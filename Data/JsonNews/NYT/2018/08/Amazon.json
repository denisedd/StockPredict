{"Headline": "Cummings Brings \u2018Thunder Road\u2019 to Deauville Festival", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the opening of \u201cThunder Road,\u201d the main character, Jim Arnaud, tries to deliver a funeral eulogy for his mother. There is no question that Jim, a boyish police officer, loves his mom. But after a few minutes, there\u2019s also no question that he is having a minor meltdown in front of a room full of people.He rambles on, apologizes, tries to play a song on a small portable stereo, and does a little dance. The camera does not cut away.This eulogy is one in a series of mortifications that Jim, played by Jim Cummings, undergoes in the movie, at the hands of frustrated co-workers, a sharp-tongued ex-wife and his own unimpressed preteen daughter.\u201cIt\u2019s like a much sadder version of my life, or the ghost of Christmas future,\u201d Mr. Cummings, who also wrote and directed \u201cThunder Road,\u201d said by phone from Los Angeles. \u201cI\u2019m creating this horrible, pathetic version of what my life could have been and then finding empathy and comedy in that.\u201dThe singular vision of Mr. Cummings\u2019s film placed it squarely within the interests of Bruno Barde, the longtime director of the Deauville American Film Festival, which opens Friday. The 44-year-old festival in the resort town of Deauville, France, puts a spotlight on American independent cinema.\u201cThunder Road\u201d fits the mold of a small-scale film willed into being by determination, obsession and a modest budget.\u201c\u2018Thunder Road\u2019 partakes in the established independent film tradition of the \u2018self-made man\u2019 who writes, directs and plays the main character,\u201d Mr. Barde said, aligning its antihero with \u201cthe great tradition of American comedies from Charles Chaplin to Woody Allen and the Coen brothers.\u201dLike the other American films featured at Deauville, \u201cThunder Road\u201d had its world premiere elsewhere, at South by Southwest. It will screen in a competition selection that cherry-picks primarily from standouts at Sundance and SXSW, such as Debra Granik\u2019s \u201cLeave No Trace,\u201d \u201cAmerican Animals,\u201d Jennifer Fox\u2019s \u201cThe Tale,\u201d \u201cPuzzle,\u201d and \u201cBlindspotting.\u201dThe jury, led by the actress Sandrine Kiberlain, includes the writer-director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, whose films \u201cAt War\u201d and \u201cThe Measure of a Man\u201d had their premieres in Cannes.\u201cIn the U.S., the independent cinema doesn\u2019t benefit from all the help we have in France. But at the end, we see the result of a strong need. And a masterpiece is always the result of a strong need,\u201d Mr. Briz\u00e9 wrote in an email, declaring his \u201ceternal curiosity about these films which sometimes come from nowhere.\u201dIt will be up to Mr. Briz\u00e9 and the rest of the Deauville jury to judge \u201cThunder Road,\u201d which will compete for attention with a fleet of stars such as Sarah Jessica Parker, Morgan Freeman, Shailene Woodley and John Grisham.But the film \u2014 named after the 1975 Bruce Springsteen song, which in turn borrowed the title of a Robert Mitchum movie \u2014 certainly bears the stamp of a strong need.Mr. Cummings, 31, made \u201cThunder Road\u201d after first making a short by the same title that was comprised solely of the funeral monologue. It had taken him a few years to find his feet, eventually working as an associate producer on \u201cKrisha,\u201d directed by Trey Edward Shults. Before then, he put in time as a production assistant at Industrial Light and Magic.\u201cI was very much a nobody,\u201d Mr. Cummings said, his voice bearing the softest trace of growing up in New Orleans (alongside seven siblings).Mr. Cummings\u2019s ready self-deprecation might make him sound like just another poster boy for underdog indie filmmaking. But the director retains his own, perhaps Jim Arnaud-like quirks of expression and enthusiasm. He happily explained, for example, that being both director and star \u201csaved time on set and an extra meal\u201d and saved him from having to \u201cdownload\u201d all the specifics of his character \u201cinto another person\u2019s brain.\u201dPlaying Jim Arnaud, the fresh-faced Mr. Cummings brings a hapless candor that suggests the character is only barely keeping up, whether it\u2019s during a dinner conversation with the family of his squad-car partner, or playing patty-cakes with his daughter. The episodic film is essentially one long slow-motion breakdown, culminating in a very public rebuke in the parking lot of the police department.In many Hollywood comedies, Arnaud might be portrayed as just another man-child to mock. Mr. Cummings, who has made a number of comedic shorts, did state a fondness for the obliviously gauche British character Alan Partridge played by Steve Coogan. But \u201cThunder Road\u201d makes a case for Arnaud as a good-hearted goof, the sort of guy that a sister or brother might worry about, and maybe not fully understand.\u201cIt\u2019s O.K. for the audience to not know how to feel when they\u2019re watching something, because you can lure them in and disarm them with comedy and then you get to talk about big stuff,\u201d Mr. Cummings said.Mr. Cummings\u2019s strategy is reflected in the film\u2019s use of long takes in shooting scenes. It\u2019s a way of resisting the rhythm of reaction shots that might cue the viewer to laugh at a scene or feel a certain way. In the story itself, we\u2019re also encouraged to take Arnaud seriously through the compassionate character of his partner, and boundlessly patient friend, Nate (Nican Robinson).The film\u2019s Deauville showing will lead into a national release in France, and in the United States, it screens in October at over 15 theaters under the auspices of Alamo Drafthouse. It will also be available on video on demand this fall, and next year, on Amazon\u2019s streaming platform, Mr. Cummings said.Mr. Cummings is keeping his options open but does have at least one project on the horizon that promises to continue his particular brand of tonally complex emotion with an intriguing premise.\u201cI\u2019m in development for a TV show about astronauts coming back to the suburbs. Which is another melancholy comedy,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The Costs of Making Buildings Safer", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The earthquake that struck eastern Los Angeles County on Tuesday caused little damage, but it was a reminder of the seismic volatility in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains. Forty-seven years ago, a much more powerful earthquake struck Sylmar \u2014 about an hour\u2019s drive from the epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s earthquake \u2014 killing 65 people and severely damaging four hospital campuses.The consequences of that disaster are still being felt.A law passed in 1973 that ordered hospitals to strengthen their most vulnerable buildings has had unintended consequences across the state. To Nancy Skinner, a state senator in the East Bay, the seismic safety law has been used as an excuse for a vital acute-care hospital, the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, to shut down services at its Berkeley location. The hospital cites financial difficulty in funding the mandated retrofit, whose deadline has been pushed back several times and is now 2020. (There is also a 2030 deadline for buildings to be able to not only withstand an earthquake, but also remain operational.)Officials with Sutter Health, the hospital system that runs the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, have reassured locals that services will remain intact and that the center will relocate several miles south to Oakland. But Ms. Skinner said the move \u2014 which will result in some ambulances and patients having to use one of the most congested highways in America \u2014 would have an \u201cextreme\u201d impact on her constituency.The hospital controversy underscores a recurring problem in California: Residents want safer buildings, but they fear the more immediate consequences of costly renovations.\u201cThe magnitude of the earthquake that\u2019s going to happen here is so significant that we really do need to have every critical facility in the best possible earthquake shape possible,\u201d Ms. Skinner said.\u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing is closures,\u201d she added, \u201ca consolidation of services.\u201dMore than 94 percent of general acute-care buildings at California hospitals currently meet the new 2020 deadline, state data shows.But in the last decade, at least 44 general acute-care hospitals across California have closed. In at least eight cases, hospital officials publicly cited expensive, often multimillion dollar seismic retrofitting costs as a significant factor in the decision to close.\u201cThere was no funding,\u201d said Susan Neer, former chief administrator at Indian Valley Hospital, an acute-care hospital in Greenville which, amid a nursing shortage, closed at the end of 2006. \u201cThe state put all these mandates in, but they weren\u2019t going to help.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)An Evening With \u201cThe Daily\u201d at the Theatre at Ace Hotel DTLA: Sept. 20Twenty minutes a day, five days a week, \u201cThe Daily\u201d brings transparency to how the news is reported and explores topics of the day in depth.

It has expanded its service that provides curbside pickup of food orders to 1,800 stores. And it recently announced a pilot project to use automated carts to help employees speedily retrieve items for customers\u2019 online orders.Walmart\u2019s online grocery strategy has required the company to combine its vast inventory with a digital infrastructure that has often been less than inspiring to customers.Sales in stores open at least a year were up 4.5 percent nationwide, far exceeding analysts\u2019 forecasts. The strong results led the company to raise its sales and profit expectations for the year.\u201cThe business feels solid, the foundation feels good,\u201d said Greg Foran, the chief executive of Walmart U.S., in a conference call with reporters.The mega-retailer said that revenue increased 3.8 percent from a year ago to $128 billion.

{"Headline": "As Brexit Looms, Musicians Brace for the Worst", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The composer Howard Goodall was passing through a London airport in March en route to a conducting gig in Houston. Idling at the currency exchange desk, he got into a conversation with an employee about whether Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, would be good for his industry. When Mr. Goodall said no and suggested that the consequences would be \u201cdisastrous,\u201d the clerk replied that everyone he asked that question \u201cgives the same answer.\u201d\u201cWell, I needed to say something,\u201d Mr. Goodall said in a recent interview.Carmakers and financial institutions, airplane manufacturers and the energy industry: All have voiced anxiety about how much negotiation remains to be done. Last month, Amazon weighed in: Doug Gurr, the company\u2019s most senior executive in Britain, warned that if the country left the European Union without negotiating a new arrangement with the bloc (the \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario), there could be civil unrest.Months after his encounter at the airport, Mr. Goodall still seems incensed. He is a realist, he said: Classical music was never going to be top of the priority list. But he felt that the arguments were being drowned out by bigger, better-funded lobbying groups.\u201cThe music business is international, and in this country we have an international reputation,\u201d Mr. Goodall said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of losing it.\u201dMichael Jay, the chairman of the committee that wrote the House of Lords report, agrees. \u201cIndividuals working in the U.K. cultural sector are highly mobile, and have thrived on collaboration with people from all over the world,\u201d he said in a statement.If British ensembles are required to organize visas for every concert in, for example, Amsterdam or Berlin, as well as licenses to travel with their instruments, they would find it harder to tour \u2014 and, given the likely costs, it would be much harder to make touring financially viable.Ms. Kani said that the Grange Park Opera was \u201cvery dependent on European singers\u201d and that British performers benefited from having to compete with musicians from abroad. \u201cIt raises everyone\u2019s game,\u201d she said.There are myriad other concerns for the sector: the fate of thousands of students from other European Union countries in British music schools, Pan-European regulations on intellectual property, and cultural funding that flows directly from the bloc\u2019s institutions. While haggling over Britain\u2019s exit continues, all those issues are up in the air.\u201cIt\u2019s a very messy situation,\u201d Mr. Goodall said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same in so many industries, from pharmaceuticals to technology. And the issue is, there so few answers. No one seems to know.\u201dJohn Whittingdale, a Brexit-supporting member of Parliament and a former minister who ran the culture department, said in an interview that such anxieties were alarmist. \u201cWe have some of the best orchestras, musicians and conductors in the world, and that has nothing to do with the E.U.,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concerns that musicians have are largely to do with the arrangements once we leave, and those will be in our gift. They will depend entirely on the immigration rules that we put in place.\u201dMr. Whittingdale added that he hoped that after Britain\u2019s exit it would be easier for performers from anywhere in the world to come to Britain \u2014 not just European Union citizens.In an interview at the Southbank Center, a London arts venue close to the offices that the European Union Youth Orchestra has recently vacated, Mr. Marcus was eager to present the ensemble\u2019s move to Italy as an opportunity rather than a retreat. But the reality was that young British instrumentalists were likely to lose out, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re currently in our own version of a transition period, but after 2020 we\u2019ll have to see how things shake down.\u201dHe said he was also anxious that Britain would end up more isolated, culturally as well as politically. \u201cThe U.K. has a thriving cultural scene; it might not disappear overnight. But over a 50-year period, who knows?\u201dThere are signs that, amid all the other sound and fury over Brexit, politicians are starting to pay more attention to the concerns of the creative industry. The House of Lords report has brought the issue a little higher up the lawmaking agenda, though what that will mean in practice is \u2014 as with nearly everything else surrounding the issue \u2014 difficult to judge.In a statement, a spokesman for the culture ministry said, \u201cWe recognize the need for classical musicians to tour across the E.U. without prohibitive restrictions and to regularly move goods on a temporary basis.\u201dAsked about Brexit, Ruth Gibson, 32, a viola player originally from Ireland but who is now based in London, rolled her eyes. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m trying not to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re freelance musicians; more uncertainty is the last thing we need, to be honest.\u201d\u201cMusic has no borders,\u201d Ms. Gibson said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point, isn\u2019t it?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alexa vs. Siri vs. Google: Which Can Carry on a Conversation Best?", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "Advertisement\nDigital assistants like Amazon\u2019s Echo can listen to you. And they can talk back. But that doesn\u2019t mean they can carry on a good conversation.We explored the conversational limits of the leading assistants. After consulting with the companies involved and a few artificial intelligence experts we created tests that show what they can and can\u2019t handle. Don\u2019t expect the assistants to replace conversations with friends anytime soon. But the experiments \u2014 even in the moments when the assistants screwed up \u2014 showed what these assistants could one day become in our lives.Because these devices are not yet nimble enough to understand and respond to anything you might say, Amazon, Apple, and Google must hone them for particular tasks, like playing a song or building a shopping list. If you stick to these tasks, the devices are pretty good at zeroing on what you want. But even inside these small domains, they can trip up. Listen how.Right away, the HomePod showed how difficult it can be for machines to understand natural language. The device recognized what we were doing, but misunderstood how we wanted to do it, and added an item called \u201cthese things\u201d to a shopping list.If your roommate asked what you wanted from the market and you said \u201cguacamole, chips, tortillas,\u201d he would understand that as three separate things. But the Google and Amazon devices didn\u2019t quite recognize the pause between items as a verbal comma. Although these devices are pretty good at recognizing what you say, they may not completely understand it.Alexa grasped that we were continuing to add to the shopping list, even though we weren\u2019t explicit about it. It held onto the context of the exchange and mapped our next request back to our list.A digital assistant relies on many different technology systems, all working together on the device and inside a network of computer data centers that connect to the assistant over the internet.When you say something, one system tries to recognize each word and convert it to text. Another system tries to understand the meaning of each word and how it relates to the others. A third system spits out new text that responds to what you\u2019ve said. A fourth converts this response to digital speech. Other systems may also weigh in, but you get the point.Engineers used to build speech recognition systems by writing one small computing rule at a time \u2014 a painstaking process. But so-called neural networks are now replacing those hand-written rules, accelerating the progress of speech recognition. Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by pinpointing patterns in large amounts of data. They can learn to recognize spoken words, for instance, by analyzing recordings of old customer support calls.In some cases, the assistants perform as well as human listeners. But listening is only part of what they do.Even if you make a rather specific request, it can have multiple meanings. And that can be tough for an assistant to deal with.When we asked on August 2, before pre-season football started, Google Home came to the same conclusion. And the HomePod asked that we identify the team we were talking about. Google and Apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation.Alexa guessed that we meant the New York Giants football team, which hadn\u2019t played a game in seven months, but this may have been because we were asking the question in New York. Amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location. In any case, Alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question.When you chat with a friend, you use pronouns. To keep up, a digital assistant must recognize pronouns for what they are and map them back to words in a previous exchange. Algorithms are learning to identify pronouns by analyzing hundreds of sentences, detecting patterns in the syntax.After recognizing what you say, these devices must then understand what you want and generate a response. For that part, companies like Amazon and Google have also begun to rely on neural networks to learn from what people have asked these digital assistants in the past.Engineers might train one neural network to identify what you are trying to do (build a shopping list, get the score of a baseball game) and train another to parse a sentence and identify the nouns, pronouns, verbs and other parts of speech. It\u2019s like elementary school grammar classes for computers.All of the machine learning algorithms these devices use are liable to make mistakes, though, and the system can be brittle because so many different algorithms are trying to work in concert. A digital assistant may screw up if you make a small change to a request that has worked countless times in the past. It may also screw up if you don\u2019t change anything.Machine learning algorithms can help these devices deal with turn-by-turn exchanges. But each verbal exchange is limited to a simple, three- or four-turn conversation. In a perfect world, engineers would build one giant neural network that learns to do everything. For now, these devices move toward better conversations in small steps.\u201cIf you keep your language short and simple, you can maybe go as deep as three steps,\u201d said Nancy Fulda, a researcher at Brigham Young University who specializes in conversational systems. \u201cThe technology operates by different rules than people do.\u201dIn the previous example, the devices understood what we were asking because they mapped a pronoun back to the subject of our previous request. But what if we don\u2019t use a pronoun?The devices correctly identified nearby shops, but they were all different. That\u2019s likely because each device is using a different \u201cknowledge graph,\u201d a vast database of facts and other information you may ask for. Google, for example, may use data gathered from Google Maps, whereas the other companies may pull from sources like Yelp.Amazon trains neural networks to recognize that this kind of pronoun-free request refers back to the previous exchange. The algorithms analyze hundreds, perhaps thousands, of requests like this and learns to identify them on its own. When generating responses, these assistants plug particular information into an existing template. Sometimes, engineers will build this template to sound more conversational. This seemed to be the case here, when Alexa said that traffic was \u201csluggish.\u201dA neural network also drives Google\u2019s new \u201cconversational mode.\u201dIn the past, you couldn\u2019t talk to the device without saying \u201cHey, Google.\u201d Now, after saying this once, you can deliver multiple commands and questions. In some cases, Google Home can recognize when you are delivering another command \u2014 and when you\u2019re just talking to someone else in the room. It does this with a system that has been \u201ctrained\u201d with the interactions other people have had with their devices. Basically, Google\u2019s customers are helping Google build a smarter product.Don\u2019t expect these devices to tell you what they think \u2014 or even what other people think. It\u2019s easier to build technology that sticks to the facts. After asking these devices to identify the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which they all did correctly, we asked for their opinion of his work. None of the machines seemed to grasp the concept of this question, and Google eventually lost the context altogether.Engineers hope machine learning will continue to replace handwritten rules and expand what these devices can do, but conversation is such a complex task, even machine learning approaches will need years \u2014 or perhaps decades \u2014 to completely solve the problem.These devices fall down in moments when they need to handle self-reflection or complex analysis.This is an incredibly difficult question for a computer to answer, unless it has been specifically programmed to handle it. Many times, these devices will just reply with canned responses, as Google did with the Muffin Man bit.For now, you will have to make do with the Muffin Man.Note: The devices tested were the Apple HomePod, the Amazon Echo Plus and the Google Home. They were each tested separately. The phrases used to trigger the devices \u2014 \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d \u201cAlexa\u201d and \u201cHey, Google,\u201d respectively \u2014 were used before each interaction, and were removed from the audio recordings for clarity.Audio production by Brad FisherAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Ripple Effect on Grocery Industry: Rivals Stock Up on Start-Ups", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byChieh Huang spent years trying to get grocery industry executives excited about the technology at Boxed, his grocery e-commerce company. He regularly gave tours of the company\u2019s state-of-the-art fulfillment centers, featuring a custom software system and roving bands of autonomous carts.But interest in Boxed, which is not profitable and crossed $100 million in revenue in 2016, was lukewarm. \u201cThey were like, \u2018What a cute lemonade stand,\u2019\u201d Mr. Huang said.Kroger announced a partnership with Ocado, an online grocery company, to use its robots to pack online orders. Target acquired Shipt, a start-up offering same-day delivery services, for $550 million. Walmart acquired Parcel, a start-up offering same-day delivery, and announced a partnership to use Alert Innovation, a small company that employs automated carts to fulfill grocery pickup orders at stores.And on Tuesday, Boxed announced that it had sold a minority stake to Aeon Group, one of the largest retail chains in Japan. Alongside investors including Alpha Square Group and CDIB Capital, Aeon invested $110 million in Boxed. The deal values the start-up at $600 million, according to a person familiar with the agreement.\u201cAre technology folks like us going to figure out retail faster than the retailers figure out technology?\u201d Mr. Huang asked. \u201cIn some ways we\u2019re all kind of fighting the same fight against the gigantic folks online.\u201dFood shopping is one of the last major holdouts to online retail. Groceries are unique in that their inventory is perishable, fragile and heavy. Grocery customers often shop at the last minute, like to see the food they are about to eat and don\u2019t want to pay high delivery fees.Grocery companies \u201care realizing that with Walmart and Amazon moving at their pace, you need to pick yours up, too,\u201d said Greg Spragg, a former chief merchant at Sam\u2019s Club, the wholesale retailer owned by Walmart, who now consults at GrowthWise Group. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it fear. I would call it a wake-up call.\u201dWalmart, the nation\u2019s largest grocer, declined to comment. Amazon did not provide a comment.Global food retailing is a $5 trillion business, and just 3 percent of the world\u2019s grocery spending happened online last year, according to Forrester Research. Online grocery sales are expected to double over the next four years, reaching $334 billion by 2022.Market research conducted by Morgan Stanley in July found that 56 percent of consumers who were likely to order groceries online said they would most likely order from Amazon, compared with 14 percent who would go to a mass merchandiser and 10 percent who would use their local supermarket.Phil Lempert, a grocery industry analyst, predicted store closings for chains that do not evolve to meet the changing needs of customers. Stores offering curated selections, specialty items, cooking classes and the option to buy online and pick up in person will thrive, he said.\u201cThe bulk of stores \u2014 they haven\u2019t been doing exciting things for a long time,\u201d Mr. Lempert said.Josh Hix, chief executive of Plated, a meal kit start-up, said the Amazon-Whole Foods deal had immediately changed his discussions with grocery chains. Meal kit companies have a checkered record.

In September, it sold to Albertsons, a large grocery chain. At the time, Albertsons\u2019 chief executive, Bob Miller, said the deal was \u201cthe latest example of Albertsons Companies meeting our customers wherever and however they like to shop.\u201dMr. Huang also fielded numerous acquisition offers for Boxed, creating a harrowing few months.Most of the big grocers \u201chave wanted to kill us, partner with us, invest in us or buy us \u2014 all probably in the course of the same conversation,\u201d he said.Mr. Huang, who previously founded a gaming company that was sold to Zynga, decided that the opportunity was too good to sell now. He opted to take the investment from Aeon instead.The ownership structure allows Boxed to license its technology to its retail competitors in the United States as they try to become more digital. The company is in talks with 10 or so potential partners for various pieces of its technology. They include mobile app technology, personalization software, a packing algorithm that maximizes space in shipping boxes, software that tracks item expiration dates, order management software and warehouse robotics automation.Boxed, which is based in New York City and has about 250 full-time employees, sells food and other everyday essentials in bulk.

Financing reached a high of $2.92 billion in 2015, but this year, it is on pace to be less than half that, according to CB Insights, a financial research firm.The number of independent ad tech companies has fallen 21 percent since 2013, to 185 as of the second quarter of 2018, according to LUMA Partners, which analyzes digital media and marketing.\u201cWhile all industries go through a maturation curve, this one faces a particular need for consolidation,\u201d said Terry Kawaja, the chief executive of LUMA Partners. \u201cSo many of these companies were not profitable.\u201dAlthough many consumers have never heard of ad tech firms, people\u2019s online activity is influenced every day by these companies as they battle for a share of ad impressions on phones, tablets and laptops. The \u201cMad Men\u201d style of advertising workers has been replaced by the \u201cmath men\u201d of ad tech start-ups, which specialize in gathering data on consumer preferences.Advertising, the economic juice behind the internet, has long been an attractive area for start-ups. During the last 10 years, the ease of forming companies and the availability of cheap venture capital led to a flood of ad tech start-ups, pushing boundaries on where and how ads were delivered. They introduced technologies like the automation of ad buying \u2014 called programmatic advertising \u2014 and header bidding, in which many ad exchanges bid on publishers\u2019 space simultaneously.Ari Paparo, chief executive of the ad tech start-up Beeswax, said he had noticed a distinct decline in venture capital funding for ad tech firms just in the last two years. \u201cThe private market is influenced by the public market, and you saw so many fail as publicly traded entities,\u201d he said.There were 260 deals between ad tech companies and venture capital firms in 2014 but only 122 in 2017, according to PitchBook. In the first half of 2018, there have been 53 deals.The fear is that when investment dries up, innovation will die.Small start-ups are crucial to the industry because they often serve as catalysts for technological advances, said Doug Knopper, one of the founders of the ad tech platform FreeWheel, which was sold to Comcast in 2014.\u201cThere\u2019s still more innovation to come, but if V.C.s don\u2019t put money into it because they don\u2019t see a path to exit, does innovation stall?\u201d he said, referring to venture capitalists.Some are hoping a third big competitor could help the industry. Eric Adelman, president and one of the founders of Three Pillars Recruiting, said while the AT&T acquisition consolidates power in fewer places, the deal could help make AT&T a rival to Google and Facebook.\u201cHaving three giants in the industry is much better than having two giants,\u201d he said.In a statement, Facebook said: \u201cThe dynamics of the market may be changing, but it\u2019s stemming more from people\u2019s shifting consumption habits than one platform\u2019s popularity.\u201dNot all smaller players are giving up. Kevin Hunt, senior vice president of global marketing for the ad platform SpotX, is betting that his company\u2019s focus on video advertising will set it apart.\u201cIt\u2019s important for companies who are in this space to be technically flexible, to make sure they have built a solid foundation that allows them to move as technology moves,\u201d he said.Eric Franchi, one of the founders and a former executive at the digital advertising company Undertone, isn\u2019t giving up on ad tech. After the software company Perion acquired Undertone in 2015, Mr. Franchi teamed up with Joe Zawadzki, the chief executive of MediaMath, to fund an ad tech-focused venture-capital fund called MathCapital that helps the little guys.\u201cWe want the best entrepreneurs that want to build ad tech companies to come to us,\u201d Mr. Franchi said. \u201cOver time, hopefully we can be a force for good in the space to help these companies get started.\u201dAnd even after Ben Barokas sold his company Admeld to Google in 2011, he decided to stay in the ad tech industry, creating a content compensation platform called Sourcepoint.\u201cI think certainly Facebook and Google are hoovering up the vast majority of growth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat said, I believe in independent content creation.

{"Headline": "Why Apple Is the Future of Capitalism", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Desai is a professor at Harvard Business School.Those interpretations obscure Apple\u2019s other accomplishment \u2014 pioneering a financial model that is the envy of corporate America. Sure, Apple produces innovative phones and laptops, but look inside its sleek exterior and you\u2019ll find an elegant financial machine that has become the ideal for corporate America. Without investing significantly in hard assets, Apple spins cash and returns it to shareholders at a stunning rate. It\u2019s difficult not to admire.But the model that has been perfected at Apple is risky and imitated poorly by many American corporations. The next decade will reveal whether these imitations were a series of brilliant moves or large-scale financial engineering.Apple has $115 billion of debt outstanding, and it has distributed $288 billion to its shareholders in the past six years, most of it through share buybacks. In the most recent nine months alone, Apple bought back $54 billion worth of shares.This transformation is representative of trends in corporate America. According to the Federal Reserve, corporations have issued on net over $1.3 trillion of debt and retired over $1.9 trillion of equity over the past four years. American companies are borrowing money to buy their own shares in what is tantamount to a huge, slow-motion leveraged buyout.Apple has conducted its buybacks responsibly: It bought shares when they were relatively cheap, rewarding the patient shareholder. Other companies have not been so prudent, taking on debt to make ill-timed purchases of expensive shares rather than investing in growth opportunities. In some cases, they have done so simply to push up share prices so that management can meet goals for quarterly earnings or metrics that trigger compensation.Second, Apple\u2019s financial model emphasizes cash flow over profits. Apple is not simply immensely profitable; in 2017, it generated $16 billion more in operating cash flow than profits. It does that in part by running its day-to-day operations in a distinctive way. Typically, a company has to use external funds to fund the process of stocking goods and collecting revenue from customers.Apple\u2019s model turns this upside down. Its retail stores collect cash from customers quickly, it is ruthless on keeping inventory low, and it takes forever to pay suppliers. In the process, Apple\u2019s operations are extremely effective cash generators. This is no coincidence. It is the result of the canny supply chain that Tim Cook built. In effect, Apple has largely been financed on the backs of its suppliers, who are willing to hold their inventory and wait more than 100 days to get paid, just for the pleasure of doing business with Apple.This restructuring of operations to minimize inventory, move to subscription models (which generate predictable streams of cash) and keep suppliers waiting has become the dominant pattern in large corporations. Amazon, for example, generates relatively small profits but mountains of cash through this process. But this emphasis on cash also means that executives can become wary of making capital expenditures, such as new factories or server farms. This kind of spending can increase profits in the long run but bites into cash flow in the short run. That is a recipe for sluggish corporate investment, just as we\u2019ve seen in the wake of the financial crisis.Finally, Apple is the epitome of an \u201casset light\u201d company: It owns very few hard assets and therefore needs almost zero outside capital to run its business. As of mid-2018, Apple has $105 billion of operating assets and $120 billion of operating liabilities. What does that mean? Miraculously, its operations rely on no capital from outside financiers.How does one achieve this apotheosis of the asset-light strategy? First, create a supply chain in Asia run by companies willing to invest in low-return projects that create your products. Second, hold those suppliers under your thumb. Idolizing asset-light strategies, however, can also lead to underinvestment, an excessive reliance on outsourcing and the artificial division of companies to avoid hard assets.The accomplishments of Apple\u2019s model are substantial. But the financial strategy that has worked so well for Apple is a risky one for less capable companies with weaker strategic positions. For them, aping Apple can just as easily result in too much debt on their balance sheets, precarious supply chains and deferred opportunities for investments.The financial archetype defined by Apple \u2014 asset-light strategy, leveraged share buybacks and cash flow above all \u2014 is a high-wire act. Boards should guard against the temptation to follow Apple\u2019s path blindly. Big investors, especially mutual funds and pension funds that represent so many individuals, should question the management of any company that does. Many of Apple\u2019s imitators are more likely to mortgage the future than create it.Mihir A.

Big Tech Is as Strong as Ever", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYou may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?In a strange way, the social network\u2019s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That\u2019s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.\u201cThis is one of the most profitable business models I\u2019ve ever seen, and that really hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook\u2019s stock now \u201cmay be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.\u201dTogether the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren\u2019t having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon\u2019s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they\u2019ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That\u2019s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon\u2019s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon\u2019s site.\u201cThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin \u2014 and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.But Big Tech\u2019s earnings so far don\u2019t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe\u2019s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook\u2019s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon\u2019s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook \u2014 which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government\u2019s help.\u201cThere\u2019s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a triopoly \u2014 but if you were worried about the duopoly, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Couldn\u2019t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?\u2019\u201dFinally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \u201cgreen fields\u201d \u2014 the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties \u2014 Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them \u2014 are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there\u2019s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.And that\u2019s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.\u201cThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\u201d Mr. Squali said. \u201cThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they\u2019re not afraid to destroy something that\u2019s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\u201dIn other words: Get used to the Five.

{"Headline": "Are Superstar Firms and Amazon Effects Reshaping the Economy? ", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe biggest companies may be influencing things like inflation and wage growth, possibly at the expense of central bankers\u2019 power to do so.JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. \u2014 Two of the most important economic facts of the last few decades are that more industries are being dominated by a handful of extraordinarily successful companies and that wages, inflation and growth have remained stubbornly low. Many of the world\u2019s most powerful economic policymakers are now taking seriously the possibility that the first of those facts is a cause of the second \u2014 and that the growing concentration of corporate power has confounded the efforts of central banks to keep economies healthy. Mainstream economists are discussing questions like whether \u201cmonopsony\u201d \u2014 the outsize power of a few consolidated employers \u2014 is part of the problem of low wage growth. They are looking at whether the \u201csuperstar firms\u201d that dominate many leading industries are responsible for sluggish investment spending. And they\u2019re exploring whether there is an \u201cAmazon Effect\u201d in which fast-changing pricing algorithms by the online retailer and its rivals mean bigger swings in inflation. If not yet fully embraced, the ideas have become prominent enough that this weekend, at an annual symposium in the Grand Tetons, leaders of the Federal Reserve and other central banks discussed whether corporate consolidation might have broad implications for economic policy.Central bankers tend not to chase the latest research fads, as Mr. Furman put it. But they, too, are wrestling more intensely with the possibility that the details of how companies compete and exert power matter a great deal for the overall well-being of the economy.While these topics more commonly show up in debates around antitrust policy or how the labor market is regulated, it may have implications for the work of central banks as well. For example, if concentrated corporate power is depressing wage growth, the Fed may be able to keep interest rates lower for longer without inflation breaking out. If online retail makes prices jump around more than they once did, policymakers should be more reluctant to make abrupt policy changes based on short-term swings in consumer prices.Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the host of the conference, has been intrigued by the weak lending to small and midsize businesses in recent years, even amid an economic recovery. She and her staff have explored whether the increasing concentration of the banking industry among a handful of giants might be a cause.\u201cLooking at the size and footprint of firms has not been mainstream,\u201d Ms. George said, \u201cbut it appears to be very broad-based and a signal of something worth taking seriously.\u201dBanks are generally disinclined to treat intellectual property or other intangible items as collateral against loans, which could mean interest rate cuts by a central bank have less power to generate increased investment spending.When workers have few potential employers to choose from, he said, they may have less ability to demand higher pay, and it becomes easier for employers to collude to restrict pay, whether through explicit back-room deals or more subtle signaling.But he said monetary policy might have some power to reduce that effect. By keeping interest rates low and allowing the labor market to strengthen, employers may eventually find they have no choice but to increase worker pay. \u201cAllowing the labor market to run hotter than otherwise could possibly cause collusion to break down,\u201d Mr. Krueger said. \u201cIf the collusion does wither, wages and employment would rise.\u201dPhysical retailers tend to be slow to change prices because of some temporary disturbance, like a spike in the value of the dollar or a fall in gasoline prices. But online retailers are able to reflect changing prices almost instantly.\u201cThe implication is that retail prices are becoming less \u2018insulated\u2019 from these common nationwide shocks,\u201d Mr. Cavallo wrote. \u201cFuel prices, exchange-rate fluctuations or any other force affecting costs that may enter the pricing algorithms used by these firms are more likely to have a faster and larger impact on retail prices than in the past.\u201dIt\u2019s hardly the case that central bankers are becoming storm-the-barricades opponents of corporate power. Much of the discussion so far has been more about trying to understand the facts, rather than leaping to allow this emerging research to drive policy actions.For some of the people who have argued for years that concentrated corporate power is behind many of the economy\u2019s travails, the central bankers are late to the party.\u201cWage stagnation is not a puzzle,\u201d said Marshall Steinbaum, a fellow at the Roosevelt Institute, who spoke on a panel organized by the activist group Fed Up outside the lodge where the Fed symposium later took place. \u201cCutting-edge research tells us exactly what\u2019s going on, and yet the Fed seems to be considering this for the first time.\u201dThere is an almost tribal dimension that limits these conversations about how corporate concentration might affect the overall economy and policy. People who study industrial organization or antitrust policy are, for the most part, in a different clan from those who spend their time talking about bond yields and inflation targets.But card-carrying members of that macroeconomic tribe are starting to see that they may have plenty to learn about some of the inner workings of the economy: the details of how businesses compete, set prices and hire people.Kristin Forbes, an M.I.T. economist and a former Bank of England policymaker, faced the knotty task of setting policy for the British economy at a time when economic data was sending conflicting signals. This type of work can bring more coherence to seeming contradictions.\u201cWe would look at macro data, but that data can hide a lot of what\u2019s happening underneath,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a deepening sense of the importance of fusing microeconomic data with macroeconomic trends.\u201d With the Federal Reserve facing the challenge of an American economy that is by many measures at a healthy cruising speed, yet still falling short in its capacity to generate well-paying jobs for millions of people, people at this particular gathering in Jackson Hole could agree that it\u2019s not enough to view the economy using high-altitude data.

When she plays, she wears a regulation hockey face cage, cyclocross elbow pads, knee and shin guards. When the weather gets cooler she wears hockey pants as well, but it\u2019s too hot for that in August. Ms. Flores is from Mexico, and she started playing hardcourt bike polo with the New York team three years ago. \u201cIt was a little intimidating at first, but I feel very comfortable now. It\u2019s like a second home.\u201dAs the action started, couples, families and a few older men stopped to sit on benches near the pit, trying to figure out just what was going on, cellphones raised to record the action. With two teams of three players each on the court, the objective was immediately apparent \u2014 to outmaneuver the other team\u2019s players, and to keep the ball away from your team\u2019s goal while scoring on theirs. The castanet-like sound of the mallets hitting one another is sometimes drowned out by the good-natured heckling of other players sitting on the sidelines.The origin story of hardcourt bike polo begins in the late 1990s, when, apparently, bored bicycle messengers in Seattle played around with makeshift gear to entertain themselves between jobs. It became a cult sport in the aughts. And in recent years, the sport\u2019s governing body has made a bid to go mainstream, like ultimate Frisbee or even skateboarding. By trying to change the competitive format of the game from a traditional three-versus-three to \u201csquad\u201d or \u201cbench\u201d play, larger teams of up to nine members would be able to swap out players, games can be extended from 15 to 50 minutes long.Attempts to recruit more women and younger players to the sport has also led to the barring of body-on-body contact like checking or high sticking \u2014 using your mallet above the handlebars as a parrying tool.At tournaments, the game looks a lot different than it did back in the mid-2000s, when the New York team formed. \u201cRules happened, and when rules happened, fun stopped,\u201d said a bike mechanic who calls himself Chombo, a longhaired player who was an early member of the city\u2019s hardcourt bike polo community. \u201cIt\u2019s drawn a little bit of a division from the people who want to play it like an organized sport to the people who want to come ride their bikes and have fun,\u201d he said on a recent Sunday afternoon.Mr. Tagami is interested in attracting a more mainstream audience for the sport, which means new rules and higher visibility. \u201cThe game as it is now rewards technical skill, teamwork, and coordination in the way that most traditional sports do,\u201d he said. He pointed out that if the games were extended to a defined 50 minutes, it would be ideal to fill an hourlong television slot.Hardcourt bike polo enjoyed rapid growth between 2010 and 2014, when chapters popped up everywhere from Berlin to Buenos Aires, but the infrastructure lagged behind. Teams struggle to carve out spaces to play without official courts or permits, travel to tournaments is self-funded, and even organized teams lack uniforms. \u201cWith that kind of infrastructure gap, we need to be working backward, we need to be building courts and working with cities and finding sponsors,\u201d Mr. Tagami added. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be appealing TV or entertainment if it\u2019s just filmed underneath a bridge with bad lighting. There\u2019s no compelling narrative.\u201dThe sport is also feeling the pressure to evolve, with many of the game\u2019s early innovators now in their thirties or forties. Teams (like bands and other indie group efforts) fall apart when people marry, start families, move away, or just get tired. The challenge is to bring new blood in while honoring the original culture of the game.For some, the added regulations are indeed giving new players access to what was once seen as a niche sport. Patty Youn, a firefighter in Toronto who has been playing bike polo for seven years, said that the recent change in format has invigorated the game. \u201cSquad has changed up the old boys club teams,\u201d she said.And yet when the world championships are held next year in Argentina, the games will be played in the traditional three-versus-three format, a nod to the sport\u2019s more D.I.Y. days.For all of the regulations put in place over the years, hardcourt bike polo is still pretty quirky. When Ms. Youn, the firefighter, flew off her bike in a particularly hard tournament game against Pennsylvania, the New York referee flipped frantically through a printout rule book to try and find the protocol for time outs and injury.The players at the pit remain devoted to each other and to the sport, but also to just having a good time. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Ms. Flores said, \u201cyou rode your bike in circles all day with your friends and had fun. How many adults our age wouldn\u2019t want to do that?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Duo\u2019s technology allows companies to provide employees or customers with remote access. Its software verifies the identity of users, scans their device for security weaknesses and then lets them connect, a kind of supercharged username-and-password. Cisco said it would integrate Duo\u2019s technology across its network, device and cloud platforms.The acquisition is part of a trend in which cloud providers and cybersecurity companies are trying to bolster the services they offer.Many businesses have turned to the cloud to run everything from human resources administration to artificial-intelligence analysis on remote computers. The attractions are numerous: The cloud allows workers to be more mobile, data to be accessible and processed from anywhere, and hardware systems to be less frequently updated.But some organizations have balked at handing their data to third parties like Amazon.\u201cWith more sensitive data and critical information needing to be protected in these cloud deployments, we believe security vendors stand to benefit,\u201d wrote Daniel Ives, the chief strategy officer and head of technology research of GBH Insights, in a note this week.Big tech companies have turned to acquisitions in recent years to \u201cbolster their existing offerings to customers,\u201d Mr. Ives said. Cisco alone paid $2.7 billion for the hardware and software maker Sourcefire in 2013, $635 million for OpenDNS in 2015 and $293 million for the cloud-security provider CloudLock in 2016.The pace of such deals \u2014 particularly in identity management, like Duo \u2014 should only pick up over the coming years as companies try to strengthen their defenses against cyberthreats, Mr. Ives said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Last Company You Would Expect Is Reinventing Health Benefits", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrustrated with insurers, some large companies \u2014\u00a0including a certain cable behemoth \u2014\u00a0are shedding long-held practices and adopting a do-it-yourself approach.It\u2019s hard to think of a company that seems less likely to transform health care.\u201cThey\u2019re the most interesting and creative employer when it comes to health care benefits,\u201d said Dr. Bob Kocher, a partner at Venrock, a venture capital firm whose portfolio companies have done business with Comcast. (The cable company declined over several months to provide executives for an interview on this topic.)Comcast, which spends roughly $1.3 billion a year on health care for its 225,000 employees and families, has steered away from some of the traditional methods other companies impose to contain medical expenses. It rejected the popular corporate tack of getting employees to shoulder more of the rising costs \u2014 high-deductible plans, a mechanism that is notorious for discouraging people from seeking medical help. \u201cWe see the start-up community as where the real disruption is taking place,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers. \u201cWe weren\u2019t seeing enough innovation.\u201d The group now vets some of these companies for employers, including Comcast.Comcast \u201cis the tip of the spear,\u201d Mr. Marcotte said. Other employers are focusing more attention on unsatisfying hospitals and doctors. Walmart has been at the forefront of efforts to direct employees to specific providers to get medical care, even if it means paying their travel to places like the Mayo Clinic. The majority of working-age Americans \u2014 some 155 million \u2014 get their health insurance through an employer, and most companies cover their own medical costs. The companies rely on insurers to handle the paperwork and to contract with hospitals and doctors. Insurers may also suggest programs like disease management or wellness to help companies control costs. But employers, including that Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan alliance, are increasingly unhappy with the nation\u2019s health care systems. Companies are paying more than they ever have. And their employees, saddled with escalating out-of-pocket costs and a confusing maze, aren\u2019t well served, either. \u201cThe results haven\u2019t been there,\u201d said Jim Winkler, a senior executive at Aon, a benefits consultant. \u201cThere\u2019s frustration.\u201d And, like many other workers, many employees are being pinched by the rising cost of premiums, Mr. Speer said. Geoff Girardin, 27, used Accolade when he worked at Comcast a few years ago and he and his wife were expecting. \u201cOur introduction to Accolade was our introduction to our first kid,\u201d Mr. Girardin said. He credits Accolade for telling him his wife was eligible for a free breast pump and helping find a pediatrician when the family moved. \u201cIt was a huge, huge help to have somebody who knew the ins and outs\u201d of the system, he said.For employees like Jerry Kosturko, 63, who survived colon cancer, Accolade was helpful in steering him through complicated medical decisions. When he needed an M.R.I., his navigator recommended a free-standing imaging center to save money. \u201cThey will tell me what things will cost ahead of time,\u201d Mr. Kosturko said.A nurse at Accolade helped him manage symptoms after he had surgery for bladder cancer in 2014. He developed terrible spasms because, he said, he wasn\u2019t warned to avoid caffeine. The Accolade nurse thought to ask him and quickly urged him to call his doctor for medicine to ease his symptoms. Mr. Kosturko also turned to Grand Rounds when his doctor thought he might need to stay overnight in the hospital to be tested for sleep apnea. The second opinion convinced him he did not. \u201cThis is my life at stake,\u201d she recalled in an interview. \u201cI need to know what I\u2019m doing is the best plan.\u201d Grand Rounds asked a specialist at Duke University School of Medicine, Dr. Andrew Berchuck, to review her case. Insurers are usually none too pleased with the employers\u2019 use of alternatives: They\u2019re reluctant to share information with an outside company and poised to undercut a potential competitor by offering a cheaper price. They may even refuse to work with some of the companies. For Comcast, the next frontier is the financial well-being of its employees, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and may not be able to afford even a small co-payment toward a doctor\u2019s visit. Employees who run into financial trouble have no independent source of information, Mr. Spann said.Employees who are less worried about their finances may be less likely to miss work or suffer from health problems, Mr. Leavitt said. Ultimately, he said, \u201cthere is a productivity play for Comcast.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Artist Warns of a Robot-Ruled Future. Or Is It Our Present? Let\u2019s Discuss.", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn excerpt from Cao Fei\u2019s new video work, \u201cAsia One,\u201d now on view at the Guggenheim Museum.And I have been to one of JD\u2019s logistics centers, much like the one where \u201cAsia One\u201d was shot. There were certainly more than just two employees. But you could see, as the boxes flew down the conveyor belts, the beginnings of this trend toward fewer and fewer people doing the work. In that sense, there was nothing surprising to me in the look or feel of this \u201cfuturistic\u201d distribution center.Maybe the reason Ms. Cao wanted to shoot there is that its lack of hustle and bustle is so jarring. China is a country with 1.4 billion people, and my own experience in visiting a manufacturing or distribution site was to be awed by the sheer mass of humanity you encounter. Everything is the biggest, with the most people. Now, though, China is undergoing a big demographic shift, with a steadily declining population of young people. In some parts of the country, there are already shortages of migrant labor.An excerpt from \u201cAsia One,\u201d in which a robot-operated factory floor becomes a stage for one of China\u2019s leading young artists. In \u201cAsia One,\u201d China is no longer the back office but the main stage. The factory is gleaming \u2014 cardboard boxes dance across the screen as if they were in a Busby Berkeley musical \u2014 but no one is there. These two workers appear to be middle-class, and they\u2019re managing this hugely complex set of logistical operations. Yet they might as well be the last people on earth, and they are under constant surveillance.China is also going full steam ahead with facial recognition technologies, mobile payments and mass surveillance. There are cameras everywhere, CCTV everywhere. At lots of the factories I visited, companies had installed fingerprint recognition to better track and authenticate who was visiting the site. And Ms. Cao is playing with that \u2014 the female worker has a bar code tattooed on her wrist, as if she were the product rather than the employee.Probably 90 percent of these delivery workers are migrants from elsewhere in China, and in Ms. Cao\u2019s project you see the delivery men shoving odd-shaped packages into a van, racing through the alleyways of Beijing. And she takes you home with some of these people, where several generations live in a one-room apartment.When you put the two films together, you have this portrait of a Chinese economy with a lot of automation, but still a lot of heavy lifting and arduous tasks. And she shows you the challenges for the human worker in 2018, and the coming challenges of isolation, loneliness and perhaps joblessness \u2014 or the absence of jobs. And of technological control.In the U.S. we think of shipping and robotics as economic questions, but of course they are deeply political in China. And this gets to why I think \u201cAsia One\u201d is such a monumental work: Ms. Cao somehow convinced one of China\u2019s most valuable companies, with deep government ties, to let her shoot this tragic portrait of China\u2019s future \u2014 our future, too \u2014 right inside its flagship warehouse.And in \u201cAsia One,\u201d Ms. Cao invests this empty factory with this romantic, heroic, Cultural Revolution-style rhetoric. You\u2019re really working for the benefit of the company and its shareholders, but you have to fuse that with national priorities and ambitions. It\u2019s all about the goals for the nation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Meet the New Jack Ryan, Same as the Old Jack Ryan", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPlayed by four men in five movies across 24 years, Jack Ryan has been more of a curriculum vitae than a character. Boy Scout, Marine, history professor, C.I.A. analyst, reluctant action hero \u2014 he can be taken out of the drawer any time and handed to the next actor in line.And he\u2019s about as convincing at it as anyone. He gives Ryan\u2019s professorial side a credibility that Mr. Ford and Mr. Affleck couldn\u2019t manage, and his combination of boyishness and physical presence, already used for comedy in \u201cThe Office,\u201d helps give his Ryan a humorous edge that Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Pine went for with middling success.Mr. Krasinski is the face of \u201cJack Ryan,\u201d and he\u2019s a pleasure to watch. The more important name associated with the show, though, is probably that of Carlton Cuse, who created it with Graham Roland and has writing or directing credits on four of the six episodes available for review.As a creator or producer in recent years of suspense, horror and science-fiction series like \u201cBates Motel,\u201d \u201cThe Strain\u201d and \u201cColony,\u201d Mr. Cuse has a solid record for being more creative in terms of concept, and more thoughtful in terms of character, than the television norm. But his shows also stay solidly within their genre boundaries, and their execution can be formulaic to the point of drab.An amusing, or frustrating, characteristic of the Ryan movies was their willful disregard of continuity, even though Mace Neufeld was a producer of all of them, and is now an executive producer of the Amazon series. They jumped back and forth in time, and the fourth and fifth each rebooted the story, in different ways. \u201cTom Clancy\u2019s Jack Ryan\u201d continues that tradition, taking Ryan back to his early days as a C.I.A. analyst. Once again, he can save the world for the first time.Another commonality among the films was their Cold War outlook, even after they departed from the novels \u2014 Russia was the evil empire, right through \u201cShadow Recruit.\u201d The series breaks away from Mr. Clancy\u2019s era, joining the rest of popular culture in focusing on the Middle East and making terrorists the antagonists.And in keeping with the inflationary tendency of the established Ryan narrative, where the hero\u2019s ordinariness is contrasted with the extreme threats of nuclear annihilation or economic collapse, this new Ryan uncovers a terrorist who\u2019s bidding to be the new Osama bin Laden.The villain, a Lebanese jihadist named Suleiman, is played by the Arab-Israeli actor Ali Suliman, and it\u2019s notable that Mr. Suliman and the Saudi Arabian actress Dina Shihabi, as Suleiman\u2019s wife, get nearly as much screen time as Mr. Krasinski and Mr. Pierce. The series goes much further than most American shows in fleshing out the lives and motivations of the non-American characters, not falling back on the usual assertions of religious fanaticism. It\u2019s a refreshing change, even if the depictions of the marginalization and patriarchal attitudes that drive the Suleimans are pretty formulaic in their own right.But still, Jack Ryan is Jack Ryan, and he has the same job he always had. The character has been roughened around the edges \u2014 he\u2019s willing to manipulate another analyst who has a crush on him, and he now has a past on Wall Street, a sure sign of questionable morality. But in the key moments, he\u2019s still the Boy Scout, which is to say the godlike, morally superior American, stretching out his hand to the rest of the world. Some things can\u2019t be rebooted, apparently, no matter how outdated they get.An earlier version of this article and picture caption misstated the number of episodes in the series. It is eight, not 10.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018Mystery Road,\u2019 Judy Davis Goes West", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the six-hour story \u2014 set in motion when a pair of ranch hands, one white and one Aboriginal, go missing on a vast cattle station \u2014 Swan has been given a jousting partner, another cop to warily build a relationship with, perhaps for seasons to come. And while Mr. Pedersen would be reason enough to watch the moody, flavorful, handsomely photographed show, the thing that really sets \u201cMystery Road\u201d apart is the actress who signed on to play the outback sergeant Emma James: the great Judy Davis, playing a police officer for the first time in her career and starring in an Australian TV series for the first time in nearly 40 years.Ms. Davis is so firmly identified in the American mind with intense, often neurotic city-dwelling characters (notably in Woody Allen movies) that it takes an episode or two to get used to her climbing in and out of a police car in the dusty, empty landscapes (shot on location around the town of Kununurra in Western Australia), wearing a baggy blue uniform that swallows her tiny frame. It seems at first as if she might not be right for the part, but eventually you see that she\u2019s perfect. James is a formidable woman stuck in the middle of nowhere because of the bonds of family and history, and Ms. Davis\u2019s preternatural intelligence and tightly capped energy serve her well.Many countries have their version of the American western, but Australia, with its correspondingly dramatic landscapes and its history of subjugating Indigenous nations, makes a strikingly similar match. \u201cMystery Road\u201d will feel familiar for fans of the resurgent contemporary American TV western, like \u201cLongmire\u201d or this summer\u2019s cable hit, \u201cYellowstone.\u201dThe mystery story, which incorporates drug trafficking, child sexual abuse and shady land deals, is fairly pedestrian. But in the hands of the director Rachel Perkins and the cinematographer Mark Wareham, the show is a visual knockout, an evocative succession of desert-, ranch- and starscapes.It\u2019s also bracing to see the way in which the lives and concerns of the Indigenous characters are given precedence without the self-consciousness, or self-congratulation, that sometimes marks American productions\u2019 treatment of African-American or Native American characters in similar stories. That tends to be true of Australian TV and film in general, and \u201cMystery Road\u201d features good work by a host of established Aboriginal performers, including Aaron L. McGrath, Deborah Mailman, Wayne Blair and Tasma Walton.But Ms. Davis is first among equals, and the series becomes hers in its later episodes, as James is forced to uncover secrets about her family history. Some of the show\u2019s best scenes are anguished conversations between James and her brother, moments whose naturalness and crack timing may owe something to the fact that the brother is played by Ms. Davis\u2019s husband of 34 years, Colin Friels. (They\u2019ve appeared together frequently over the years, most notably in the great Gillian Armstrong film \u201cHigh Tide\u201d in 1987.) That\u2019s a lot of Australian screen history to top off a western-mystery binge.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Happy Children Do Chores", "Date": "2018-08-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Dell\u2019Antonia writes frequently about parenthood.Children should do chores. That\u2019s a controversial premise, though not everyone will admit it. A few parents will declare outright that their children are \u201ctoo busy for chores\u201d or that \u201ctheir job is school.\u201d Many more of us assign chores, or say we believe in them, but the chores just don\u2019t get done.That\u2019s a problem. For starters, chores are good for kids. Being a part of the routine work of running a household helps children develop an awareness of the needs of others, while at the same time contributing to their emotional well-being. Children who consider themselves necessary to the family are less likely to feel adrift in a world where everyone wants to feel needed.I don\u2019t want to make too much of a small study, and there\u2019s really no need. All that the research in this area does is confirm what we already know.Children who help more at home feel a larger sense of obligation and connectedness to their parents, and that connection helps them weather life\u2019s stressful moments \u2014 in other words, it helps them be happier. Their help, even when it\u2019s less than gracious, helps their parents be happier, too.But for all that their help matters, to us and to them, few kids are doing much around the house at all. In a survey of 1,001 American adults, 75 percent said they believed regular chores made kids \u201cmore responsible\u201d and 63 percent said chores teach kids \u201cimportant life lessons.\u201d Yet while 82 percent reported having had regular chores growing up, only 56 percent of those with children said they required them to do chores.We believe in chores. We talk a good game. But when we look honestly at who\u2019s doing what in our kitchens, laundry rooms and bathrooms, many of us (including me) struggle to do what it takes to get kids to help at home.I asked 1,050 parents an open-ended question: What do you least like about parenting? The most common answer by far was \u201cdiscipline,\u201d which included enforcing chores and other responsibilities. Other answers: \u201cEnforcing the rules, especially about household chores\u201d; the challenges of \u201cchores and disciplining a child\u201d; and having to nag kids to do simple chores. We may think our children should do chores, but we really don\u2019t want to have to make them.\u201cOur interviews and observations over the last several years also suggest that the power and frequency of parents\u2019 messages about achievement and happiness often drown out their messages about concern for others,\u201d Dr. Weissbourd said.We can do better. Although household chores seem like a small thing, the subtle but pervasive message of requiring them isn\u2019t small at all. Requiring a high schooler to contribute to the family well-being and the smooth running of the household before turning his attention to his books conveys the value you place on that contribution.Sports and homework are not get-out-of-chores-free cards. The goal, after all, is not to raise children we can coddle into the Ivy League. The goal is to raise adults who can balance a caring role in their families and communities with whatever lifetime achievement goals they choose. Chores teach that balance. They\u2019re not just chores \u2014 they\u2019re life skills.Persuaded? Then you\u2019ll be looking, now, at the end of this article, for some golden advice on getting your children to step up. You might be worried that there aren\u2019t enough words left here to encompass all you\u2019re going to need to learn to make this happen. Is there another page perhaps? A link to click to make the magic happen?There is not \u2014 because unfortunately, getting children to do chores is an incredibly simple two-step process: insist, and persist, until the chore is done.Accept no excuses. Don\u2019t worry if you must repeat yourself again and again. If you\u2019re spending more time getting the child to do this job than it would take to do it yourself, then you\u2019re doing it right. Getting children to do chores without nagging \u2014 that\u2019s an entirely separate endeavor. Right now the goal is the chore.Can an allowance help? Maybe. But if you\u2019re trying to teach kids to share the responsibility of a home, paying them for routine chores is not the right message. After all, no one pays you to unload your own dishwasher, and no one ever will.The good news is that children whose families have established an expectation that they will contribute to the workings of the household do just that. There are 7-year-olds in the suburbs who do the laundry, just as there are 5-year-olds in the Amazon who help harvest papayas. In our house, the kids clear their dishes, feed the animals, clean the kitchen after dinner and take out the trash. I\u2019ve found they may not whistle while they work; they may require near-constant reminders; they will almost certainly not do the job to your standards without years of training, but children can and will do the work if you require it of them.And in another 20 years, they might even thank you for it.An earlier version of this article misstated the values that 80 percent of students in a survey ranked more highly than caring for others. They were happiness and achievement, not just happiness.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rite Aid and Albertsons Agree to Call Off Merger in Face of Opposition", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Rite Aid pharmacy chain announced on Wednesday it had called off its proposed merger with Albertsons, the grocery retailer, after the deal appeared to lose the support of its shareholders.The announcement came on the eve of a special meeting of Rite Aid shareholders to consider the merger. That meeting will not take place, the company announced.\u201cWhile we believed in the merits of the combination with Albertsons, we have heard the views expressed by our stockholders and are committed to moving forward and executing our strategic plan as a stand-alone company,\u201d said John T. Standley, the pharmacy chain\u2019s chief executive.The companies said they had mutually agreed to terminate the merger, and that neither would be responsible for any payments to the other side.Albertsons said in a statement that it disagreed with \u201cthe conclusion of certain Rite Aid stockholders and third-party advisory firms\u201d that the deal undervalued the drugstore chain, but would not alter the terms of the deal.As part of the proposed deal, Rite Aid shareholders would have owned 30 percent of the combined companies.The deal was supposed to solve several challenges facing the two old-line companies in a retail landscape that is being turned upside down by consolidation, bankruptcies and rapid digital innovation.Under the deal that was called off on Wednesday, Albertsons would have rebranded its in-store pharmacies under the Rite Aid name, and would continue to operate some stand-alone Rite Aid pharmacies.Foot traffic to the in-store pharmacies was supposed to help Albertsons raise the number of customers walking through its food aisles, increasing the chances that they would buy a banana or rib-eye steak on their way out.It would have also enabled Albertsons\u2019 largest investors, including the private equity firm Cerberus, to cash out of its long time investment in the grocery chain.Rite Aid\u2019s board tried to convince shareholders that Albertsons\u2019 digital capabilities and financial strength would help the pharmacy chain grow in the face of stiff competition.But it was hardly the transformative deal that rivals have pursued \u2014 such as CVS\u2019s proposed merger with Aetna, the health insurer, or Walmart\u2019s efforts to deepen its ties with Humana.Since 2012, Albertsons has grown to 2,318 stores with revenue of $60 billion from just 192 stores and annual revenue of $4 billion.A big driver of that expansion came in 2014 when Cerberus and other investors agreed to buy Safeway, another supermarket chain, for $9.2 billion \u2014 creating a grocery giant.Still, Albertsons has struggled in some markets to distinguish itself from competitors. Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods last year, and Walmart\u2019s huge investment in its grocery offerings, has only added to those challenges.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen Play It (Relatively) Straight", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMALIBU, Calif. \u2014 During their lengthy runs on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen created some of the sketch comedy show\u2019s most outrageous characters.Now, more than a decade after Ms. Rudolph left the show, and five years since Mr. Armisen\u2019s departure, they are back together, in the new Amazon comedy \u201cForever.\u201d But this time, they\u2019re playing a relatively normal married couple who argue about fork tines.Their new show, which debuts Sept. 14 and is written and produced by the Emmy-winning writers Alan Yang (\u201cMaster of None\u201d) and Matt Hubbard (\u201c30 Rock\u201d), signals a big leap from the pair\u2019s sketch-comedy roots. Instead of playing a multitude of outlandish characters on a series with no discernible end (\u201cS.N.L.\u201d is entering its 44th season), the two play a single character each in a comedy capped at eight episodes.\u201cAlan said it was the first time he did a show that had an ending, where he knew where it was going,\u201d Ms. Rudolph said. \u201cThat was a huge light bulb for Fred and myself. We both said, \u2018Yes, that\u2019s what we want.\u2019 \u201dThe show began coming together in March 2017, when Mr. Armisen and Ms. Rudolph approached Mr. Yang about creating a series for them. Mr. Armisen was wrapping up his sketch series \u201cPortlandia\u201d after eight seasons; Ms. Rudolph was coming off her short-lived variety series with Martin Short, \u201cMaya & Marty.\u201d And they had always shared a desire to do another show together. \u201cI remember Fred reminding me, weren\u2019t we going to do a show where we played monsters or something?\u201d Ms. Rudolph said.Mr. Yang immediately contacted Mr. Hubbard, whom he had worked with on \u201cParks and Recreation.\u201d The two began brainstorming ideas and presented the actors with several pitches, between \u201cfive or so\u201d (Mr. Armisen\u2019s estimate) and \u201ca million\u201d (Ms. Rudolph\u2019s count). Maybe Maya and Fred could be friends, they thought, or they could be dating, or they could be brother and sister?\u201cThere was one that had them running a preschool for rich people in Silver Lake,\u201d Mr. Hubbard recalled, sitting in a trailer here with Mr. Yang during a break in filming the series. \u201cI think I pitched a show where they were leaders of a cult.\u201d\u201cThat was actually one of the better ideas,\u201d Mr. Yang said.In the winning scenario, Mr. Armisen is Oscar, a dentist in Riverside, Calif., Mr. Yang\u2019s hometown. June, Ms. Rudolph\u2019s character, works at a shady time-share company when she isn\u2019t chickening out of trying to find something better. \u201cI think we thought it would be fun to take two people who are unbelievably good at playing anybody, and have them play a relatively normcore couple in Riverside,\u201d Mr. Hubbard said.But despite their satisfying if somewhat predictable existence in a sleepy suburban Southern California town, June and Oscar find themselves dealing with improbable tragedies, energy-giving fountains and a mysterious briefcase-wielding weirdo.The two were drawn to the series\u2019 unusual story arc, which includes a series of life-changing moments early into the eight-episode run, and the chance to play a pair of characters who grow and change over time. \u201cIt\u2019s really about the relationship,\u201d Ms. Rudolph said. \u201cThey\u2019re happy, and from the outside, I think everyone sees a loving relationship. But with June, she\u2019s always wondering, what else is out there?\u201dCatherine Keener, who plays Kase, a free spirit who comes between the two, worked with Ms. Rudolph in the 2017 film \u201cWe Don\u2019t Belong Here,\u201d but had never worked with Mr. Armisen before. \u201cIndividually they\u2019re both brilliant, but they\u2019re another thing when they\u2019re together,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can almost see it, this thing, like they\u2019re in this little pocket together. Everyone would stand around and just watch them.\u201dThe series has offered both Ms. Rudolph and Mr. Armisen a chance to bust out of the sketch-comedy bubble. \u201cI never thought when I started out that being in comedy would mean being limited to comedy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut very quickly, when you demonstrate you can be funny, people label you as a comedian, and they don\u2019t like it when you go outside of that box.\u201dThe plotline of the series also allowed everyone involved to get outside for a change. On a chilly afternoon last March, Ms. Rudolph was here at the Leo Carrillo State Beach filming the final episode of the series. Over the course of the day, the actress flew a kite with Julia Ormond, jumped in and out of the Pacific and ran back and forth along the beach in front of Mr. Armisen. \u201cHe was off camera, and he was laughing so hard, because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever seen me run before,\u201d Ms. Rudolph said.Besides the Malibu beach, the shoots have taken the cast and crew all over the Los Angeles area, including Big Bear and Simi Valley. Mr. Armisen, who moved to California three years ago, has been able to explore the state on Amazon\u2019s dime; for the producers, it\u2019s been a chance to get out from under the faux fluorescent lighting of their previous sitcoms. \u201c \u201830 Rock\u2019 is in an office, \u2018Parks and Rec\u2019 is in an office,\u201d Hubbard recalled.While Ms. Rudolph was flying her kite on the beach, Mr. Armisen hung out by a nearby craft services truck. As he waited for his next scene, he talked about how \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d \u201cPortlandia\u201d and \u201cForever\u201d feel like extensions of each other (\u201cAs corny as it sounds, it\u2019s sort of like a tree, like we\u2019re still all united with all of that\u201d), and why \u201cAmerica\u2019s Funniest Home Videos\u201d will always make him laugh (\u201cI could mention some cool show from England, but as far as actual, immediate laughter, that show still works\u201d).And he talked about the one important advantage \u201cForever\u201d has over many of his past sketch comedy gigs. \u201cI don\u2019t have to keep putting on different wigs and mustaches and stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just one character all the way through. I don\u2019t have to think like, \u2018Wait, who am I today?\u2019 So that\u2019s been a nice feeling.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Reeling From the \u2018Year Without a Sam\u2019s Club,\u2019 Alaskans Wonder: What\u2019s Next?", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFAIRBANKS, Alaska \u2014 Monica Laakso, a bar manager married to a utility lineman, saw her monthly food bill jump by $200. The Fairbanks Senior Center had to eliminate cookie treats from its Meals on Wheels program. And Benny Lin, owner of the Pagoda Restaurant, got a shock when the price of salt tripled just about overnight.Sam\u2019s Club, the discount bulk retailer, closed down more than 60 of its stores this year, from Baton Rouge to Cincinnati, and much of America shrugged it off in the midst of an economic boom. But in Alaska, and especially in Fairbanks, Sam\u2019s exit was a thunderclap and a symbol of an anxious new economic chapter for the state.\u201cWhat comes next?\u201d said Christina Wright, who runs a business, Cakes by Christina, from her Fairbanks home and saw the price of ingredients increase by 30 percent. In a place where huge distances and a tough climate make buying in bulk essential, the departure of Sam\u2019s meant people suddenly were dependent on traditional grocery stores with higher prices.Stretching back to Alaska\u2019s days as a territory and through its boom years of oil production, the powerful mythology of this state has been that open-ended opportunity came with the vast landscape and traditions of limited government.But the Year Without a Sam\u2019s, as some people are calling it, has exposed new rifts in the identity Alaska has cultivated, as the economy has sunk amid a drop in oil prices and production. Unemployment, at 7.1 percent, is the highest in the nation. Even the state\u2019s secret demographic weapon \u2014 its romantic appeal as a place to start afresh \u2014 seems to have ebbed, with more people moving out over the last five years than moving in, for the first time since at least World War II.Against this backdrop, Alaskans will go to the polls next week in a primary election for governor that could set up a stark discussion of the state\u2019s future, as Gov. Bill Walker, an independent seeking a second term, faces challenges this fall from his left and his right.Mr. Walker \u2014 whose first term was shaped by recession, as the drop in oil prices and production dragged down the state budget \u2014 portrays himself as a tested leader willing to make hard decisions and take decisive action.But in some ways, the election has become a referendum on taking action at all. Mr. Walker repeatedly proposed new taxes to fix a multiyear shortfall in the state budget, including the restoration of an income tax, which was abolished decades ago when oil money made it unnecessary. The State Legislature \u2014 Republican-led in the Senate, but divided in the House with a Democratic-led, two-party coalition \u2014 thwarted those plans. It instead cut education funding and local aid to cities like Fairbanks, where many public buildings, constructed in the 1970s as the oil boom hit, have started to crumble.Mike Dunleavy, a former state senator who led much of the charge against Mr. Walker\u2019s ideas in the Legislature, has been seen as the leading candidate in a Republican primary that includes Mead Treadwell, a former lieutenant governor.On the Democratic side, Mark Begich, a former United States Senator and mayor of Anchorage, also has pledged to reverse decisions that have come out of Juneau, the capital, in recent years. He has promised to diversify the economy with more renewable energy and job training, and make the state a global center for climate change research and science.As the election has approached, new challenges have emerged for Alaska. When oil and construction jobs faded, for example, Alaskans noted that commercial fishing, like tourism, was still strong. Then came a trade war with China.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a gang tackle at the Seahawks game and then somebody piles on,\u201d Joe Morelli, the chief executive at Seafood Producers Cooperative. Mr. Morelli said a 25 percent tariff on seafood exports to China could rip through his company\u2019s biggest growth market \u2014 black cod. (Love for Seattle\u2019s professional football team, the Seahawks, is part of Alaskan life, too. Though the team plays 1,500 miles from Fairbanks, it\u2019s the closest thing to a home team for a state spread over an area four times the size of California.) \u201cThe last thing Alaska needs right now is another hit,\u201d Mr. Morelli said.Alaska\u2019s 740,000 residents have found that outside forces are leaving their mark on a place that thrives on self-determination. The state has reeled as decisions came from the board of Walmart, Sam\u2019s owner, from tariff policymakers in Washington and Beijing on matters that threaten the nation\u2019s biggest commercial fishing fleet, and from the big oil companies that have shed thousands of jobs. Alaska remains a place of ambition and hope, but many residents seem unsure what the next chapter will look like, and who will write it.For all the storm clouds, Alaska is nowhere near economic collapse. The $65 billion Permanent Fund, a savings account built from taxes collected on oil, was bolstered as oil prices boomed during the Great Recession, even as the rest of the nation suffered; it still spits out annual dividends to residents. The United States Air Force is promising to move thousands of troops and their families to the Fairbanks area starting next year, with a buildup of the F-35 jet program. Oil prices have risen from their lows, a crucial boost to the state budget. Amazon, delivering almost anything almost anywhere, has eased the pain of Sam\u2019s departure for some.And Costco, a competitor to Sam\u2019s Club, has told residents it will move into Sam\u2019s old space in Fairbanks later this year.Still, the effects of the Sam\u2019s demise have lingered, especially in remote villages that are off the road system reachable only by air or water. There, bulk-buying runs to Sam\u2019s to fill larders and freezers, and stock the shelves of village stores, were part of life.\u201cEvery person I know, in every village, had a Sam\u2019s card,\u201d said Larry Bredeman, who lives about four hours up a partly gravel road from Fairbanks, and said that almost everything he wore and ate came from Sam\u2019s.Mr. Bredeman, 67, and his brother in law, Ray Woods, have now made two trips \u2014 about 1,000 miles round trip by car \u2014 to pick up supplies in Anchorage from a Costco there, including hundreds of pounds of dog food for Mr. Woods\u2019s 17-dog sled-racing team.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "War Without End", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "At WarThe Pentagon\u2019s failed campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan left a generation of soldiers with little to fight for but one another.Supported byHe was 19, but at 160 pounds and barely needing to shave, he could pass for two years younger. He was nobody\u2019s archetype of a fighter. A high school drama student, he joined the Army at 17 and planned to become an actor if he survived the war. Often he went about his duties with an enormous smile, singing no matter what anyone else thought \u2014 R. & B., rap, rock, hip-hop, the blues. All of this made him popular in the platoon, even as he had become tenser than his former self and older than his years; even as his friends and sergeants he admired were killed, leaving him a burden of ghosts.After a few hours, Second Platoon reached the crest, high above the valley. The soldiers inhaled deeply, taking in the thin air. Away from the outpost\u2019s burning trash, the air tasted clean.A few soldiers went forward to check the trail before the rest of the platoon moved to the ambush site. With little more than whispers, the soldiers arranged themselves in a triangle astride a mountain footpath. Second Lt. Justin Smith, their platoon leader, put Molano at one corner and a second man with an M240 at another, with their machine guns angled back toward each other so their fire could create an interlocking zone of flying lead. Other soldiers set claymore mines on small stands.Everything was ready before dark. The air was chilly and the ridge raked by gusts. Soto was shivering. He pulled a dry undershirt and socks from his pack, changed clothes, ate a protein bar and washed it down with water. He saw his company\u2019s outpost below, across the open space, and realized this must be what it looked like to militants when they attacked. A distant call to prayer floated on the mountain air.More than three million Americans have served in uniform in these wars. Nearly 7,000 of them have died. Tens of thousands more have been wounded. More are killed or wounded each year, in smaller numbers but often in dreary circumstances, including the fatal attack in July on Cpl. Joseph Maciel by an Afghan soldier \u2014 a member of the very forces that the United States has underwritten, trained and equipped, and yet as a matter of necessity and practice now guards itself against.On one matter there can be no argument: The policies that sent these men and women abroad, with their emphasis on military action and their visions of reordering nations and cultures, have not succeeded. It is beyond honest dispute that the wars did not achieve what their organizers promised, no matter the party in power or the generals in command. Astonishingly expensive, strategically incoherent, sold by a shifting slate of senior officers and politicians and editorial-page hawks, the wars have continued in varied forms and under different rationales each and every year since passenger jets struck the World Trade Center in 2001. They continue today without an end in sight, reauthorized in Pentagon budgets almost as if distant war is a presumed government action.As the costs have grown \u2014 whether measured by dollars spent, stature lost or blood shed \u2014 the wars\u2019 architects and the commentators supporting them have often been ready with optimistic or airbrushed predictions, each pitched to the latest project or newly appointed general\u2019s plan. According to the bullhorns and depending on the year, America\u2019s military campaigns abroad would satisfy justice, displace tyrants, keep violence away from Western soil, spread democracy, foster development, prevent sectarian war, protect populations, reduce corruption, bolster women\u2019s rights, decrease the international heroin trade, check the influence of extreme religious ideology, create Iraqi and Afghan security forces that would be law-abiding and competent and finally build nations that might peacefully stand on their own in a global world, all while discouraging other would-be despots and terrorists.Aside from displacing tyrants and leading to the eventual killing of Osama bin Laden, none of this turned out as pitched. Prominent successes were short-lived. New thugs rose where old thugs fell. Corruption and lawlessness remain endemic. An uncountable tally of civilians \u2014 many times the number of those who perished in the terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001 \u2014 were killed. Others were wounded or driven from their homes, first by American action and then by violent social forces American action helped unleash.The governments of Afghanistan and Iraq, each of which the United States spent hundreds of billions of dollars to build and support, are fragile, brutal and uncertain. The nations they struggle to rule harbor large contingents of irregular fighters and terrorists who have been hardened and made savvy, trained by the experience of fighting the American military machine. Much of the infrastructure the United States built with its citizens\u2019 treasure and its troops\u2019 labor lies abandoned. Briefly schools or outposts, many are husks, looted and desolate monuments to forgotten plans. Hundreds of thousands of weapons provided to would-be allies have vanished; an innumerable quantity are on markets or in the hands of Washington\u2019s enemies. Billions of dollars spent creating security partners also deputized pedophiles, torturers and thieves. National police or army units that the Pentagon proclaimed essential to their countries\u2019 futures have disbanded. The Islamic State has sponsored or encouraged terrorist attacks across much of the world \u2014 exactly the species of crime the global \u201cwar on terror\u201d was supposed to prevent.Almost two decades after the White House cast American troops as liberators to be welcomed, large swaths of territory where the Pentagon deployed combat forces are under stubborn insurgent influence. Areas once touted as markers of counterinsurgency progress have become no-go zones, regions in which almost no Americans dare tread, save a few journalists and aid workers, or private military contractors or American military and C.I.A. teams.Across these years, hundreds of thousands of young men and women signed on in good faith and served in the lower and middle ranks. They did not make policy. They lived within it.His urge to understand what happened was irresistible. A few months later, Soto sneaked away from the Bronx with an 11-year-old friend. The two rode the 4 train to Lower Manhattan and walked to the rubble at Ground Zero, where the towers had been. Soto made up his mind standing there. He would protect the United States. When he was old enough, he would enlist.The neighborhood outside his home was rough, and Soto was already carving out his place on the street \u2014 since age 8, he had been selling AA batteries on the curb. As his childhood passed, he watched friends drift into crime. Some joined Dominicans Don\u2019t Play, a Latino gang in a violent rivalry with another, the Trinitarios. His father, who worked as a doorman in Manhattan, had custody of him and his brother. The family shared an apartment with Soto\u2019s grandmother, Haydee Madera-Soto, who moved to New York from Puerto Rico in 1962 and lived in the same building on Morris Avenue for decades. She watched from her second-story window as if hovering above him, calling him inside when she sensed trouble. When he tried evading her, she learned his routes over rooftops and down staircases into other buildings on the block, and knew which staircases to charge up to intercept him and lead him home. Soto did not want to disappoint her. In eighth grade, he played Iago in a school production of Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cOthello.\u201d The role helped him enroll at the Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan in September 2003, not long after the United States invaded Iraq.Soto never quite fit in. Most of his classmates were neither skirting gang involvement nor inclined toward military service. They were almost all bound for college and seemed to be able to dissociate themselves from the memory of New York being attacked. Soto felt as if he were from another world and moving in a different direction. He graduated in 2007 and enrolled in summer classes at Lehman College, but something did not feel right. America was fighting two wars. Each was going badly. What was he doing sitting around? He walked out of math class and into an Army recruiting office, where he told the first soldier he saw that he wanted to sign up. He volunteered for the infantry \u2014 his sense of the hardest, most dangerous job. His grandmother was visiting her village in Puerto Rico when he took his oath. She was despondent when she heard. \u201cIf I had been here, I wouldn\u2019t have let him go,\u201d she said.In August, when Soto arrived at Fort Benning, Ga., for One Station Unit Training, a pipeline to combat divisions, he was given as simple a label as a human being can have: Roster No. 242, written on tape on his plain green helmet. Several sergeants who trained him had been to Iraq and Afghanistan; he regarded them as the most impressive people he had ever met. Soto returned home for the holidays with orders to report in January 2008 to Fort Hood, Tex., and join the First Infantry Division, which was bound for a rotation in Afghanistan. The war in Iraq had entered a less violent phase. The Pentagon was shifting attention to defeating the Taliban, which had reasserted itself after being forced from Kabul in 2001. It had cut off remote outposts and was challenging the American-backed government across much of the country.At Fort Hood, Soto was greeted by a Viper Company squad leader, Staff Sgt. Nathan Cox. At 32, Cox was older than is typical for his rank. He had a deeply furrowed brow, a hint of graying hair, a college education and an aura of confidence rooted in previous tours in Bosnia and Iraq. He welcomed Soto in a straightforward manner, with a politeness that reflected his Catholic-school years in Iowa. Soto immediately liked him. Cox was a tattooed bookworm with a pensive side. After working under the tutelage of drill sergeants, with their outsize personas, Soto was drawn to his quieter, more composed and reflective demeanor. The platoon sergeant, Sgt. First Class Thomas Wright, assigned Soto as an ammunition bearer in a machine-gun team, a position for an F.N.G. \u2014 \u201cfucking new guy\u201d \u2014 on a fast track to war.The company was busy readying for Afghanistan and spent weeks in the field, conditioning with long marches under heavy rucksacks and training with weapons. The more Soto came to know Sergeant Cox, the more fortunate he felt to work for him. Cox served in the Army in the \u201990s, then returned to civilian life and studied for his bachelor\u2019s degree. Like Soto, he was deeply affected by the terrorist attacks in 2001, and he began talking of serving again. But he was raising two stepchildren and an infant daughter with his wife-to-be, Annie, and did not want to disrupt their family while they had teenage children in school. He waited until 2005, as his stepdaughter was graduating from high school, to take his oath for a second time, returning, like Soto, to the Army as an infantry volunteer. Cox did a tour in Iraq before reporting to Fort Hood with Annie and their toddler, where he became a squad leader. In this role, he was expected to shape a new batch of soldiers into a fighting team. Like Soto, he was also an artist. Soto sang. Cox drew. Sometimes he sketched officers as they gave briefings, filling pages of his tactical notebooks with renderings in real time.Late that spring, Cox hosted several young soldiers at the home on Fort Hood he shared with his family. It was one-half of an Army-managed duplex, a place in such poor condition that Annie and he referred to it as a government slum, the \u2019hood of Fort Hood. The battalion\u2019s soldiers were being granted leave before flying away for a year, and the party, on a concrete patio outside their back door, was a chance to gather away from work and relax. Annie prepared food and welcomed her husband\u2019s charges into her life. Cox grilled meat and served drinks and offered his out-of-uniform human side, impressing on his squad that each soldier was part of a team, and that he needed them, and that soon they would all need one another in profound ways.There were things he did not share. Although few of his fellow soldiers knew it, Cox did not have to deploy to Afghanistan; he had been recruited to serve as a PsyOps soldier, and there was a position for him in the PsyOps field. He turned down the opportunity, confiding in Annie that he could not let his squad go to Afghanistan without him. He had been telling his soldiers they had to be there for one another. He intended to live by his words.On the flight from the United States in July, Cox got his soldiers seated, then tried to relax. He ate and read part of a book but felt his wartime self settling over him, that blend of exhaustion and intensity, as he headed into his third war. \u201cSaying goodbye was hard, took it out of me emotionally,\u201d he wrote in his journal. \u201cFlight gives way to deployment mind-set + compressed brain.\u201dViper. The name sounded impressive. They were F.N.G.s now.At the moment Soto and his fellow soldiers arrived in the valley, the United States had been in Afghanistan almost seven years \u2014 longer than America\u2019s Civil War and involvement in World War I combined. The war\u2019s objectives and the military\u2019s roles had shifted across the years. The rush into the country to punish the perpetrators of the 2001 attacks had evolved into something else: an open-ended occupation. Osama bin Laden and Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban\u2019s leader, were at large, and elite counterterrorism units remained in the country, fighting a shadow war against Al Qaeda and its allies. But larger conventional American units were engaged in a war that swapped urgency for a mesh of military, development and political aims. Combat tours to Afghanistan now blended military and civil assignments, including holding down remote outposts, organizing infrastructure projects, helping Afghan ministries with tasks like registering voters and training and outfitting Afghan soldiers and police officers, to whom the Pentagon insisted security would one day be entrusted.No one had a firm idea of when that day might be, and hope for decisive momentum on any of these propositions had been undercut by the campaign in Iraq, which began diverting Pentagon attention soon after Bin Laden escaped over the mountain passes near Tora Bora in late 2001. In mid-2008, as Cox\u2019s squad arrived, the United States had more than 140,000 troops in Iraq and about 33,000 in Afghanistan. Many lived in an archipelago of small rural positions, around which the Taliban had long ago established ambush points and planted hidden bombs. This encirclement made ground patrols perilous and in some places rendered resupply by road impossible. These positions were kept alive by replenishments dropped with parachutes or carried by helicopters, themselves in short supply. All the while, the United States, pitted against enemies adept at terrorist attacks and guerrilla warfare, was field-testing a reboot of Western counterinsurgency doctrine, with an emphasis on protecting civilians and providing services while tightening rules that dictated how troops could fight. A phrase from Vietnam was circulating anew \u2014 \u201cwinning hearts and minds\u201d \u2014 even as units of hard-helmeted conventional troops spent large fractions of their time guarding their outposts and keeping themselves provisioned in distant, rugged terrain. A darker slang developed in the lower ranks. Afghanistan was the \u201cwelfare war.\u201d Forlorn outposts, often built near villages resentful of foreign occupiers, were \u201cbullet sponges.\u201dAmericans occasionally ventured up the Korengal\u2019s banks in the first years of the war, and they often met armed resistance. But the valley did not gain larger notoriety until 2005, when three Navy SEALs were killed in an ambush and a helicopter rushing to their aid was shot down, claiming 16 more lives. In 2006, an Army brigade situated the outpost on a low ridge with a gently sloping crest, beginning the phase of the American effort that Soto\u2019s platoon was cycling through. On a tactical level, establishment of the outpost could seem to make sense. The place was defensible, in an officer-school way \u2014 a position overlooking the river and lower trails with enough space for helicopters to land. On a social level, it could not have been much worse. It was an unforced error of occupation, a set of foreign military bunkers built on the grounds of a sawmill and lumber yard formerly operated by Haji Mateen, a local timber baron. The American foothold put some of the valley\u2019s toughest men out of work, the same Afghans who knew the mountain trails. Haji Mateen now commanded many of the valley\u2019s fighters, under the banner of the Taliban.Military minds had chosen the place. Standard military tactics would have to defend it. Troops built smaller posts so their occupants could watch over more of the riverbed and support one another with machine gun and mortar fire. NATO officials spoke of forging alliances between government and people. The American presence in the Korengal felt more crude fortress than diplomatic expedition, out of sync with ideas of protecting populations or courting hearts and minds.At first Soto found the valley breathtaking. The riverbed formed a green stripe of cropland. Terraces of stacked stone climbed the lower hills. Villages clung to ledges. Farther up the mountains rose escarpments of stone, buffeted by wind. This was not the arid steppe or brown hills that dominate much of the Afghan landscape. It was ancient forest bisected by cascading mountain streams that fed a river with a haunting name, a place beyond the imagination of a teenager from the Bronx.Soto soon saw the ground through another lens. Using aerial photographs, the Americans had charted every building in every village. The valley no longer seemed to him a land that time forgot. It was as intricately mapped as almost any place on earth. Hilltops, ridges, livestock sheds. Each was a precise spot that American weapons were ready to hit, a number on a targeting template overwritten on homes, ready for retaliation against any place from where an attack might emerge. Many attacks followed patterns. The outpost was reachable by a single dirt road from the Pech Valley. The Army had used this overland path for more than a year, sending cargo trucks accompanied by helicopters and armored Humvees. Often a route-clearance platoon led the slow drive, looking for bombs. These practices were well known by all sides and allowed the Taliban hours to prepare. Without irony, the Army had given its dirt track a name: Route Victory.Soon after his arrival, Soto was in a Humvee turret on the road, looking over the river to a village called Donga when incoming fire struck the dirt beside his truck, smacking it with shrapnel and rocks. He shouted to the driver \u2014 \u201cMove!\u201d \u2014 and opened up, aiming .50-caliber bullets just below dust he spotted rising on the far side. He fired an entire can, then half of another. Sergeant Cox was beneath him in the truck. \u201cHey, man, you O.K.?\u201d he asked Soto after, watching for his response. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said; he was adjusting to the place.Several times at night, Soto looked across the valley at flashlights bobbing in forests. He was sure these were Taliban moving ammunition and weapons. He found it maddening. They could fight as they pleased, but American soldiers were bound by rules limiting their ability to enter homes, rules governing when they could use their weapons, rules governing whether and how firepower could be applied. Soldiers were drilled in manners and restraint. As Soto saw it, Viper was like a boxer forbidden to use fists, reasoning with a foe who was allowed to punch first. It was a death lottery, with medals for the losers and talking points on the news.On Sept. 6, Second Squad walked across the river and up the steep hill to Donga, while other soldiers set up a position on the west side. Militants opened fire, trying to hit the soldiers on the west bank. When the gunfire stopped, Cox hunched over the radio with another sergeant. They shook heads and swore and told everyone to get ready for the return walk. Soto was a student of Cox\u2019s body language. He knew something was wrong.Helicopters circled overhead. After Second Squad crossed the river and climbed to the road, Soto was angry. There was a lot going on, and they weren\u2019t hearing it. He thought he knew why. When the squad reached an Afghan Army position, his anger surged to fury. He confronted a sergeant. \u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded. \u201cWho got hit?\u201d\u201cIt was Knight,\u201d the sergeant said.Specialist Marques Knight was an experienced soldier, with a tour in Iraq. He was killed in a vehicle turret when a sniper\u2019s bullet hit his head. Soldiers beneath him in the truck saw his legs go instantly limp.The sky opened up, splattering the valley with rain and hail. Soto strode forcefully along the last leg of the walk to the outpost, soaked and cold, alternating between numbness and lucidity. Knight\u2019s body lay in the mechanics\u2019 bay, where soldiers paid last respects. Late that night, Viper gathered for a ceremony in the darkness. A mortar crew fired two illumination rounds. Each was a bright flare beneath a fluttering parachute. They ignited brilliantly and descended, whistling softly and casting shadows that spun and danced. They burned for about a minute. Then the valley was black again.The idealism that propelled Soto to Afghanistan was being scoured away. In his journal, Cox recorded one of Soto\u2019s questions. \u201cWhy is it,\u201d Cox wrote, \u201cthat pieces of crap go on living lives that mean nothing and good men die in places like this?\u201d Soto thought Cox agreed, but he was careful in his reply. He didn\u2019t know that fatalism had seeped into his sergeant\u2019s thinking, too. \u201cHave a bit of humor with death,\u201d Cox wrote. \u201cAt the funeral just say, \u2018I guess I had it coming.\u2019 \u201d His entry that night was littered with the titles of songs. \u201cSeven Nation Army,\u201d \u201cAway From the Sun,\u201d \u201cHere Without You.\u201dHe ended with a lyric from one more: \u201cLove me when I\u2019m gone.\u201dAfter Knight was killed, Sergeant Wright, the platoon sergeant, told Soto that Third Squad was heading to an observation post and that Soto would leave Second Squad temporarily to join them there. Soto did not want to go. Cox\u2019s 33rd birthday was at the end of the month, and Soto had ordered a gift \u2014 a copy of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye.\u201d He had noticed how much Cox read. Even when there was time for only a few hours of sleep, Cox would often spend part of it with a book. It was fiction as sanctuary. The two men had talked about reading, and Soto had learned that Cox had never read J.D. Salinger. He intended to fix that, just as he intended to remain with Second Squad for its next patrols. He sought out his squad leader and asked to stay in his job.Cox told him he had already spoken with Wright and the brief reassignment would stand. The observation post needed a medic, a role Soto had trained to perform. Cox was occupied with leading the rest of his squad. Some of the soldiers were calling certain patrols suicide missions; one griped to him about taking what he considered unnecessary risks. Cox was incredulous. \u201cWhat?\u201d he wrote in his journal. \u201cEverything we do is an unnecessary risk. It is our job!\u201dSoto moved with Third Squad to Observation Post Dallas, a small position above the valley, where soldiers took turns on radio watch and behind machine guns, defending their peers below. The place was primitive to an extreme, a set of sandbagged fighting holes cut into stone and sunbaked earth. Soldiers slept in folding cots on uneven ground, camping near a barrel of their own waste. The bunkers were infested with fleas, and the air was swarmed by flies, which moved between excrement and everything else. But some of the soldiers liked their days there. At Dallas they were unhassled by the rules and routines of the larger outpost, alone atop a ridge where bird song filled the air each dawn. Cox, on an earlier rotation, had seemed especially pleased. \u201cMy 1st command,\u201d he wrote, \u201cof a fort.\u201dOn Sept. 20, Second Squad drove north on Route Victory toward the Pech Valley to sweep an area where patrols were attacked so frequently that troops called it Ambush Alley. Soto listened to their progress while on radio watch at Dallas. He heard gunfire chatter, then a rocket-propelled grenade boom and echo. Over the radio came the reassuring sound of Cox\u2019s voice. The patrol radioed that it had crossed through the most dangerous stretch.An explosion rocked the valley. Soto guessed what it meant. A Humvee had been hit by a bomb.He waited anxiously, monitoring the back-and-forth transmissions between outpost and patrol. Multiple voices came on the radio. Cox\u2019s was absent. Soto assumed Cox was busy at the blast site, assessing what had happened, helping any wounded, organizing the squad\u2019s reaction. Other soldiers reached the crater and described what they saw. The I.E.D. had knocked the last Humvee off the road, scattering its armor, roof and doors downslope. Two soldiers had been wounded. Two more were dead. The gunner, Pvt. Joseph F. Gonzales, had been killed instantly. So had Sergeant Cox.High on the mountain to the south, Soto\u2019s eyes welled with tears.Soto usually sat directly behind Cox in the truck. If Wright had not sent him to Dallas, if Soto had won his argument over being reassigned, he would have been in his seat with his first-aid bag when the blast blew the truck apart.Barack Obama was the president-elect. The Afghan war was soon to be new again. But political wheels turned slowly, and whatever changes were in store for the war would be unlikely to happen soon enough to matter to his platoon, which was still engaged in pitched firefights. Sitting at home, looked after by his grandmother, Soto felt guilty for being away. He was relieved when it was time to return to the valley.He landed to more bad news. Three more soldiers in his platoon were shot while he was gone, and a helicopter was hit by a missile or rocket and crashed. Most of those inside scrambled out, but a sergeant was killed. The downing exposed another weakness in American plans for Afghanistan: the reluctance of the Afghan forces. After the helicopter slammed into the earth, Marines mentoring Afghan soldiers tried to rally them to the aid of passengers and crew. The Afghans refused. The patrol, they said, was not on their schedule.Soto\u2019s views of the war were hardening further, and he was unwilling to suppress what he knew. American soldiers were not going to win over Korengalis with counterinsurgency sweet talk or development projects, and they were not going to defeat militants by hanging around the outpost and trying to visit villages by day. In the news he read about the war, senior officers said what they needed to say \u2014 about Americans coaching Afghan forces, about winning over the Afghan population, about the Taliban losing ground. The brass didn\u2019t mention what he saw: that most Afghans in the valley were not interested in getting along, that Afghanistan\u2019s Army survived only under American protection and that units like his spent most of their time just trying to stay supplied and alive.Then came the order for the ambush patrol high on the ridge.Smith\u2019s plan called for the scouts to find a position up the slope and watch the trail, ready to give warning if anyone approached. They departed in single file. Soto figured a night of boredom was ahead. Near the center of the patrol base, the radio operator sat with the handset, monitoring transmissions. He had spread a poncho liner and opened an M.R.E. ration, expecting an easy run of hours.Smith rushed toward him, whispering fast. \u201cDudes are coming down the trail,\u201d he said. The radio operator asked if the scouts were coming back.\u201cNo,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe Taliban.\u201d He dashed away.Soto heard movement behind him. Smith crouched between him and Specialist Molano, practically hissing. Scouts had just reported gunmen walking this way, he said, 10 or 15 people in all.Soto entered a peculiar mind-set that can settle over a combatant in the seconds before battle, a feeling of absolute, intoxicating clarity. Roles in the valley had been reversed. This time someone else was heading into a trap. He flipped his rifle\u2019s selector lever off safe. His world shrank to what rehearsals had drilled him for: peering into his sector, ready to kill. His job now was to wait. Smith alone was to decide whether the people approaching were combatants. If he decided they were, then he decided when to begin shooting. Only he could initiate fire.Soto\u2019s eye was pressed close to his night-vision device. His heart thumped in his ears.Into the dim green glow of his eyepiece stepped the shape of a man. He was carrying a rifle. Another man emerged behind him. He carried a rifle, too. Two more men stepped into view. They were about 35 yards away. The first man paused. He pointed a flashlight at the ground, switched it on and quickly switched it off.Soto felt vindicated. The Taliban fighters were ghosts no more. He had been right all along when he saw flashlights and suspected the Taliban moved openly at night. Calm settled over Soto. The approaching men were about to die.The lead man was perhaps 20 yards away.Lasers had already settled on the first two men. A green line stopped on the forehead of the first; another traced a figure-eight pattern on his chest. The second man was similarly marked.Soto moved his weapon toward the man with the machine gun and rested his aiming laser between straps on his tactical harness.The gunmen drew inside of 15 yards, then inside of 10. More fighters filled in behind them.Smith pressed the switch on the claymore. An explosion shook the forest. Steel balls slammed into the Taliban patrol. His voice sounded in the dark. \u201cFire!\u201d he said. \u201cFire! Fire!\u201dSoto fired several times into the chest of the man carrying the machine gun. The man dropped to his knees. Soto kept shooting as the man crumpled to the ground. He scanned a pandemonium made visible through his night-vision monocular. A few Taliban fighters had fallen in place. Others staggered and scattered. Tracers skipped off rocks, spinning over the ridge in hot arcs. Soto fired at the fleeing men. He thought he hit them but wasn\u2019t sure.The man Soto shot first rose. He was upright. Soto fired again. The man dove into brush. A grenade shook the forest. Soto heard familiar voices. He yelled that he was fine as he changed his rifle\u2019s magazine. The shooting stopped. A voice called out. \u201cGet ready for a counterattack!\u201dSergeants moved through the patrol base, checking their soldiers. Someone said none of the Americans had been hurt. A sergeant led Soto and two other soldiers into the kill zone to search the dead. Soto found the body of the machine-gunner he had killed. Up close, under a flashlight, he looked 16 years old. More bodies were spread through the woods. The sergeant donned latex gloves and turned the dead men\u2019s heads to photograph each face for an intelligence report. Second Platoon had killed more than 10 Taliban fighters. Now it had to get back to avoid suffering casualties of its own.The platoon filed downhill with scouts in the lead. Gunfire broke out again. Soto was farther back; he and the soldiers near him slid downhill, grabbing brush to break their falls. They found the scouts standing over three more Taliban bodies.The platoon shuffled on. Inside the column, Soto let his mind wander. He felt proud. He and his friends had killed men who had been killing them. Vengeance was satisfying, in a primal way. And this night, he thought, might have brought more than revenge. The Taliban\u2019s losses could hurt its ability to fight.Viper 2 waded back across the river before dawn and weaved uphill to the outpost\u2019s gate. The waiting soldiers were cheering. Soto heard people say that what his platoon did was monumental. Cooks prepared a hot meal, and the soldiers, back within the relative safety to their base, talked hurriedly, loudly, surging with what they had done.Soto drifted away. His legs quivered with cramps. He had been working in gore, searching the warm, bloodied bodies of Taliban fighters ripped apart by bullets and claymore mines. He washed himself by standing naked and dumping bottles of drinking water over his head. His adrenaline had ebbed, allowing him to reconsider what had happened. He realized he had been wrong about one thing. Smith was legit. He\u2019d led them through the most successful operation of their tour. But now he doubted the killing would change the company\u2019s circumstances. The valley did not work that way.Earlier, elders had appeared at the outpost\u2019s gate and asked to speak with Viper\u2019s commander, Capt. Jimmy Howell. In ordinary circumstances, their long faces might command others to hush. But the outpost was ebullient. Viper\u2019s morale had been buoyed by the settling of a score. Soldiers grinned. An awkward meeting followed. Howell took a seat among his visitors, who said the Americans had made a mistake. A child had gone missing while gathering food on the mountain, they said, and villagers sent a search party to find her. These were the men, they said, that Viper killed.Howell waited until the last elder had spoken. Then he replied. The elders\u2019 tale, he said, was one of the most ridiculous lies he had ever heard.After the ambush, Soto became Smith\u2019s radio operator, and the platoon was assigned to visit Laneyal, across the river from Aliabad, a village that served as a de facto front line, beyond which was Taliban turf. Getting there involved multiple risks. The soldiers would walk along the western side of the river, which the Taliban often raked with gunfire, and where Knight was killed. Then they would pick their way downslope to a river fork. The path was narrow, and the river was swollen with snowmelt and rain. There the soldiers would cross on wooden footbridges. The first was perhaps two feet wide. The second was a timberlike plank. First Lt. John Rodriguez, Viper\u2019s executive officer, walked with Smith, who was still learning the ground.The platoon departed in drizzle. Sheets of mist drifted across the valley. The mud was slick like grease. The valley dropped before the soldiers like a gorge. On the way down, the soldiers met an elder, Zarin, coming up. Rodriguez knew him. The two men chatted in the rain. Zarin said the path would be safe.After crossing the bridge over the western fork, the soldiers moved in single file to the plank. Laneyal loomed overhead as Soto crossed.An explosion detonated before him, heaving a cone of dirt in the air, blowing him to the ground. In the moment after, all was still. Soto\u2019s ears rang.Bullets snapped down, part of a crescendo of fire. Soto pushed himself to his feet and dashed downstream, leaping over boulders. He saw a pile of logs ahead and headed there, his radio antenna swinging from his back. He reached the logs, knelt, aimed his M4 upward and fired.\u201cStay there!\u201d Smith shouted. \u201cStay! There!\u201dSoto couldn\u2019t hear him. Rushing water and gunfire drowned out other sound. He thought Smith needed the radio. He ran down the bank and jumped into the cold water, feeling the weight of his pack and radio as his feet struck bottom. A stone building stood across the river, about 100 feet away. Gunfire tore through the air. Soto pushed himself across the stream, struggling to stay upright. He cleared the water, scrambled upright and ran to the soldiers at the building.An Air Force bomb whooshed in and exploded, sending a mushroom cloud rising where another building had been. Smith told the soldiers under Laneyal to be ready to withdraw. Now was their chance. The soldiers threw smoke grenades and retraced their steps, contracting into Aliabad, where they clustered in alleys and went through the ritual of a head count. Squad and team leaders tallied ammunition. The mood lightened. They had survived another ambush and were exhilarated to be alive.A voice called out. \u201cDewater?\u201dThere was no answer. Pfc. Richard Dewater was not in Aliabad.Nausea swept over Soto. He radioed to the outpost, in case Dewater had walked back. Dewater was not there. Nightfall was near. The soldiers moved across the bridges. The platoon spread through wheat fields to the blast hole.\u201cI found him,\u201d a voice said. Soto spun around. A sergeant was there. Dewater was not. \u201cLook up,\u201d the sergeant said, and swung a flashlight beam into the canopy of a tree. Dewater\u2019s lifeless body hung from a branch. His helmet was on. He was missing a leg.Another sergeant climbed the tree and pushed Dewater free. The soldiers placed him on a litter. Slowly they made their way across the river, panting, struggling to carry their friend.On the staircase, Afghan soldiers watched. One raised a camera. Something in Soto snapped. He stepped before the lens. \u201cWhat the fuck you doing, man?\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re taking a picture of? We don\u2019t take pictures of you. Put that camera down.\u201d He shoved the man. The Afghan soldiers parted. The processional reached the road and turned north, walking in darkness and cold rain.Unknown to most of the younger soldiers, officers in Viper Company and their battalion commander were advocating a different approach. One linchpin of American strategy had been to fight away from population centers, from outposts the military sometimes called blocking positions. The troops understood the assumptions in this thinking were weak. On May 1, Taliban fighters overwhelmed a mountaintop outpost overlooking the Kunar River, killing three Americans, two Latvians and three Afghan soldiers, and taking other Afghan soldiers prisoner. In the aftermath, Lieutenant Rodriguez talked with an intelligence sergeant who had concluded, as did others who were tracking the violence, that many Korengali fighters were fighting elsewhere, at least for now, including in the Kunar Valley. This challenged American thinking about blocking positions. Taliban fighters were not blocked. They had little trouble leaving the valley at will.That month, Viper\u2019s commander, Captain Howell, sent a letter via the elders to Nasrullah, the Taliban\u2019s local leader, proposing measured withdrawal in exchange for a Taliban commitment to reconcile with the Afghan government and not to use the Korengal to stage attacks. A letter came back, saying perhaps the parties could work out a deal if the Americans would convert to Islam. Until then, Nasrullah said, New York and London would have to burn.Soto felt anxious in his last weeks in the valley. A photograph of him seconds after Dewater was killed had appeared in The New York Times. Word rushed through his circles in the city. In her apartment in Morris Avenue in the Bronx, his grandmother stared at the photo and cried. Friends wrote him on Facebook and email, urging him to keep safe. The attention was jarring. Soto had shrunk his world to a grunt\u2019s regimen and assumed a fatalistic view. Expecting to be killed had made his job easier. Now he felt pressure not to die.By mid-June, all that was left was a helicopter ride to Bagram by darkness. He and a small group of troops sat on the landing zone, on gravel and dust, backs pressed against stuffed rucksacks. They were near the mechanics\u2019 bay, where the remains of men they knew had waited in body bags for their own flights home. His tour was minutes from being over.The first sergeant appeared. Dust swirled as the aircraft descended. He grabbed Soto and shouted. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cSoto!\u201d he shouted back.\u201cSoto?\u201d The first sergeant pressed a coin-shaped medallion with the company logo into his hand, a keepsake for having served his tour. \u201cMan, you really deserve this.\u201dIn 2011, his unit was sent to Iraq to help with another American withdrawal. Now he was a sergeant and team leader on a third deployment. He had gained muscle and experience, skepticism and tattoos. Soto\u2019s time in Iraq was nothing like his Afghan tour. He and his team were part of a perimeter security force that guarded airfields as planes carried away whatever the Pentagon wanted to keep. The insurgents appeared to have decided to let them go. Soto saw no direct action; he spent more time in the gym than on patrol. But he had learned to doubt official military narratives. When he flew to Kuwait late that year, among the last Americans to leave (before the collapse of Iraqi forces in the face of an Islamic State offensive would draw the Pentagon back), he did not feel as if peace had been assured. The violent contest for Iraq was not over.By then the war in Afghanistan had absorbed the Obama administration\u2019s campaign to turn it around. The American and NATO troop surge that followed Viper Company\u2019s tour had crested, bringing more news of fighting in places few Americans had heard of before. An influx of money, equipment and advisers had swelled Afghan Army and police numbers and distributed fresh forces over the ground. The latest plan was for the Americans to secure the country, usher in government services and then hand over the countryside to Afghan troops.But ministries and armies are not remade in a few years, and many American units were dispatched into lightly populated areas and the same sort of hard-to-maintain positions that previous commanders decided were ineffective, risky and not worth their cost. It was as if one cycle of senior officers had not learned from the previous round. Moreover, several regions were also engines of opium-poppy production, where a foreign military presence threatened an established local economy and provoked armed interests with no intention of losing it. The thinking behind the offensive could sound good in the general officers\u2019 suites. At the lower ranks, Marines and soldiers were fighting small, brutal and frustrating actions, protected from being overrun by air power while losing lives and legs on ground, like the Korengal Valley, that the Pentagon did not intend to keep and had few viable proxies to pass off to.The Taliban showed no sign of folding. Its bombs grew more sophisticated, even as its spokesmen taunted the Americans and their proxies on Twitter. Many American soldiers and lower-level officers saw that the Afghan surge was not succeeding, and that the Taliban would wait for the drawdown. Some of them, after a decade of war, in command of an array of fire support unmatched by any military in the world, adopted cautious tempos and spoke to their troops in knowing euphemisms, including \u201ctactical patience,\u201d a concept at odds with the aggressive ethos of infantry units but in line with an understanding that the plan was flawed. Roughly translated, it meant: \u201cDon\u2019t let your people be the last soldiers killed in this war.\u201dSoto and his fellow veterans from the Korengal watched from afar, clustered on social media, memorializing their own list of dead: David Paquet, Michael Dinterman, Marques Knight, John Penich, Joseph Gonzales, Ezra Dawson, Richard Dewater, Nathan Cox. A list including the wounded showed that the cost was larger; after a Marine who worked with them committed suicide and a postwar motorcycle accident claimed a forward observer, some of them wondered if it was larger still.And then it was someone else\u2019s turn. Sgt. Robert Soto left the Army with an honorable discharge in 2012, driving home to New York in a U-haul truck towing a red Camaro he kept almost as clean as the rifle he left behind. War had come to his city when he was a child. Now he was ready to try peace. He moved in with his grandmother in the Bronx and used his G.I. Bill benefits to enroll at Monroe College. Except for occasional visits to the nearby V.A. center for treatment for anxiety and insomnia, he mostly kept his status as a veteran to himself.In 2014, he transferred to Columbia University, where he avoided the vocal veterans\u2019 group on campus and rarely flashed the visual signals \u2014 the caps, T-shirts, bags and Velcro patches \u2014 that can convey recent service to the larger tribe. Sometimes to sleep he drank, enough that friends and his grandmother were concerned, but he was also making grades, working out, staying socially active. He landed a role in a musical and in 2017 performed at the war museum on the decommissioned U.S.S. Intrepid. That summer he graduated with a degree in political science. The Ivy League\u2019s imprimatur had been bestowed upon him, but he did not want to wear it. Apprehensive about having his life taken over by a conventional career, he still had dreams of being an artist. He worked part time \u2014 in construction, installing and removing scaffolding, in child care \u2014 while trying to break into the music industry. He had grown up on the street and then at war. Writing and recording music was the resumption of his long dream of becoming a performer, and felt like the childhood he never had. Much of what he wrote was about life in New York, but he recorded other tracks, like one he called \u201cGala,\u201d with a refrain that called back to the war:No more pain for all my guysJust ChampagneLet\u2019s taste the sky.Still he wondered: Was there no accountability for the senior officer class? The war was turning 17, and the services and the Pentagon seemed to have been given passes on all the failures and the drift. Even if the Taliban were to sign a peace deal tomorrow, there would be no rousing sense of victory, no parade. In Iraq, the Islamic State metastasized in the wreckage of the war to spread terror around the world. The human costs were past counting, and the whitewash was both institutional and personal, extended to one general after another, including many of the same officers whose plans and orders had either fizzled or failed to create lasting success, and yet who kept rising. Soto watched some of them as they were revered and celebrated in Washington and by members of the press, even after past plans were discredited and enemies retrenched.On that point Soto\u2019s views were unsparing. Good people paid in blood and sorrow, sent to graves or subjected to suffering for which there was no reckoning. It fit a pattern he now could see. Viper\u2019s war was the Korengal Outpost, for four years a showcase of American resolve only to become the subject of an Al Jazeera report of Taliban fighters strolling through its remains. Soto did not see himself as special. Many others served there, and he knew countless combat veterans could name emptied outposts across Afghanistan and Iraq that were also mostly forgotten, except among those who fought from them, told, in their time, that it mattered.Some days he accepted it. Others he could not square what he heard with what he and his fellow veterans had lived. The dead were not replaceable, and they had been lost in a place the Army did not need them to be. Sometimes, when he was awake in the restless hours between midnight and dawn, his memories of lost friends orbiting his mind, Soto entertained the questions. What befell those who sent them? Did generals lose sleep, too? \u201cThey just failed as leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should know: They failed, as leaders. They let us down.\u201dLate this spring, before a recording session in a rented sound studio near Times Square, Soto visited his grandmother on Morris Avenue. He and his father looked through a closet that held old uniforms and keepsakes from his enlistment. In the collection was a small Amazon delivery box. Soto had received the package when a helicopter brought mail to the Korengal Outpost in 2008. Its tape had been torn open, but its contents remained undisturbed \u2014 a paperback book gift-wrapped in green. Its gold ribbon was pristine. It was the copy of \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye\u201d he had ordered for Sergeant Cox\u2019s 33rd birthday. It had arrived after Cox\u2019s death.Advertisement"}

As ever, the pillows on the beige suede banquettes had been perfectly plumped. A peek inside the reservation ledger revealed that nothing had changed about the clientele: studio moguls, fashion designers, literary agents, A-list movie stars.Wait. Could it be? Was that ... the former Cond\u00e9 Nast editor Gab\u00e9 Doppelt, a publishing stalwart trusted by Anna Wintour and trained by Tina Brown, behind the hostess podium?\u201cBelieve it, darling,\u201d Ms. Doppelt, 58, told me in her precise South African accent, as she dispatched a waiter to tend to a troublesome table. \u201cMagazines are over!\u201d\u201cAnd we call it a ma\u00eetre d\u2019,\u201d she said, giving my arm a you-poor-thing pat. \u201cWe really must get you out more.\u201dAs Jeffrey Klein, the young hotelier behind the Sunset Tower said recently, \u201cDimitri is an institution.\u201dMs. Doppelt\u2019s new career is certainly not dreary. At 6:45 p.m. on an August Monday, she was standing in a backless black Miu Miu dress near the check-in podium. All of a sudden, Michael Kors turned the corner and walked toward her with outstretched arms. \u201cWho says that chic doesn\u2019t exist on our planet!\u201d he said in a near shriek. They hugged \u2014 Ms. Doppelt had met Mr. Kors multiple times when she was a fashion editor \u2014 and she guided his entourage to a prime corner table.\u201cI was really burned out,\u201d said Ms. Doppelt, whose last media job was at The Daily Beast, under Ms. Brown, where she served as West Coast bureau chief. \u201cWe were posting something like 40 or 50 pieces a day, once you include photo galleries and video blogs. It was all about maintaining or increasing traffic. There just isn\u2019t enough good stuff to keep up that pace, frankly.\u201d\u201cThe idea of coming back to publishing was so horrific to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then the phone rang, and it was Jeffrey. We\u2019ve been friends forever. He sounded frantic \u2014 Jeffrey being Jeffrey. And he said, \u2018Dimitri is leaving, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\u201dThe more closely a restaurant is associated with one person, the harder it is to recast and move forward. In Mr. Dimitrov\u2019s case, the entire Sunset Tower is associated with him; every time guests turn on the television sets in their rooms, the first thing that pops up is a welcome video starring a purring Mr. Dimitrov.A new welcome video featuring Ms. Doppelt will take its place, and she may well develop her own cult following. But heat in Hollywood is ephemeral. A few scrunched-up celebrity noses \u2014 \u201cTower Bar just isn\u2019t the same\u201d \u2014 could send customers looking elsewhere for air kisses and $42 lobster Cobb salads.Mr. Klein is also tinkering with the 81-room Sunset Tower at a moment when Hollywood administrations are changing, which can result in new migratory patterns for A-listers. Old movie studios like 20th Century Fox are fading as streaming giants like Amazon ascend. San Vicente Bungalows will also have a see-and-be-seen restaurant and nine hotel rooms. Mr. Dimitrov is already selling it hard. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be trusted by Mr. Klein with the new project, which is going to be magically special, an oasis, amazing luxury, covered by every architectural magazine in the world,\u201d he said in his over-the-top way.Aware of the stakes, Mr. Klein has spent more than a year working on what he calls \u201cSunset Tower 2.0\u201d \u2014 the smooth transition to Ms. Doppelt from Mr. Dimitrov; renovating the spa, gym, pool and guest rooms; and turning an underwhelming events space into a Tower Bar annex, complete with dark wood paneling, pink suede chairs and potted palm trees.\u201cIt\u2019s crucial to evolve,\u201d he told me during a tour in May, when construction was still underway. \u201cI won\u2019t let the Sunset Tower become some old relic.\u201d (The hotel\u2019s co-owner is Len Blavatnik, a Ukrainian-born billionaire.)Just then, an interior designer, Lisa Koch, arrived with five swatches of puce-ish fabric to show Mr. Klein. She laid out the pieces on the floor, and he got down on his hands and knees to examine them. \u201cThis one\u2019s a little too bubble gummy,\u201d he said, moving on to another. \u201cI like this one, but the peony print has always bothered me,\u201d he continued, looking up at Ms. Koch. \u201cIt\u2019s just a tiny bit too bright.\u201d It was decided that the peony would be reprinted 30 percent lighter.\u201cI\u2019m just listening to the bones of the building,\u201d Mr. Klein said, standing up and brushing dust off his blue trousers.Mr. Bozzi, who is married to Bryan Lourd, the Creative Artists Agency kingpin, added that Mr. Klein\u2019s decision to hire Ms. Doppelt was \u201ca stroke of brilliance,\u201d coming as women assert themselves in Hollywood as never before.No less a tastemaker than Ms. Wintour appears to agree. Ms. Doppelt first worked for her at British Vogue in the late 1980s.Indeed, Ms. Doppelt insisted her hairpin career turn was actually a lifetime in the making.Her father owned a restaurant in Pretoria, South Africa, where she lived until 1974, when she moved to London to attend a \u201ccrammer\u201d specialty school. (She dropped out and ended up getting a job as Ms. Brown\u2019s assistant at Tatler in 1979.)In Manhattan in the 1990s, around the time she took a break from magazines to help VH1 create its Fashion Awards, Ms. Doppelt lived in the Royalton Hotel for nine months. At that time, Brian McNally\u2019s 44, located inside the Royalton, was a lunchtime hot spot with editors and fashionistas. \u201cI would often sit with Brian in the mornings and we would sort through the booth gridlock \u2014 Anna, Donna, Calvin,\u201d Ms. Doppelt said.Mr. Klein first approached her for the Tower Bar job in 2004. She accepted, planning to quit her job at W, but got cold feet at the last minute, according to both of them. The job has been much harder than she expected. \u201cEvery boss I\u2019ve ever worked for sweats the small stuff, and I had no idea how much small stuff goes into making Tower Bar run,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I would just be walking around, chatting to my friends and making new ones.\u201d Instead, Mr. Dimitrov started her out folding napkins and polishing silverware.And her gabbing got her in trouble.\u201cI love Gab\u00e9, such a creative mind, but I had to tell her, \u2018You cannot go on and on with one table,\u2019\u201d Mr. Dimitrov said. \u201cYou must spread the attention across the entire room. Short bursts.\u201dThe hardest adjustment has been the physicality of the job, the diminutive Ms. Doppelt said. Her shift starts at about 5 p.m. and can stretch until 2 a.m.\u201cWorking eight hours a day on your feet in four-inch heels \u2014 I beg of you to try it,\u201d she said one night earlier this summer. \u201cSo I have developed a system. I start out in Prada flats. Then I move to four-inch Gucci heels. Then we go down an inch to Miu Miu heels. Then back to the Prada flats.\u201dIn fact, it was time for a shoe change right then.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Follow the Money (Then Take a Picture)", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "With \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d the filmmaker Lauren Greenfield looks back at 30 years of chronicling the rich \u2014 and predicting our cultural future.Supported byPerhaps because she has spent her career watching the rich, the photographer and filmmaker Lauren Greenfield is herself rich to watch. At a party after the New York premiere of her new documentary \u2014 \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d about the perils of capitalism \u2014 Ms. Greenfield was wired, welcoming and constantly working. She snapped pictures of the well-heeled crowd as she hugged her way around the room, occasionally misplacing a glass of white wine, in a churn of compliments and gossip.Ms. Greenfield, 52, paused to note that one prominent guest had left the festivities early: Jacqueline Siegel, the star of her best-known documentary, \u201cThe Queen of Versailles,\u201d about the construction of a $100 million house amid last decade\u2019s financial crisis. Ms. Greenfield observed that in the intervening years, Ms. Siegel\u2019s bosom seemed to have grown inexplicably, much like the national economy. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said, \u201cfor the excess of the new American dream.\u201d (Through a spokesman, Ms. Siegel, a self-professed patron of cosmetic procedures, denied that she has recently augmented her breasts.)Over the last 30 years, Ms. Greenfield has become America\u2019s foremost visual chronicler of the plutocracy, and those who hope to join its ranks. Her ultra-saturated, up-close, unsparing images have appeared in the pages of The New York Times Magazine, GQ and The New Yorker, as well as museum exhibitions and theatrical documentaries. Ms. Greenfield\u2019s lens has fallen on affluent teens playing hooky, rappers and the strippers they shower $100 bills on, investors in exile, hedge-funders in denial, Iceland\u2019s teetering banking system, abandoned mansions in Dubai and countless other icons of the world\u2019s mounting financial inequality.In an interview in July, Ms. Greenfield noted that critics have occasionally dismissed her work as marginal. And yet her fascination with materialism has often placed her ahead of the cultural curve. In 1992, she photographed bored teenagers at a fancy Los Angeles school dance; two of them were the then-unknown Kim and Kourtney Kardashian. In 2007, Ms. Greenfield began work that eventually led to \u201cThe Queen of Versailles,\u201d putting her in an ideal position to document the global housing crash.Even the election of a reality-show celebrity as commander-in-chief is a \u201cweird validation of what I\u2019ve been looking at and why it\u2019s important,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cWhen Kim Kardashian was photographed with Donald Trump in the White House,\u201d she added, referring to an Oval Office meeting that took place in May, \u201cit looked like it could have been an ad for my movie.\u201dArriving in theaters nationwide on Aug. 3, \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is a 105-minute collage of a documentary that weaves together still images, news clips, original interviews and footage of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s own family. It argues that the unceasing pursuit of fame and fortune has \u201cbecome the new American dream\u201d (it\u2019s a favorite phrase), replacing the Horatio Alger allegory of pulling oneself up by the bootstraps.Ms. Greenfield is well aware that she didn\u2019t invent this notion. In a gold-hued, 503-page monograph also titled \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d that Phaidon published in 2017, Ms. Greenfield quotes the writer Fran Lebowitz: \u201cOh please, Americans do not hate the rich; they want to be them. Every American believes that they are the impending rich, and that will never change.\u201dMs. Greenfield began work on the documentary in 2014 after performing \u201can archaeological dig into my own work\u201d \u2014 re-examining more than 500,000 images and 650 hours of audio/video footage archived at her Venice, Calif., home. She and her husband-slash-co-producer, Frank Evers, pitched the project to Amazon Studios. \u201cLauren had all of this material, so they saw a through line from the Reagan \u201980s to Trump, with her as our narrator and guide,\u201d Mr. Evers said.Amazon turned out to be a cosmically appropriate partner. On the same day that \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d had its premiere at the Museum of Modern Art in July, the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, became \u201cthe richest man in modern history,\u201d according to Bloomberg, with an estimated net worth of $150 billion.Ms. Greenfield herself isn\u2019t particularly rich, and she seems determined not to absorb the aspirational codes she has spent her life decrypting. Over lunch in July at Freds, the restaurant on the top floor of Barneys New York (not her idea, she\u2019d like to note), she ordered a salad with canned tuna in lieu of fresh. She dressed straightforwardly in a black T-shirt, her Gucci eyeglasses the only suggestion of status. When her salad arrived, Ms. Greenfield apologized and used her fingers to flick a garnish of raw onions directly onto the table.She had brought her Canon camera, which she plunked down next to her plate; a luxury department store is basically her Serengeti. But she decided not to photograph anyone that day. She hadn\u2019t gotten permission, so the security guards would have likely intervened. Despite being a sly documentarian of strangers at times, Ms. Greenfield doesn\u2019t easily fade into the background. With her minimalist black wardrobe, giant smile and short stature, she\u2019s like a version of her profession out of \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d: a slightly glamorous, vaguely academic photographer-mom.Ms. Greenfield grew up in communes on the West Side of Los Angeles. Her mother, a psychologist, leaned into the counterculture of the 1970s, joining an \u201ceating collective\u201d and refusing to buy Ms. Greenfield brand-name clothes. She appears in \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d telling her daughter, \u201cThe things you didn\u2019t have were the things that I didn\u2019t believe in.\u201dWhat the family valued was education, and when Ms. Greenfield was in the 11th grade, she enrolled at the private Crossroads School in nearby Santa Monica, where she befriended some of the city\u2019s wealthiest teens. That ignited her obsession with \u201cmaterialism and class,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause my parents had rejected it so much.\u201dIn 1983, Ms. Greenfield matriculated at Harvard, where her parents had studied, and where she encountered both Mr. Evers and a student body of immense privilege. While traveling around the world her junior year, studying film and anthropology, Ms. Greenfield met the pioneering French photographer Jean Rouch, who is credited with helping invent the style known as cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9, and after returning to Cambridge she changed her major to visual studies.Ms. Greenfield then trained under Barbara Norfleet, who in the mid-1980s released \u201cAll the Right People,\u201d a book of reportage photography focusing on East Coast elites. At the time, such creatures would mostly appear in staged portraits or respectfully edited party pictures, but Ms. Norfleet wanted to capture them and their rituals in the wild. \u201cI realized the rich were, in many ways, this undercover group,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cThat\u2019s hugely important, because they have so much influence.\u201dEncouraged by Mr. Evers, who had been hired at Columbia Pictures, Ms. Greenfield applied to film schools a few years after graduation, but she wasn\u2019t admitted anywhere. She concentrated on still photography, earning assignments with National Geographic. Her first project, about a Mayan tribe in Mexico that her mother was studying, was spiked. But after rereading \u201cLess Than Zero,\u201d Bret Easton Ellis\u2019s 1985 novel of California excess, she pursued an idea about her own native culture: a portfolio chronicling Crossroads and other deluxe schools, where students attended five-figure bar mitzvahs, drove Range Rovers and cavorted with celebrity progeny like Kate Hudson.Ms. Greenfield turned the resulting images into her first monograph, \u201cFast Forward,\u201d which earned her gallery representation and the attention of magazine photo editors. She traveled to the wealthy suburb of Edina, Minn., to record popular cliques enamored with Abercrombie & Fitch; and to Milan, where white teenage boys had co-opted the bandannas, baggy jeans and aesthetics of American gang culture. One fellow photographer told Ms. Greenfield that she ran the risk of pigeonholing herself, but she ultimately decided to \u201ckeep peeling back that onion,\u201d she said.Her pictures, relying on candy colors, awkward compositions and voyeuristic access, synced with the work of other rising photographers in the 1990s, including David LaChapelle and, a bit later on, Ryan McGinley. They also drew the attention of Sheila Nevins, the former HBO documentary president. In 2002, she hired Ms. Greenfield to make her first feature-length film, \u201cThin,\u201d an unrelenting account of four patients at an eating-disorder treatment center in Coconut Creek, Fla.To call any of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s portrayals flattering would be inaccurate. (Ms. Siegel\u2019s husband sued the director for defamation after the \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d was released, but the director won $750,000 in legal fees after an arbitrator ruled that everything in the film was true.) And she seems to have a knack for convincing people to be radically, unappealingly honest. Her subjects must find that cathartic. Many have agreed to sit with her repeatedly over the years, including for \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d and Ms. Greenfield has stayed close with several of them, even those she\u2019s captured in harsh light.One of them, a Las Vegas party host named Tiffany Masters, flew to New York to attend the \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d premiere. Sipping an espresso martini at the after-party, she described how Ms. Greenfield has caught her in various unfavorable ways: in the act of pulling her skirt down, for example, or recording a fatty \u201cflap over the bra.\u201d Nonetheless, Ms. Masters said, she doesn\u2019t fault the artist. \u201cLauren has the ability to shoot the truth,\u201d she said.Long pause. \u201cNo.\u201dWhy not?Another long pause. \u201cThey\u2019re unfiltered,\u201d Ms. Masters said. \u201cThey\u2019re raw. They\u2019re uncensored. But they\u2019re human.\u201dMs. Greenfield joined the ranks of prominent documentarians in 2012, after \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d grossed $2.4 million in ticket sales. The movie centered on Ms. Siegel and her husband, David, a time-share tycoon, as they attempted to build one of the largest houses in America. During filming, the couple halted construction when Mr. Siegel became a victim of the real estate bubble. \u201cHe\u2019s been to Donald Trump\u2019s office a couple of times trying to get help,\u201d Mr. Siegel\u2019s son says in the movie. In \u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d Ms. Siegel returns to claim she once dated Mr. Trump.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the one percent for their own sake,\u201d Ms. Greenfield said. \u201cI\u2019m interested in how we\u2019re all engaged, like Jackie and David, in wanting a little bit more.\u201d Ms. Greenfield is convinced that few people learned their lesson in the 2008 crisis, and she has spent a decade worrying about a modern-day version of the Fall of Rome. In the film, Chris Hedges, a former New York Times journalist, warns that \u201csocieties accrue their greatest wealth at the moment they face death.\u201dRather than lampoon the rich, \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d attempts to examine how avarice has destroyed lives across economic strata. The film intercuts a history of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s career with the stories of more than a dozen characters, as they reveal in broad strokes the ways in which the desire for more (money, beauty, attention, success) has tainted society. There\u2019s an Icelandic fisherman who becomes a banker and installs a waterfall in his home, only for the country\u2019s economic collapse to send him back to the seas; an adviser who charges outrageous sums to teach aspirational Chinese how to pronounce luxury brand names in English; an adult film actress, once paid $30,000 by Charlie Sheen, who\u2019s had three nose jobs in attempt to escape her past. Much of the footage is wealth porn. Some is actual porn.Another character, Florian Homm, sobs on camera about the ways greed isn\u2019t good. (A former financier, he was accused of defrauding his investors, causing $200 million in losses, and was wanted by the F.B.I.) \u201cIt\u2019s light finance, with heavy repercussions,\u201d Mr. Homm said in an interview. \u201cBut Lauren leaves the viewer to make their own assessments.\u201dAfter \u201cThe Queen of Versailles\u201d was released, one of Ms. Greenfield\u2019s Harvard film professors, Robb Moss, told her that all of her work \u201cwas actually about addiction.\u201d But an inherent challenge in chronicling any form of addiction is the risk of glorifying it. If \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is Ms. Greenfield\u2019s effort to decry incessant capitalism, it also puts the behavior on a podium.Her editors encouraged Ms. Greenfield to add her own story to the film. She interviewed her parents and her two teenage sons, Noah and Gabriel, about her own compulsion: working too much. The \u201cgeneration\u201d in the title is a reference to these scenes, which tie the movie together and provide emotional heft. Ms. Greenfield, who often interviews her subjects for hours at a time, doesn\u2019t shy from emotional inquiries into her own inadequacies as a mother. In one clip, a 16-year-old Noah tells Ms. Greenfield that because she was so often away on assignments, Mr. Evers did the bulk of raising him, and that \u201cthe damage has already been done.\u201dBoth Mr. Evers and Ms. Greenfield were initially reluctant to include her story in the film. \u201cBut Lauren realized that she herself was very much a part of this wealth culture,\u201d Mr. Evers said. \u201cShe wanted audiences to realize they were complicit, too.\u201d Ms. Greenfield became more comfortable with appearing in her own work after trying it in a 2014 ad she created for the feminine-care brand Always. The spot featured the director interviewing children about gender stereotypes, showing how the phrase \u201clike a girl\u201d \u2014 as in \u201crun like a girl\u201d or \u201cfight like a girl\u201d \u2014 transforms into an insult as kids age. The campaign has become Ms. Greenfield\u2019s most-watched product, after airing during the 2015 Super Bowl and amassing more than 200 million views.\u201cGeneration Wealth,\u201d which Ms. Greenfield has also turned into a traveling museum exhibition, doubles as a retrospective and a farewell to her focus on still photography. \u201cPrint is dying,\u201d she said, and magazines are commissioning fewer shoots, unable to finance the weeks of travel that her style of reportage requires. In the future, she said, she will concentrate on documentaries. Her next project is with Showtime; Ms. Greenfield would reveal only that it is set in Asia.Her current film ends with a dose of unexpected brightness, returning to characters who have forsaken their love of money for actual, human love. But ultimately, the takeaway from Ms. Greenfield\u2019s decades of work seems to be that it\u2019s up to future generations to decide how to spend their money \u2014 and if you ask her son Noah for his take, the kids are not all right.\u201cThat\u2019s what I realized from the film,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cPeople are spending like nobody cares, and that\u2019s exactly how it was in 2008.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Playing Catch-Up With Walmart, Amazon Offers Digital Grocery Pickup at Whole Foods", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon has found itself in the rare position of playing catch-up with its rivals.The e-commerce giant announced Wednesday that its Whole Foods stores will allow customers to order their groceries online and pick them up in person. Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest grocer, already offers online grocery pickup in nearly 1,800 stores across the United States, and plans to roll out the service to as many as 2,200 stores by the end of the year.Amazon\u2019s new service is starting in Sacramento and Virginia Beach. Shoppers who pay the Amazon Prime subscription fee \u2014 $12.99 a month or $119 a year \u2014 can order their groceries online and pick them up 30 minutes later at a Whole Foods.The latest move comes as Amazon and Walmart vie head-to-head for dominance of America\u2019s shifting retail landscape. Amazon continues to rule pure online shopping, but Walmart has been making inroads by incorporating digital shopping with its vast network of super centers. Fresh food is where the competition is perhaps the most fierce because customers shop for it so frequently.Retailers may be doubling down on their online grocery offerings, but is this what consumers want?Apparently not. A recent research report by analysts at Morgan Stanley says retailers still haven\u2019t quite convinced shoppers of the merits of online grocery shopping.Among shoppers who have never tried ordering groceries online, polled as part of the investment bank\u2019s annual survey, 65 percent said it\u2019s because they prefer to physically see food before they buy it. They want to see the strawberries and feel the avocados themselves.Among those who have never ordered groceries on the internet, seeing the food before they buy it is a key issue.I prefer to physically see and choose groceries I buy65%I like going to the supermarket39Delivery fee is too expensive32I would have to do additional grocery shopping in-store for fresh products30I don't buy enough products at one time to make the delivery fee worthwhile18Products are more expensive online than in a physical store16I'm not available or don't want to have to wait at home for delivery14I haven't got around to trying it yet14Time consuming13I don't like to select everything so far in advance13I'm concerned about the security of online payments10Limited selection of products is available8The service is not available where I live7The store where I shop doesn't offer online grocery shopping7Lack of natural and organic products3I don't have regular access to Internet2I prefer to physically see and choose groceries I buy65%I like going to the supermarket39Delivery fee is too expensive32I would have to do additional grocery shopping in-store for fresh products30I don't buy enough products at one time to make the delivery fee worthwhile18Products are more expensive online than in a physical store16I'm not available or don't want to have to wait at home for delivery14I haven't got around to trying it yet14Time consuming13I don't like to select everything so far in advance13I'm concerned about the security of online payments10Limited selection of products is available8The service is not available where I live7The store where I shop doesn't offer online groceryshopping7Lack of natural and organic products3I don't have regular access to Internet2AlphaWise, Morgan Stanley ResearchBy The New York TimesBut among digital options, \u201cclick and collect\u201d services, as they\u2019re called, seem to be attracting more shoppers than services that ship directly to your home.More shoppers are willing to order fresh foods \u2014 like cheese and fruits \u2014 online and pick them up in the store, rather than have them delivered, according to Morgan Stanley.Retailers are trying to be sensitive to concerns about freshness. Last week, when Walmart unveiled a new automated system designed to help its store workers assemble online orders more efficiently, the retailer made a point to note that human workers, not machines, would still pick the fruits and vegetables.For Amazon, new services like online grocery pickup are a test of whether it can integrate its digital prowess with its recently acquired brick-and-mortar network of Whole Foods.But Amazon has a long way to go in denting Walmart\u2019s dominance. With a 23 percent share of grocery spending, Walmart sold more than twice as much food as the second largest national grocer, Kroger, over the last three months. Whole Foods captured just 2 percent of grocery spending, according to Morgan Stanley.Note: Charts show the results of a survey conducted in May 2018 by Morgan Stanley Research and AlphaWise. The survey polled 2,951 consumers who were responsible for their household\u2019s grocery shopping. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States in terms of age, gender and region. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 1.8 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Is the Id of Tech", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet me answer the question many are thinking: Is he crazy? Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.Not crazy like a fox, but crazy as a loon.So let me answer that question: Is he crazy? No, he\u2019s not. Not, at least, in my various encounters with him over nearly two decades \u2014 including recently \u2014 in which he has been alternately funny, rude, compelling, obnoxious, accessible, easy to deal with, hard to deal with, always on, outspoken to a fault even when he might be at fault, angry, charming, intense and also strikingly confident. Which is a long way of saying deeply human, with all the positive and negative characteristics that suggests. And that is why, to me, Elon Musk has become the id of tech. But his desires and needs are never unconscious or hidden; they are all out there in the brightest Technicolor for all to see. In the oddest of ways, he is transparent, so utterly direct that it is unsettling and even painful at times to those around him.This week I have talked to a lot of people who know Mr. Musk, including those who adore him and those who have had it with his brusque intensity. And what I found among his current and former colleagues is that they really have the exact same story about an impulsive and driven boss who runs a very hot and messy kitchen and does not spend a lot of time apologizing for it. Some grew weary of this and left, while others thrive under the withering lights. Still others left and then came back, drawn in by the glow.This is not a new phenomenon in tech, and especially in Silicon Valley, a place that needs its complicated gods.Too much? Sure, but it was a pretty good myth and even better since it was largely true. Over the ensuing years, Mr. Jobs used his famous reality distortion field to bend the news media and investors and everyone else to his will. He also warred many times with some journalists and investors, but no one remembers that anymore. His death, much too early and so very tragic, sealed his epic tale for eternity. And so it was Mr. Musk who became the obvious choice, although the comparison to Mr. Jobs is certainly not a perfect one. Mr. Jobs was elegant and spare and even quiet; Mr. Musk is all pomp and circumstance. Mr. Jobs traveled in his mind; Mr. Musk wants to die on Mars (just not on landing, as he told me in an interview a few years ago).What they do share is a proclivity for what is perhaps the most important element of all truly legendary makers of important things: Creative destruction.For Mr. Jobs, it was a bet-the-company approach that ushered in a whole new way of computing. For Mr. Musk it is a lot of big notions, any one of which would be hard to do alone, from electric self-driving cars to ubiquitous solar energy to landing a spent rocket ship on a platform in the ocean. Yeah, he did that, too.This is not to say I am an Elon fanboy, as I find the hagiography around him tiresome and even toxic when it comes to some of his acolytes, who cannot take one valid criticism of their leader without descending into madness. (And Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t do himself any favors by whipping them up \u2014 it\u2019s indulgent and irresponsible.) But I will say that this whole debate brings to mind something that an angel investor named Pejman Nozad said to me offhand many years ago, when he was bemoaning all the stupid start-up ideas that he saw littering the landscape. Silly social networks, dumb photo filter apps, yet another delivery service for millennials. \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d he said, \u201cis a lot of big minds chasing small ideas.\u201dMake no mistake, Mr. Musk\u2019s mind and ideas are big ones. He has said publicly, and others agree, that he is simply exhausted and under intense pressure, and these recent mistakes will soon be forgotten. But he has been careless, and fewer people are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. He has tarnished his reputation by going after imagined enemies, fair critics and those who don\u2019t wish him well with the same tweet daggers. It\u2019s a huge waste of time, when what he has to do to seal his status is actually to build a strong and stable company that is not just revolving around his aura, and a team that does its best work with or without him.And, of course, delete that Twitter app off his phone. After all, can you imagine Steve Jobs tweeting? No, neither can I.Advertisement"}

Libel and slander are not.Mr. French is a First Amendment litigator and senior writer for National Review.Right now, Mr. Jones is defending lawsuits filed by multiple Sandy Hook Elementary families accusing him of making intentionally false factual statements. Most appallingly, he has insisted that these grieving families were faking their pain: \u201cI\u2019ve looked at it and undoubtedly there\u2019s a cover-up, there\u2019s actors, they\u2019re manipulating, they\u2019ve been caught lying and they were preplanning before it and rolled out with it.\u201dWould that it were that simple. Rather than applying objective standards that resonate with American law and American traditions of respect for free speech and the marketplace of ideas, the companies applied subjective standards that are subject to considerable abuse. Apple said it \u201cdoes not tolerate hate speech.\u201d Facebook accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against \u201cglorifying violence\u201d or using \u201cdehumanizing language to describe people who are transgender, Muslims and immigrants.\u201d YouTube accused Mr. Jones of violating policies against \u201chate speech and harassment.\u201d Exhibit A of how wrong the center has been: In June, it paid Maajid Nawaz $3.375 million for labeling him an \u201canti-Muslim extremist.\u201d This is rich, considered Mr. Nawaz is a former Islamist turned Muslim reformer.One doesn\u2019t even have to look to Big Tech to see the almost infinite malleability of the \u201chate speech\u201d label. In the name of stopping hate speech, university mobs have turned their ire not just against alt-right figures like Milo Yiannopoulos and Richard Spencer, but also against the most mainstream of conservative voices, like Ben Shapiro and Heather Mac Donald.Dissenting progressives aren\u2019t spared, either. Just ask Evergreen State College\u2019s Bret Weinstein, who was hounded out of a job after refusing to participate in a \u201cday of absence\u201d protest in which white students and faculty members were supposed to leave campus for the day to give students and faculty members of color exclusive access to the college. The good news is that tech companies don\u2019t have to rely on vague, malleable and hotly contested definitions of hate speech to deal with conspiracy theorists like Mr. Jones. The far better option would be to prohibit libel or slander on their platforms. To be sure, this would tie their hands more: Unlike \u201chate speech,\u201d libel and slander have legal meanings. There is a long history of using libel and slander laws to protect especially private figures from false claims. It\u2019s properly more difficult to use those laws to punish allegations directed at public figures, but even then there are limits on intentionally false factual claims. It\u2019s a high bar. But it\u2019s a bar that respects the marketplace of ideas, avoids the politically charged battle over ever-shifting norms in language and culture and provides protection for aggrieved parties. Nor do tech companies have to wait for sometimes yearslong legal processes to work themselves out. They can use their greater degree of freedom to conduct their own investigations. Those investigations would rightly be based on concrete legal standards, not wholly subjective measures of offensiveness. Private corporations can ban whoever they like. But if companies like Facebook are eager to navigate speech controversies in good faith, they would do well to learn from the centuries of legal developments in American law. When creating a true marketplace of ideas, why not let the First Amendment be your guide? Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Plans for a China Comeback Go Beyond Google Search", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet, the opportunities in the world\u2019s largest internet market may be too good to resist. And the full scope of the company\u2019s interest in China now appears to be broader than just internet search.Other recent steps that Google has taken in China include opening a research center and promoting its software tools to developers.In artificial intelligence and other areas in which Alphabet is seeking to advance the technological frontier, China today is more than just the planet\u2019s biggest audience of internet users. It is an ecosystem of sophisticated potential business partners, talent and tech-hungry customers from which tomorrow\u2019s innovations could emerge.Alphabet\u2019s investments in future technologies make it particularly important for the company to get a foot into China early. Driverless cars have prompted regulatory and political debate, which means starting sooner could help reduce Chinese authorities\u2019 concerns. More time in China for Waymo also means more experience on Chinese roads for its cars, and more data collected on the country\u2019s driving environment.\u201cI think they\u2019ve realized that developing in the United States won\u2019t produce a car that will work in China,\u201d said Gansha Wu, the chief executive and a co-founder of Uisee, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Beijing. \u201cThe road conditions are totally different.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said the company did not have a comment for this article.For Alphabet, any play at significant expansion in China would bring unique challenges.Its major moneymaking activities, such as search and video, run up against the Communist Party\u2019s controls on information in a way that online shopping, for instance, does not.Waymo\u2019s company registration in China still puts it a long way from having wheels on the road. Its Shanghai subsidiary has an initial capitalization of about $500,000. A visit on Friday to the address listed on its registration filing turned up only a cramped, unmarked office, empty but for some simple furniture.Even with more investment, Waymo\u2019s place in the Chinese market is hardly assured.Baidu, maker of the country\u2019s leading search engine, has made its autonomous-vehicle software platform available to dozens of local and foreign companies. SAIC Motor, China\u2019s largest carmaker, is working with the e-commerce titan Alibaba. BMW and Daimler have received permission in China to test their own self-driving vehicles.That might leave only China\u2019s newer, smaller automakers for Waymo should it someday seek a local partner for building intelligent cars, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Automotive Foresight, a consultancy in Shanghai.\u201cThat\u2019s their chance,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.A Waymo spokeswoman confirmed that the company had set up and staffed a legal entity in China, but declined to comment on further plans.If Google wanted to serve Chinese search users, it would face a formidable rival. For most Chinese, Baidu, which has a market capitalization of more than $70 billion, is about as synonymous with search as Google is for people elsewhere.Smaller Chinese search engines receive relatively little traffic on their own apps and websites, said Juan Lin, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm 86Research. Many of their queries come to them from external sources, such as WeChat \u2014 a sign of how little influence they command among Chinese web users, and of how much dominance Baidu enjoys.There is another problem for Google.Another potential avenue to more sales for Google in China would be to win permission to operate Google Play, its store for apps and digital media. Hundreds of millions of smartphones in the country use Google\u2019s Android operating system, but people download apps from a variety of third-party sources.For that, Google would likely need local help to win Beijing\u2019s regulatory blessing. One potential ally is Tencent, the video game and social media behemoth. The two companies recently completed a deal to share patents. Tencent also offers cloud computing services. Google executives have said that they hope to make their cloud business a global operation, something that would be hard to achieve without being in China.Making friends could benefit Google in other ways. It could cut deals with software companies to have its search engine embedded in their mobile browsers, or team up with phone makers to have its apps preinstalled on their devices.In all of these areas, Google would need to overcome wariness among potential Chinese partners, said Ms. Lin of 86Research. Google left China in 2010 in a huff.\u201cWho would want to partner with a company that exited China because of its slogan of \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019?\u201d she said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s $1 Trillion Milestone Reflects Rise of Powerful Megacompanies", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byU.S. Steel. General Motors. AT&T. Exxon Mobil.Small potatoes.Apple\u2019s new 13-figure valuation highlights how a group of enormous companies has come to dominate the United States economy. Today, a smaller cluster of American companies commands a larger share of total corporate profits than since at least the 1970s.The impact of this phenomenon has been clear in the stock markets, where a band of household-name companies \u2014 led by Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google \u2014 has fueled the nine-year bull market, the second-longest behind the rally that ended in 2000. Their successes also are propelling the broader economy, which is on track for its fastest growth rate in a decade.But the effects of the consolidation of corporate profits extend far beyond the stock markets \u2014 and they are not entirely benign.Economists, for example, are starting to look into whether the rise of so-called superstar firms is contributing to the lackluster wage growth, shrinking middle class and rising income inequality in the United States. The vast social and political influence wielded by these megacompanies has prompted some lawmakers to demand more regulation to rein them in.\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most important trends that we\u2019re experiencing,\u201d said Roni Michaely, an economist at the University of Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s really about economic growth, economic inequality and consumer welfare.\u201dIn the past few decades, a profound shift has taken place in the distribution of corporate profits among American companies. In 1975, 109 companies collected half of the profits produced by all publicly traded companies. Today, those winnings are captured by just 30 companies, according to research by Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Ren\u00e9 M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University.On Tuesday, Apple reported the latest in a string of strong quarterly earnings, with its profit increasing to $11.52 billion, up nearly a third from the same period a year earlier. The report helped bolster the company\u2019s stock price; as of Thursday, Apple\u2019s shares were trading at $207.39.The difference between how much it costs American companies to make their products and how much they sell those products for \u2014 a metric of the power that companies possess in their markets \u2014 is at its highest level since at least 1950, according to a 2017 paper by two economists, Jan De Loecker of Princeton and Jan Eeckhout of University College London.More than three-quarters of all American industries have grown more concentrated since 1980, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the standard formula that antitrust regulators and others use to analyze proposed corporate mergers, according to a paper written by Professor Michaely, along with Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and Yelena Larkin of York University in Toronto.A consensus has formed among economists that the trend toward corporate concentration \u2014 in terms of the size of companies and their grasp on profits \u2014 is real and may be long-lasting. \u201cThe number of papers that are being written on this from week to week is remarkable,\u201d said David Autor, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor who has studied the phenomenon.The consolidation is especially pronounced in the technology sector, where a group of large, efficient companies now lord over the fastest-growing and most dynamic parts of the United States economy.When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, it quickly transformed the way society interacts with technology. More than 1.4 billion have been sold since.Apple and Google combined now provide the software for 99 percent of all smartphones. Facebook and Google take 59 cents of every dollar spent on online advertising in the United States. Amazon exerts utter dominance over online shopping and is getting bigger, fast, in areas like streaming of music and videos.But the trend is not confined to technology.Today, almost half of all the assets in the American financial system are controlled by five banks. In the late 1990s, the top five banks controlled a little more than one-fifth of the market. Over the past decade, six of the largest United States airlines merged into three. Four companies now control 98 percent of the American wireless market, and that number could fall to three if T-Mobile and Sprint are allowed to merge.Consolidation begets profits. \u201cWhoever is left is more profitable and can generate higher returns to investors,\u201d said Professor Larkin, who has studied the impact of corporate consolidation on financial markets.This year, five tech companies \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet \u2014 have delivered roughly half of the gains achieved by the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. Apple is the only company with a $1 trillion market value, but Amazon this year has been nipping at its heels. It is currently valued at more than $880 billion.Of course, this is good only as long as profits keep pouring in. If the tech companies\u2019 shares start to sputter, \u201cit\u2019s going to be tough for the rest of the market to keep things propped up,\u201d said Justin Walters, a co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, which researches the stock market.Economists disagree about cause and effect. Some say that companies like Apple, Amazon and Google spent lavishly to establish their dominant market positions, and can now make enormous profits without spending much, as a share of their income, on labor.Some on the left take the critique a step further, arguing that greater corporate power translates into weaker antitrust enforcement, looser limits on campaign contributions and declining rates of unionization, which collectively make it easier for big companies to tilt the economy in their favor. Companies, in this view, are not just reaping bigger profits than they were in the past, but they are also feeling less pressure to share the spoils with workers.Although companies tend to gain power as they grow, that does not make them invincible. They can simultaneously become more susceptible to crippling assaults from politicians and regulators. That is especially true at a time when populism has gained currency on both the left and the right.The same tech companies that are vacuuming up a greater share of corporate profits are also in the cross hairs of governments around the world.Apple\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly profit set the stage for its market value to top $1 trillion. But executives issued a cautionary note: The trade war with China \u2014 where Apple generates about 18 percent of its revenue \u2014 threatens the company\u2019s ability to keep raking in profits at its current clip.\u201cA year ago, the big tech companies were basically untouchable,\u201d said Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago who has studied government regulation and corporate behavior. \u201cToday, they seem not to be.\u201dBen Casselman and Jack Nicas contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The players and the tournaments can be sponsored by major corporations, and the battles are often streamed live online with commentary.\u201cIt\u2019s grown through a combination of expanded broadband, social networks, interesting games and personalities, more involvement from the publishers and also, increasingly, from sports and entertainment,\u201d said Christopher Vollmer, global advisory leader for entertainment and media at PwC, the accounting firm formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers.As the industry has grown, it has increasingly mirrored the legacy sports market, featuring slickly produced tournaments, high-value ticket sales, major corporate sponsors and extensive advertising.The e-sports audience is disproportionately young and male, Mr. Vollmer said, but that may change as e-sports gain popularity. As the audience diversifies, advertising and sponsorship opportunities will most likely grow, he said.Some of the most popular e-sports games include: League of Legends, a fantasy-inspired multiplayer battle game; Call of Duty, a series of military first-person shooting games; and Overwatch, a futuristic first-person shooter.Activision Blizzard, the publisher of Call of Duty and Overwatch, has a market capitalization of $54 billion. In 2016, the company acquired Major League Gaming, an organizer of e-sports competitions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barnes & Noble Says Former C.E.O. Demos Parneros Was Fired for Sexual Harassment", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Tuesday, the explanation came spilling out in a public exchange of accusations between Mr. Parneros and the company \u2014 including that Mr. Parneros had been fired in part because of claims of sexual harassment by an employee.The fight began when Mr. Parneros filed a lawsuit claiming defamation and breach of contract. He said that he had been fired without warning after a deal to sell the company fell through. Casting himself as a \u201cwell-respected retail executive,\u201d he claimed that the bookseller had enabled rumors that he was let go because of \u201cserious sexual misconduct.\u201dHe described Barnes & Noble as a \u201cfinancially troubled business\u201d that is in turmoil and disarray, with a \u201cvolatile\u201d chairman who \u201crefuses to relinquish control.\u201d He said he was owed severance of $4 million in cash, plus equity and damages.In response, Barnes & Noble\u2019s board said in a statement that Mr. Parneros had been \u201cterminated for sexual harassment, bullying behavior and other violations of company policies.\u201d Until Tuesday, the company had said only that he was terminated for violating policies, without further explanation except to say they were not related to financial matters.In his lawsuit, Mr. Parneros referenced the alleged misconduct, revealing details that Barnes & Noble had not disclosed.He played down his interactions with an executive assistant who had made an internal complaint against him as \u201csimply an innocuous, less than five-minute conversation about vacationing in Quebec.\u201d Another impetus for his firing, he said, was his purported mistreatment of Allen W. Lindstrom, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.Mr. Lindstrom is one of three executives sharing chief executive duties until Mr. Parneros\u2019 successor is found.In the filing, Mr. Parneros saved his harshest condemnation for Leonard Riggio, Barnes & Noble\u2019s chairman and largest shareholder, citing his \u201cerratic and unprofessional behavior.\u201dBarnes & Noble said in its statement that the allegations about Mr. Riggio \u201care replete with lies and mischaracterizations\u201d and an example of Mr. Parneros being \u201csomeone who, instead of accepting responsibility for blatantly inappropriate behavior, is lashing out against a former employer.\u201dIn the spring of 2017, Mr. Riggio brought Mr. Parneros on as the company\u2019s leader, the fourth non-interim chief executive in four years, to try to bolster the bookseller\u2019s flagging fortunes, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Parneros had worked for nearly three decades in various roles at the office supply chain Staples.Mr. Riggio, who bought the company in 1971 when it was an ailing Manhattan bookstore and turned it into a national fleet of superstores, had planned to retire in 2016. But he stepped in as acting chief executive after Barnes & Noble fired Ronald Boire, who had served as chief executive for less than a year.Publishers and investors have grown increasingly worried about the company\u2019s future. Some industry analysts argue that Mr. Riggio has been too heavy-handed in steering the company and lacks the vision to guide its recovery at a tumultuous moment.In his lawsuit, Mr. Parneros said that Mr. Riggio had said that \u201che had to run the company and could not be a spectator.\u201dThe allegations lobbed in the suit are likely to make it even more difficult for Barnes & Noble to recruit its next chief executive, at a moment when the company desperately needs stable leadership.Barnes & Noble\u2019s stock price has fallen 60 percent over the last three years, and the chain has struggled to reverse years of declining sales and foot traffic. In the last decade, the company has closed more than 150 stores, leaving it with a base of 633. It waged a losing battle with Amazon, losing more than a billion dollars on its Nook e-book business.Even as independent bookstores have bounced back and Amazon has expanded into brick-and-mortar retail, Barnes & Noble has still failed to recover ground.But Mr. Parneros said that he was lavished with praise by Mr. Riggio, the Barnes & Noble board, investors and publishers as he helped fill empty executive roles and introduce new store prototypes and sales categories.In November, the activist investor Sandell Asset Management offered to buy the chain, an overture that Barnes & Noble refused. In the spring, a book retailer made a bid, which Barnes & Noble also declined, according to Mr. Parneros.In June, after conducting due diligence, the book retailer withdrew its purchase offer, leaving Mr. Riggio \u201cextremely upset\u201d because he \u201cno longer had a graceful exit from the company,\u201d according to Mr. Parneros\u2019 lawsuit.At that point, Mr. Riggio \u201cturned against\u201d Mr. Parneros, stopped returning his calls and texts and fabricated reasons to remove him, according to the lawsuit. On July 2, Mr. Parneros was dismissed, without the millions of dollars in severance payments that his predecessors had received, he said.In a news release in July announcing his departure, Barnes & Noble said that Mr. Parneros had violated company policy, a move that he said the company knew would lead to speculation that he had engaged in sexual misconduct.Mr. Parneros said in his complaint that he had \u201calways conducted himself in a professional manner\u201d and that his reputation has been damaged. He was forced to resign from the board of KeyBank after more than four years as a member, and references to an honorary degree bestowed upon him by a Massachusetts college were removed from its website, he said.Barnes & Noble said in its statement on Tuesday that the board unanimously agreed to fire Mr. Parneros following an investigation that revealed \u201cmultiple examples of significant misconduct.\u201dIn his lawsuit, Mr. Parneros said he was called into Mr. Riggio\u2019s office weeks before his firing and told about complaints from an executive assistant.According to the lawsuit, the assistant had said that, during a conversation about her vacation to Canada, Mr. Parneros had characterized a hotel he had visited with his wife as the kind of place where \u201cyou would put out.\u201d Mr. Parneros said he disputed the claim, saying that he had described the hotel as charming and romantic.He also countered a complaint from the assistant that, during a conversation about which person was taller, he had stood back to back with her. He said that they had only stood side to side, with no inappropriate touching.Mr. Riggio had indicated that he did not consider the incidents to be too serious, according to the lawsuit. But Mr. Parneros said he wanted to apologize, and brought a company representative with him to meet with the assistant.According to the suit, all parties, including Mr. Riggio, agreed that the meeting went well, and the assistant said that she did not want to make a big deal out of the situation and did not want to transfer to a different position.Mr. Parneros also said that he had treated Mr. Lindstrom, the chief financial officer, \u201cappropriately\u201d given what he described as Mr. Lindstrom\u2019s poor performance. Mr. Lindstrom did not respond to a request for comment.According to Mr. Parneros\u2019s lawsuit, Mr. Riggio was disparaging toward Mr. Lindstrom, and created an \u201cabusive corporate culture\u201d that involved personal attacks focused on the mental health, appearance and other attributes of several employees.In its statement, Barnes & Noble said that Mr. Riggio is widely known\u201d for his \u201cimpeccable reputation and as an individual and leader that upholds the highest standards of integrity and decency.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "S.&P. Closes at a Record, as Profits Defy Turmoil", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor much of the year, the stock market has been on the ropes. Trade wars have erupted, the Federal Reserve raised rates, emerging market currencies collapsed, and major technology firms faced regulatory scrutiny \u2014 and, in the case of Amazon, presidential broadsides via messages on Twitter. Investors quailed at times, sending stocks down by as much as 10 percent.But the nine-year-old bull market never completely crumbled. By April, stocks had started a fresh climb. And after a 0.6 percent rise on Friday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed at a record high of 2,874.69 points, reflecting investor faith in a single fundamental fact: Big American companies are making lots of money.\u201cWe\u2019ve had record earnings growth, we\u2019ve had record numbers of earnings and sales beats,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, chief United States equity strategist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBasically the fundamentals couldn\u2019t look better.\u201dBecause owners of stock are entitled to a share of the money a company makes, corporate profits are a key ingredient of stock market rallies. And profits for companies in the S. &P. 500 were up roughly 25 percent in the second quarter, after a surge of 27 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.About 80 percent of companies reported results that were better than Wall Street analysts expected. (In a typical quarter, some 64 percent of companies outperform the analysts\u2019 predictions.) This year\u2019s crop of quarterly earnings has been the best since 2010, when the American economy was just emerging from the recession that ended the previous year, making big leaps in annual profit growth much easier.The current rosy profit picture shouldn\u2019t be surprising. The Trump administration\u2019s deep tax cuts that went into effect in January reduced corporate tax expenses sharply and raised profitability almost automatically. But other metrics \u2014 such as sales growing at an annual rate of more than 9 percent in the second quarter \u2014 suggest that corporate America is riding a robust American economy. The unemployment rate is near 18-year lows. Gross domestic product expanded by 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s a 3-percent-plus growth world, and that\u2019s because the fundamentals underlying consumer spending, underlying business spending, underlying our manufacturing sector are in superb shape,\u201d said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics, a consulting firm.Since the bulk of companies began reporting their quarterly results in July, that upward economic pressure has erupted in gushers of profits, especially at some of the giant technology-centered firms that have been hugely influential in determining how the stock markets move.Amazon reported a $2.53 billion quarterly profit, its largest ever. Microsoft notched $8.87 billion in earnings, beating estimates. Apple\u2019s quarterly profit jumped 32 percent to $11.52 billion, beating Wall Street expectations and pushing the company\u2019s market value above $1 trillion, a milestone that no American company had ever reached before.The earnings boom has also reached far beyond tech. Earnings at financial firms jumped more than 27 percent. Quarterly profits at industrial companies rose 20 percent.Even the retail sector, which has been squeezed by online competition and soft prices in recent years, is enjoying a respite. Home Depot raised earnings and sales targets for the year. Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings, including a 40 percent rise in online sales in the United States. And Target said quarterly sales at stores it had previously opened rose at the fastest pace in 13 years, sending its stock to a record high.There could be more market gains to come. From the bargain hunter\u2019s perspective, the combination of blockbuster profits and a prolonged stock market soft patch for much of the year, means that stocks \u2014 compared to their earnings \u2014 are significantly cheaper than they were earlier this year.A key valuation measure, the price of the S. & P. 500 index compared with analyst estimates for corporate earnings over the next 12 months, has fallen this year. Some observers see that as a positive sign, indicating that the rising market over the last few months has been fueled by solid earnings growth, rather than wild optimism by stock market investors.On the other hand, the stock market is by no means dirt cheap, as it was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. And there are plenty of risks that could still derail the recent rally, from disorderly decline of some emerging markets, such as Turkey, to the continuing fallout from trade tensions between the United States and other large economies.\u201cThe big talk on the street is obviously trade and China,\u201d said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of United States equity strategy at J. P. Morgan Securities.On the other hand, Mr. Lakos-Bujas thinks that a resolution of the trade fight between the world\u2019s two largest economies, could generate a pop in the stock market, by removing a risky overhang clouding an otherwise bright picture. The American economy, he says, is in something of a sweet spot, with strong growth, low unemployment, low inflation and high corporate profits.\u201cIn this kind of environment, generally, risk assets such as equities, they tend to do well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Sales are falling. The Nook, Barnes & Noble\u2019s attempt at selling electronic books, became a financial drain. Critics say the company lacks direction, sometimes seeming to prioritize sales of gifts and tchotchkes over books. For investors, the impact is already evident: Barnes & Noble\u2019s stock price is down 60 percent over the last three years.Publishers are worried that a crucial pipeline for book sales could be crumbling.\u201cIt would be disastrous if they go down,\u201d said Dennis Johnson, a co-publisher of Melville House, an independent press. \u201cIf 600 bookstores disappear from the country, there will be that many fewer visible books, which seem to be receding from their place in the culture.\u201dMr. Riggio, 77, the company\u2019s chairman, disputed the notion that Barnes & Noble is mired in a leadership crisis. After all, he said during an interview at the company\u2019s headquarters on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue, he has always been there.And he has a plan to turn things around.\u201cI have a big stake in the business, I founded it and I\u2019ve been here forever, so I think there\u2019s a lot of stability that comes with that,\u201d said Mr. Riggio. \u201cIf we\u2019re without a leader, I\u2019m it.\u201dMr. Riggio built Barnes & Noble from a single Manhattan bookstore into a national fleet of superstores, many with more than 100,000 titles, transforming the business of selling books from a genteel and fusty profession into a mass-market moneymaker. The company boasts that it has sold 6.7 billion books since going public 24 years ago.But the factors that buoyed the chain\u2019s expansion \u2014 the growth of malls and shopping centers and big box stores that sell everything \u2014 have reversed, with the rise of Amazon and other online retail leading to dwindling foot traffic and sales. At the same time, after decades of declines, independent bookstores have been resurgent, aided by an increased interest in localization and curated experience. Even Amazon is expanding into brick-and-mortar bookstores, with more than a dozen stores across the country and more in the works.The American Booksellers Association counted 2,470 independent store locations in 2018, up from 1,651 in 2009, and sales at its member stores were up 5 percent so far this year over last. Sales of printed hardcover books grew nearly 11 percent from 2013 to 2017, while those of paperbacks rose 17 percent, according to the Association of American Publishers.\u201cThe indies decided that rather than trying to compete on price and inventory, we\u2019re going to provide our customers with a curated experience that\u2019s hypersensitive to the customers in that community,\u201d said Ryan Raffaelli, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who has studied why independent bookstores are rebounding in spite of Amazon. \u201cBarnes & Noble has struggled to figure out where they fit in the larger ecosystem, given that that continuum continues to spread further and further apart.\u201dTo adapt, Mr. Riggio said that Barnes & Noble would close big, underperforming stores and open smaller ones in more highly trafficked areas. In the last decade, the chain has closed more than 150 stores and now operates 633.\u201cWe have to move back to where the action is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to follow the population.\u201dBut he disagrees with another diagnosis of the problem: that he\u2019s a micromanager who doesn\u2019t give his chief executives room to operate. People who have worked closely with him described him as self-assured to a fault.\u201cAnyone who joins there knows that the chairman is very hands on,\u201d said John Tinker, an analyst at Gabelli & Company.He disputed the idea that he doesn\u2019t give his chief executives room to operate.\u201cI don\u2019t micromanage anything,\u201d he said.Some in the publishing industry see potential for Barnes & Noble to solve its problems. They point to successful large chains in other countries, like Waterstones in Britain and Indigo in Canada, as potential models for how Barnes & Noble might turn itself around. Rather than a chain of homogeneous locations, Waterstones now operates more like a constellation of independent stores, said James Daunt, the company\u2019s managing director, who took over in 2011. The individual stores vary widely in terms of size and title selection, and local booksellers are encouraged to tailor their stores to the surrounding community.Indigo, which is expanding into the United States, has alternatively positioned itself as \u201ca book lover\u2019s cultural department store,\u201d with a cafe, toys, music and lifestyle products.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of low-lying fruit out there that they can harvest,\u201d said Richard Schottenfeld, an investment fund manager who has acquired a 5.7 percent stake in Barnes & Noble and has met with Mr. Riggio and company executives to discuss operational strategy. He pointed to the company\u2019s \u201cbadly designed\u201d website, the \u201clong overdue\u201d debut of book clubs this spring and the company\u2019s \u201cout of whack\u201d operating costs.Mr. Riggio should focus less on where to close and open stores and more on how to convert browsing visitors into paying customers, Mr. Schottenfeld said.\u201cIt\u2019s not as much about the ideas as it is the execution of those plans \u2014 the company is mismanaging the opportunities in front of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems like you can get more dollars out of people if you just figure out what they want to buy from you.\u201dSome publishing executives privately express hope that Barnes & Noble will be sold, perhaps to Indigo. Mr. Riggio didn\u2019t rule out the idea of a sale, although he said he didn\u2019t think \u201cthis is the time to sell the company.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be responsive to our shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe always have to entertain offers that come along.\u201dFor now, though, it is up to Mr. Riggio to lead the company. His supporters say he\u2019s up to it, having proven himself adept at understanding retail trends.\u201cI would not count Len out, ever,\u201d said Michael P. Huseby, a former chief executive at Barnes & Noble who now heads Barnes & Noble Education, a separate company. He said that Mr. Riggio has a \u201chistory of innovation and adapting and setting a vision.\u201dMr. Riggio said he still hopes to retire someday. In the meantime, he has about \u201c5,000\u201d ideas for how to lure customers back to Barnes & Noble.\u201cI want more people to buy and read books,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the time frame when the number of independent bookstores fell 43 percent. It was between 1995 and 2009, not between 1995 and 2000.Advertisement"}

The deals are so large, start-ups can now can ask themselves: I.P.O. or SoftBank?That firepower is why SoftBank\u2019s name tends to strike fear, envy and longing into the hearts of investors and start-up chief executives. Some investors accuse the Vision Fund of distorting the funding market by inflating start-up valuations. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank\u2019s C.E.O., has been called a \u201cone-man bubble maker.\u201d Some founders are desperate to get access to the company\u2019s Scrooge McDuck pool of money. But others charge that the fund, which invests a minimum of $100 million per deal, is pushing companies to take on capital they may not want or need out of fear. (Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s C.E.O., once said he did a deal with the firm because he\u2019d rather have SoftBank\u2019s \u201ccapital cannon\u201d behind him, rather than pointed at him.)This week SoftBank positioned its capital cannon behind Brandless, sending $240 million to the e-commerce start-up, which sells a variety of organic and \u201cclean\u201d household consumables for $3 each. Brandless started selling products just one year ago, and is notable because it is taking on Amazon and Whole Foods, among others.But SoftBank and Brandless will be using Amazon\u2019s own playbook against it.

From Mr. Icahn\u2019s letter:With their 100 million prime members, Amazon has become one of the toughest competitors in history (feel free to ask the retail industry), while their ultimate health care plans are not revealed yet, it is almost certain the first step of a much larger play in the pharma distribution space. Make no mistake, Express Scripts is no Apple and breaking into the PBM ecosystem is not that difficult for a company that already has the systems, the network and the scale that Amazon does. Knowing this, it is absurd for Cigna to now walk into the minefield that Express Scripts might well become.In his letter, though, Mr. Icahn argued that the best course of action might be no deal at all. Cigna could form a business partnership with Express Scripts to get into the pharmacy benefit management business without spending billions, Mr. Icahn said.

{"Headline": "An Airline Scans Your Face. You Take Off. But Few Rules Govern Where Your Data Goes.", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The program makes boarding an international flight a breeze: Passengers step up to the gate, get their photo taken and proceed onto the plane. There is no paper ticket or airline app. Thanks to facial recognition technology, their face becomes their boarding pass.\u201cI would find it superconvenient if I could use my face at the gate,\u201d said Jonathan Frankle, an artificial intelligence researcher at M.I.T. studying facial recognition technology. But \u201cthe concern is, what else could that data be used for?\u201dAnd even though the program is run by the Department of Homeland Security, federal officials say they have placed no limits on how participating companies \u2014 mostly airlines but also cruise lines \u2014 can use that data or store it, opening up travelers\u2019 most personal information to potential misuse and abuse such as being sold or used to track passengers\u2019 whereabouts.The data the airlines collect is used to verify the identity of passengers leaving the country, an attempt by the department to better track foreigners who overstay their visas. After passengers\u2019 faces are scanned at the gate, the scan is sent to Customs and Border Protection and linked with other personally identifying data, such as date of birth and passport and flight information.For its part, Customs and Border Protection has said it will retain facial scans of American citizens for no longer than 14 days. But the agency has said it cannot control how the companies use the data because they \u201care not collecting photographs on C.B.P.\u2019s behalf.\u201dJohn Wagner, the deputy executive assistant commissioner for the agency\u2019s Office of Field Operations, said he believed that commercial carriers had \u201cno interest in keeping or retaining\u201d the biometric data they collect, and the airlines have said they are not doing so. But if they did, he said, \u201cthat would really be up to them.\u201dBut, Mr. Wagner added, \u201cthere are still some discussions to be had,\u201d and federal officials are considering whether they should write in protections.Privacy advocates have criticized the agency for allowing airlines to act as unregulated arbiters of the data.\u201cC.B.P. is a federal agency. It has a responsibility to protect Americans\u2019 data, and by encouraging airlines to collect this data, instead they are essentially abdicating their own responsibility,\u201d said Jennifer Lynch, a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit.\u201cAre there privacy protections in the contracts that D.H.S. has reached with the airlines?\u201d Mr. Rudolph said in an interview. \u201cDo they require the disposal of any data collected? Do they require audits? Are there use limitations to ensure that travelers\u2019 photos aren\u2019t used in ways they don\u2019t expect? Without any enforceable rules, it\u2019s too easy for D.H.S. to break those promises.\u201dMr. Wagner, however, defended the program and said it \u201cbuilds upon the processes that have taken place for many years.\u201d\u201cAirlines are already collecting a lot of information from a traveler and providing that to C.B.P.: the reservation data, the manifest,\u201d he said.But biometric data, including scans of passengers\u2019 faces and fingerprints, is among the most sensitive, according to privacy experts, because unlike other means of identification such as a Social Security number, it cannot be changed.The face is a particularly sensitive identifier because \u201cif someone has a camera, they can identify you by your face,\u201d Mr. Frankle said. \u201cYou can be recognized even if you have no idea you\u2019re being recognized.\u201dThe program, which currently operates through four major airlines in international airports in Los Angeles, Detroit, Orlando and Atlanta, is not mandatory for passengers. But the airlines \u2014 Delta, Lufthansa, British Airways and JetBlue \u2014 have reported that a majority of passengers participate.It comes as facial recognition technology has become both more widespread and more closely scrutinized.Companies such as Apple and Citibank have leveraged the technology, and still more \u2014 including casinos, music festival organizers and retailers like Walmart \u2014 have used it to track customers and shoplifters.Amazon has recently drawn condemnation for providing facial recognition software to law enforcement agencies, whose use of the technology has caused privacy and civil liberties groups to voice concerns about overzealous surveillance.Questions about the technology\u2019s accuracy have also arisen. According to the Georgetown report, federal data shows that the system used by Customs and Border Protection incorrectly rejects as many as one in 25 travelers using valid credentials. It also cited studies that showed that facial recognition algorithms fail more frequently in correctly identifying women and people of color. The department said it does not track how many people using forged credentials manage to get through the system.A privacy report by Customs and Border Protection published in June 2017 when the program began said federal officials would conduct a privacy evaluation within one year to ensure that airlines were complying with \u201crequired privacy protections.\u201d An agency spokeswoman, Jennifer Gabris, said last month that the evaluation had not been completed because the program had not achieved \u201cinterim operating capability.\u201dMs. Gabris did not respond to inquiries asking what privacy protections are required of participating companies; representatives for participating airlines also declined to respond to similar inquiries.The companies have since been left to come up with their own policies that contain varying degrees of privacy assurances. In statements, the airlines stressed that the program was being tested in limited trials.But while they provide passengers with generalized privacy policies, only one, JetBlue, specifically outlines how it will protect customers\u2019 biometric data, an update made after inquiries from The New York Times.Further complicating the situation is the fact that the companies share passengers\u2019 data with the technology vendors they have contracted to create the infrastructure that collects the information and sends it to federal officials. Those vendors \u2014 Vision-Box, SITA and NEC Corporation \u2014 each have their own privacy policies with differing levels of accessibility.\u201cThis is not something that is hard to get right if your hands are clean, which only invites suspicion if you don\u2019t get it right,\u201d Mr. Frankle said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a place where you\u2019re innocent until proven guilty. We should be skeptical until they assure us they\u2019re not going to use this data for anything other than convenience in ways that are legally binding.\u201dDespite the privacy concerns, the Traveler Verification Service shows signs of expanding.The airlines say they hope to introduce the program within the next year to at least another half-dozen airports, and federal officials updated privacy documents last month to allow for cruise lines to participate in the program.Two senators, Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, have urged the Department of Homeland Security to stop the expansion of the larger effort until their privacy concerns are addressed.Advertisement"}

On the whole, it\u2019s a surprisingly O.K. addition to the genre. Directed by David M. Rosenthal from a script by Brooks McLaren, it begins the way several apocalyptic movies used to end \u2014 with the discovery of a pregnancy.A young lawyer, Will (Theo James, whom I last saw as a charming robot in the sci-fi romance \u201cZoe,\u201d now streaming on Amazon Prime), and his fianc\u00e9e, Samantha, who both live in Seattle, find out that they\u2019re expecting right before Will is set to meet with his future father-in-law, Tom (Forest Whitaker). Tom lives in Chicago and sure wishes his daughter still lived there, too. A decorated military man, now retired, he has a forceful way of making his opinions known to Will. Their Chicago dinner does not go well, despite the intervention of Tom\u2019s wife, Paula (Nicole Ari Parker).The next day, while Will is recounting the dinner to Samantha over FaceTime, there\u2019s a huge noise in Seattle. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d she says, and the line goes dead. Soon, flights are canceled, power grids are down, and nobody knows what\u2019s going on. Her father decides to pack up the Cadillac S.U.V. and head West, and Will can come with him or not.As it happens, down the long road they must travel, the prevailing rule is survival of the most heavily armed. They pick up a female Native American auto mechanic along the way, but her survival smarts, and her ethics, run up against the increasing atavism they encounter. For Tom and Will, it\u2019s simple: They have to get to Samantha, despite not knowing whether or not she\u2019s alive. Along the way, Will picks up more than a little of Tom\u2019s ruthlessness as they move forward, never piecing together whether what\u2019s happening was caused by an act of war, a seismic event or something else. It\u2019s during the middle section of endless dark roads and run-ins with gas pirates that the movie builds a most convincing sense of dread.The opposing factions are male dominated in the worst ways. There\u2019s a gang rape, and at a crucial point one of the young men in Custance\u2019s party announces that he\u2019s making the older man\u2019s daughter his consort (that is, sex slave), and that Custance can either accept it or take a bullet. And there\u2019s not a single pretty frame in the movie. It\u2019s unfortunately very convincing. I doubt that in real life, when the party\u2019s over, anyone surviving will have much opportunity to enjoy a view.That\u2019s the thing with futuristic movies: They seem to never be pleasant. \u201cAnon,\u201d a Netflix Original that had its premiere just before the start of the summer, depicts a future in which you see the world, literally, via the intervention of the internet. That is, we humans walk around with an embedded eyepiece that not only records all we do, but also displays giant ads in front of buildings, lets us see how a watch in a shop\u2019s window looks on our wrists, lets us instantly buy that watch if we like it, and more and more and more.

{"Headline": "One Tesla Investor Wants It to Stay Public", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk has insisted that taking Tesla private would allow the company to achieve its potential.On Thursday, one Tesla investor took issue with Mr. Musk\u2019s argument.Ms. Wood \u2014 whose firm owned a roughly 0.26 percent stake in Tesla as of June 30, according to public filings \u2014 argued in her letter that the public markets would better support Tesla\u2019s growth over the long term.From her letter:\u201cIf you do not take Tesla private, you will be surprised and gratified at investor reaction once they realize and understand the scope and ramifications of your long-term vision and strategies. With time, I believe that truth always wins out in the public markets, as has been the case for Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Salesforce, and other companies with visionary leaders.\u201dMs. Wood said that over time, Tesla would become less of a hardware company and more of what she called a \u201cmobility as a service\u201d provider. That includes providing autonomous cars and trucks on demand, similar to what Uber and other companies are racing toward. By her firm\u2019s calculations, that could lift Tesla\u2019s gross margins from 19 percent to 80 percent.But that kind of transformation would be more difficult to do as a private company, she wrote, given how much harder it would be for Tesla to tap public markets for financing.ARK\u2019s hyper-bullish valuation rests on a surge in Tesla\u2019s revenue to more than $180 billion over the next five years from $13 billion. Of course, Tesla has attracted plenty of investors with starkly different views of its prospects. They point to the company\u2019s production delays, cash burn and increasing competition to explain their bets against the stock.ARK expressed an interest in staying invested in Tesla if Mr. Musk succeeded, Ms. Wood said in a statement. Doing so might require revamping the rules of ARK\u2019s mutual funds that are invested in the company, and its exchange-traded funds would have to sell their holdings.If Mr. Musk keeps Tesla public, her firm\u2019s forecast for what the company\u2019s shares could be worth: between $700 and $4,000 in five years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On Hunt for Content, AT&T Closes Deal for Chernin\u2019s Otter Media", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Jesse Jacobs, president of the Chernin Group, felt defeated.\u201cIt was like Lucy pulling up the football from Charlie Brown at the last second,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said.Mr. Chernin predicted that AT&T would accelerate Otter\u2019s growth by combining it with its new entertainment empire. In June, AT&T completed its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner, which includes HBO, Warner Bros. and the Turner cable networks.\u201cThey look at Otter as strategically key to several things they are trying to do, including serving customers with every type of content delivered through every possible distribution channel,\u201d Mr. Chernin said of AT&T, which has been a minority investor in Otter since its founding in April 2014.Tony Goncalves, Otter\u2019s chief executive, declined to say whether Otter was profitable. But he did give a hint about what AT&T has planned.\u201cYou\u2019ll see a good amount of cross pollination, where some of that really wonderful Warner intellectual property and content will find its way into the businesses that are part of the Otter portfolio today,\u201d said Mr. Goncalves, who was previously a senior AT&T executive overseeing digital initiatives, including the introduction of DirecTV Now, a streaming offering.AT&T, with its vast data on cellphone and broadband subscribers, plans to tailor ads on the Turner networks, which include CNN and TNT, based on who is watching. Otter will give AT&T more digital advertising inventory to sell the same way.But the Chernin Group had a theory. \u201cWith every new wave of technology, great new brands emerge, and we wanted to own those brands,\u201d Mr. Jacobs said. \u201cThey certainly weren\u2019t going to be incubated inside the large media companies,\u201d where they would have to compete for resources.Mr. Chernin declined to comment on the speculation. He said, however, \u201cI think we will continue to do a version of what we do, which is make movies and television shows, and we will look to continue to invest in consumer technology brands.\u201dAbout six years remain on that deal, Mr. Chernin said. Asked what would happen when Disney completes its $71.3 billion acquisition of the studio, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to be a proud member of the Disney family.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the Chernin Group\u2019s interest in Headspace, a company that sells meditation via an app. Chernin owns a minority stake in Headspace, not full control.Advertisement"}

The products were purchased nationwide at a variety of businesses, including box stores, dollar stores, pharmacies, arts and crafts stores, and online.The group, which has been surveying toys for more than three decades, recommended that the companies that make or offer the products stop selling them and start notifying consumers about the chemicals they appear to contain.It also called on policymakers to continue to support the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a federal agency, and urged the commission itself to test more school supplies for dangerous chemicals.Here\u2019s a look at what the public interest group found:Of the crayons tested, one, a green Playskool crayon, tested positive for trace amounts of tremolite, a form of asbestos. The crayon was part of a set of 36 manufactured by Leap Year Publishing and purchased at a Dollar Tree store.Julie Duffy, a spokeswoman for Hasbro, which owns the Playskool brand, said that \u201cproduct and children\u2019s safety are top priorities\u201d for the company.\u201cWe are conducting a thorough investigation into these claims, including working with Leap Year, the licensee of the product,\u201d she said in a statement.In an email, John Sorenson, a spokesman for Leap Year Publishing, said that all of its products, including the green crayon mentioned in the report, \u201care thoroughly tested by independent labs\u201d to meet or exceed federal standards.\u201cWe are currently re-verifying that they are safe and free of any asbestos, as well as requesting a review of P.I.R.G.\u2019s testing methods,\u201d he said.In a statement, Dollar Tree said it was aware of the report and had \u201csince reverified that each of the listed products successfully passed inspection and testing.\u201dCrayons sold under five other brands \u2014 Crayola, Up & Up, Cra-Z-Art, Disney Junior Mickey and the Roadster Racers, and RoseArt \u2014 tested negative for asbestos.Four markers were sent to the laboratory, and two dry-erase ones tested positive for a group of compounds often found in petroleum products and known as B.T.E.X.: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene.One of those compounds, benzene, is a known carcinogen and was found in a package of six magnetic markers purchased on Amazon and produced by The Board Dudes, a brand owned by Mattel.In a statement, Mattel said it took such reports seriously, \u201caggressively\u201d tests its products and was reviewing the claims. The markers, the statement added, \u201ccontain substance levels that fall within the permissible limits.\u201dAn Expo dry-erase scented marker, also purchased on Amazon, tested positive for some of the B.T.E.X. compounds, though not benzene and none at levels considered worrying by toxicologists, according to the report.In a statement, Expo said that it was aware of the report and that its products \u201cmeet all applicable regulatory and safety standards.\u201dWashable markers, from Crayola and Jot, tested negative.Only one, a Jot-brand, 1-inch blue binder from Dollar Tree, tested positive.

Trump designated Mnuchin to be the point person, which, according to multiple sources, was fine with Chinese officials, who preferred dealing with the moderate Treasury secretary. But in May, when Mnuchin traveled to Beijing for negotiations, Trump also dispatched Ross, Lighthizer, Navarro, and Kudlow to accompany him. (A Treasury spokesman says Mnuchin asked Ross and Lighthizer to join.) Predictably, there were tensions within the U.S. delegation. A White House official says Mnuchin and Navarro argued repeatedly, including in rooms where the Chinese could hear them.But Mr. Mnuchin keeps his head down, and avoids publicizing his disagreements with President Trump.\u201cSometimes he\u2019ll agree with me, and sometimes he won\u2019t agree with me,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin told the magazine. \u201cHe\u2019s the president of the United States.

{"Headline": "India Pushes Back Against Tech \u2018Colonization\u2019 by Internet Giants", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 In India, American companies dominate the internet. Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp is the most popular app on phones. Virtually every smartphone runs on Google\u2019s Android system. YouTube is the favorite video platform and Amazon is the No. 2 online retailer.For some Indian political leaders, it is as if their nation \u2014 which was ruled by Britain for a century until 1947 \u2014 is being conquered by colonial powers all over again.And they are determined to stop it.\u201cAs a country, we have to all grow up and say that, you know, enough of this,\u201d Vinit Goenka, a railways official who works on technology policy for India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a conference last week.In recent months, regulators and ministers across India\u2019s government have declared their intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. Collectively, the regulations would end the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which is the world\u2019s fastest-growing market for new internet users.The proposals include European-style limits on what big internet companies can do with users\u2019 personal data, a requirement that tech firms store certain sensitive data about Indians only within the country, and restrictions on the ability of foreign-owned e-commerce companies to undercut local businesses on price.Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at TechLegis in New Delhi, said India was trying to establish strong data protections for its citizens, as Europe did, while giving the government the right to obtain private information as it sees fit, much as China does. Foreign tech companies will have little choice but to go along.\u201cEveryone is going to fall in line and do what is necessary,\u201d Mr. Waris said. \u201cThese companies have to do it in China and Europe, and they will do it here.\u201dIndia\u2019s new policies are still a work in progress, with competing government agencies jousting with foreign and domestic lobbyists and policy advocates to shape them.But new restrictions are definitely coming, said officials and industry executives involved in the process. The country\u2019s Supreme Court declared last summer that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy and pushed Parliament to pass a data privacy law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his B.J.P. party have embraced an India-first economic nationalism to address weak job growth ahead of elections next year. Law enforcement authorities are also demanding more legal tools to extract private customer data from WhatsApp, Facebook and financial firms.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to build walls, but at the same time, we explicitly recognize and appreciate that data is a strategic asset,\u201d said Aruna Sundararajan, the nation\u2019s secretary of telecommunications, who has been deeply involved in the policy discussions. \u201cThere is a strong feeling in many quarters that the reason that India has not been able to develop a Tencent or Baidu or Alibaba is because we have not been nuanced in our policies.\u201dThe Indian government, which sees data as vital to a whole new generation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, appears particularly determined to reel in Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.WhatsApp has refused, saying that building such technology would break the encryption that keeps messages private. The government, for its part, is holding up a new Indian payments service from WhatsApp until it complies with local laws, including a new rule that requires financial data to be stored only in India.More broadly, the Indian government says it wants to ensure that Indian and foreign companies have to follow the same rules on taxes, data storage, security, pricing and cooperation with law enforcement.For example, Indian travel agencies complain that current tax laws allow foreign services such as Booking.com to avoid collecting hotel taxes, which can run as high as 28 percent of the room price. The disparity, they say, gives foreign firms a price advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about protectionism. It\u2019s about saying if 10 laws apply to me, the 10 laws should also apply to someone else operating in India,\u201d said Rameesh Kailasam, chief executive of IndiaTech.org, a newly formed lobbying group that represents local investors and start-ups, including MakeMyTrip and the ride-hailing company Ola.In a statement, Booking.com said it made a \u201cfull effort\u201d to comply with Indian tax laws.The big American technology companies are trying to fend off or dilute the regulations behind closed doors. Many consider the topic so sensitive that they refused to discuss it on the record.They also warned that India has fewer legal protections than the United States against government searches and data requests, so private data stored in the country could more easily end up in the hands of the police.The issue may become a topic in trade and economic discussions between the United States and Indian governments scheduled for the fall.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a policy group whose board includes top executives at Cisco, Adobe, and Mastercard, said that India risked hurting its own economy by imposing stringent rules on foreign tech companies.

{"Headline": "Marie Kondo, in Reverse: How to Fill a Space", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byrentersWhen her roommate moved out and took all the furniture, a Brooklynite had to furnish an entire apartment. She decided to do it slowly and deliberately. When Jessica Lauretti moved into her two-bedroom in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, five and a half years ago, it marked the end of nearly a decade of kinetic, and at times chaotic, living. She had been sharing a lively four-bedroom apartment on Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg \u2014 the kind of place where friends were always hanging out, forever stopping by on their way to and from things.Ms. Lauretti was constantly in and out as well, touring in an indie folk band with her brother and spending months at a time living out of a weekender bag. During lulls in the touring schedule, she would pick up freelance film and media work, which, because of her erratic schedule, never blossomed into a real career. \u201cI felt like I was doing too much,\u201d said Ms. Lauretti, who is now 37. \u201cI decided it was time to take a break from the band and focus on my life and home.\u201dA broker took Ms. Lauretti and a friend to an apartment in a two-family building on a tree-lined Greenpoint street, and she knew she had found the setting for a calmer next chapter.\u201cWhen we walked in, we just had that feeling of \u2018ahhh\u2019 \u2014 it felt very quiet and peaceful,\u201d Ms. Lauretti said. Leaves rustled at the windows, huge skylights illuminated the living room and they could hear birds chirping outside. The rent, split evenly, was $2,300 a month. And her roommate, who had been living in a one-bedroom, supplied all the furniture and housewares.\u201cEverything else we\u2019d seen was dirty and old or new construction \u2014 really generic and cookie-cutter,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was like a gift from the real estate gods.\u201dBut when her roommate moved out a year later, Ms. Lauretti was left with little more than the weekender bag she had moved in with. And while she might have spent a few weeks tacking between Ikea and various Craigslist listings to fill up the space, that seemed at odds with her desire for more deliberate living. The other easy solution \u2014 finding a roommate with a moving truck\u2019s worth of belongings \u2014 did not appeal either. She already had designs on inhabiting the entire apartment herself someday and didn\u2019t want a roommate who would put down roots along with her furniture. Instead, Ms. Lauretti decided, she would buy one item at a time, as she figured out what she liked \u2014 a process she thought of as \u201creverse Marie Kondo.\u201d Rather than winnowing away her belongings, she would slowly acquire things she loved. $2,300 | Greenpoint, BrooklynThis strategy meant that the apartment felt quite empty for a while. \u201cI would panic and freak out and be like, \u2018I just need to go and buy a bunch of stuff to fill the space!\u2019 But then I would relax and remind myself that I didn\u2019t \u2018need\u2019 anything,\u201d she said. Having never given it much thought, however, she didn\u2019t know what styles she liked. All she knew was that she wanted to preserve the airy, light, breezy character of the apartment. Eventually she decided that a midcentury-modern aesthetic \u2014 furniture on legs, clean lines \u2014 would work best for her purposes. To keep the space from feeling too cold or sterile, she sought out mixed materials and varied textures in neutral tones, which \u201cadds a lot of depth without adding weight,\u201d she said. Using those guiding principles, Ms. Lauretti gradually acquired furniture and housewares, mixing new, vintage and custom pieces. Some were inexpensive \u2014 Ikea mirrors, a glass lamp from Target, a yoga blanket she ordered on Amazon and dip-dyed in indigo to hang over the back of the sofa \u2014 and some quite costly, like the table she hired a friend to make. A few were concessions, like the pair of white Crate & Barrel mugs she bought so she could drink coffee while hunting for better ones.Over time, design became a hobby (she would comb through Etsy for prints and art while watching movies), and as her work life became more hectic, she was glad of the relaxation it provided. A friend brought her on at his creative content studio after it was acquired by a subsidiary of Verizon, and soon she was traveling frequently for work. Souvenirs from her travels \u2014 books, art, Scandinavian blankets from a trip to Iceland \u2014 started to fill her home, along with paintings and prints made by friends.A few years ago, when her last roommate left, she realized that she could afford the rent, which had never gone up, on her own. She turned the second bedroom into an office and felt grateful to have such a peaceful home base for a life that was once again feeling somewhat frenetic. After four and a half years, Ms. Lauretti now considers her home project nearly finished, save for a few odds and ends. \u201cThe apartment feels like it really represents me. It\u2019s like a canon; it\u2019s complete,\u201d she said.  She could easily see the next phase of her life playing out there, too. It would be an ideal apartment for a couple, she mused, provided future boyfriends arrived with only a suitcase, as she once had. And Greenpoint would be a lovely place to raise a child. At the same time, she recently took a leave from her job to write a book on young women and leadership and, freed from the obligations of an office, sometimes fantasizes about moving somewhere else: maybe Los Angeles or Paris, maybe Montana or New Mexico.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think, what do I want my life to be like?\u201d Ms. Lauretti said, describing the appeal of different lifestyles and the divergent paths each place might offer. But starting something new or shifting lifestyles doesn\u2019t necessarily require leaving New York, she added, or the apartment she has spent a number of years setting up just as she likes.  \u201cWhat\u2019s so great about New York is that you can always reinvent yourself here,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Trump Accuses Google of Burying Conservative News in Search Results", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, in a series of early morning Twitter posts on Tuesday, attacked Google for what he claimed was an effort to intentionally suppress conservative news outlets supportive of his administration.Mr. Trump added that \u201cthey are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!\u201dLarry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council and a longtime advocate of deregulation, appeared to back Mr. Trump when asked by reporters later on Tuesday whether the administration would be pursuing more regulation of Google. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking a look at it.\u201dIn a statement, Google said that its search service was \u201cnot used to set a political agenda and we don\u2019t bias our results toward any political ideology.\u201dThe president\u2019s tweets landed at a difficult moment for the tech industry. There is a growing sense across the political spectrum in the United States and in other countries that something must be done to rein in their influence.Google has also been called to testify. Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and the chairman of the Senate committee, has asked Google to send Sundar Pichai, its chief executive. So far, the company has offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global affairs.Mr. Burr said he was unlikely to subpoena Mr. Pichai to testify, but that his absence would signal that Google was choosing \u201cnot to participate\u201d and be \u201cpart of the solution.\u201dInterfering in how companies like Google and Facebook present information would be a notable departure for the federal government, which has mostly taken a hands-off approach to the internet. Free-speech scholars said companies like Google and Facebook were free to operate with few restrictions thanks to a 1996 law called the Telecommunications Act.\u201cThat law pretty much removes free-speech liability for Google and Facebook,\u201d said Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at the Newhouse School. \u201cThat being said, I think it\u2019d be a major leap to believe that the people behind Google are writing algorithms to discriminate against content.\u201dWhat sort of pressure regulators in the United States could exert is not entirely clear.The Justice Department, under both the Trump and Obama administrations, has shown little interest in pursuing antitrust cases against Google or its parent company, Alphabet. Mr. Trump has often raised antitrust questions about another tech giant, Amazon, but little has come of his threats.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has suggested that if internet companies are not a \u201cneutral platform,\u201d they should not be protected by a law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives companies broad legal immunity for what people put on their services.Appearing in front of reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Trump offered a vague expansion of his earlier criticism, saying that social news platforms were actively \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of people. \u201cWe have tremendous, we have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in. And you just can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of bias appeared to be inspired by a segment Monday night from Lou Dobbs, a host on the Fox Business Network. Mr. Dobbs highlighted an article by a conservative website, PJ Media, that said that it had conducted what it called an unscientific study in which 96 percent of Google search results for the word \u201cTrump\u201d were articles from \u201cleft-leaning sites.\u201dThe piece was also featured on the website Drudge Report, whose operator, Matt Drudge, was an early supporter of Mr. Trump.Search engine experts said Google uses many factors in its search algorithm \u2014 including how often a web page is linked to by other sites and how often certain words appear on a page \u2014 and that formula is constantly being updated.\u201cEvery year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users\u2019 queries,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment.\u201dEven longtime Google critics disagreed with the premise of the PJ Media article.\u201cThe industry should have plenty of concerns with Google, particularly antitrust and data collection practices, but this isn\u2019t one of them,\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, an online publishing industry group. \u201cThe president\u2019s tweets this morning are flat-out absurd.\u201dLong before Facebook, Apple and Google had removed InfoWars from their sites, conservatives were zeroing in on Big Tech as a new enemy in the political culture wars. In February, at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., guests packed a ballroom for a discussion called \u201cSuppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\u201dAlthough it provided a target for those in attendance, Google was a sponsor of the conference. The company held a reception for conference attendees, with an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Since then, Google has updated its search algorithm to surface what it calls \u201cmore authoritative\u201d news sources.The internet companies find themselves caught between conservatives who say they are being heavy-handed and others who say they are not doing enough to police their sites. Twitter only suspended Mr. Jones\u2019s account, for example, and was condemned by some of its own employees and many on the left for not being tougher.Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the majority leader, has also raised concerns that Republican voices were being stifled online. He was joined by other Republican House leaders, including Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, who threatened to subpoena Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, if he did not testify in Congress in a separate hearing on Sept. 5 on content moderation on the internet.\u201cSocial media platforms are increasingly serving as today\u2019s town squares,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a statement after Mr. Dorsey agreed to testify. \u201cBut sadly, conservatives are too often finding their voices silenced.\u201dJeremy Peters, Katie Rogers and Edmund Lee contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Style Icon", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Amazon chief executive has quietly been grooming a new image to go with his new status as rocket scientist, richest man in the world and potential Washington big shot.It has happened as steadily, and stealthily, as Amazon\u2019s relentless march to vie with Apple for the title of world\u2019s most valuable company. According to Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies like Apple, Intuit and Google, \u201che is doing something with style that differentiates him from any one else in tech. We have seen him sharpen up, with a wardrobe rooted in tradition but also very modernist and minimal. It creates a focus on him, and has evolved in accordance with his business.\u201dIt\u2019s a transformation that in many ways is as unexpected as Amazon\u2019s swerves into original moviemaking and web services. Snaps! What was he thinking? He was apparently already focused on saving time, even in those early years.There he is, for example, arm veins a-popping, next to a poster of the even balder and more built Dwayne Johnson in \u201cRampage,\u201d with the caption: \u201cStill working on my smolder.\u201d There he is with Patrick Stewart in matching tuxedos at the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year (Bezos is a famous Trekkie), a photo that provoked many commentators to remark on their similarity.There he is in the desert in faded denim, a cowboy hat, those \u201clucky\u201d cowboy boots (apparently a gift from a friend) and shades leaning against his space capsule and striking a \u201cRight Stuff\u201d pose.And there he is with robot dogs and spaceships, and atop a giant windmill in Amazon\u2019s new wind farm, modeling a hard hat and shades and smashing a Champagne bottle.Which leads inevitably to thoughts of Tony Stark. Indeed, in November 2017 Mr. Bezos wore a jeans-black-polo-leather-jacket combination to Summit LA17 that echoed, almost exactly, the jeans-black-T-shirt-leather-jacket look Robert Downey Jr. modeled in \u201cIron Man 2.\u201dPointedly, and unlike his fellow tech entrepreneurs who have enshrined the dress-down uniform in the mythology of their sector and equated it with a life of the mind, Mr. Bezos has a facility for dressing up. He has also shown a willingness to sample outfits, much as he samples industries, the better to make them his own. It\u2019s an expression of an omnivorous, rather than laserlike, focus.The result is a new model for a major tech entrepreneur. If Amazon does win the race to the trillion-dollar mark, look for it coming soon to a Silicon Alley near you.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strong Women on the March at Seattle Art Fair", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prominent placement was no coincidence.\u201cImages of strong females sell easily,\u201d said William Rau, the president of M.S. Rau Antiques, a New Orleans-based gallery that had staked out a position by the door and positioned the $198,500 piece front and center. He said that more female art buyers are out buying, and they are responding, as are men, he added, to art showing women in charge. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a \u2018me too\u2019 connection or just female equality, I can\u2019t answer,\u201d he added.But diversity is a complicated subject in a city where the white male still dominates, especially in the computer-science and engineering world that is Seattle\u2019s economic driver.And as questions of power relationships and abuse have percolated through Hollywood, politics and business, encouraging artists to make statements of race or gender runs the risk, fair organizers said, of looking cynical or crass, as if you\u2019ve thrown some diversity into the mix after meeting with your consultants, or simply awkward, because there might be no right way to do it.\u201cIf you\u2019re a man telling a woman\u2019s story, you\u2019re open for investigation,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cBut I love strong women characters in literature and art and this has inspired me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not unaware that we live in a very crazy political period, but I think it\u2019s also important not to get caught up in the \u2018nowness,\u2019\u201d he said. Indigenous people, for example, he said, have faced existential issues for generations. \u201cYou say, \u2018this is a tough political time\u2019 to an indigenous person, and they would be like, \u2018huh?\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cIn tech, it gets simplified into numbers \u2014 how many women and minorities do we have in the company,\u201d said Professor Katyal, who is also a co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. Art can look deeper, she said, at both itself and the broader world. \u201cThe task of art is for us to say, \u2018are these numbers enough,\u2019\u2019\u2019 she said.Ms. Hupfield said that for her, performance art was also an assertion of authority. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who set the terms for the audience,\u201d she said.But where lines of power, gender and tech converge, things can also be pretty messy.Mr. White\u2019s puppet installation, for example, featured a rope system that visitors were encouraged to yank on to make the hand-holding Boren sisters dance. It was also in its way a tech statement, as in low-tech. \u201cI love the fact that he made it entirely out of cardboard,\u201d said Greg Canote, 67, a fair visitor who said the Boren sisters had stolen his heart.The dancing pioneers also provided a stark contrast with a robotic project out in the parking lot by the artist Mark Pauline, whose clanking metal behemoths, looking like something from the dystopian future of the Mad Max movies, prowled their display space treating art as prey. In one performance, the robots, directed by a member of the team, methodically shredded a copy of an Andy Warhol painting.And the Rau Gallery took \u201cDevant la Mer\u201d home without selling it. One elegantly dressed woman stopped by on the fair\u2019s opening morning, assessed the Cassigneul for a long time, then asked Mr. Rau what his best price offer would be. He scribbled some numbers. She assessed again for a while and kept shopping.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ikea Opens First India Store, Tweaking Products but Not the Vibe", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "The Swedish furniture giant opens in Hyderabad, India, this week. To appeal to customers, it is cutting prices, offering assembly and selling samosas.Supported byHYDERABAD, India \u2014 Parina Lamba, 4, knew what she wanted in the new Ikea store here, the first by the Swedish retail giant in India. She hopped onto a daybed on the showroom floor, lay down and would not get off.\u201cShe didn\u2019t sit on any other bed,\u201d said Parina\u2019s father, Sarav Lamba, one of about 7,000 people to get early access to Ikea\u2019s store a few days before this Thursday\u2019s grand opening.Mr. Lamba was sold. The Hemnes bed was like none other he had seen in Hyderabad, featuring a pullout tray that allowed it to become a double bed \u2014 perfect for when Parina\u2019s grandmother came to visit, he said. At 39,970 rupees, or $582, with two mattresses, the price was fair, he added. And as an engineer, he was looking forward to putting it together with his daughter\u2019s help. \u201cI love D.I.Y.,\u201d he said.Ikea\u2019s opening in India \u2014 and its subsequent success or failure \u2014 is likely to become a case study for other international retailers.India\u2019s retail landscape is complex. With a growing middle class, its 1.3 billion people buy about $30 billion a year of furniture, lighting and household items like bed linens and cookware, according to Technopak, an Indian consulting firm.But despite the efforts of a few local chains, 95 percent of those goods are sold through small shops that offer custom-built products, usually specializing in one category such as wooden furniture or lamps, and offer free assembly and delivery.\u201cThe consumer in India is kind of pampered,\u201d said Ankur Bisen, who heads Technopak\u2019s retail and consumer products division.Ikea stores are the polar opposite. Part showroom and part warehouse, they are sprawling outlets that are far from city centers with mazes of giant bins and floor-to-ceiling shelves. Ikea\u2019s brand signals affordable, mass-produced and functional, and its design aesthetic is lightweight and lean, in contrast to the heavier, bulkier furniture traditionally favored in Indian households.Yet Ikea, with its reputation for good value, also appeals to the bargain-hunting nature of the Indian shopper.\u201cIn India, a lot is driven by the price of the goods and not so much about the quality,\u201d said Anil Talreja, a partner at Deloitte\u2019s India arm who works with retailers.All of this has forced Ikea to rethink its product lineup and store operations for India. Although the Hyderabad store has the classic Ikea layout, what\u2019s on display is somewhat different.Given India\u2019s lower income levels, the store features hundreds of products \u2014 from dolls to spice jars \u2014 priced at less than 100 rupees, or $1.45. In some cases, Ikea is selling a product in India for less than it charges elsewhere. In other instances, the company is tailoring it for local tastes. For example, most Indians do not use knives to eat and primarily want spoons, so the company ditched its children\u2019s plastic cutlery packs and instead sells four spoons for 15 rupees, or 22 cents.Ikea employees also visited about 1,000 homes in various cities to understand how people lived and what they needed. Indian families spend a lot of time together, with relatives frequently popping in, so the company added more folding chairs and stools that could serve as flexible seating.Indian women, on average, are also shorter than Europeans and Americans, so the company decided to showcase some cabinets and countertops at lower heights. And with children often sleeping in the same room as their parents until they are in elementary school, its model bedroom squeezes in a child\u2019s bed amid all the other furniture. Figuring out how to adapt Ikea\u2019s furniture was more difficult. Some items popular in the United States, such as untreated pine furniture, do not endure in south India\u2019s hot and humid climate. Metal or wooden furniture needs small risers to lift it off the floor since people frequently clean their floors with water.Import duties and other taxes can raise the cost of an Ikea chair or cabinet by 30 to 50 percent. That forced the company to price many imported products higher than it does elsewhere in the world.\u201cWe\u2019re still not as affordable as we want to be yet,\u201d said John Achillea, who oversees the Hyderabad store and its 950 employees after running Ikeas in St. Louis and Sunrise, Fla.Ikea also added 150 assemblers to its Hyderabad store, and it is working with UrbanClap, a home services company, to offer customers like Mr. Lamba the option of hiring a trained carpenter to put together his daybed for about $10.The quest to keep lowering its prices in India has prompted Ikea to seek new local suppliers. The company is getting carpets, pillows, mattresses and even some of its popular Ektorp sofas from local manufacturers. Globally, Indian suppliers sell about $400 million of goods a year to Ikea, primarily textiles. Over time, the company wants to expand that to other categories.Mr. Achillea said finding more Indian suppliers will help the company in other ways. \u201cIkea is about volume,\u201d he said. \u201cProducing more locally, more Indian-relevant products, that will drive the prices lower and then obviously the volume goes up.\u201dIn Hyderabad, Ikea is in an area known as Hitec City, where thousands of new apartments are going up and multinational tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Capgemini, Tech Mahindra and Deloitte have offices. Many customers at the store last weekend worked at those companies or were familiar with Ikea from other countries.In the city\u2019s traditional furniture district, Nampally, furniture sellers said they were not worried about Ikea stealing their business. The new store will get people excited about buying furniture, they said, and customers will come to check out the local options, too.Srinithdas Mundhada, whose 45-year-old store sells metal furniture like storage cabinets and cheap plastic chairs and stools, said that he and his family have already gotten adept at competing with big foreign-owned retailers.\u201cWe are cheaper than Amazon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe welcome Ikea with a warm heart.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Disney has given hints but no specifics. The name, rollout strategy, precise menu of movies and television shows \u2014 all still a mystery.But one aspect is becoming clear: The service\u2019s initial success or failure will depend a great deal on an ascendant Disney executive named Ricky Strauss, who was recently given \u2014 to the surprise of many in Hollywood \u2014 creative oversight of the service\u2019s programming. He has the power to \u201cgreenlight\u201d new episodic series and movies and will develop, according to Disney, the service\u2019s \u201cstrategic content vision.\u201dBut standout success on the production side of the film business has been more elusive for Mr. Strauss.In his new job as president of content and marketing for Disney\u2019s streaming service, Mr. Strauss will be responsible for steering hundreds of millions of dollars in production. As he put it in a brief phone interview, \u201cQuality is going to be critical.\u201dMr. Strauss will need to court other top filmmakers, writers and stars to make content for the service \u2014 at a time when Apple, Amazon and Netflix are going after talent with wheelbarrows full of money.\u201cThere\u2019s a big, big opportunity for storytellers inside and outside of Disney to help us,\u201d Mr. Strauss said when asked what he wanted to communicate to Hollywood\u2019s creative community.\u201cI do believe that this is the future, which is one reason I wanted the job,\u201d he added.\u201cThis as an extremely important, very, very significant strategic shift for us,\u201d Mr. Iger said when he announced the Disney-branded streaming service last year.The urgency has only grown.The number of cord-cutters \u2014 adults who have canceled cable or satellite hookups and continue without it \u2014 will hit 33 million this year, a 32.8 percent increase from 2017, according to a new report by the research firm eMarketer. The annual increase in cord-cutters had been projected at 22 percent. Most of those people are subscribing to streaming services instead.Programming from National Geographic, which is part of the Fox acquisition, will probably be offered on the service. Disney has not decided whether family films from the Fox library (\u201cHome Alone,\u201d \u201cIce Age\u201d) will be included. Fox\u2019s rowdy animated shows, including \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d are expected to remain on Hulu.Mr. Strauss declined to discuss original movies and series beyond the handful that have already been announced. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re playing with launch dates,\u201d he said.But two agents and two producers working with Disney, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect ties to the company, provided some details about what the company has planned.At least nine movies are in production or advanced development, with budgets ranging from $20 million to $60 million. Disney is remaking two musicals from its animation library as live-action films: \u201cLady and the Tramp\u201d (1955) and \u201cThe Sword in the Stone\u201d (1963). Other films headed to the service include \u201cTogo,\u201d a period adventure about a sled dog, and \u201cNoelle,\u201d starring Anna Kendrick as Santa\u2019s daughter.Most series will cost $25 million to $35 million. Already in the works are episodic spinoffs of Disney franchises like \u201cHigh School Musical\u201d and \u201cMonsters Inc.\u201d The Muppets will probably be getting a new series. There will be Marvel-themed shows.

That lockup, from which the prince emerged grayer and thinner, was part of what Saudi officials called an anti-corruption crackdown that ensnared many of the kingdom\u2019s elites.Under the terms of the deal, the prince will receive shares of Deezer in exchange for exclusive audio and video content from the Saudi media company he controls, Rotana Group. In a statement, Prince Alwaleed said the agreement \u201crepresents one of the many premium investments that we have always sought for our shareholders.\u201dThe deal was made through the prince\u2019s investing vehicle, Kingdom Holding Company, whose business he had said he was able to conduct during his stay at the Ritz. Still, his detention raised sharp questions about Prince Alwaleed\u2019s future autonomy, including whether he could continue to invest freely in international companies and property.Going forward, Prince Alwaleed is primarily interested in investments in media and technology, said Kacy Grine, an investment banker and adviser to the prince. \u201cI think the next step for the prince would be to do the same on the TV and movie side,\u201d Mr. Grine said, adding that Netflix or Amazon were potential deal partners.The Deezer deal, Mr. Grine said, is \u201cby definition a comeback, compared to the situation a few months ago.\u201dPrince Alwaleed could not be reached for comment.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Tried to Change China. China May End Up Changing Google.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtEver since its founding 20 years ago in a Silicon Valley garage, Google has proudly and often ostentatiously held itself up as the architect of a new model for corporate virtue.Still, if you work at Google or have bought into its missionary brand, you can point to moments when its ethos did rise to something more than marketing puffery. The most obvious example: In 2010, after four years of attempting to operate a censored search engine in China under a regime there that was becoming increasingly hostile to online freedoms, Google did something that a more conventional company would not have done. It said that it had had enough, and pulled its search engine out of the massive market.The defenses are not unsound. Under any rational business sense, it would be insane to expect one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies to stay out of the world\u2019s largest internet market, especially when many of Google\u2019s American rivals happily operate under that government\u2019s intrusive rules. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, and Microsoft and Amazon both offer a host of services there.But wasn\u2019t standing apart supposed to be the hallmark of Google\u2019s Googliness? Leaving China was the kind of unorthodox decision the search company once reveled in \u2014 a move that sacrificed financial prosperity for the moral high ground, that showed employees and customers that Google, with its planet-swallowing mission to organize all of life\u2019s information, was motivated by something deeper than financial ambition.Activists for online freedoms worry that Google\u2019s return would have dangerous real-world consequences, perhaps accelerating a great new wave of online restrictions in China and elsewhere. But the most lasting impact might be in how we would have to reimagine what kind of company Google was and what it stood for.It is hard to see how going back to China would be anything other than a terrific comedown \u2014 the most telling act of a company that, day by day, has come to resemble the utterly conventional corporation it once vowed never to become.\u201cIf Google wants to be judged like any other global company, that\u2019s fine,\u201d said Ben Wizner, director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThey should just say so \u2014 that their principal obligation is to their shareholders and their bottom line. But that has not been the rhetoric coming out of Google, and I think it\u2019s fair to judge them by the standards they have set for themselves.\u201dIn a statement, a Google spokesman said that \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on speculation about future plans.\u201d But the company\u2019s leaders have disputed the idea that returning to China would be a moral reversal. At last week\u2019s staff meeting, Mr. Pichai suggested that returning to China would be in accord with the vision the company had in 2006, when it first agreed to censor results to accommodate Beijing.Mr. Pichai underlined this argument \u2014 that providing some access to the outside world is better than none \u2014 by citing his experience growing up in India.\u201cMy dad worked for a U.K. company, and they went through whether they should be in India or should they pull out,\u201d he told Google\u2019s staff, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. \u201cAnd they stayed, and that made a difference for my dad. And in all likelihood, I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it weren\u2019t for that.\u201dThere are other factors behind Google\u2019s potential reversal. The internet has changed a great deal since 2010, and the company\u2019s executives have increasingly come to see their decision to leave China as rash, na\u00efve and ultimately counterproductive.\u201cThis argument makes me very sad: The world is becoming more like China, so therefore we might as well be in China,\u201d said Rebecca MacKinnon, an internet freedom advocate at New America, a think tank.She said that advocates of free speech and human rights had long found Google to be an ally in their efforts, and that a reversal in China would be regarded as a major defeat.\u201cI wrote a book where I warned that China is Exhibit A for how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and then begin to change the internet,\u201d Ms. MacKinnon said. \u201cAnd if companies like Google are now throwing in the towel and saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s where the internet is going\u2019 and \u2018If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u2019 \u2014 well, that\u2019s deeply troubling.\u201dIf Google does go back to China, it will very likely have to agree to an even more restrictive censorship regime than what it tolerated previously. Mr. Pichai has vowed to be transparent about how such a plan might roll out. But advocates said transparency alone would not mitigate their worries about Google\u2019s shift.\u201cIf Google is trying to promote openness and free societies, then transparency is going to be an insufficient way to make this better,\u201d said Mr. Wizner of the A.C.L.U. \u201cThe transparency would be aimed at the rest of the world. Google wouldn\u2019t be telling Chinese people, \u2018Here\u2019s what you can\u2019t see.\u2019\u201dSure, it\u2019s early, and Google\u2019s plans are not clear. There remains the possibility that Google will think of some completely nontraditional way to satisfy China\u2019s censors without losing its soul.But that seems unlikely. The more plausible conclusion is the more obvious one: Google took on China, and Google lost.\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, \u201cthis will be a huge victory for the Chinese government and anyone else who wants to severely restrict the internet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Is Billy Bob Thornton Doing These Days?", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust another semi-rock-star dad, bowling with his bandmates in between acting gigs.SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 Billy Bob Thornton stood at the foot of a lane inside the Bowlmor bowling alley and arcade here and squinted at a rack of pins. He paused a moment, his right arm poised at a 90-degree angle, his right hand gently cradling the ball. He reached back, aimed and, with a quick two-step, lobbed the ball down the middle of the lane.  Sterrrrikkkkke!Hollers, whoops and high-fives all around.His love of bowling may contradict the image of Billy Bob Thornton, the 63-year-old actor, musician, writer and ex-husband of five. You may think of him as a tatted up, whiskey-swilling, uncensorable iconoclast with an 11,000-square-foot party pad in Beverly Hills and one ex who reportedly wore a vial of his blood around her neck. That would be Angelina Jolie, except that\u2019s not the real story. It wasn\u2019t blood, he said. Well, not a lot of blood. Well, it wasn\u2019t a vial. \u201cShe had one of those lockets, and we pricked our fingers and put few drops in there,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. Not that those crazy days didn\u2019t exist, though the only hint of them is the tattoos that cover nearly every inch of his arms, and various hidden body parts. \u201cWe had a good time,\u201d he said matter-of-factly, with only the faintest tinge of nostalgia.These days, he is dedicated to his sixth wife, Connie Angland, whom he met in 2003 on the set of \u201cBad Santa,\u201d and their 14-year-old daughter, Bella, who is home-schooled. Mr. Thornton, too, spends a lot of time at home: \u201cYou\u2019re only busy when you\u2019re shooting,\u201d he said. The rest of the time, he is writing music or hanging out with the three other children he had with two of the other ex-wives. Mr. Thornton has been bowling since he was about Bella\u2019s age. Growing up in Hot Springs, Ark., he said, there wasn\u2019t much else to do.Though his mother, a psychic, predicted that her son would one day work with Burt Reynolds (he did, in \u201cEvening Shade\u201d), and win an Oscar (he did, for \u201cSling Blade\u201d), what he really wanted to do was play professional baseball. He even tried out for the Kansas City Royals, but a wayward pitch broke his collarbone.At Bowlmor Mr. Thornton was surrounded by trusted comrades: Ms. Angland; Teddy Andreadis, a keyboardist, and J.D. Andrew, a guitarist, both of whom are in his band the Boxmasters (Mr. Thornton plays the drums and sings); his longtime publicist, Arnold Robinson; Jaime Sickora, the chief engineer at Henson Recording Studios, in Hollywood, where Mr. Thornton has done all of his albums; and the manager of Henson, Faryal Ganjehei. Mr. Thornton is not Mr. Hollywood anymore. Other than \u201cDwight,\u201d as in Yoakam, his closest pal in that industry is Dennis Quaid, invited tonight but, alas, out of town.Bowling is his only form of exercise, really. Wherever he and the Boxmasters go on tour, on which they were about to embark for their new album, \u201cIn Stereo,\u201d they make time for it. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can count on in every town,\u201d Mr. Thornton said. \u201cBut you can count on there being a bowling alley.\u201d He bought his own ball, with a blue-and-silver marble design, in Grand Rapids, Mich. The Boxmasters were opening for Def Leppard, and on days off the two bands would get into some serious competitive bowling.But tonight Mr. Thornton was using the house balls, which were slick and sweaty and, well, gross.Thankfully, he had the foresight to bring a large bottle of Purell, which he placed on a table by an oversize plate of untouched nachos (Mr. Thornton is a vegan). He squirted some on his hands after every turn.\u201cAll musicians are good at bowling,\u201d Ms. Sickora said. \u201cI think it has to do with their hands.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s like a professional,\u201d Ms. Ganjehei said reverently, as Mr. Thornton bowled one strike after another.This was a busy summer for the actor. Along with the Boxmasters tour, the second season of his Amazon Studios drama, \u201cGoliath\u201d (David E. Kelley is one of the creators), in which Mr. Thornton plays a down-on-his luck alcoholic lawyer, started on June 15. He won a Golden Globe for it in 2017. Much of the show\u2019s action is centered at the Ocean Lodge, a seedy hotel nearby. Mr. Thornton appreciates the neighborhood\u2019s many charms and the rest of this sprawling megalopolis. \u201cI\u2019m in a business I hate, but I worship L.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in L.A. 38 years. This is the city where my kids were born and raised, and the place where my dreams were realized.\u201dThree games, a few beers and many cigarettes later, the final tally was 398 for Mr. Thornton\u2019s team, and 384 for his opponents. He bowled a 139, a 130 and a 99: not his best by a long shot, but still O.K. What would he do if he hadn\u2019t won? \u201cProbably go in the corner and pout,\u201d he said. Advertisement"}

It was a few years ago, on a night Mactaggart and his wife had invited some friends over for dinner. One was a software engineer at Google, whose search and video sites are visited by over a billion people a month. As evening settled in, Mactaggart asked his friend, half-seriously, if he should be worried about everything Google knew about him. \u201cI expected one of those answers you get from airline pilots about plane crashes,\u201d Mactaggart recalled recently. \u201cYou know \u2014 \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u2019\u2009\u201d Instead, his friend told him there was plenty to worry about. If people really knew what we had on them, the Google engineer said, they would flip out.Mactaggart had spent most of his adult life in the Bay Area, running a family real estate business with his uncle. The rise of the tech industry had filled his condo developments with ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs, making Mactaggart a wealthy man. But he never really thought about how companies like Google or Facebook got so big so fast. The vast pools of data they collected and monetized were abstractions, something he knew existed but, as with plane crashes, rarely dwelt on.And no one knew more about what people did or were going to do than Facebook and Google, whose free social and search products provided each company with enormous repositories of intimate personal data. They knew what you \u201cliked\u201d and who your friends were. They knew not just what you typed into the search bar late on a Friday night but also what you started to type and then thought better of. Facebook and Google were following people around the rest of the internet too, using an elaborate and invisible network of browsing bugs \u2014 they had, within little more than a decade, created a private surveillance apparatus of extraordinary reach and sophistication. Mactaggart thought that something ought to be done. He began to wonder whether he should be the one to do it.Mactaggart, who is 52 but boyish, did not think of himself as a radical. He often describes himself as a capitalist. He is the kind of man who wears chinos with a braided belt; it is easy to picture him on a sailboat. But his research on privacy had stirred something in him. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Buddhist thing, where you walk past a mess and a mop and say, \u2018Someone ought to clean up that mess,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cAnd eventually you realize you have to pick up the mop.\u201dOver evening walks around his neighborhood, Mactaggart batted around ideas for a new state law with his friend Rick Arney, a finance executive. But Arney, who worked in the California Legislature after business school, suggested a different approach. Instead of going through Sacramento, Arney suggested, they could put the question directly to the people of California, gathering signatures for a statewide ballot initiative. Mactaggart liked the idea. He also had the money to do something with it. Early last year, he hired a small staff, set them up in a two-room office in Oakland and began cold-calling privacy experts to figure out just what his initiative should say.\u201cI thought it was a joke at first, to be contacted by someone named \u2018Alastair Mactaggart,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mactaggart was wary of proposing a sweeping law like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., fearing that Californians would find it mystifying and reject it. He wanted a solution that consumers would embrace and Silicon Valley could live with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Hoofnagle recalls Mactaggart\u2019s telling him. \u201cI just think the data use by these companies is out of control.\u201dAlmost by accident, though, Mactaggart had thrust himself into the greatest resource grab of the 21st century. To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit, formed in the digital ether by ordinary people as they browsed, used apps and messaged their friends. Like the oil barons before them, they had collected and refined that resource to build some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Facebook and Google, an emerging duopoly that today controls more than half of the worldwide market in online advertising. But the entire business model \u2014 what the philosopher and business theorist Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 rests on untrammeled access to your personal data. The tech industry didn\u2019t want to give up its powers of surveillance. It wanted to entrench them. And as Mactaggart would soon learn, Silicon Valley almost always got what it wanted.And increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn\u2019t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.In Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook\u2019s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups \u2014 including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley\u2019s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.Soltani knew exactly how hard Facebook and Google would fight to protect their business model, because he had watched them do it before. In February 2012, senior officials from the Obama administration unveiled what some of them hoped would become a signature initiative of President Obama\u2019s second term: a \u201cconsumer-privacy bill of rights.\u201d The proposal called for limits on the data that companies were collecting and more control for consumers over how it was used, and the tech industry had at least some incentive to consider it: The previous year, Facebook and Google each entered into consent decrees with the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found that the companies had deceived users about their privacy policies. Soltani, then serving as an F.T.C. technologist, worked on both investigations, and his efforts helped highlight a more pervasive problem: Most consumers simply didn\u2019t have the time or experience to navigate the personal-data economy on their own. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s model puts the onus on the user to decide if the bargain is fair,\u201d Soltani told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling you coffee and making it your job to decide if the coffee has lead in it.\u201d When it comes to privacy, he said, \u201cwe have no baseline law that says you can\u2019t put lead in coffee.\u201dWhite House officials believed at first that many tech companies were open to the administration\u2019s ideas. But the following year, as a team of experts at Obama\u2019s Commerce Department worked on drafting a detailed privacy bill, The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing an explosive series of articles about United States government surveillance programs. Relying on thousands of documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the articles revealed how the N.S.A. was collecting rivers of personal data \u2014 emails, photos, instant-message conversations \u2014 from nine leading internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft. Soltani by then had left the F.T.C. and joined The Post as a consultant on the series, working on articles that showed how the N.S.A. had collected hundreds of thousands of user address books from email providers and even hacked into the private networks that companies like Google and Yahoo use to transport their data.The Snowden scandal robbed Obama\u2019s consumer proposal of both momentum and moral authority. Stung by the perception that it had colluded with United States spy agencies, Silicon Valley demanded that the government regulate itself instead, allying with civil liberties groups to push for legislation reining in the N.S.A. Over the next several months, scores of tech executives flew to Washington for high-level meetings with Obama, including Sandberg, who also sat with Obama\u2019s new commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, the Chicago billionaire who was the co-chairwoman of his re-election campaign.In early 2014, Pritzker traveled to Silicon Valley for a highly publicized listening tour. She hailed the tech industry as a model for government \u2014 a partner, not an antagonist. Data, she proclaimed, was \u201cthe fuel of the 21st century.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s tour included visits to eBay, Google and the Menlo Park campus of Facebook, where she met again with Sandberg. The women discussed an array of issues, including consumer privacy and how to ensure that American tech businesses remained competitive around the world. Two former Obama administration officials told me that those conversations appeared to have shaped Pritzker\u2019s early views on privacy. \u201cOur goal at the Department of Commerce as a service organization is to support you, whether you are a researcher, inventor, entrepreneur, mentor or investor,\u201d Pritzker told her audience at a start-up accelerator in Sunnyvale.When the Obama administration finally returned to its consumer-privacy bill the following fall, Pritzker and her team voiced concerns about its sweep and scope, according to former Obama officials I spoke with. Pritzker wanted to make sure the bill could win industry support, and with it, Republican support. In January 2015, her office persuaded the White House to delay public release of the draft, which had been planned to coincide with an Obama speech at the F.T.C. Instead, her aides began previewing the bill in dozens of meetings with different business executives and lobbyists. According to the former Obama officials, the industry raised a host of objections. Facebook and Google, in particular, objected to how many kinds of data the rules covered, which included not only conventional personal information like Social Security numbers but also data linked to particular devices, which was critical to compiling the digital dossiers relied on by the advertising industry. (Facebook disputed that account.) Jim Hock, Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff at Commerce and now a spokesman for her private investment firm, PSP Partners, says Pritzker weighed all points of view. \u201cNo one meeting was more important than another,\u201d he says.But when consumer advocates were finally shown the new draft, they were furious. The bill now had a welter of exceptions and carve-outs. It drastically scaled back financial penalties and did not specifically protect location data. More broadly, it seemed to retreat from the idea of consumer privacy as an inherent right. Most of the bill\u2019s protections applied only if collecting or using a given piece of information posed a serious risk of economic or emotional harm. That March, Washington\u2019s leading consumer-privacy groups signed an open letter criticizing the Obama proposal, arguing that it did not do nearly enough. The Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies, also weighed in, attacking the bill as overbroad and burdensome. \u201cThe feeling was that it didn\u2019t do much, and no one really liked it,\u201d Soltani told me.The language of the resulting ballot initiative, which Mactaggart finalized last November, reflected lessons from the painful failure of Obama privacy\u2019s initiative. It wasn\u2019t called a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d And on its face, it was not a frontal attack on the giants of Silicon Valley. Mactaggart\u2019s proposal instead took aim at the so-called third-party market for personal data, in which companies trade and sell your information to one another, mostly without your knowing about it.Under the proposed law, every California consumer could demand, from most large businesses, an outline of his or her digital dossier, showing what categories of personal information the company had collected. Mactaggart and Soltani included nearly every category of personal information that they could think of: not only whether the companies had collected your name and address but also if they had collected your browsing history, your fingerprints, your face scans or your location data. They would also be required to inform consumers if they were drawing \u201cinferences,\u201d the sophisticated guesses companies make about, say, your dating habits or your taste in convertibles. And if consumers didn\u2019t like the deal, they could \u201copt out,\u201d demanding that companies no longer sell or share any data in a given category.The ballot initiative had significant implications for the Silicon Valley giants, however. If adopted, Mactaggart and Arney hoped, it would cripple the tech industry\u2019s \u201cnotice and choice\u201d consent model, where companies dictated all the terms of service up front, forcing consumers to either agree or find a different app. As more people opted out of data sharing, they believed, the rules would slowly dry up the supply of personal information that companies could buy or trade on the open market. \u201cThird-party tracking would essentially end,\u201d Mactaggart says. \u201cSo when you log in to Spotify, you wouldn\u2019t be logging into, like, 100 partners. You wouldn\u2019t have 75 percent of the websites in the world looking over your shoulder.\u201dStill, Mactaggart and Soltani imagined their rules to be comparatively light-touch, a way to inhibit only the most invasive and creepy kinds of commercial surveillance while leaving Silicon Valley to thrive. Imposing them in California, the beating heart of the tech industry, offered another advantage. Through California\u2019s referendum process, they could end-run the entire tangle of interests that had stymied the Obama bill in Washington. And if they succeeded, the effect would ripple far beyond the state\u2019s borders: Any company in the world that wanted to do business with California\u2019s 40 million residents would need to follow California\u2019s rules. Mactaggart liked to compare it to California\u2019s strict auto-emissions standards, which forced the world\u2019s automakers to develop cars that guzzle less fossil fuel.But Soltani also knew how aggressively the tech companies used their connections in state capitals. In 2015, a Facebook user named Carlo Licata filed suit in Illinois, arguing that the company\u2019s photo \u201ctagging\u201d feature, which automatically identified Facebook users in photos uploaded to the site, violated his privacy rights. Illinois is among the few states in the country with a strict law governing biometric data, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting fingerprints, voiceprints or a \u201cscan of hand or face geometry.\u201d (\u201cIllinois only has this law because it recognized the need to protect biometrics before Silicon Valley began trying to control state legislation,\u201d says Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in Chicago who represents Licata.) Other Facebook users in Illinois filed similar suits, which were consolidated and transferred to a federal court in California. Facebook argued that the Illinois law did not specifically apply to its methods for identifying people in photographs. The judge disagreed, ruling in May 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed.Just weeks later, the original sponsor of the Illinois privacy act, a genial Chicago-area lawmaker named Terry Link, abruptly proposed an amendment to his own law. The amendment clarified that digital photographs did not count as a source of biometric information and that the law only protected facial scans conducted \u201cin person.\u201d A Facebook official told me that the company had provided Link with suggestions for clarifying the law, not the language itself. But in a recent interview, Link recalled that the amendment language was given to him directly by a lawyer for Facebook. (Link did not specify who, and would not comment on why he had pursued the amendment in the first place.) Indeed, the amendment, introduced with only a few days left in the year\u2019s legislative session, seemed tailored to buttress Facebook\u2019s arguments in the California lawsuit, leaving Facebook and other companies free to create face scans from digital pictures without consent.Link had attached his amendment to a bill that was already sailing through the Legislature, an otherwise bland measure dealing with state procedures for unclaimed property. After national privacy groups leapt into action, Link withdrew the amendment. This April, the judge certified Licata\u2019s case as a class action, applying to as many as eight million Facebook users in Illinois. If Facebook loses, the company could face a judgment as high as $40 billion.Arney met with three Google representatives, including Mufaddal Ezzy, a former aide in the State Legislature who runs Google\u2019s California lobbying operation. They had lunch in a private room at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern, a trendy downtown restaurant with taxidermied heads of wild game on the walls. The executives were friendly, Arney recalls, but mostly they were confused, even a little disconcerted. \u201cGoogle\u2019s angle was, No. 1, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me recently, with a chuckle. No one in tech had ever heard of Arney and Mactaggart. They didn\u2019t understand why a finance guy and a real estate developer cared so much about privacy. One asked whether either of the two men were planning to run for office. Eventually, the idea was floated that they all work together on an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s initiative \u2014 a piece of legislation in Sacramento, where they could all have input. \u201cTheir idea was that we could fix this in the State Legislature,\u201d Arney says.Facebook seemed to have different worries, Mactaggart told me. Mactaggart\u2019s uncle was friends with a former San Francisco city official who had gone to work for Facebook. The friend reached out to arrange a meeting with Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy: Will Castleberry, a gravel-voiced veteran of the tech and telecom industry. When Castleberry met Mactaggart and Arney at a different San Francisco restaurant in December, Mactaggart found him charming and sincere. \u201cA lot of people who we talked to told us these were evil people,\u201d Mactaggart said later. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201dCastleberry praised Mactaggart\u2019s proposal but asked whether he was willing to rewrite it. Facebook\u2019s chief concern, he said, was a feature of the proposal called a \u201cprivate right of action.\u201d Unlike the Obama bill, which left most enforcement to the F.T.C., Mactaggart proposed letting consumers sue companies that violated the law. (Illinois had included such a right in its biometrics law, allowing Licata to sue Facebook.) Facebook feared that if interpretation of the new rules was left to juries, rather than regulators, it would take years just to determine what the company\u2019s compliance obligations were. \u201cWe support more disclosure in principle,\u201d Castleberry explained to me. \u201cBut the stakes are just much higher with the private right of action.\u201dMactaggart wanted to make sure his bill had teeth. But as a businessman, he said, he was sympathetic to Facebook\u2019s concerns. He urged Facebook to send him some alternative language. \u201cWe thought, Gosh, if Facebook came back with something reasonable, and we could get behind it, that would be a win-win,\u201d he recalls.But as Mactaggart waited, the tech companies \u2014 and other industries dependent on free data \u2014 were preparing to crush him. In January, California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce filed paperwork to register a group called the Committee to Protect California Jobs. The committee soon collected six-figure contributions from Facebook, Google and three of the country\u2019s biggest internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. The money paid for polling, which showed that Californians indeed had ample concerns about privacy, and to retain Gale Kaufman, a respected Democratic referendum specialist with close ties to the state\u2019s labor unions. The group also hired Steven Maviglio, a prominent Democratic public-relations consultant whose clients included the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly. Silicon Valley was girding for war.Mactaggart also knew that the tech and cable money, while less than the $2 million he had so far put into his own campaign, was only just the start. His own consultants warned him that the Committee to Protect California Jobs would most likely raise $100 million or more by Election Day. Mactaggart was rich. But he wasn\u2019t that rich.The Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook, sending the company\u2019s stock price plunging and setting in motion the worst crisis in the company\u2019s history. Cambridge executives had long bragged about deploying powerful \u201cpsychographic\u201d voter profiles to manipulate voters. Now Facebook was forced to acknowledge that Cambridge had used voters\u2019 own Facebook data to do it. The damage was not only legal and political \u2014 Facebook faced lawsuits and new inquiries by regulators in Brussels, London and Washington \u2014 but also reputational. Silicon Valley\u2019s public image had survived the Snowden revelations. But tech companies, already implicated in the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Russian interference in the 2016 election, were no longer the good guys. When Arney took one of his sons canvassing on the train, it was suddenly easy to get people to sign their ballot petition. \u201cAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal, all we had to say was \u2018data privacy,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me.The scandal forced Facebook to take complaints about privacy more seriously \u2014 or, at least, to sound as if it did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told CNN. Mactaggart pressed the advantage, posting an open letter accusing Zuckerberg of misleading Facebook users, then calling up media outlets to remind them that Zuckerberg\u2019s company was, at that moment, financing a campaign to stop new privacy regulations in California. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, in April, he again appeared contrite. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Zuckerberg told lawmakers. The next day, Facebook announced that it would no longer contribute money to the Committee to Protect California Jobs.Yet even as his canvassers racked up petition signatures from voters in the state, Mactaggart was being spurned by almost every prominent privacy group in the country. Like any other movement, the world of privacy experts has its radicals and moderates, feuds and schisms. In the wake of the Cambridge revelations, some advocates in Washington and California called for regulations, similar to Europe\u2019s G.D.P.R., that were much more sweeping than what Mactaggart proposed; some privacy advocates told me that they feared his initiative would crowd out their own, more sweeping proposals. (Whereas Mactaggart\u2019s initiative allowed consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of data sales between companies, G.D.P.R., which went into effect across the continent in May, required companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission for collecting the information in the first place.) Once voters approved Mactaggart\u2019s initiative, these critics pointed out, California lawmakers would need to muster an almost unobtainable supermajority to amend it.Corbin did not mention her firm\u2019s new client: the Committee to Protect California Jobs. Still at work for its remaining backers, the committee had hired Corbin\u2019s firm in February. According to Corbin, the industry coalition wanted her to provide an overview of existing privacy rules as well as areas of potential compromise with the other privacy activists, a move that could further isolate Mactaggart. Such an alliance would not have been totally unprecedented. Despite disagreements over consumer rules, tech companies have contributed millions of dollars to groups like the E.F.F. and the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology while working closely with some of them in pushing for post-Snowden surveillance reforms. \u201cSometimes politics makes for strange bedfellows,\u201d Corbin told me by email, when I asked about the payment. \u201cI can tell you there was plenty to concern industry and privacy groups alike about the ballot initiative.\u201dFacebook, for its part, contacted the C.D.T., asking the center\u2019s top expert on data-privacy protection, Michelle De Mooy, to help develop an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s proposal \u2014 language that could be submitted to lawmakers in Sacramento, either replacing or pre-empting Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. De Mooy told me that after some initial discussions, she turned them down, in part because Mactaggart did not seem interested in further compromise, but also because he seemed likely to succeed. \u201cThey were looking for options,\u201d De Mooy says of Facebook. \u201cUltimately, we said that that wasn\u2019t something we were going to do.\u201d But C.D.T. also remained neutral.Facebook chose that moment to make another direct appeal to Mactaggart. The company had developed a legislative counterproposal, which in April Will Castleberry emailed to Mactaggart, copying De Mooy. Mactaggart read it on a plane, flying back from a memorial service in Canada. He wasn\u2019t impressed. It was vague about data collected from mobile phones, and it appeared to exclude Facebook\u2019s own network of \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons around the Web, one of the company\u2019s chief means of tracking consumers when they weren\u2019t on Facebook. And while it limited the sale of data, it seemed to allow companies to make deals to swap data back and forth, potentially a major loophole.But Mactaggart didn\u2019t want to waste his money on a ballot fight if he could get a deal in Sacramento \u2014 and now that his initiative looked sure to get on the ballot, lawmakers in Sacramento had taken a renewed interest in passing their own privacy bill. Some privacy groups, including Common Sense Kids Action, were already negotiating with them. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate developer,\u201d Mactaggart told me later, describing his thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten everything I want, ever. If the legislature passed my entire bill, I\u2019m fine. And if it was almost as good \u2014 sure. Who needs to have a fight for the sake of having a fight?\u201dNevertheless, Mactaggart was willing to compromise. He had told California lawmakers that he would drop his campaign if they could pass a reasonable privacy bill by June 28, the legal point of no return for formally withdrawing his initiative from the ballot. Mactaggart and his team were scheduled to meet Ed Chau, a mild-mannered lawmaker from outside Los Angeles who leads the Assembly\u2019s committee on privacy and consumer protection. Chau had been designated as the Assembly\u2019s chief negotiator on a potential deal between industry and privacy advocates. After lunch, we all walked over to the Capitol and filed into Chau\u2019s fifth-floor office, where staff members had promised Mactaggart an update on the negotiations.Many privacy advocates in California regarded Chau as their champion. In 2017, he tried to pass a bill that would have required cable companies and other internet service providers to obtain customers\u2019 consent before selling their browsing history and other sensitive personal data. Known as AB 375, the bill was designed to replicate a popular Obama-era regulation that Trump and Republicans in Congress overturned during Trump\u2019s first months in office. To get it done quickly, Chau employed the very same tactic the tech industry had used in Illinois, gutting a different bill that had already passed the Assembly and inserting the broadband privacy provisions. \u201cCalifornia is going to restore what Washington stripped away,\u201d he pledged at a news conference.Some privacy advocates believed de Le\u00f3n was deliberately setting up Chau\u2019s bill to fail. While de Le\u00f3n is a progressive Democrat \u2014 he is now seeking to oust his fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from her United States Senate seat \u2014 he has also had a long relationship with AT&T, among the most feared and influential companies in Sacramento. As Senate leader, de Le\u00f3n was responsible for the health and size of the Democratic majority in the chamber, and the telecom and tech industries were a critical source of campaign cash. (AT&T also employed at least one of de Le\u00f3n\u2019s former top advisers among its swarm of lobbyists.) Most of the chamber\u2019s Democrats declined to go on the record supporting or opposing AB 375, fearful of enraging either the state\u2019s most powerful companies or privacy-minded anti-Trump voters. It never reached the floor, sparing them a painful vote. The reason for its demise remains murky. (Dan Reeves, a de Le\u00f3n aide, told me: \u201cWe said, if the author wants a vote, we\u2019ll put it up for a vote. We never heard back from them.\u201d Chau says he did ask for a vote. \u201cThe response from leadership then was, I didn\u2019t have the support,\u201d he says.) Now Chau had a second chance. Democratic leaders had resurrected his legislation, making a modified AB 375 the vehicle for a potential compromise with Mactaggart.But when we arrived in his office, Chau seemed ill at ease. He had not yet heard from Facebook or Google, he told us, and did not really know what their position was. He spoke in bland generalities. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of reaching out to all the stakeholders to see whether we can build consensus,\u201d Chau said. Mactaggart asked if the tech companies were being reasonable. Chau repeated himself, a nervous smile stuck on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all potential stakeholders,\u201d he said. After 15 minutes, Chau\u2019s assistant interrupted to say that he had another meeting. We filed out. No one else appeared to be in Chau\u2019s waiting room.Outside, it was a beautiful California day, so we strolled along a footpath on the Capitol grounds. Mactaggart was struck by Chau\u2019s evasiveness \u2014 and worried about the tech companies\u2019 seeming silence. \u201cIf you are Facebook and Google, and you are serious about legislation and reform,\u201d Mactaggart said, \u201cyou would think that it might make sense to go talk to the head of the committee that\u2019s in charge of crafting the legislative response to this initiative.\u201d It was possible that the companies had abandoned compromise. It was also possible that everybody was playing a more complex game. State lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cede policymaking authority to Mactaggart, and tech companies disliked his initiative so much that they might be willing to come to a reasonable compromise with the Legislature instead. If Democratic leaders were careful, they could devise a win-win: A bill that Mactaggart and the industry would accept, that privacy activists would hail and that lawmakers could take credit for. But Mactaggart found the delays and secrecy maddening. His deadline was fast approaching. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning,\u201d he said.We got in his SUV and headed back to Oakland. I asked him whether he thought Chau could deliver a bill that would satisfy him and still pass the Legislature. But Mactaggart took my question both more broadly and more personally: What would happen if he failed? \u201cThese companies know so much about you,\u201d Mactaggart said as he drove. \u201cAnd as time goes on, it is only going to get worse and worse.\u201d Approaching Oakland, we drove past the Benicia refinery, a small mountain of pipes and distillation towers looming over an inlet of San Francisco Bay. Mactaggart suggested that the refinery, originally constructed for Exxon in the 1960s, could never be built there today, given California\u2019s strict environmental-impact laws. Reform movements of earlier eras had managed to rein in Big Oil, Mactaggart noted. It was time for Big Tech to face a similar reckoning.It began to dawn on at least some people that Mactaggart\u2019s vote might be the most important one. Without it, Mactaggart\u2019s initiative would move forward. There would be no win-win. Hertzberg, in particular, really wanted a deal. Where Chau is modest, Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, is voluble and insistent, with a slicked-back mane of hair and a steady borscht-belt patter. \u201cI called Alastair \u2014 we had some friends in common,\u201d Hertzberg told me. Hertzberg proposed that Mactaggart take the pen. Mark it up however you want, he told Mactaggart, and I\u2019ll bring your proposal back to the industry. On a Wednesday in mid-June, Mactaggart went to his lawyer\u2019s office and got on the phone with a small group of negotiators, among them Hertzberg, Chau and an adviser to Common Sense Kids Action. Twelve hours later, they had an agreement, which Mactaggart and Common Sense Kids Action agreed to support. Hertzberg and Chau sent it off to the Legislature\u2019s lawyers to be formally drafted into a bill.Mactaggart had agreed to whittle down his biggest stick: The private right of action would permit consumer lawsuits only in the case of a traditional data breach, as when your credit-card information is stolen. And instead of naming every third party they shared your data with, companies would have to disclose only the kinds of data they were sharing, an obligation the companies already had to European consumers under G.D.P.R. Many privacy activists hated the deal, and some of the same groups that had refused to support Mactaggart\u2019s initiative now savaged him for compromising on it. The A.C.L.U. and E.F.F., both of which rely heavily on civil litigation to win advocacy battles, were particularly upset by the narrowed private right of action.But as Mactaggart saw it, the core of his initiative remained intact \u2014 and was in some ways strengthened. Now you could see exactly what information Silicon Valley and the data brokers had collected about you. You could still demand that they stop selling or swapping your data. And if they refused, the California attorney general could investigate and impose fines. Even in this reduced form, Mactaggart and Soltani believed, this would be the most stringent consumer-privacy law in the country \u2014 the most significant step in years toward regulating the surveillance capitalists, and a proof of concept for activists and industry alike. If it passed, the tech industry could no longer claim that no one cared about privacy, or that data rules would kill jobs, or were too technically challenging. California\u2019s attorney general could police the entire industry, while other states worked on their own versions of the rules. \u201cUnder this law, the attorney general of California will become the chief privacy officer of the United States of America,\u201d Mactaggart argued. Eventually, it might drive the tech industry back to the negotiating table in Washington, in hopes of getting a single national standard.The next morning, Hertzberg summoned tech lobbyists to a meeting. They had a simple choice, he explained. They could agree to the deal, or take their chances with Mactaggart in the fall. Hertzberg told the lobbyists they could probably scare his colleagues into killing this new bill, too. But Mactaggart\u2019s initiative was polling extraordinarily well. To beat him in November, the tech industry and its allies \u2014 the cable companies, the data brokers and the financial companies and retailers that used their data for advertising \u2014 would have to mount a huge negative campaign, at considerable cost to their own image. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll be right back here next year,\u201d Hertzberg told me later that day.Legislative staff members had finished rewriting AB 375, and a deal seemed imminent. That Friday, as he drank his morning coffee, Mactaggart decided to read the new bill \u2014 the fine print \u2014 one more time. He noticed a seemingly minor alteration in one section, the kind of thing most people would skip over. Mactaggart realized it would completely gut what remained of the private right of action. Furious, he called Hertzberg and Chau and told them the deal was off. Neither lawmaker could explain who made the change, Mactaggart told me, but Hertzberg scrambled to fix it. \u201cIn most negotiations, you are talking to all these different interest groups,\u201d Hertzberg told me recently. \u201cThis is a situation where we had to go and reach out to everyone and bring that information to Mr. Mactaggart and ask him what he wanted to do.\u201d By Monday morning, the deal was back on again.That Tuesday, Facebook signaled that it would not fight the bill. In a statement emailed to reporters, Will Castleberry said that \u201cwhile not perfect, we support AB 375 and look forward to working with policymakers on an approach that protects consumers and promotes responsible innovation.\u201d At hearings, industry representatives complained that they had been put in the impossible position of either accepting the compromise or fighting a ballot initiative they had no power to change. \u201cThe internet industry will not obstruct or block AB 375 from moving forward,\u201d the Internet Association announced, \u201cbecause it prevents the even-worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201d Soltani wryly pointed out that Mactaggart had offered Silicon Valley a take-it-or-leave-it privacy policy \u2014 the same kind that Silicon Valley usually offered everyone else.Political power is a malleable thing, Mactaggart had learned, an elaborate calculation of artifice and argument, votes and money. People and institutions \u2014 in politics, in Silicon Valley \u2014 can seem all-powerful right up to the moment they are not. And sometimes, Mactaggart discovered, a thing that can\u2019t possibly happen suddenly becomes a thing that cannot be stopped.I spoke to Mactaggart shortly after the vote. \u201cIt felt like a moment \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d he observed. A part of Mactaggart was already thinking ahead. The legislation would not take effect until 2020, and both the Legislature and the tech industry would have a chance to amend the new law beforehand. In the weeks after the vote, as Silicon Valley\u2019s accumulated troubles sent shares in Facebook and other tech companies plummeting anew, their lobbyists were back on the march. The Trump administration was convening meetings to discuss a new national privacy standard, one that would perhaps override California\u2019s newly minted statute. There would be plenty of chances for mischief. But as he basked in the victory, Mactaggart was giddy, even emotional. \u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Ludicrous Attack on Big Tech ", "Date": "2018-08-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe idea that Google and Twitter are rigging their platforms against him is patently false.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.Case in point are some tweets this week from President Trump, who wrote his umpteenth in a series of attacks on the big tech platforms.The latest sputter \u2014 that\u2019s a digital equivalent that falls between clearing your throat of mucus and vomiting slightly in your mouth \u2014 was aimed at Google. In an angry finger-tapping burst in two parts, Mr. Trump accused Google of skewing its search results against him:\u201cGoogle search results for \u2018Trump News\u2019 shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake News Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% results on \u2018Trump News\u2019 are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation \u2014 will be addressed!\u201dWill. Be. Addressed. Oh my. Is that a threat? I guess it might be if you were a low-rent version of a movie gangster, obsessively searching Google News over and over again in the middle of the night.But the big tech platforms should not be even slightly afraid since the threat is an empty one. The allegation is both wildly untrue and mostly easily proved false in all kinds of ways. (For example, I doubt that Mr. Trump has ever heard of page rank, since he recently showed he also cannot work a phone so well.)Most of all, the allegation leaves out the pertinent fact that Mr. Trump himself is the most voluble politician ever to use digital media, and his entire existence has been amplified, echoed and re-echoed over and over again by the tools that Silicon Valley has let loose on the world over the past two decades. To say nothing of the widespread belief in the United States intelligence community that Russians manipulated social media in his favor.Rather than attacking techies, he should send them a gold-embossed thank you note.Instead, as is his way, Mr. Trump huffs and puffs away on issues that have finally bubbled up to him from the ever-growing cesspool of online anger, especially the truly ludicrous idea that Silicon Valley does not like conservatives.That is obviously a joke, because, in fact, most tech leaders are more often lightweight versions of libertarians and largely apolitical except for backing gay and transgender rights and wanting to allow more qualified immigrants into the country to make more tech.Otherwise, in my reporting, I have found that they love those tax cuts and adore the repatriated income and can\u2019t get enough of deregulation. Sure, they don\u2019t cotton to the anti-climate-change nonsense Mr. Trump spews and can\u2019t stand the endless bullying, but let\u2019s stop to reflect that they have handed him all the weapons in his online arsenal to do that.So whether it\u2019s the idea that Twitter \u201cshadow bans\u201d right-wing conservatives or that Facebook and YouTube have made a left-leaning decision that a vile and mendacious actor like the Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones perhaps needs to be thrown off services for his vile and mendacious behavior, it\u2019s all codswallop.You can look that fine word up on Google if you want to know what it means, by the way. That is also where you can also reach every single conservative, alt-right and white nationalistic site in a millisecond. And Google is just one platform of so many that have allowed every one of those voices to thrive and proliferate in untold \u2014 and in some cases, dangerous \u2014 ways.It is certainly true that some of tech\u2019s egregious sins \u2014 like allowing malevolent actors to use their platforms malevolently or disadvantaging smaller start-ups from innovating, which might be covered in Senate hearings next week where top Facebook, Google and Twitter leaders are expected to appear \u2014 need to be addressed by some sort of regulation to come.But stifling even vile human speech is not one of them. It\u2019s hard to make tech giants sympathetic, but Mr. Trump has managed to pull it off with cloddish aplomb with nearly every accusation of their being unfair in this regard.Last week, for example, he tweeted: \u201cSocial Media Giants are silencing millions of people \u2026 People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship!\u201dBut it\u2019s been Mr. Trump who has led the truth-isn\u2019t-truth team that has tried its best to obfuscate facts by using social media to unleash so many lies that it drowns out all else. And it\u2019s probably no surprise that conservatives made such good use of digital tools, having most definitely been largely left out in the wilderness of the old media equation for decades until Fox News arrived on the scene.Tech has, in fact, been very, very good for conservatives from the get-go and very much so for Mr. Trump and his minions, as his 2016 digital media director and current 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, well knows.It\u2019s certainly not good for most of the rest of us, who have to wade through the ever-growing digital muck on a daily basis to utilize what is actually good about it. (It\u2019s pretty much down to the game Fortnite and meditation apps now.)What\u2019s most interesting about the coarsening of the digital media landscape, which Mr. Trump has truly been an \u201cinnoventor\u201d of (yeah, that is a term used in Silicon Valley) \u2014 is that it has had a discernibly bad impact on the very platform that he has used so well.That would be Twitter. And rather than being boosted by the Twit in chief and the reaction to the reaction to the reaction to him, usage on the platform has continued to fall. In its last earnings report, the company said it had lost one million monthly active users in the most recent quarter.While that is a result of a number of management snafus that have gone on since forever, it is also about the inability to clean up all the mess it has allowed to morph. Which is to say letting a thousand flowers bloom, despite the fact that far too many of them stink and more still are troublemaking bots.That has meant that Twitter and other social media platforms have since become so much of a toxic swamp that it is now probably impossible to clean most of it up.As one social media executive said to me recently, with an audible sigh: \u201cFor one set, we can\u2019t take enough down; for another set, we can\u2019t leave up enough. One side thinks social media enabled populism, while the other thinks the opposite. There will be no fixing this.\u201dWhich makes for a kind of digital gridlock that is perfect for Mr. Trump, even though he seems to not be in on the giant tech joke he has created.In an interview with Mr. Trump conducted by Mark Leibovich of The New York Times about a year ago, that much was clear.\u201cThey want to take away my voice,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trump declared plaintively, even as he bragged about the 54 million he reaches directly with every tweet on his @realDonaldTrump handle (along with 23 million more on @potus). \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not going to take away my social media.\u201dNo, Mr. President, they\u2019re not.

{"Headline": "Cities\u2019 Offers for Amazon Base Are Secrets Even to Many City Leaders", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJared Evans, a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council, is proud that the city is among 20 finalists for one of the most coveted prizes in the country: the planned second headquarters of Amazon.He does, however, have one small question: What financial incentives did his city dangle in front of Amazon?\u201cWhat have I been told?\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201dAcross the country, the search for HQ2, as the project has been nicknamed, is shrouded in secrecy. Even civic leaders can\u2019t find out what sort of tax credits and other inducements have been promised to Amazon. And there is a growing legal push to find out, because taxpayers could get saddled with a huge bill and have little chance to stop it.\u201cThe only time the public may become aware if the city has promised Amazon incentives is if we win and then we need to get those incentives passed,\u201d Mr. Evans said.A primary reason for the information blackout is that, in many cases, the bids were handled by local private Chamber of Commerce affiliates or economic development groups that aren\u2019t required to make their negotiations public. Many of the groups are also not covered by Freedom of Information Act or state open-records requests.But another reason is gamesmanship. Some cities say they want their Amazon proposals to remain confidential to avoid showing their hand to rivals. And Amazon required the finalists to sign nondisclosure agreements that forbid the local groups to release proprietary information about the company.\u201cI don\u2019t know what we offered Amazon in terms of financial incentives, but I believe Amazon wants to see the biggest incentive package that any city will offer them,\u201d said Leslie Pool, a member of the Austin City Council. The city, also a finalist, submitted a bid put together by the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, which had no consultations with the City Council.But that kind of transparency is the exception.\u201cWe are not releasing documents related to Amazon HQ2. We are not subject to F.O.I.A.,\u201d Michael Finney, the president and chief executive of the Miami-Dade Beacon Council, a public-private partnership that handled the Amazon bid, said in an email. Similar requests to Austin, Atlanta and Indianapolis met with similar responses.And when officials in Montgomery County, Md., did respond to a request for information on their bid, they delivered, among other items, a 10-page document of incentives \u2014 with every single line of text redacted.Companies are often stealthy when searching for a location for a critical factory or relocating a headquarters, as General Electric or Bechtel have done in recent years. And it has been reported that Apple has been holding behind-closed-doors meetings with government leaders as it shops for a new corporate campus.In the case of Amazon, it is the size and scope of its search that some officials find shocking \u2014 and galling.\u201cTypically, you see companies bid a couple of places against each other as they try to land a corporate deal,\u201d said Brad Lander, a member of the New York City Council who has not seen the city\u2019s proposal to Amazon. (New York is a finalist.) \u201cThis process is highly unusual. It creates a real race-to-the-bottom aspect with the potential of companies bidding multiple cities against one another.\u201dIt is unclear how much promised tax credits and financial incentives will weigh into Amazon\u2019s decision. Three of the first four questions Amazon asked cities to answer in their proposals were centered on incentives. But the e-commerce giant also sought information on possible building sites, the local labor force, transit options, computer science programs in local schools and cost-of-living data.The cities see more at stake than just the jobs and investment that Amazon\u2019s second headquarters would bring. Amazon says its presence and investment in Seattle have created an additional 53,000 jobs beyond its own direct hires and added $38 billion to Seattle\u2019s economy from 2010 to 2016.But there have also been serious downsides for the city. In a be-careful-of-what-you-ask-for address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors this summer, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said that housing prices in her city average $824,000, that rents have soared 57 percent in the last five years and that there are 4,000 homeless people on the streets every night.Those are the types of concerns raised by Ms. Pool, the Austin councilwoman. Ms. Pool said she thought her city lacked the infrastructure and housing to accommodate 50,000 high-paying jobs and that such fast growth would alter the city\u2019s socioeconomic makeup and quality of life.\u201cThis is a city where you want to put down roots,\u201d Ms. Pool said. \u201cThe people here are the friendliest. The parks are beautiful. But if someone like Amazon comes in, a big con is the massive amount of dislocation it causes. You put out the small businesses and longtime property owners, the very businesses and people that give the city its flavor and, I would argue, its brand.\u201dStill, the project is too good to pass up, even for some of the nation\u2019s mayors who are most focused on housing and affordability, such as Bill de Blasio of New York and Rahm Emanuel of Chicago.\u201cThey are about ending inequality and creating more inclusive cities,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the School of Cities and the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. \u201cNow they\u2019re in a game competing with one another to throw money at one of the most powerful companies in the world run by one of the world\u2019s richest men.\u201dMr. Florida was on the board of directors for Toronto Global, whose bid is one of the 20 finalists, but he said he resigned this year so that he could raise concerns about the general lack of transparency in the bidding.\u201cI think the lack of transparency of this whole process is galling,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be all out in the public. This is taxpayer money.\u201dEventually, the taxpayers whose area wins will have to be told how much money Amazon was promised. And when they discover how much they will have to hand over, Mr. Florida said, \u201cthere is going to be hell to pay.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Shares of Whirlpool, Alcoa and General Motors tumbled after the companies warned of the financial hit from the higher costs related in part to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum.So far, the tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the United States and China have had little impact on Sonos, the company said. But as trade tensions ramp up, Sonos looks particularly vulnerable.In its filing with the S.E.C. ahead of its I.P.O., Sonos warned that tariffs were a potential risk to anyone buying its shares:If the tariff list remains unaltered, all of our inbound products to the United States would be subject to a 10 percent tariff assessed on the cost of goods as imported. If these duties are imposed on our products, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations.Of course, the trade worries only add to the list of more traditional investor concerns. The company, which started life as a multiroom speaker maker, has more recently ridden the wave of smart speakers. That has put the company in the position of both teaming up and competing with heavyweights like Amazon, Google and Apple.Sonos\u2019s growth is slower than some recent I.P.O.s as well. The company\u2019s revenue rose just 10 percent in its last fiscal year. For comparison, Spotify grew 37 percent and Dropbox 31 percent in the year before they went public.And a red flag for those looking to buy into the I.P.O.: Sonos\u2019s existing shareholders accounted for 8.3 million of the shares sold in the offering.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Classical Myths Filtered Through a Modern Prism", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.We are living in an age of great cultural interest in ancient myths, including TV dramas (\u201cTroy: Fall of a City\u201d), literary retellings (Neil Gaiman\u2019s compelling \u201cNorse Mythology\u201d), novels that reinvent myth in a modern context (Kamila Shamsie\u2019s brilliant \u201cHome Fire\u201d) and novels set in the classical past (Madeline Miller\u2019s moving \u201cCirce\u201d). In times of sweeping change, myths provide a way of thinking about big questions like transformation, power, agency and responsibility, and these ancient stories have the great advantage, in a polarized, partisan age, of being ecumenical: They belong to none of us, and to us all.For Zachary Mason, a computer scientist as well as the author of three works of fiction, ancient myth is an opportunity to explore the emptiness of life and the infinite variety of narrative. His 2010 book, \u201cThe Lost Books of the Odyssey,\u201d was a sequence of cleverly Borgesian short stories that imagined variations within the framework of the Homeric poem.The title of his new work, \u201cMetamorphica,\u201d nods to Ovid\u2019s \u201cMetamorphoses,\u201d and Ovid bookends the collection. In the first story Ovid begs to trade \u201canything, everything\u201d for literary immortality. The final piece returns to Ovid, now in exile on the Black Sea, writing a letter to Emperor Augustus to plead for a repeal of his sentence. The letter gets soiled, slashed, mildewed and translated into multiple languages, until the \u201cfalse and worthless letters are as numerous as the grains of sand in a desert.\u201d None reach within even a thousand miles of Rome, where, in any case, the emperor would probably not open them. The piece is a fable about bad postal service and the difficulties of communicating before email and video chat. But it also offers one of many variations on Mason\u2019s central theme: Where we may expect to find meaning, there is none. The lesson can feel profound or sophomoric, depending on how much patience you have for this kind of thing.Mason takes the memorable female characters of classical myth \u2014 goddesses, prophets, rape victims, noble heroines, killers of family members, witches, Amazons, adulteresses and athletes \u2014 and turns them into ciphers. He reduces the number of rapes; Persephone, Daphne and Thetis, for example, are willing participants in their liaisons. But he also reduces female agency to more or less nothing. Helen is a phantom, alienated from her own story. Daphne is not an emblem of poetic inspiration, but \u201can ordinarily pretty girl,\u201d replicated throughout eternity as an endless sequence of equally ordinary pretty girls. Eurydice, the beloved of Orpheus, is \u201cless a lover than a trope of literature.\u201d Clytemnestra\u2019s triumphant slaughter of her daughter-killing husband \u201cfades into nothing.\u201d Athena, a terrifying military goddess, becomes a needy girl with a crush on Odysseus.Mason\u2019s male characters live almost equally meaningless lives, although they have a somewhat wider set of interests and exercise their own power through poetry, close male friendships and (always heterosexual) sex. As in Ovid, Zeus is a serial rapist, and Mason provides disturbingly lyrical descriptions of his abusive pleasure (\u201cher will dissolves like a sandbank in the tide\u201d). But even rape fails to give Zeus\u2019 life meaning. When another version of Athena robs and challenges him, he manages only to substitute one kind of frustration for another.Mason\u2019s twist on the story of Midas reminds us that money has no fixed meaning or value. Midas becomes the inventor of money, \u201ca necessary myth for our time\u201d: After the loss of his friend, Dionysos, he melts down his family\u2019s treasures into coinage, and in so doing, erases history and memory. In the ancient version of the myth, as in Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s great retelling, \u201cThe Golden Touch,\u201d there is an insistence that some things \u2014 like eating and drinking, and the people we love \u2014 might be incommensurate with money. Mason eliminates this thread, along with more or less every element in the body of Greco-Roman myth that smacks of ethics, or suggests that anything we do matters.Death is a common theme, and death is usually not scary but void. When Zeus takes the islands, and Poseidon the seas around them, Death plays the winning card: He claims \u201cthe emptiness within them.\u201d Elysium, the place of bliss provided for warriors after death, becomes an infinite series of rock pools in which Menelaus, husband of Helen, can collect and catalog mollusks with only a vague \u201cintuition for an order\u201d that might one day emerge; the work shields him from the pain of death and from his wife, who has \u201cnever been kind.\u201d The Greek myths, in Mason\u2019s hands, are like those mollusks: a vast set of items to collect and catalog, offering glimpses of a pattern, and a bleakly comforting escape from the world of feelings and human beings.An earlier version of this review misidentified the author\u2019s last book. It was \u201cVoid Star,\u201d published in 2017, not \u201cThe Lost Books of the Odyssey\u201d (2010).Emily Wilson is a professor of classics at the University of Pennsylvania. Her translation of \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d will be published in paperback this November.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Ride Share to Rickshaw: Wedding-Shopping Adventures in India", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "Personal JourneysChampagne and cake? Try chai and samosas: A bride-to-be returns to India to shop for her wedding in a bumpy, smog-filled trip, in-laws in tow.Supported byOn a Tuesday in December, from the dark corridors of the Delhi Metro, we climbed the staircase of the Chawri Bazar station single file, me last, since I had no idea where we were going. We emerged on the fringes of a traffic circle, into a thick, hazy smog that clung to our skin and throat and nostrils, and formed a film that for the next three weeks, would never really go away.Around us, on a chaotic street that used to anchor a 19th-century hardware bazaar, a million negotiations were taking place: chai vendors negotiating the ratio of tea to milk, tailors negotiating the price of stitching a blouse, drivers negotiating traffic, pedestrians negotiating drivers. My soon-to-be father-in-law, a New Delhi native and the Magellan of this city, brokered a deal of his own. He hailed two rickshaws \u2014 the three-wheel kind powered by people, not motors \u2014 told each where to go, the price he would pay \u2014 no motors, no meters \u2014 and motioned for his son and me, borderline millennials more accustomed to ride sharing than rickshaws, to hoist ourselves into one, while he and my mother-in-law expertly climbed into the other. The seats faced backward, offering an uninterrupted view of Old Delhi\u2019s traffic-thronged streets, crumbling facades and canopy of power lines.\u201cHow is this legal?\u201d I asked, staring up at a lethal-looking knot of electrical wires, not really expecting an answer. The driver started pedaling. I clutched onto the bar in front of me like a child on a roller coaster. We hit a bump in the road; I screamed.Some brides shop for their weddings while holding flutes of champagne. I could barely hold my phone long enough to take a selfie.Back in Los Angeles, where we live and much of our extended family does too, reality set in: It would be prohibitively expensive. A lot of our loved ones wouldn\u2019t be able to make the trip, what with the cost, their kids, their jobs. We\u2019d have so little control over the final product, planning a wedding from half a world away. But a \u201cpro\u201d had always been that it would be easier to find outfits and accouterments for our multiday Hindu wedding \u2014 we\u2019re culturally Hindu, if not the most religiously observant \u2014 in India than in the United States, where the selection along strips like Oak Tree Road (Edison and Iselin, N.J.) and Pioneer Boulevard (Artesia, Calif.) pales in comparison to that of shops in the motherland, where clothing rods sag with the weight of ornately beaded outfits, and proprietors pull ever more options from the back, loath to lose out on a potential sale.I knew from experience. I had been married before and purchased a gorgeous, peacock feather-festooned lehenga, the two-piece bridal gown native to North India, online. But I failed to diet or exercise enough to be comfortable showing a six-inch swath of my midriff, as the outfit did, and six weeks before my wedding in New York, panicked and bought a less revealing lehenga from a store in Jackson Heights, Queens. The photos make me cringe.There were other reasons to return to India: my fianc\u00e9\u2019s aforementioned grandfather, along with many relatives that we rarely see. My in-laws, whom I referred to with the reverential Auntie and Uncle, go back every December. If we went with them, I\u2019d have an opportunity to bond with the tight-knit family I was marrying into before I walked down the aisle again, something I knew was more important than the \u201cwow\u201d factor of the centerpieces. The memories banked during this trip could carry us through Thanksgivings and Christmases to come. My fianc\u00e9 and I would have an army to help us wade through the sea of bridal gowns, lehengas and achkans, the knee-length jacket worn by North Indian grooms, and we could also get wedding invitations made for less than we\u2019d pay in the United States.The caveat: since we were in his parents\u2019 old stomping-grounds, they would dictate the order of operations, which is why, within 12 hours of landing, we were barreling through the streets of Old Delhi in bicycle rickshaws, trying to find an alley that my father-in-law promised was lined with wedding invitation makers (many of whom also printed ornate business cards and stationery). Our goal: design the invitations and get them into production as soon as possible, so they\u2019d arrive in Los Angeles by early January.After 10 minutes that felt like much more than that, our rickshaws pulled to a stop near a stand of pomegranates. \u201cLet\u2019s check out a few shops, see the selection,\u201d my father-in-law said. (As the founder of a Los Angeles clothing manufacturing company, he\u2019s always on the hunt for a good deal.) If I was looking for Amazon, here it was: hole in the wall after hole in the wall, hundreds of them, hawking invitations as thick as hardcover books, some the size of shoe boxes.1/4 mileHaldiram'schandni chowk rd.Indu Fashionsold delhiindianai sarakjogiwaraChandni Chowkchawri bazar rd.R.

We returned to a more crowded Delhi than the one we left. Two weeks into our trip, my cousin-in-law, his parents and his girlfriend arrived, which meant there were now 11 people sharing a three-bedroom apartment. The teakettle in the kitchen started whistling at 5:30 each morning; showers ran cold after the first three. Family breakfasts of samosas, masala scrambled eggs and many, many cups of coffee got us to laugh about whatever funny thing had happened the day before \u2014 like me telling an Uber driver, \u201cno habla Hindi.\u201dWe piled back into the metro and then into rickshaws. I grumbled as we dodged mud puddles and scooters and stray dogs. Through an alley, up a dark, steep staircase, in an airless room where a graphic designer worked on a Windows desktop that couldn\u2019t have been made more recently than 1999, I understood: we had to sit there and review the invitation line by line. This part of town valued clients who communicated in person rather than over Wi-Fi.There was one more must-see on my list: Sabyasachi. Even though I had bought a gown for my sangeet and a lehenga for my wedding and loved both outfits (thought of them fondly, like pets), before leaving Delhi, I wanted to visit the place that informed what I first imagined I might look like as Bride 2.0.Four of us Ubered from the apartment to Sabyasachi\u2019s New Delhi flagship, in a gated colonial mansion shielded from the road by a row of tall hedges. On the second floor, in a low-lit room perfumed by dozens of fresh roses, there it was: the gown I\u2019d been eyeing on Instagram for months, that I had envisioned getting married in before even knowing how to pronounce the designer\u2019s name (Saab-yah-saa-chee). It was even more stunning in person, yards of velvet-studded netting and beads that folded and draped into a robe of epic effect.An attendant helped me into it; my fianc\u00e9 and soon-to-be family oohed and ahhed. But standing on a pedestal, in front of a panel of full-length mirrors, I realized the gown would be perfect for the type of wedding \u2014 and marriage \u2014 that I wasn\u2019t going to have. The dress inhibited movement and revelry. It was for standing on stage and posing for photographs, not dancing to Cardi B. I had done right to go with outfits that reflected my lifestyle, not that ephemeral \u201cwow\u201d factor.The day after the wedding, I apologized to my mother-in-law (I avoided family titles in the interim). She laughed and said, \u201cI thought it was kind of funny, but then you kept doing it and it sounded nice!\u201d She didn\u2019t want to hurt my feelings. I didn\u2019t want to be inaccurate. I asked her what I should call her, now that I was officially her daughter-in-law. Her answer: mom.Sheila Marikar, a contributor based in Los Angeles, is writing a novel about denizens of the gig economy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Writer\u2019s Trip Into the Amazon Reveals Brazil and Himself", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.A year after Chris Feliciano Arnold traveled to Brazil, his country of birth, to cover the 2014 World Cup, he decided to return and tell a different, more hidden story. He reached out to a government press officer he had met in Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas, and received a message telling him, basically, to steer clear of the region and its people.The Amazon had become a violent wasteland, Arnold was warned. The official lamented that indigenous communities were withering as alcohol and teenage suicide hollowed out tribes and suggested a handful of brighter destinations in the continent-sized nation. \u201cGet out of there, buddy,\u201d the source wrote. \u201cIndians are a worn-out clich\u00e9. Go see the real Brazil. Sorry to be harsh.\u201dIt is fortunate that Arnold disregarded that advice and spent months slogging through the Amazon to research his debut book, \u201cThe Third Bank of the River.\u201d The result is a valuable addition to contemporary reportage out of Brazil, which has understandably been dominated by the country\u2019s tumultuous politics, systemic corruption and rising middle class.The book, a collection of vignettes that at times feels disjointed, has two main themes. One is the mounting threats indigenous communities face as logging, agriculture and mining encroach ever more aggressively into pristine corners of the world\u2019s largest tropical rain forest. The second is a searing look at the toll violence is taking on residents of the Amazon as drug-smuggling groups battle over key routes. The mayhem is compounded by overcrowded prisons and trigger-happy police officers who sometimes carry out extrajudicial killings.Arnold\u2019s account of the threats to indigenous communities \u2014 informed by a comprehensive and accessible litany of the abuses they have endured since colonial times \u2014 is the highlight of the book.His vivid tale of an ambush by members of an uncontacted tribe, desperate for food, who pounce on a settled indigenous village nicely sets up an urgent, fascinating question: Should these remote tribes be left alone or should the government establish contact for the sake of immunizing them from preventable diseases that can easily obliterate communities that have not been exposed to the outside world?Somewhat frustratingly, Arnold does not offer his own verdict, leaving readers to consider which might be the best of bad options.His rendering of the violence afflicting the Amazon \u2014 a key battleground in a pandemic of violence that killed a record number of people in Brazil in 2016 \u2014 is less captivating.Arnold\u2019s use of imagined quotes to add dramatic flair to a couple of scenes in the book is unsettling, raising questions about the reliability of the rest of the reporting. In relaying a negotiation between an imprisoned drug trafficker and a senior law enforcement official, Arnold introduces a lively exchange saying \u201cthe conversation must have gone something like this.\u201d Later, he suggests that a band of dirty cops may have been chugging rum and snorting cocaine while gunning down suspected drug traffickers from a vehicle, again blending reporting with supposition.Arnold\u2019s Brazilian roots are part of what make him a compelling chronicler of the country\u2019s ills. Raised in Oregon by American parents who adopted him in the southern city of Belo Horizonte as an infant, Arnold developed a yearning to explore his roots after college.\u201cBrazil is in my blood,\u201d he writes. When he first returned in his mid-20s as a backpacker, he says, \u201cthe experience stirred something dormant inside me.\u201dBecause Arnold is not quite an outsider and not quite a native, following his travels through the Amazon feels like witnessing a deeper exploration of his identity. In one amusing passage, he ignores advice to remain safely on the Colombian side of a border town, and attributes his decision to \u201cmy stunted but stubborn sense of Brazilian patriotism.\u201dThis facet of the book reaches a riveting climax toward the end, when Arnold describes an encounter with his birth family that almost didn\u2019t happen.It is, of course, Arnold\u2019s prerogative to be circumspect about what must have been a deeply moving encounter. But the scene, which is short and devoid of details, feels like a missed opportunity, leaving the reader wondering what was said during an almost certainly crucial moment in Arnold\u2019s quest to make sense of Brazil.Ernesto Londo\u00f1o has been The Times\u2019s Brazil bureau chief since July 2017.Advertisement"}

Earlier this week, I changed planes in England after reporting at the Tour de France, and was stunned to see the grounds of Windsor Castle as brown and desiccated as the landscape I\u2019d just witnessed in southern France.In Japan, where record temperatures have made some outdoor pools too hot for swimmers, the consequences have been severe.

{"Headline": "The Knicks Make It to the Finals \u2014 in an Alternate Reality", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a recent Friday night, the Knicks and the Wizards jogged out of the locker rooms in a red brick warehouse in Long Island City and tossed white towels into the outstretched arms of cheering fans.A sportscaster\u2019s booming voice introduced the players to a couple hundred in attendance, who watched from seats arranged like bleachers. On two jumbo screens, the virtual players could be seen loosening up with shoulder rolls and elbow bumps while the Knicks and the Wizards sat down in black pleather chairs and put on headsets. A few cleaned their fingers with alcohol pads before picking up their controllers and pushing their faces toward computer monitors placed only a few inches from their noses.This is N.B.A. 2K, the first official esports league operated by a professional American sports league.The video game league, a joint venture between the N.B.A. and the game developer Take-Two, started its inaugural season on May 1. Its games are live-streamed to hundreds of thousands of fans across the world on the online platform Twitch. The games are played in front of a live audience in a flashy new studio in Long Island City, Queens, which opened in April. Here on the banks of the East River, the basketball court is a circle of computers. The locker rooms are internet cafe-like spaces where players warm up before a game. The competition is fueled by sugar-free Red Bull, pigs-in-a-blanket and Gatorade in every color.The Knicks lost that game, 80-68, but have since rebounded, winning enough games to make it to the league finals against the Heat.\u201cFrom the N.B.A.\u2019s standpoint, this is our fourth league,\u201d said Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., referring to the N.B.A.\u2019s other properties, including the W.N.B.A. and the N.B.A. G League. \u201cWhile the N.B.A. 2K League is a new concept, because it\u2019s a virtual league, we think we can take the same expertise and experience in operating traditional leagues and bring that to the world of gaming.\u201dThe N.B.A. 2k League has several similarities with the N.B.A. \u2014 with a few obvious differences.There are 17 teams this year; the N.B.A. has 30. The average age of the gamers is 23; it\u2019s 27 in the N.B.A. Each 2K team is affiliated with an N.B.A. franchise, like the Pistons, the Celtics or the Jazz, and the players live and practice in their home markets. The 2K teams have six players; N.B.A. teams have a minimum of 14.The gamers might not be making millions, but there are a few perks: Free housing. Free training. And the opportunity for self-promotion.Every weekend, all 102 players in the league (except for the Knicks) are flown to New York from regional training centers across the country to compete in Long Island City. Even though it\u2019s an online venture, games during the 17-week season are played in person to avoid connectivity issues.For the 2K Knicks, practice begins at 10 a.m. at 11 Penn Plaza, a building in front of Madison Square Garden. The team spends about eight hours with their coach, scrimmaging, studying match videos and working on strategy. The players \u2014 who are from South Carolina, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Virginia and the Bronx \u2014 are advised on what foods to eat, how to disconnect before bed and how to develop better sleep habits.\u201cPracticing before, oh, my God, it was insane,\u201d said the 2K Knicks player Marc Rodriguez, 22, from the Bronx, of his gaming before going pro. He began playing the video game N.B.A. 2K at age 10. By middle school, he would regularly play until 3 a.m. \u201cI used to have rough mornings,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I would get home again after school, take like an hour nap, and then I would get back on the game.\u201dBefore being drafted, the 2K Knicks players were students or held mostly entry level jobs: country club locker room attendant, salesman for a trucking company, YouTube content creator, Amazon warehouse employee. Their day jobs, however, came second to 2K.Idris Richardson, 22, the center for the 2K Knicks, comes from South Carolina, where he boxed and shipped commercial heaters, and later moved to Detroit. He said he never liked playing basketball in real life, but for him, N.B.A. 2K was an escape.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have 2K, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting in this chair; I\u2019d be in jail or dead,\u201d said Mr. Richardson, who described a tough life in Detroit. \u201cEverywhere I go I hear gunshots or sirens 24/7. So it was like, let me stay in the house. I know I\u2019m safe.\u201dWhen drafting players, scouts look for players with \u201cstick skills\u201d and those who know the game of basketball well.\u201cYou really can look at it the same way as you would in traditional basketball,\u201d said Jerry Ferrara, a scout for the 2K Knicks and the actor best known for his role as Turtle in \u201cEntourage,\u2019\u2019 the HBO series. \u201cIs he making the right plays and not forcing shots? That guy is only interested in scoring. That guy withdraws in the fourth quarter, what\u2019s up with that? Could we coach him differently? Coachability is a big factor.\u201dMr. Ferrara said he conducted interviews on Skype with more than 100 players before draft day in April, factoring in natural playing ability, character and a player\u2019s love for the game, he said. He described the 2K Knicks players as a bunch of social media-savvy, brand-conscious go-getters.\u201cThe stereotype of the hairy guy, in his boxers, overweight, eating Doritos and playing video games \u2014 yeah, that still exists \u2014 but that\u2019s more the casual player, like me, than the pro gamer,\u201d Mr. Ferrara said. \u201cPro gamers now are busy, motivated young people who get it. They\u2019re having sponsorship meetings, and the popular ones are running full on brands and the aspiring ones see that blueprint now and are following suit.\u201dIn the games, the players control avatars who stand a foot taller, or more, than they are. But they bear a passing resemblance: The players could scan their faces and have them mapped on to their characters. Other attributes were left up to the players.\u201cSome have mohawks, or accessories, and some are different races than their avatars,\u201d said Brendan Donohue, the managing director of the N.B.A. 2K League.Some women competed in the tryouts, but none made the final cut, and at the moment, N.B.A. 2K doesn\u2019t support female avatars.\u201cWe\u2019re working on that,\u201d Mr. Donohue said.As the popularity of sport simulation games grows, more popular video games \u2014 like League of Legends and DOTA 3 \u2014 still dominate the video game world.The N.B.A. 2K League said an average of 300,000 unique viewers watch individual game broadcasts this year. In comparison, Overwatch, a popular first-person shooting game, averaged 830,000 daily worldwide viewers at its grand finale at Barclays Center last month, according to the game\u2019s developer. A single League of Legends match during the game\u2019s 2017 World Championship in Beijing saw 80 million unique viewers, according to the developer. Last season, the N.B.A. said that regular games averaged around 1.3 million television viewers.Still, Mr. Silver said, N.B.A. 2K viewers are more likely to attend a game in person or watch one on television after they have watched a 2K match on Twitch, and the league is closely watching to see if the cities, like New York or Cleveland or Memphis, will rally around their hometown players.\u201cIt\u2019s a big experiment to see if the geographical ties that are used to build a fan base, whether that can translate into a virtual world,\u201d Mr. Silver said. \u201cThat is a new concept.\u201dAfter the season, the players plan on returning to school and finding new jobs. Nate Kahl, the Knicks power forward, is considering driving for Uber.Mr. Rodriguez said he will go back to his retail job at GameStop and living with his mother in the Bronx, where he\u2019ll continue to grind at 2K.\u201cAt this point the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep breaking barriers after barriers and continue to pursue my dreams.\u201dAdvertisement"}

France, its chief executive and chairman, was pulled over in Sag Harbor, N.Y., Sunday night.France, 56, quickly announced he would take an indefinite leave of absence. His uncle, Jim France, will take over his responsibilities in the interim.Nascar has a substance abuse policy that applies to the \u201cmisuse\u201d of alcohol and prescription drugs. It is unclear if this policy applies to executives, or whether the family-controlled sport will penalize its chief executive.During a radio interview after the report, France said, \u201cRumors are always interesting, but they\u2019re seldom right. The France family is locked and loaded in its dedication to Nascar.\u201dHe did not deny the existence of exploratory discussions, however.Selling a stake in Nascar would be complicated. The France family doesn\u2019t disclose the exact ownership stake of each family member.According to a number of sports, business and media executives consulted for this article, none of whom would agree to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of Brian France\u2019s arrest, buying Nascar would not make a lot of sense for a private equity firm, in part because there are no easy solutions to Nascar\u2019s problems.A buyer looking to boost its value and sell in a few years \u2014 the usual playbook for private equity \u2014 would have difficulty. The next owner of Nascar will have to play the long game of developing the next generation of fans.Nascar\u2019s television ratings have followed the same trend, and are down by about half since 2005. The rating for the sport\u2019s marquee race, the Daytona 500, continues to fall. The age of the average Nascar viewer is 58, and the fan base is skewing older faster than that of any other sport.These difficulties aren\u2019t unique to Nascar. Every sport is challenged by younger fans who aren\u2019t inclined to spend hours in a stadium or in front of their TVs. Ratings across television have been falling for a decade. Sports is not immune. College football and baseball have suffered large attendance drops, and the N.F.L.\u2019s television ratings are down 19 percent in just the last two years.But a potential buyer of Nascar would receive only its rule book and media rights, not tracks or teams. International Speedway Corp., known as I.S.C., owns 13 tracks and the Motor Racing Network. It is a publicly traded company. The France family owns a controlling stake, but it is separate from the Nascar stake. Experts say a potential buyer for Nascar would likely want to buy control of I.S.C. as well.Even that would not guarantee success. For years stock car racing has struggled to develop star drivers as fan favorites like Tony Stewart, Jeff Gordon and especially Dale Earnhardt Jr. retired.Sunday night in Watkins Glen, N.Y. an heir might have emerged. Chase Elliott, the 22-year-old son of Nascar Hall of Famer Bill Elliott, won a Cup Series race for the first time.A few hours after Elliott\u2019s win, France \u2014 who did not attend the race \u2014 was being pulled over on the other side of the state by the police.Nascar does has a number of positive attributes, according to financial analysts. It may be a family business, but the organization has professional marketing and sales teams that are widely respected.Its media rights also retain value. Besides the main Nascar Cup Series, Nascar has other lower-tier racing series, such as the Xfinity Series and Camping World Truck Series, providing hundreds of hours of content. Its schedule also runs in the summer, when there is a dearth of competitive sports.Now it just has to find its way out of this difficult summer.Advertisement"}

The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index has soared more than 320 percent since emerging from the rubble of the financial crisis in March 2009, creating more than $18 trillion in wealth. But the gains haven\u2019t been spread among the masses. Stock market wealth is heavily concentrated among the richest families.The motivation looks unchanged, however. More from Sheera Frenkel and Nicholas Fandos of the NYT:The aims of the latest campaigns appeared to be similar to those of past operations on the social network: to distribute false news that might cause confusion among people, and to alter people\u2019s thinking to become more partisan or pro-government on various issues.Amazon\u2019s $13.4 deal for Whole Foods started a trend. Traditional grocery retailers are lusting after digital technology; online companies are seeing benefits in bricks and mortar. See, for instance, Kroger partnering with the online grocer Ocado to automate ordering; Target acquiring the same-day delivery company Shipt; and the e-commerce start-up Boxed selling a minority stake to Aeon Group, one of Japan\u2019s largest retail chains.Food shopping is one of the last major holdouts to online retail. Groceries are unique in that their inventory is perishable, fragile and heavy. Grocery customers often shop at the last minute, like to see the food they are about to eat and don\u2019t want to pay high delivery fees.Chieh Huang, the C.E.O. of Boxed, poses the big question: \u201cAre technology folks like us going to figure out retail faster than the retailers figure out technology?\u201d\u2022 Some 40 percent of U.S. businesses are now female-owned, up from 29 percent in 2007.\u2022 Women of color made much of the difference. While the number of women-owned businesses grew 58 percent from 2007 to 2018, the number owned by women of color grew 163 percent.\u2022 But employment and revenues aren\u2019t on the same course. All these businesses are responsible for 8 percent of total employment (it was 6 percent in 2007) and claim 4.3 percent of total business revenue (up from 4 percent).DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Teachers and Students Speak Out When School Gets Real", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow do you connect what you\u2019re learning in the classroom with what\u2019s going on in the world outside of school?Whitney Lawrence, an elementary school teacher from Texas, explains why making those connections is so important:\u201cAs educators, we are expected to walk into our classrooms and pretend that the social, political and environmental issues consuming the world outside of the classroom are not taking place. We are to continue on, teaching our mandated state standards and steer clear of \u2018controversial topics.\u2019 But let\u2019s be honest. What educator went in on Feb. 15\u201d \u2014 the day after the school shooting in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 \u201cwithout facing questions of safety, school shootings, teachers carrying guns, or a number of other concerns from their students? We are doing our children a disservice by not having critical conversations, exploring current events and issues, and building a capacity to make the world better.\u201dKendall Dunn, 18In the day and age of wealth, where consumerism is ubiquitous, it\u2019s become acceptable to compulsively fill desires through material gains, such as new clothes or electronics. After all, if we have the capability to harmlessly buy whatever we desire, then what\u2019s wrong with instant satisfaction? The problem is that we constantly reward ourselves, which in turn causes us to feel less grateful for items we receive.Just like the inhabitants of Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World,\u201d we seek products to provide short bursts of satisfaction and often ignore more wholesome alternatives. Similar to the imaginary civilians in \u201cBrave New World,\u201d we are surrounded by consumables that are marketed for being quick: Amazon Prime, faster internet, minute-microwave rice, etc. Even subpar TV dinners can seem more attractive than a home-cooked meal because of its immediate nature. However, better things come to those who wait.Sera Eviner, 16Why is #MeToo happening now? Why are all of these women all of a sudden sharing their stories? These questions seem to puzzle many, yet there is a simple answer: Newton\u2019s first two laws of motion can easily explain the growth of the #MeToo movement. Newton\u2019s first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.While the initial force is debatable \u2014 whether it be President Trump\u2019s locker room talk, the growing women\u2019s rights movement, or simply women banding together against Harvey Weinstein \u2014 it is evident that a strong force had pushed this moment into action. The once silenced women gained courage and support to speak up; this cause that was once at rest, is now in motion and will remain in motion.Andrea B., 17Whether heroes take the form of a mighty Anglo-Saxon warrior like Beowulf or a fierce princess like Wonder Woman, the people who rise up to lead us out of the shadows of death are cultivated by the trials they face and the hope for a brighter future that we project upon them, which are often rooted in the injustices we experience.Victoria Li, 16Sinking into pillows with a pair of fuzzy socks hugging my feet, I lost myself in the world of \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d Beyond the ball gowns and fancy cars, a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu washed over me. I realized that the same issues F. Scott Fitzgerald was commenting on in 1925 still exist today.We live in a society suffering from a severe lack of authenticity. There is no substance beneath our shiny exterior of purported principles. Maybe some of our historical documents provide a gilded barrier between what we say we represent and what we actually are.Abby VanLonkhuyzen, 16The motivations behind the Chinese Exclusion Act and President Trump\u2019s executive order barring people from seven Muslim countries are shockingly similar. Both were designed to limit the immigration of one particular ethnic group. But unlike the Chinese Exclusion Act, the president\u2019s executive order faced harsh criticism and was challenged in court on several occasions.Despite similarities between the two laws, the American people have learned a lot in the last 100 years. We\u2019ve learned that immigration doesn\u2019t hurt the economy \u2014 it might even help it. We\u2019ve learned that, true to American beliefs, the color of a person\u2019s skin or the religion they practice does not matter.Betsy Jenifer, 18Considering that \u201cDr. Faustus\u201d was written in the 16th century, during the Renaissance, it is surprising and even baffling that it is more relevant now than ever before. Today, everybody wants to be famous. Everyone wants to be noticed, loved and desired by everyone else. They want to raise eyebrows and swivel heads the moment they walk into a room and be important enough to make people stop chewing their food at the mention of their name.In Christopher Marlowe\u2019s play, Faustus\u2019s unbridled ambitions tragically lead to his downfall. After 24 years of enjoying all worldly pleasures, Lucifer along with his armada of devils drag Faustus into hell for eternity as he cries out.Jackson Edwards, Wesley Gow, Jack Trent, Jaya Krishnan, 17\u201cInvisible Man,\u201d Ralph Ellison\u2019s bildungsroman centered around an unnamed black protagonist (written to be symbolic of any black man), should not be relevant today. Ideally, \u201cInvisible Man\u201d should serve as a dated reminder of America\u2019s racial history; unfortunately, its underlying themes remain just as prevalent today as they were when Ellison first released the novel 66 years ago.Students are identified as they originally submitted their work to the Learning Network, so locations and some full names are missing.Jeff Baird, BrooklynEvery year my eighth-grade students choose a modern-day issue of injustice that they would like to learn more about, and take action toward solving. This has resulted in everything from Instagram accounts about our society\u2019s beauty standards, to musical fund-raisers for LGBTQ+ rights groups, to creative writing pieces, artwork and political letters that urge others to help victims of police brutality, mass incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline.Heidi Echternacht, Princeton, N.J.Our second-grade class explored community all last year. First, we interviewed and drew portraits of each other in class. Then we interviewed people who worked at school and drew their portraits for a community art show. Next, we expanded into Princeton and toured the town, interviewing chefs, firefighters and the mayor, and had an art show in the town library featuring our interviews and portraits.After that, the kids decided to invent their own town they called \u201c2ndton.\u201d They wanted to have stores, use money and hold court to solve problems, so we did. They wanted to pay taxes, so we did that, too. We were going to have an election for mayor, but they decided against it in case people\u2019s feelings got hurt. Finally, we started our own newspaper and wrote about topics ranging from biographies of people in the N.J. Hall of Fame to national news about Donald Trump and the Women\u2019s March.We reported world news, primarily through covering the Olympics. We had subscribers and delivery routes that were coordinated by students and charged 10 cents for a subscription and a penny per paper. We put out a paper twice a week for six weeks. At the end, each student wrote an essay on community, citizenship and democracy.Julie Mann, QueensMy human rights class for high school ESL students has always been built around current events; I never know what I\u2019m going to teach until life happens.Since the new administration took over, our class has been very focused around immigrant rights: travel bans, ICE raids, DACA, the myth of the criminal immigrant, and now the separation of families. This is the first time we\u2019ve ever made our own population the focus of the human rights class, and I am guessing this is going to continue into next year.Kellyn McNamara, Charlotte, N.C.I am designing an earth and environmental science class in which students will connect a current event or issue to each unit\u2019s content. For instance, for unit 1, earth as a planet, students will explore the history of space exploration (and its funding), and prepare for a Lincoln-Douglas style debate in which they will argue either for federal funding of space exploration or for privatized space exploration.Susan Barber, AtlantaMy students would say that one of the best things they did last year was read Clint Smith\u2019s collection of poetry \u201cCounting Descent,\u201d then Skype with him when we finished. As a literature teacher, I can choose all types of texts to teach reading skills, but I love bringing in modern works and voices to help students explore current issues.Many told me they had never read anything like \u201cCounting Descent\u201d in school and it offered them, predominantly upper-middle-class white teenagers, an avenue to consider a different perspective on race and coming-of-age than what they are typically exposed to in suburban Atlanta.Savannah Lodge-Scharff, Roxbury, Mass.Mark Drago, Somerville, Mass.Elizabeth Misiewicz, Ridgefield, Conn.Last year, my middle-school students had to write speeches on topics they were passionate about, and that they could tie to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, then deliver them to an audience of around 100 made up of parents and school staff. They are finding their place in the world, and this project essentially said to them, \u201cYour opinions are important, and you deserve to be heard.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Company Keeps Lies About Sandy Hook on the Web", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeonard Pozner says he spends hours every day trying to erase online conspiracy theories that the death of his 6-year-old son Noah at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.But the bulk of his work is more methodical. Sandy Hook conspiracies are strewn around the internet on various platforms, each with its own opaque rules and reporting mechanisms. So Mr. Pozner has studiously flagged countless videos and posts for a wide variety of offenses \u2014 invasions of privacy, threats and harassment, and copyright infringement \u2014 prompting Facebook, Amazon and Google to remove false material about his son.Twitter has been less receptive to his claims and some smaller sites have simply not responded at all. But one company, Mr. Pozner says, has actively pushed back against his attempts.WordPress.com, one the internet\u2019s biggest blogging platforms, is operated by a company called Automattic, which also runs a wide array of smaller sites and internet services. Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists have been able to remain on WordPress.com thanks, in part, to policies put in place to resist previous campaigns to get content removed from its service, particularly through the strategic use of copyright claims.These debates have put tech companies into a sort of existential crisis. But for Mr. Pozner and others like him, the arguments have long been much more personal, as they struggle with images of family members being repurposed in horrifying new ways and experience harassment themselves because of misinformation online.\u201cThe only items that concern me is when his image is being used in a negative, ugly way \u2014 denying the tragedy, calling him a crisis actor and everything else that the typical global village idiot on the net does,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.In the absence of uniform online policies about hoaxes, Mr. Pozner\u2019s most effective tool has been filing copyright claims on images of Noah. He has filed such claims with Automattic about photos of Noah appearing on posts that labeled him a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d who had been spotted in Pakistan after Sandy Hook and others that claimed he was a \u201cfiction\u201d and that photos of him were created using images of his older half brother.Automattic has repeatedly responded to Mr. Pozner with form letters saying \u201cbecause we believe this to be fair use of the material, we will not be removing it at this time.\u201d The letters explain that fair use could include \u201ccriticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.\u201d They also warn that the company could collect damages from people who \u201cknowingly materially misrepresent\u201d copyrights.\u201cThe responses from their support people are very automated, very generic, very cold and there\u2019s just no getting through to them,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.\u201cThey have taken this incorrect interpretation of freedom of speech to an extreme,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only thing WordPress has taken out \u2014 and where I\u2019ve been successful \u2014 is if someone posts personal information like my driver\u2019s license or address.\u201dAutomattic said that the responses Mr. Pozner received were \u201ca predefined statement\u201d that is used in copyright situations. \u201cWe regret that it was used in this situation,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe offer our apologies to the family for the response we gave to them.\u201dMr. Pozner\u2019s complaints appear to have been thwarted in part by longtime policies at Automattic intended to prevent the use of copyright claims to censor criticism and journalism on its platform. The responses sent to Mr. Pozner included a link to a post from 2013 describing the company\u2019s efforts to deal with spurious but effective copyright claims. The post also highlighted that the company had filed suit against two particularly egregious offenders in an effort to \u201cfight back\u201d on behalf of people who were posting material on the platform.Online platforms are not held liable for copyright infringement claims against people who use their platforms as long as they remove or block access to content in response to the claims. This is crucial to the function of any website where people can post content, and internet companies have traditionally tended to err on the side of removal, even when claims may be dubious. This has created opportunities for abuse, and Automattic has made fighting that a corporate cause.\u201cThey avoid getting involved because fair-use determinations are notoriously complex and fact specific,\u201d Mr. Rubin said of online platforms. \u201cPlatforms would rather eliminate their own potential liability by taking the content down and leaving it to the parties to battle amongst themselves in court.\u201dIn the case of Mr. Pozner, however, Automattic suggested that its approach was imperfect. \u201cWhile our policies have many benefits to free expression for those who use our platform, our system like many others that operate at large scale, is not ideal for getting to the deeper context of a given request,\u201d the company said in a statement.Although the posts reported by Mr. Pozner \u201dare not violating any current user guidelines, or copyright law,\u201d the company said, \u201cthe pain that the family has suffered is very real and if tied to the contents of sites we host, we want to have policies to address that.\u201dHe has removed photos of Noah from Facebook by relying on policies that protect the privacy of children under 13, a process that has required him to send the company his driver\u2019s license and a copy of his son\u2019s birth certificate. Mr. Pozner has also successfully filed such reports with Google.\u201cYou can\u2019t even measure the volume of content I\u2019ve taken down at this point,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.At times, he has been able to explain the abuse he and his family have received, some of it because of his efforts to purge Sandy Hook conspiracies from the internet, and seek removals based on a slowly evolving awareness in the tech community about the issue. (In June of last year, a 57-year-old woman in Florida was sentenced to five months in prison for making death threats against Mr. Pozner and his family.)A report to Vimeo led to a response on Friday from a representative who said he would assign the case to a specialist, but first told Mr. Pozner that he was sorry to hear about his situation.\u201cEveryone has gotten better this year, especially with all the work that I\u2019ve done to shame a lot of these platforms for continuing to abuse us and the memory of our children and just all of the ugliness that goes on,\u201d Mr. Pozner said. \u201cIf you type in Noah Pozner now into an image search on Google, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s mostly normal results but it used to be 99 percent hateful angry memes, so the cleanup is huge.\u201dMr. Pozner said he was tired of hearing technology companies say that they do not want to be \u201carbiters of truth,\u201d an oft-repeated refrain, particularly as concerns around misinformation on social media grow.\u201cTechnology platforms have had this misguided, futuristic vision of freedom of speech and everything was built around that, but it doesn\u2019t really fit into the day-to-day use of it,\u201d Mr. Pozner said. \u201cBy not taking action, they have made a choice. They are the arbiters of truth by doing nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "David Quammen Turns Tough Science Into Page-Turning Pleasure", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesLove a writer \u2014 read him carefully and closely \u2014 and you\u2019ll pick up on his pet words, the ones he reaches for repeatedly, like a baseball player with a trusted bat.Nabokov famously had \u201cmauve.\u201d Elizabeth Hardwick had \u201cmotive.\u201d Edward St. Aubyn has \u201cgasp.\u201d The statistician Ben Blatt has called these \u201ccinnamon words\u201d (after Ray Bradbury\u2019s fondness for the names of spices), and they\u2019re often hilariously telling, revealing the essence of a writer, something idiosyncratic in his perception of the world and himself. Is it any wonder that Dickens, that cash-strapped father of 10, was so crazy about \u201cpinch\u201d as noun, verb \u2014 even name?For the science writer David Quammen that word is \u2014 sublimely \u2014 \u201cnoodle.\u201d The verb pops up all over his work \u2014 and could any word suit him better? He is our greatest living chronicler of the natural world yet was never formally trained in the sciences. He started out as a novelist, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Robert Penn Warren, and stumbled into nonfiction, his boyhood passion for rooting around in forests now taking him to the canopies of the Amazon and the cliff lines of Komodo island. (The root of \u201camateur,\u201d remember, is Latin for \u201clover.\u201d)Nonfiction ought to be \u201cartful, imaginative, accurate,\u201d Quammen has written. \u201cThis combination of adjectives is not contradictory.\u201dHis new book, \u201cThe Tangled Tree,\u201d is the biography of an idea \u2014 a heretical, groundbreaking idea \u2014 and its many midwives, chief among them Carl Woese, \u201cthe most important biologist of the 20th century you\u2019ve never heard of.\u201dIn 1977, Woese and his colleagues at the University of Illinois announced their discovery of a \u201cthird domain\u201d of life \u2014 single-cell microbes they called archaea \u2014 genetically distinct from what were thought to be the only two lineages of life: prokaryotes, which include bacteria, and eukaryotes, which include plants and animals. (It\u2019s O.K., I might have missed the memo, too.)Quammen surveys the field pioneered by Woese: molecular phylogenetics (\u201cwrinkle your nose at that fancy phrase, if you will, and I\u2019ll wrinkle with you\u201d): \u201creading the deep history of life and the patterns of relatedness from the sequence of constituent units in certain long molecules\u201d \u2014 this means DNA, RNA and a few proteins \u2014 \u201cas those molecules exist today within living creatures.\u201d He plunges into how various findings have upended our conception of stately Darwinian inheritance, represented in the notion of the tree of life \u2014 of species branching out, evolving separately from each other.Since Anton van Leeuwenhoek scraped the plaque off his 17th-century teeth and observed it under the microscope (\u201cthere were many very little living animalcules, very prettily a-moving,\u201d he wrote to the Royal Society), we have known that we teem with living organisms. But this new knowledge \u2014 that we are genetically a mosaic \u2014 challenges our conception of human identity. What does it mean to be an \u201cindividual,\u201d if we are such composite creatures?Quammen raises and rushes past these existential questions; like the White Rabbit, he spends some sections in a bit of a mad rush. There\u2019s a \u201cMontana blizzard of facts\u201d he wants to shepherd us through; a dizzying array of scientists, past and present, he must introduce. (Please don\u2019t ask me if I can tell my Norton Zinder from my Oswald Avery.)But Quammen is generally an exemplary guide; there are few writers so firmly on the side of the reader, who so solicitously request your patience (\u201cTrust me, this is leading to a point\u201d) and delightedly hack away at jargon (\u201cBrace yourself for a fancy bit of lingo\u2026\u201d). He keeps the chapters short, the sentences spring-loaded. There are vivacious descriptions on almost every page \u2014 precellular life on Earth, he writes, was a \u201ca world of primeval twitching.\u201d Each section ends with a light cliffhanger. Quammen has the gift of Daedalus; he gets you out of the maze.And maybe to a bar. When not in the field, you can find Quammen and his subjects talking over a drink or two, over a combo sushi platter, over Turkish food, Chilean steaks and beers or just over a coke and pizza. It\u2019s a book born out of appetite and conviviality, an unpretentious delight in food and conversation \u2014 in being and thinking with others.Quammen doesn\u2019t just give us stories of solitary toil and triumph. Every discovery is couched in a life with its particular constraints and spurs \u2014 not least the power (or catastrophe) of personality. For all Woese\u2019s brilliance, it can be argued that he stood in the way of his success; he was a disinterested lecturer, a collector of petty grievances. We see how women scientists in the field were mocked and marginalized \u2014 even those with some standing, like Lynn Margulis, whose groundbreaking theory revealed how eukaryotic cells (which include most cells in the human body), developed symbiotically with bacteria. She was blunt about the professional and personal burdens on women: \u201cIt\u2019s not humanly possible to be a good wife, a good mother and a first-class scientist.\u201d She eventually opted for the latter two.Quammen can sometimes be too gentle on his subjects. Later in life Margulis became a 9/11 truther, which he presents as a kind of quirkiness. And there is a large, strange silence around Woese\u2019s personal life \u2014 his relationship with his wife and children is understood to be strained but he never delves into it. The focus of the book, however, isn\u2019t biography, but how the work is tinged by the life. \u201cScience itself, however precise and objective, is a human activity,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of wondering as well as a way of knowing. It\u2019s a process, not a body of facts or laws. Like music, like poetry, like baseball, like grandmaster chess, it\u2019s something gloriously imperfect that people do. The smudgy fingerprints of our humanness are all over it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jack Ryan Still Just Wants to Sit at a Desk", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQuick: What\u2019s the first franchise you think of involving a patriotic government staffer who has to beat up bad guys in order to foil international conspiracies, and who has been played by several actors over the course of decades? Bond? James Bond?While most of the films received mixed reviews, the interest in Ryan projects has remained high in Hollywood.\u201cThey appeal to audiences because they appear to be nice guys and somebody who you want to be friends with,\u201d said Mace Neufeld, a producer on every onscreen iteration.Ryan is also different from the typical action hero. \u201cHis brain is his superpower,\u201d said Carlton Cuse, one of the show\u2019s creators with Graham Roland. \u201cThat\u2019s what distinguishes him.\u201dNow it\u2019s Mr. Krasinski\u2019s turn to inhabit the character. And this iteration will be different from past versions, focusing on Ryan at an earlier point in his career than in most of the books or movies.Developments quickly take the young analyst from his desk at Langley to Yemen, where he participates in interrogations and the occasional firefight as he pursues a terrorist mastermind in the Middle East who may or may not have ties to ISIS.\u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d played heavily on Cold War tensions. \u201cThe Sum of All Fears,\u201d based on a book from 1991 but released a year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, involved a bomb going off in a crowded part of Baltimore. The movie led by Mr. Pine had a face-off with the Russian government at a time when, in real life, relations with President Vladimir Putin were increasingly strained.Here\u2019s a look at how Ryan has evolved over the years.Directed by John McTiernan, the film is remarkably different from the others, its intrigue derived from a high-stakes chess game, rather than a mash-up of action scenes. The submarine is commanded by Marko Ramius, who is actually Lithuanian, not Russian (and is played by the Scottish Sean Connery). Ramius\u2019s intentions are a mystery to both the Americans and the Soviets, as well as to the audience. But the brash Ryan correctly surmises that Ramius is actually defecting, and averts nuclear disaster in the process.One consistent characteristic throughout the movies: Even though Ryan is simply an analyst who sits at a desk, he can handle himself in the field because, we find out at some strategic point, he\u2019s a former Marine.Mr. Ford\u2019s Ryan was retired from the C.I.A. and teaching at the United States Naval Academy. Ryan\u2019s wife was recast as Anne Archer and given a new name \u2014 in \u201cThe Hunt for Red October\u201d she was played by Gates McFadden \u2014 but his boss stayed the same, with Mr. Jones reprising his role as Greer.The Ryan films fronted by Mr. Ford are more action-heavy, a deliberate choice, according to Mr. Neufeld. He said that having Ryan be away from the confinement of a submarine allowed for more fast-paced storytelling.Mr. Ford\u2019s Ryan prefers punching to analysis. The story\u2019s central conflict is more about settling a personal grudge than saving America.The plot is set into motion when a close friend of President Bennett (Donald Moffat) is murdered by a drug lord, Ernesto Escobedo (Miguel Sandoval, bearing a strong resemblance to Pablo Escobar). But the real villain isn\u2019t Escobedo. It\u2019s a high-level conspiracy involving his intelligence officer, Felix Cortez (Joaquim de Almeida); the U.S. national security adviser, James Cutter (Harris Yulin); and the deputy director of operations, Robert Ritter (Henry Czerny).Ryan finds out about the cabal and, after some more firefights, punching and kicking, exposes the scheme, even at great risk to his career.This film features an unusually ineffective Ryan, who, again, can\u2019t stop a nuclear bomb from detonating inside Baltimore. But after it goes off, he is able to get cooler heads to prevail and exonerate Russia just as the two countries are on the brink of nuclear war. The real culprits turned out to be neo-Nazis, who want to start a war for some reason \u2014 it\u2019s never totally clear.The Russians, given barely any depth in the film, hatch a plot to prop up the U.S. dollar in an effort to collapse it to crash the economy and then follow up with a terrorist attack. Mr. Pine\u2019s Ryan is an analyst but also a spy, and hides the true nature of his work from his fianc\u00e9e, played by Keira Knightley. However, she discovers the truth and teams up with him for an operation in Russia. This film also features the couple\u2019s first argument, which Ryan\u2019s C.I.A. handler (Kevin Costner) referees: \u201cThis is geopolitics. It\u2019s not couples therapy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dick Cavett in the Digital Age", "Date": "2018-08-04", "News": "Stopping to smell the flowers with the last great intellectual talk-show host.Supported byRIDGEFIELD, Conn. \u2014 Everyone wants to ask Dick Cavett the same question, and it is a question that he never wants to answer: Of all today\u2019s talk-show hosts, who is the \u201cnext Dick Cavett\u201d?\u201cWell, that\u2019s an awkward subject matter for me, because I know all of them,\u201d Mr. Cavett, 81, said on a recent sunny Thursday afternoon at his sprawling country house in Connecticut. \u201cI\u2019m not addicted to talk shows. God knows, I\u2019ve spent enough time on them.\u201d But \u201cthe next Cavett\u201d? Is such a thing possible?If only.After Mr. Mailer accused Mr. Vidal of \u201cintellectual pollution\u201d and Mr. Cavett of being \u201csmaller intellectually\u201d than himself, Mr. Cavett suggested, in what was perhaps the original sick burn, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you fold it five ways and put it where the moon don\u2019t shine?\u201dIn fact, \u201c\u2018intellectual\u2019 was a word that always made me go up the wall, partly because I knew how the word is esteemed in the world of television,\u201d Mr. Cavett said, sipping seltzer with orange and munching grapes in his sunroom. \u201cI was called \u2018intellectual,\u2019 I guess, because I didn\u2019t know any better than to read the guests\u2019 books.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the strangest sensation to be getting the same comments that I got decades ago: \u2018I\u2019m addicted to your show,\u2019 or \u2018I watch it every night,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cavett said. \u201cI have virtually 3 percent memory of what I\u2019m seeing on the screen. People I would have sworn I never had on \u2014 there they are, for 90 minutes.\u201dAlthough his last talk show, on CNBC, ended in 1996, he has stayed in public view: making cameos on \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d attending film premieres and doing guest appearances on late night.\u201cDarling?\u201d she said. \u201cThis ain\u2019t \u2018darling,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Ali, who had been invited for an impromptu visit and given the master bedroom. \u201cThis is the three-time heavyweight champion of the world, and I\u2019m lying in your bed, watching your TV.\u201d (\u201cIt usually takes a beat,\u201d he said, smiling.)Ever ready to try new technology, he is thinking about starting a podcast. \u201cEverybody seems to be doing one,\u201d he said. He sent away for an Ancestry.com genetic test, and was surprised to find he had forebears in South Sudan. In 2010, he married Martha Rogers, a marketing consultant and author from Florida and a longtime friend, who found the new place in Connecticut.\u201cPart of it was to be nearer the city, nearer good medical stuff,\u201d Mr. Cavett said with resignation. But his old summer haunt also now harbors tattoos and nightclubs. \u201cMontauk is a \u2018sleepy little fishing village\u2019 no more,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I guess, fish are still extracted from the sea. But it\u2019s full of places for people who actually stand outside for God knows how long in order to get in and be deafened by music.\u201d He smiled tartly. \u201cDo I sound old?\u201dNot in the slightest, actually.Padding in bedroom slippers past a ballroom that seemed the next best thing to Mrs. Astor\u2019s, Mr. Cavett, always lean and diminutive, looked thinner now in his baggy khakis and plaid woodsman shirt, but still moved with the grace of a the high school gymnastics champion he once was, back in Lincoln, Neb. The house is still filled with boxes from the move, and the couple has yet to figure out exactly how many rooms it has. \u201cSomewhere between 25 and 50, I guess,\u201d Ms. Rogers said. \u201cWe found rooms in the basement about a month and a half ago that we didn\u2019t know were there.\u201d Back in the sunroom, an ornate Italian fountain was babbling just outside, as Mr. Cavett sat in a wicker rocking chair with a serene smile. As the light poured through three windows, beads of perspiration were beginning to form on his visitor\u2019s face. Who would not be daunted by the task of interviewing the consummate interviewer?\u201cJack Paar called me once,\u201d Mr. Cavett said, referring to the early \u201cTonight Show\u201d host who gave him his first gig. \u201cHe said, \u2018Hey, kid, when you do your show, don\u2019t do interviews.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Did I hear you right? Am I supposed to read to the guests?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, no, no, I mean \u201cinterviews,\u201d Q. and A. Make it a conversation.\u2019\u201d But in a late-night landscape rebuilt for clickable clips, unscripted moments seem increasingly rare. \u201cIf I were doing a show today,\u201d Mr. Cavett said, \u201cit would not include a nice actress who\u2019s so \u2018excited\u2019 about her new movie, and so \u2018excited\u2019 about her director, and so \u2018excited\u2019 about the costumes. \u2018Excited\u2019 is a word that could easily be stricken from the show business vocabulary.\u201dStephen Colbert, with whom Mr. Cavett has lunched at the Yale Club, is perhaps most adept, Mr. Cavett said, at puncturing the celebrity bubble, \u201cmost deliciously when the guest doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s puncturing it.\u201d (Who else? \u201cI\u2019m crazy about him, I just think he\u2019s really funny and good,\u201d Mr. Cavett said of Seth Meyers. \u201cBut I fell into the trap! I swore I wouldn\u2019t be talking about the late-night people.\u201d) Moreover, while today\u2019s hosts enjoy certain freedoms unimaginable to his generation \u2014 like Samantha Bee swearing on air (\u201cSamantha\u2019s very funny,\u201d he said) \u2014 Mr. Cavett had the leisurely airtime to explore ideas. He once did a full hour with Ingmar Bergman, the cerebral Swedish film director.It was clear from the first taping of \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show\u201d in 1968 that this would be a different kind of television entertainment. The guests included Mr. Vidal and Mr. Ali, blackballed from boxing because of his refusal to join the Army and fight in Vietnam. Naturally the topic came up. Mr. Cavett went over the executive\u2019s head at the network, insisting that his show wouldn\u2019t stoop to \u201cthis chicken-dribble,\u201d and the episode ran, but not as the premiere.Although Mr. Cavett\u2019s show was provocative, his persona, balancing Ivy League erudition with unflappable Midwestern solidity, has rarely ruffled anyone. Early in his career, Groucho Marx wrote him a letter saying, \u201c\u2018I think you hit a mother lode with the idea of a bumpkin coming east to Yale, and you should mine that for all you can,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I did.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not give the instructions,\u201d Mr. Cavett said, barely containing a smile. Mr. Rodale appeared along with the writer Pete Hamill that day. Mr. Rodale, whom Mr. Cavett recalls \u201clooking like Trotsky,\u201d was in high spirits during the interview. He brought a dish of asparagus soaked in urine for Mr. Cavett to sample (\u201cAnybody\u2019s we know?\u201d the host joked, before declining) and jauntily asserted that, with his healthy diet, he planned to live to 100. Shortly after that segment ended, however, Mr. Cavett, who was interviewing Mr. Hamill, heard an eerie gurgle, or was it a snore? He may or may not have said, \u201cAm I boring you?\u201d (Mr. Cavett said he has a DVD of the episode, but he has not watched the footage for years). \u201cThis looks bad,\u201d Mr. Hamill whispered.Glancing over at Mr. Rodale, Mr. Cavett saw that he was stiff in his chair, his back arched, and unconscious.\u201cThe scene shifts, instantly and unrealistically, to me standing at the edge of the stage saying, \u2018Is there a doctor in the audience?\u2019\u201d Mr. Cavett recalled. Audience? \u201cWhy did I do that?\u201d Katharine Hepburn, he said, later explained to him that he knew \u201cIs there a doctor in the house\u201d would convulse the audience \u2014 though it was an appropriate ask, given that Mr. Rodale died on the set.\u201cPeople would always beat up on Johnny by saying, \u2018When Cavett\u2019s got Attorney General John Mitchell on, Johnny has Charo,\u2019\u201d Mr. Cavett said.While Mr. Cavett said he loathed Nixon\u2019s politics, he called him \u201ca brilliant, brilliant man\u201d and was cordial to him in person. Years after Watergate, he remembers seeing the former president and his younger daughter, Julie, seated at an outdoor restaurant in Montauk, so he grabbed a menu and, posing as a waiter, began to list the specials: Yorba Linda cream pie, Whittier College souffl\u00e9. Not his best material, Ms. Nixon told him. The current president is perhaps the only celebrity over the age of 70 that Mr. Cavett has never met, other than being beaten by him to shrimp in a benefit buffet line years ago. \u201cI think all people who get to president of the United States must have something wonderful about them,\u201d Mr. Cavett said in a mock-diplomatic tone. \u201cWith that,\u201d he added, \u201cCavett held a gun to his head and shot himself.\u201dAs afternoon light began to grow golden over the pond that glistened at the base of the hill behind his house, he was showing no hurry to rise from his wicker chair. \u201cHow do these people decide who\u2019s right in this?\u201d Mr. Cavett said. Friends like Mr. Allen and Marshall Brickman, the screenwriter, are still around, but the man who knew seemingly everyone finds it haunting that so many notables he was once close to \u201care no longer there.\u201dWatching his shows, Mr. Cavett said, \u201cthe odd sensation about it is there I am sitting with Lucille Ball or someone like that, and it is overlain by the thought \u2018One of us is dead.\u2019\u201d\u201cSo far,\u201d Mr. Cavett said wryly, \u201cit\u2019s always the other one.\u201d Because \u201cyou never think that will happen to you. That\u2019s something you hear old folks talk about.\u201d Despite the burdens of age, Mr. Cavett seems to be managing the bouts of depression that have dogged him since he was an undergraduate, when one day \u201cI just couldn\u2019t figure out why I didn\u2019t want to get up, didn\u2019t want to go to class, and I couldn\u2019t read,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed that all the color went out of everything.\u201dYears later, after breaking out in an agitated sweat shortly after boarding a Concorde for London in 1980, he was taken for electroconvulsive therapy at Columbia-Presbyterian hospital, a treatment he called \u201cmiraculous.\u201dSuccess was no balm. \u201cOne thing you must never say to someone with depression is, \u2018What reason have you got to have depression?\u2019\u201d he said. That\u2019s like saying, \u2018what reason have you got to have asthma?\u2019\u201d And even his brand of urbane fame, once a thrill, has taken on a different quality. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t want to be recognized, and just enjoy a museum or an art gallery. And now, it\u2019s always, \u2018Can we take a selfie?\u2019\u201dMr. Cavett could tell his fans to stick their smartphones where the moon don\u2019t shine, of course. But he usually complies. \u201cOr I say, \u2018I thought you\u2019d never ask,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTo make the people standing by laugh.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the relative President Nixon was sitting with at a restaurant in Montauk where Dick Cavett posed as a waiter.

{"Headline": "More Than Cutting Costs: Travel Managers Now Consider Employee Comfort", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesCorporate managers used to focus on one thing when it came to employee travel: saving money.But now, given the nature of travel \u2014 crowded planes, tighter seats, security hassles \u2014 corporate managers are considering employee comfort as part of the deal.Aside from seat comfort, meal service and faster Wi-Fi, there isn\u2019t much room to innovate the offerings inside the aircraft, Mr. Sheivachman said. But beyond the plane, airlines can offer perks like matching frequent-flier status earned on another airline and offering access to airport lounges, early boarding, seat upgrades and priority help with requests like midtrip ticket changes.\u201cIf you are sending someone around the world and they aren\u2019t well taken care of, that reflects badly on the company and the corporate culture,\u201d Mr. Sheivachman said.These are more than V.I.P. perks, said Mary Huddleston Tabacchi, professor emerita at Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration. \u201cIdeally, a corporate flier needs to arrive well rested to do business for their employer.\u201dThe perks do have costs, so it\u2019s up to the corporate travel managers to establish policies determining who receives the benefits. \u201cIt might be the executives, it might be the road warriors who travel the most, and it might be travelers in the divisions that bring in the most money,\u201d Mr. Sabby said.Direct nonstop travel, minimizing total trip time, is as important as any perk, Mr. Landson said. Before Southwest started operating flights from the Cincinnati airport in June 2017, it spoke with travel managers from several Fortune 500 companies in the area, as well as other businesses to learn when and where their employees traveled most.There\u2019s untapped potential in helping corporations of all sizes improve their travel, Mr. Landson said. California, for example, has thousands of companies whose employees want to make day trips within the state and get back home that night. Southwest takes those factors into account when planning its flights, he said.Alaska Airlines has had a special check-in line for Microsoft employees at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for three years and added a lane for Amazon employees in the last few months.\u201cAirlines are more interested in being creative and entertaining unique requests,\u201d Mr. Sabby said. An airline, for example, might offer more intrastate upgrades for fliers in a competitive marketplace like Los Angeles.While the tool was intended for companies to use directly, \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen an increase in interest in this tool from travel management companies and consultants to use with their clients,\u201d said Elizabeth West, editor in chief of Business Travel News.The focus on cost savings ebbs and flows, largely with the strength of the economy, Ms. West said, but there is value in having happy, productive business travelers.Advertisement"}

But Governor Brown has the opportunity to make his biggest impact yet by harnessing the power of forests to reduce carbon dioxide pollution, the principal cause of global warming.  Governor Brown should direct the California Air Resources Board, 12 of whose 14 voting members he appoints, to include a rain forest standard in proposed regulations the board is expected to release soon, updating the state\u2019s cap and trade program. This would be an enormously important step toward stabilizing the global climate, fortifying indigenous communities and their cultures and protecting the fragile and incredible biodiversity of these forests.At an aquaculture farm funded by carbon credits outside the Acre capital of Rio Branco, native Amazon River fish are raised on land cleared before the state ended the destruction of its forests. Local farmers produce eight tons of fish per hectare; that same hectare would support but a single cow on the poor grass that typically grows in these cleared soils. Local youth are trained to filet the fish, returning all waste to the farm as fertilizer (even the skin is tanned into leather for Herm\u00e8s purses). Others restore land by planting banana and rubber trees, avocados, pineapples, cashew and cacao to provide food and income all year. By maximizing production of both animal protein and export crops, these innovations reduce the demands for land that drive deforestation. Income from carbon credits is also fortifying indigenous cultures. Governor Brown is already a climate hero. Leading the fight to save global forests would be a crowning achievement and fitting final chapter for his time as governor. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "3-D Printed Gun Plans Must Stay Off Internet for Now, Judge Rules", "Date": "2018-08-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCody Wilson, the self-described crypto-anarchist who has tried for years to post blueprints for 3-D printed guns online, will have to keep waiting, a federal judge ruled on Monday.The judge ruled in favor of attorneys general from 19 states and Washington, D.C., who contend that 3-D printed guns are difficult to detect and trace, and constitute a threat to national safety. The ruling extends a temporary restraining order issued July 31, and means Mr. Wilson cannot publish the blueprints unless the attorneys general\u2019s lawsuit is resolved.In granting a preliminary injunction, Judge Robert S. Lasnik of Federal District Court in Seattle wrote that Mr. Wilson\u2019s First Amendment rights \u201care dwarfed by the irreparable harms the states are likely to suffer if the existing restrictions are withdrawn and that, over all, the public interest strongly supports maintaining the status quo through the pendency of this litigation.\u201dGun safety groups heralded the decision as a major victory. Mr. Wilson is reviewing the court\u2019s decision and considering all of his options, his lawyer, Josh Blackman, said.Although Mr. Wilson\u2019s company, Defense Distributed, is effectively barred from posting the blueprints for now, the information has still found its way online.Over the last few weeks, a $20 book featuring the blueprints appeared for sale on Amazon, titled \u201cThe Liberator Code Book: An Exercise in the Freedom of Speech.\u201dThe purpose of the publication, according to its description online, is \u201cto give a physical analogy between computer code and books.\u201d\u201cCode is speech,\u201d according to the description, which also noted that proceeds would \u201cbe used to fight for free speech and the right to keep and bear arms.\u201dThe author was listed as C J Awelow, a name without much of an online footprint.The book was available until last week, when Amazon removed the listing, saying that it violated the company\u2019s content guidelines, without specifying which ones.\u201cA lot of the concern has been that the technology is going to evolve if there\u2019s a free exchange of ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something that could at least be slowed down through a ban on the distribution of this kind of information.\u201dMr. Wilson is seeking $400,000 in donations to defray his legal costs.His legal problems started after he successfully test-fired his plastic gun, called the Liberator, in 2013 and posted blueprints for making the gun with a 3-D printer. The plans were downloaded some 100,000 times before the State Department stepped in, telling Mr. Wilson that he was violating export rules governing sensitive military technology.On Capitol Hill, bills to block downloadable firearms have been introduced in both houses.Judge Lasnik appeared to agree, writing on Monday that there is a \u201clegitimate fear that adding undetectable and untraceable guns to the arsenal of weaponry already available will likely increase the threat of gun violence they and their people experience.\u201dThe attorneys general failed to demonstrate that \u201cit is in the public interest for the court to second-guess the national security determinations of the executive branch,\u201d government lawyers wrote.While Justice Department lawyers were arguing in support of the settlement to allow the posting of the blueprints, Mr. Sessions noted in a statement that plastic firearms that can pass through security screenings undetected are prohibited by federal law and vowed to \u201cvigorously enforce this prohibition.\u201dMr. Trump also wrote about the 3-D printed guns on Twitter last month, saying that he had conferred with the National Rifle Association. He added, without providing much detail, that he was looking into sales of the guns to the public.In a hearing last week, Judge Lasnik said the downloadable firearms case was \u201cprobably the most significant\u201d he had handled as a federal judge. But he would have preferred that lawmakers and regulators settle the issue.\u201cA solution to the greater problem is so much better suited to the other two branches of government,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I really hope and wish that the executive branch and Congress would face up to this and say, it\u2019s a tough issue, but that\u2019s why you got into public service to begin with.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And we have to give people a reason to get off their couch or devices. We have to give them something different.\u201dAbout 38 percent of ticket buyers for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d were Asian, according to Jeff Goldstein, Warner\u2019s president of domestic distribution. Asian moviegoers typically make up less than 10 percent of the opening-weekend audience for a film. About 68 percent of the audience was female.\u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d which cost an estimated $30 million to make and tens of millions more to market, took in $34 million since arriving on Wednesday. (The film will roll out overseas in the weeks ahead.) To compare, the hit romantic comedy \u201c27 Dresses,\u201d starring Katherine Heigl, took in the same amount over its first five days in domestic theaters in 2008, after adjusting for inflation, going on to collect $200 million worldwide.The movie business has changed dramatically in the last decade, however, making the turnout for \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d all the more impressive. As living room entertainment services like Netflix and Amazon have grown in popularity, filling seats in theaters has become much harder. To compete, studios have moved to the extremes: horror movies made on shoestring budgets, and lavishly expensive franchise films aimed at the broadest possible audience.In turn, studios have largely abandoned mid-market movies like romantic comedies and uplifting sports dramas.\u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d offers an extreme example of prosperity, but a study shows that Asian-Americans are the most economically divided racial group in the United States.For the weekend, \u201cThe Meg\u201d (Warner) placed second, collecting $21.2 million, for a two-week global total of roughly $300 million, according to comScore, which compiles box-office data. Third place went to \u201cMile 22\u201d (STXfilms), which took in $13.6 million, a bit below what most analysts had expected. \u201cMile 22,\u201d which cost about $35 million to make, stars Mark Wahlberg as an elite intelligence officer.Also of box-office note: \u201cBillionaire Boys Club,\u201d an indie film starring Kevin Spacey, was released in 10 theaters and took in $500 \u2014 a humiliating result that cements Mr. Spacey\u2019s status as a Hollywood pariah. Last year, more than a dozen men accused Mr. Spacey of sexually harassing, groping or assaulting them; he denied some of the accusations against him while also saying he would seek unspecified \u201ctreatment.\u201d\u201cBillionaire Boys Club,\u201d which was already available as a video-on-demand release, is about affluent high school boys in Los Angeles who get involved in a Ponzi scheme. Filming was completed before accusations against Mr. Spacey surfaced in October. The film\u2019s distributor, Vertical Entertainment, justified the release by saying the rest of the cast should not be penalized.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farfetch, Online Retailer, Plans to Go Public as Luxury E-Commerce Grows", "Date": "2018-08-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Farfetch offers the latest Gucci items delivered to your door in 90 minutes, has distribution deals with brands like Nike and TAG Heuer, and recently started an Arabic-language site to cater to the tastes of wealthy Middle Eastern shoppers.Now the company is turning its attention to the appetites of a new client: Wall Street.A platform for 500 independent luxury boutiques and 200 brands, Farfetch was founded by Jos\u00e9 Neves in 2007 and is now one of a handful of technology companies in Europe with a valuation of more than $1 billion.Shoppers who are money-rich but time-poor have been increasingly looking to buy from online fashion players rather than traditional boutiques. As a result, Farfetch and rivals like Yoox Net-a-Porter \u2014 which owns and operates internet retailers like Net-a-Porter, Mr Porter and the Outnet \u2014 have been growing, and both companies have been spending large amounts of cash to expand rapidly. Yoox Net-a-Porter, for example, recently ramped up its offerings of $15,000 Chopard and Piaget watches, and expects to generate 100 million euros, or $114 million, in revenue from high-end jewelry and watches by 2020.Luckily for them, many investors have jostled to get in on the act.Farfetch has come a long way in the 11 years since its founding. It was initially built by Mr. Neves, a former shoe store owner in Portugal, to be a platform to help smaller stores enter the digital world. He took a commission on each purchase, freeing himself of the need to build up major inventories or the capital requirements of a traditional retailer.Backed by the Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, which will maintain its stake after the listing, Farfetch has almost a billion active consumers, can ship to 190 countries and has created an infrastructure platform that luxury brands can use to develop their own e-commerce businesses.\u201cWhat makes us different is that everyone else is operating on a retail model, but we are a platform, not a shop, an enabler not a competitor, and are reaping all the advantages that such a position entails,\u201d Mr. Neves said in an interview in December. \u201cWe believe we are the only global luxury platform at scale.\u201dBut while a push to grow has prompted a hunt for new revenue streams, and drove sales growth of 59 percent last year to $386 million, the company has not turned a profit since its creation. As investments and costs have increased, losses grew to $68 million in the first half of 2018, compared with $29 million a year earlier. Farfetch said in the filing to announce the public offering that the losses were a result of the costs of entering new markets, as well as adding new brands and partnerships.Farfetch filed registration documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying it wanted to raise $100 million, a place-holder figure that will most likely change. It plans to list with the symbol FTCH. Although the company did not specify a date for its initial public offering, it is expected to be in 2018.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shooting at Jacksonville Gaming Tournament Leaves 3 Dead, Including Gunman", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2014 A gunman armed with a handgun killed two people at a video gaming tournament on Sunday, turning a football competition waged in a virtual domain into the chaotic scene of a double murder. The shooting suspect, a gamer attending the event, fatally shot himself, the authorities said.Sheriff Mike Williams of Jacksonville identified the suspect as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore, but said it was too early to know his motive. The sheriff said the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were assisting in the investigation.A live-stream of the tournament caught the chilling moment when the shooting began. A red laser dot appeared on the chest of one of the players, who was wearing white headphones and a red sweatshirt. The video of the players then disappeared. Twelve gunshots rang out.Eleven people were injured, nine by gunshots.The shooting took place at 1:34 p.m. at the Jacksonville Landing, a riverfront collection of restaurants, shops and an open-air performance space that is a gathering place in the city on weekends. President Trump held a packed rally there as a candidate in 2015. By late Sunday, it was surrounded by fire trucks and police vehicles, its perimeter roped off by police tape. SWAT team officers stood at the entrance of a nearby parking garage. A helicopter flew high overhead.\u201cWe have faced an occurrence that is all too common,\u201d Mayor Lenny Curry told reporters on Sunday night. \u201cTonight, we pray for the wounded and we pray for the families of those who were lost.\u201dSpeaking outside a Jacksonville hospital on Sunday night, Gov. Rick Scott mourned another mass shooting in his state.\u201cWe have got to change, we\u2019ve got to really stop and say to ourselves, \u2018There\u2019s something wrong,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Scott, who signed gun-control legislation into law after the Feb. 14 rampage at a high school in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead. \u201cWhy are young men willing to give up their lives? Or why don\u2019t they value somebody else\u2019s life? We\u2019ve got to figure this out. We don\u2019t ever want this to happen again.\u201dBut Mr. Scott is due to leave office within months \u2014 he is running for a seat in the United States Senate \u2014 and on Sunday night, he made no specific policy proposals. As he walked to his motorcade, stopping for a picture with a hospital employee, he ignored reporters who called out more questions about gun control.Jacksonville was already reeling from another deadly shooting over the weekend. One person was killed and two others were injured in a shooting after a high school football game on Friday. Mayor Curry blamed that violence on youth gangs.The violence rattled locals and visitors and rippled through the state\u2019s political establishment. Florida\u2019s primary election takes place on Tuesday; five Democrats running for governor decried the violence and reiterated their push for gun control. The two Republican candidates canceled planned campaign events in the Jacksonville area.\u201cHow long is it going to take for us to get guns off the street?\u201d Marquis Williams, 28, told local reporters after his girlfriend was treated for an ankle injury. \u201cHow many more people, how many more friends, do we have to lose \u2014 die \u2014 to this?\u201dMr. Williams and his girlfriend, Taylor Poindexter, 26, had come to the tournament from Chicago. They wore Bears jerseys and had been preparing to order a pizza at Chicago Pizza and Sports Grille, which shares an entrance with the organization hosting the gaming tournament, when the shooting began.\u201cWe heard a first pop, thought it was a balloon,\u201d Mr. Williams told The Florida Times-Union. \u201cAnd then we heard multiple pops. Took off running.\u201dMs. Poindexter said she was trampled on the way out.\u201cNever did I once think, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to be part of a mass shooting and I\u2019m on crutches just playing video games,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\u201cI have to get to him. I am four hours away from him and I have to get to my son,\u201d Ms. Lopez said in a telephone interview. \u201cHe was shot three times, once on the nipple, once on his hand and somewhere else.\u201d She did not know his condition.A professional video game organization, compLexity Gaming, said on Twitter that it had a player at the tournament who \u201csuffered a small injury\u201d when a bullet grazed his hand but that \u201che is away from the scene.\u201d\u201cI am literally so lucky,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bullet hit my thumb.\u201d In another Twitter post, he said he would \u201cnever take anything for granted ever again.\u201dPeople ran in panic from the restaurant, and at least two people were injured while fleeing, police said.After Sunday\u2019s shooting, Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville treated three patients who were all in stable condition, a spokesman, Peter Moberg, said. Another hospital, UF Health Jacksonville, was treating six patients, one of them in serious condition and five in good condition, said the hospital\u2019s spokesman, Dan Leveton.Doctors at UF Health Jacksonville told reporters that the most seriously injured of the patients there had been shot in the chest but was expected to survive. Three patients were shot once; the others were shot more than once, said Dr. Marie Crandall, a trauma surgeon. The patients range in age from 20 to 35.In Baltimore, federal officials were investigating in HarborView, an affluent condo and townhouse community just south of the Inner Harbor area. Several agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives emerged from a townhouse there Sunday night and declined to comment.Cameron Stearns, who lives next door to the townhouse where he said Mr. Katz lived with family, said he was surprised and horrified at the news that Mr. Katz had been identified as the gunman. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking and scary to think only a wall separates you from somebody capable of shooting up a video game tournament,\u201d he said.The shooting happened at the GLHF Game Bar, which is short for \u201cGood Luck Have Fun,\u201d a phrase commonly used by competitors before playing a video game. The venue located inside the pizza restaurant was hosting a tournament that viewers could watch on Twitch, a popular live-streaming network owned by Amazon. Spectators watch the games, many hoping to pick up skills and tips from more experienced players.The bar was scheduled to host a regional qualifying round for the Madden N.F.L. Championship Series, a gaming tournament. It advertised a $5,000 grand prize, and the top two finishers were to receive a berth in the finals in October.Madden N.F.L. 19, developed by Electronic Arts, is the 30th installment of the popular N.F.L. video game series, which has sold over 100 million copies.

{"Headline": "Buoyant Economy or a Blip? 4 Tips for Investing Before the Party Ends", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersWhen it comes to how the latest economic data could have an impact on investors, two opposite interpretations emerge.Or growth of 4.1 percent in the second quarter is a short-term blip brought about by tax cuts that gave people a little extra money in their paycheck but is unsustainable in the face of mounting federal debt, higher tariffs and the prospect of a trade war that could hurt large portions of the United States economy.Your takeaway depends on your overall view of the country and the economy.\u201cIn 23 years of doing this, I cannot really remember a time when a statistic comes out and you hear such diametrically opposed interpretations of it,\u201d said Andrew Crowell, vice chairman of wealth management at D. A. Davidson & Company, which manages $48.2 billion. \u201cThere is no gray zone. It\u2019s only black and white, which makes it an interesting time to be an investor.\u201dWho\u2019s correct on the data will not be known until the economic impact is felt, which could take months or even years. But for investors, any plan based on waiting or wishing is not ideal.After all, even before President Trump began to shake up economic norms, with his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threats of tariffs and nonchalance about government debt, investors were skeptical of the economic expansion, which has run, with a few minor dips, from March 2009 to the present.A wait-and-see approach on investing can be costly, but moving too quickly at this stage could be ruinous if the market goes into a correction. Advisers to some of the country\u2019s wealthiest people say to keep investing but to do it wisely.Here are four tips for investors in a time of caution:Mr. Trump has made many comments that in a different time would have caused the economy to tank. Military threats against North Korea and Iran, tariffs against the United States\u2019 largest trading partners, all manner of statements about Russia \u2014 none of them has caused a market correction.Instead, the opposite has happened this year, as investors find opportunities in market fluctuations. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen cash come in to buy on the dips,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.And for a seemingly sound reason: Companies continue to grow. The Republican tax cut that was enacted last year and a rollback of financial regulations have helped, but so have strong earnings that have outpaced price increases.\u201cThe stimulative measures have bolstered confidence that growth and the economy is going to be strong over the next couple of years,\u201d Mr. Crowell said.Advisers agree that the recovery has been running for some time and is near the point where bull markets typically begin to falter. But that does not mean the run will end this year or next or even the year after that.\u201cConsumer wealth is at all-time highs when you factor in home prices and the stock market,\u201d said Henry B. Smith, co-chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, which manages $8 billion. \u201cOne of the lacking ingredients throughout this has been business investment, and that is starting to pick up.\u201dMr. Smith is advising his clients to have the maximum exposure to equities that they can stomach. But he is also telling them to think more broadly about equities.Investors often overlook the moderating role of value stocks, which are steady, dividend-paying stocks that can help weather various economic storms. Instead, they often pursue the higher returns of growth stocks, which are expected to grow at an above-average rate.Mr. Smith said investors should think about trimming back investments in manufacturing, technology and financial services to increase holdings of consumer staples, health care, telecommunication and utility stocks, the basics of value investing.He cited last week\u2019s sudden drop in the value of Facebook as reason to broaden your view of equities. \u201cLast week was a good reminder that stocks that go up sharply can also come down sharply,\u201d he said.Many investors seem willing to forget that the returns of the past decade have been strong and that replicating them going forward may be difficult. In other words, stay invested in riskier assets while they continue to run, because selling them too early could hurt your portfolio.\u201cWhen we look at demographics and economic projections, there isn\u2019t going to be as much population growth and consumption,\u201d said Anthony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust. \u201cMost of the world has a population moving to slower consumption as they age. While this economic cycle is continuing, the risk of missing out is even greater.\u201d\u201cThe strongest period of the market cycle is from the time of yield curve inversion to the peak of the equity market, which is usually nine to 12 months after that,\u201d Mr. Roth said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even gotten to the inversion yet, which would suggest there\u2019s significant opportunity right now.\u201dYet investors need to pay attention. \u201cThe alarm is when the yield curve inverts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a predictor of both recessions and returns in the market.\u201dActively monitoring economic data and what it presages is a smart strategy.Most analysts believe that Mr. Trump is bluffing on tariffs and that they are being used as a negotiating tool. This comes from the school of thought that favors what the president does over what he says.\u201cThe worst case is, Trump just gets in a fight with China, Europe and everyone else and we see an escalation of tariffs that slows world trade and has a significant impact on the U.S. economic cycle, increases inflationary pressures and ultimately reduces output,\u201d said John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, which manages about $7 billion.That would be crushing, but it is not the only possible outcome.\u201cThe flip side is, Trump really is a master negotiator and what he\u2019s doing is trying to move away from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral agreements,\u201d Mr. Osterweis said. That may produce better trade deals, he said.Lacking any idea as to which outcome to expect, Mr. Osterweis has been encouraging clients to invest in companies whose outlooks are less dependent on the economy or a particular industry, he said.\u201cYou could think of a Google, where people\u2019s search habits aren\u2019t going to change dramatically if there\u2019s a recession and there\u2019s already an inexorable migration of ad dollars to that company,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could look at a drug company with a blockbuster drug coming through the pipeline or a Disney, where they have the next unbelievably popular movie coming out.\u201dThe opposite would be manufacturing companies like automakers that stockpile inventory and could struggle to sell it in a recession. Still, some combination of different types of companies is the more prudent bet.What it should do is get people thinking about the need to examine their portfolios. \u201cIt\u2019s prudent to be mindful that those four names don\u2019t define a diversified portfolio,\u201d he said.Another reason not to sell off stocks that have appreciated greatly is taxes. People who have held those stocks for a long time have watched them run up in value, which means they are going to owe a lot of money in taxes when they sell them.Todd Morgan, chairman of Bel Air Investment Advisors, which manages about $8 billion for high-net-worth families, said he shows clients how much the stock of a fundamentally strong company would have to fall before selling it made sense.\u201cPeople don\u2019t look at the after-tax returns,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ve had several calls about tech stocks the past few days, all asking, \u2018Should we stay in or get out?\u2019\u201dIf an investor thinks a company is going to drop below what would be owed in capital gains taxes, then it is time to get out.Investors need to keep paying attention to company fundamentals and economic indicators focused on inflation and wages. If either of those runs too high, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates, which could bring the equity party to an end.Since neither is happening now, the best advice is to stay invested and stay alert.Advertisement"}

Viewers watch as Bruce Weber, a veteran obituary writer, calls the bereaved, delicately gathering details on the deceased in time to make his deadline. The camera also travels inside The Times\u2019s morgue, a repository of historical newspaper clippings and photo archives, where Jeff Roth, its caretaker and a longtime employee, works closely with obituary writers to pull relevant images and research for the articles at hand.The documentarian Liz Garbus camped out at The Times for 16 months for this four-part series that debuted in May on Showtime. The film toggles between the paper\u2019s newsrooms in New York City and Washington, but focuses much of its energy on the nation\u2019s capital, where reporters chase leads on the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. The film puts a face to bylines like Maggie Haberman, Michael S. Schmidt and Mark Mazzetti and offers viewers a sense of the personal sacrifices required for the job.Advertisement"}

One of the guys admitted: \u201cI haven\u2019t cried in a movie in the longest time \u2014 but I cried.\u201d And his friend was like, \u201cYeah, I cried too.\u201dThis was not the target demographic. But it\u2019s funny to see them admitting to this and being so surprised by their own reaction. It\u2019s great to hear that, because that\u2019s what we believed from the beginning: that this story transcends race.The story explores the world of the uber-rich in Singapore, where you grew up. What was the most obscene show of wealth you saw as a child?This made it into \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d: There was this family that had recently suffered a personal tragedy. A Christian counselor had come over and was destroying everything that was Chinese or had any dragons or idols. I was 10 years old, and remember watching from the sidelines in this enormous mansion as they were tipping vases to the floor. The maids are weeping: They see fortunes they can\u2019t even make in their whole lifetime being destroyed right in front of them \u2014 and they have to literally sweep it up. I can\u2019t make this stuff up.\u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d offers an extreme example of prosperity, but a study shows that Asian-Americans are the most economically divided racial group in the United States.The book is a satire of this culture of excess, but Hollywood loves to glorify wealth. Were you worried that critique would be lost in translation?Jon [Chu, the film\u2019s director] and I had many many long talks over this. I knew and understood his vision: that even though there are decadent scenes, you look beyond that. The story at the heart of it is about a family, a couple, a mother and a son. And there\u2019s where the true crazy richness lies in the story.While other authors option their books for thousands of dollars, you optioned the book to the production companies Color Force and Ivanhoe for $1. What did you do with that dollar?I don\u2019t think I actually got that dollar, quite frankly. Basically, I was trying to make myself as amenable to the deal as possible. I didn\u2019t want things to be held up by money. I wanted the money to be spent hiring a great screenwriter \u2014 to really adapt my book rather than to pay me some stupid option fee. And it gave me a partnership stake in the whole process. So it was worth every dollar \u2014 it was worth that dollar. [laughs]It definitely came up in the room and was something we deliberated about for a very long time. We were hyper-conscious of what would happen and how people would respond. But at the end of the day we really felt that he really was the perfect Nick. We had to put aside our own issues to see that.I understand the issue, and I\u2019m glad it came up. But being from Singapore, which is such a multicultural society, and having so many cousins who are mixed race \u2014 and seeing their struggle as mixed-race Asians who aren\u2019t fully accepted on either side \u2014 I really have a lot of empathy for that. How are they not Asian? How is Henry Golding, who has spent most of his life living in Asia, considered not Asian? Fifty years ago he wouldn\u2019t be let into a lot of private clubs just based on the way he looks.Over the past few months, have you seen a change in potential opportunities for Asian and Asian-American stories in Hollywood?Absolutely. There\u2019s tremendous interest now in projects that I\u2019m developing going forward. I see it also with the cast: All of them have different pots that are boiling. They\u2019re being offered different roles and possibilities. We\u2019re seeing how all these actors are in demand in a whole new way, and in projects that aren\u2019t just Asian based. The climate\u2019s already changing.Now that you\u2019ve broken the bamboo ceiling, what kinds of stories are you interested in telling?Crazy poor Asians. Or just crazy average Asians. I\u2019ve written three books about the 1 percent. Now, it\u2019s all about exploring this wide spectrum and showing other facets of Asians around the world. I want to show how they can be as cool as the crazy rich Asians, if not more.I\u2019m also developing a TV series with Amazon. It\u2019s going to be set in Hong Kong, and it\u2019s about the most powerful and ruthless family there. It\u2019s going to be very different in tone and subject matter.[Spoilers ahead:] The post-credits scene of the film sets up a new potential love interest for the spurned Astrid (Gemma Chan). Is the scene a harbinger of a sequel?I really hope so. A few of the actors and me, we snuck into one of the screenings in Union Square and were watching as the credits rolled. The minute that scene played, people were screaming. It was hilarious to watch.We are definitely trying to set things up for a sequel. But it all depends on this movie performing well and having legs. This is not up to us.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Salzburg Festival, High Passion and Redemption Onstage", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySALZBURG, Austria \u2014 The Salzburg Festival may nowadays be synonymous with classical music, but this venerable summertime event, founded nearly 100 years ago, has drama in its DNA. For the first festival, in 1920, two if its founders, the director Max Reinhardt and the playwright Hugo von Hofmannsthal, joined forces for a legendary production of \u201cJedermann\u201d (\u201cEveryman\u201d), Hofmannsthal\u2019s 1911 drama based on a medieval mystery play.Staging \u201cJedermann\u201d has become one of Salzburg\u2019s enduring traditions. For nearly a century, the work, subtitled \u201cThe Play About the Death of the Rich Man,\u201d has been preaching (in rhyming couplets) against avarice and exhorting the festival\u2019s well-heeled audiences to do a charitable deed.The highly allegorical drama centers on the prosperous and dissolute character of Jedermann, whose callousness and appetites have offended heaven. When Death pays an unexpected visit, Jedermann scrambles to find a companion for his journey to the afterlife. Deserted by his friends and lover and confronted by the paucity of his good deeds, he turns to faith in God, accepts the will of heaven and dies happy.Over the decades, many of Austria\u2019s leading actors have been attracted to the virtuoso title role, including Maximilian Schell, Klaus Maria Brandauer and Peter Simonischek. Since 2017, Salzburg\u2019s Jedermann has been the stage and screen star Tobias Moretti. From the first moment, Mr. Moretti makes the wealthy man despicable, although not entirely without charm. After Death (a melancholy and intense Peter Lohmeyer, skeletal and tattooed) pays his visit, Mr. Moretti registers the panic and terror of a man who realizes too late that he has lived the wrong life. The psychological transformation from sinner to penitent is an extremely tricky one to pull off, but Mr. Moretti\u2019s performance has the dramatic and psychological scope required to make it convincing.Hofmannsthal gave the play a large cast of memorable characters with small speaking roles. Christoph Franken as Mammon (the personification of wealth), Mavie H\u00f6rbiger as Good Deeds and Johannes Silberschneider as Faith provide a surplus of superb acting as they aid Jedermann on his spiritual journey.This being one of Europe\u2019s most exclusive summer festivals, prices are hefty and tickets hard to come by. The irony isn\u2019t lost on the director Michael Sturminger, whose modern-dress staging, unveiled last year, is filled with the sort of smartly dressed people one rubs shoulders with in the audience. The opening scenes, set in Jedermann\u2019s mansion, hold a mirror up to this elite, but there is a touch too much sleaze, as Jedermann, wearing a black silk suit, downs flutes of champagne with his fabulous party guests amid slick but trashy surroundings.The production improves by leaps and bounds once Jedermann is brought to account. As Death, covered by a billowing shawl, slowly descends a staircase, the wide stage below tilts forward dramatically, sending tables, chairs and Jedermann himself crashing to the ground. From that point, the focus remains fixed on the riveting actors, although Mr. Sturminger still has a few tricks up his sleeve, including a devilish peep into the underworld late in the evening. Throughout the 100-minute performance, Wolfgang Mitterer\u2019s anxious, wild score, performed live by the 13 virtuosic musicians of Ensemble 013, lends the production rhythm and verve.Salzburg is a festival that was founded, in part, to reaffirm national culture in the aftermath of the humiliation of World War I, and pride of place is still given to German-language drama. One of this year\u2019s new productions is Johan Simons\u2019s chamber version of Heinrich von Kleist\u2019s 1808 tragedy, \u201cPenthesilea.\u201d (The theatrical lineup also includes Aeschylus\u2019 \u201cThe Persians\u201d and stage versions of the novels \u201cHunger,\u201d by Knut Hamsun, and \u201cA Horse Walks Into a Bar,\u201d by David Grossman).\u201cPenthesilea\u201d is a shocking play of passion and blood lust set against the backdrop of the Trojan War. Before the gates of Troy, the Greek hero, Achilles, and Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons, meet and fall desperately in love. Yet both refuse to surrender to their passion, because of a mix of disbelief, denial and pride. And so they fight and woo in equal measure.When Achilles playfully suggests a fight to the death and approaches the virgin queen unarmed, Penthesilea slaughters him and throws herself on his body along with her dogs, in a scene of cannibalistic derangement. Coming out of her delirium, she kills herself, in one of literature\u2019s weirdest and wildest love-deaths.Kleist claimed that the play contained the \u201centire filth and brilliance\u201d of his soul, and it is possible to get drunk on his rich and precise blank verse. His better-known contemporary, Goethe, held \u201cPenthesilea\u201d in low esteem and thought it was impossible to stage, and it was ignored or ridiculed for most of the 19th century. Since then, writers and scholars including Georg Luk\u00e1cs and Christa Wolf have subjected the play to such interpretations as Marxist and postfeminist.Mr. Simons doesn\u2019t bother with ideology, although the play\u2019s subversion of gender roles is hinted at by the black dress that Achilles sometimes wears. (The costumes are by Nina von Mechow.) Kleist\u2019s sizable cast has been whittled down to the two lead characters, turning the play into a staged dialogue that showcases the sensational, often ferocious, acting of Sandra H\u00fcller in the title role and Jens Harzer as Achilles.Alone together onstage, they often achieve a raw and dangerous intimacy. And their masterly and unexpected delivery of Kleist\u2019s florid and archaic verse can make the poetic language sound fragile and hesitant. Assaulted by the force of their new passion, neither can quite believe in the intensity of these new emotions or admit that they might be reciprocated.As Achilles, Mr. Harzer is often nervous and flirty, although a scene when he strips naked makes clear his intentions toward the Amazon queen. Ms. H\u00fcller, best known for her performance in the 2016 movie \u201cToni Erdmann,\u201d gets to show an even wider range, tearing through the role with bluster, rapture and anguish, emitting cries, shrieks and howls that are sometimes slightly comic. At times, the two actors leave their characters and provide the narration or commentary that would usually be provided by the play\u2019s supporting characters.Especially in the slow first half-hour of exposition, before the actors fully settle into the lead roles, the idea of making this a two-person show can seem less than convincing. Still, in a production of such intimate intensity, one imagines the result might look very different from night to night.As an unflinching examination of destructive love, Mr. Simons\u2019s concentrated and demanding \u201cPenthesilea\u201d is a far cry from Mr. Sturminger\u2019s crowd-pleasing \u201cJedermann.\u201d Despite its morbid theme, Hofmannsthal\u2019s work celebrates the Christian promise of salvation. It isn\u2019t clear what redemptive message \u201cPenthesilea\u201d could possibly hold, beyond a belief in the power of theater to plumb the depths of human passion. But for a festival that for nearly 100 years has presented drama at the highest level, that\u2019s more than enough.An earlier version of this article misidentified the actor playing Death in the drama \u201cJedermann.\u201d He is Peter Lohmeyer, not Hanno Koffler. It also misstated the title of a novel by David Grossman. It is \u201cA Horse Walks Into a Bar,\u201d not \u201cA Dog Walks Into a Bar.\u201dThe Salzburg Festival runs through Aug. 30.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New York Times Reviews Neil Simon", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA look at the work of Neil Simon over the decades reveals a prolific chronicler of New York City life who examined angst, romance and ambition through a comic lens, whether for the stage, film or television. Critics, like audiences in general, were mixed in their response to Mr. Simon\u2019s comedy, which tended toward shticky one-liners and heart-squeezing monologues. Here is a look at his most notable works, how The New York Times reviewed them and (when available) where you can stream them.\u201cMr. Simon evidently has no aspirations except to be diverting, and he achieves those with the dash of a highly skilled professional writer,\u201d Mr. Taubman wrote.In his review, Mr. Taubman wrote of Mr. Simon: \u201cHis skill \u2014 and it is not only great but constantly growing \u2014 lies in his gift for the deliciously surprising line and attitude. His instinct for incongruity is faultless. It nearly always operates on a basis of character.\u201dThe film was remade in 1999 with Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, but without Mr. Simon\u2019s participation.Mr. Simon, he wrote, \u201chas taken the trouble to trouble his people, tease the laughs to see what real woes lie beneath them. He has made a magnificent effort to part company with the mechanical, and his overall success stands as handsome proof that humor and honesty can be got into bed together. But in winnowing out the last traces of contrived situation comedy, Mr. Simon may also have thrown away situation itself.\u201dThe Farrelly Brothers remade the film in 2007 with Ben Stiller, Michelle Monaghan and Malin Akerman, without Mr. Simon\u2019s participation.That same month, CBS aired a new TV movie of the play, again adapted by Mr. Simon and updated to the 1990s, with Woody Allen and Peter Falk in the leading roles.Two years later, Mr. Simon and the director Robert Moore teamed up once again with Mr. Falk and Ms. Brennan for \u201cThe Cheap Detective,\u201d in which (as in \u201cMurder by Death\u201d), Mr. Falk starred as a Humphrey Bogart-style private investigator.Mr. Simon received his third Academy Award nomination for this original screenplay, in which a newly dumped single mother (Marsha Mason) is forced into an \u201cOdd Couple\u201d-style relationship with a guitar-strumming, yoga-practicing new-to-New-York actor (Richard Dreyfuss). They initially drive each other crazy but, of course, eventually fall in love. Mr. Dreyfuss won the Oscar for best actor; in addition to Mr. Simon\u2019s script, the film was nominated for best actress, best supporting actress (for Quinn Cummings) and best picture.In a reversal of his usual migration, Mr. Simon subsequently adapted the film script for the stage. The Broadway musical version of \u201cThe Goodbye Girl\u201d debuted in February 1993 and ran 188 performances, with Bernadette Peters and Martin Short in the leads.Nine years later, Mr. Simon removed the music and rewrote the script again for a TV movie adaptation, directed by Richard Benjamin. Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton took over the leading roles.\u201cAs adapted by Mr. Simon himself and directed smoothly and adroitly by Martha Coolidge,\u201d Janet Maslin wrote, \u201cNeil Simon\u2019s \u2018Lost in Yonkers\u2019 is sometimes more picturesque than powerful. But it conveys all the warmth and color of the original material.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
