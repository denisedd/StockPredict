How do the things we\u2019re talking about and spending our time on affect the peace and prosperity of the nation? Scandal mongering for partisan advantage makes our nation less secure.

But while negotiations with North Korea were going well, the administration largely turned a blind eye to the problem.The marine companies were sanctioned for doing business with a Russian company, Divetechnoservices, that the Trump administration had sanctioned on June 11 over its links to Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the main security and intelligence agency in the country.\u201cThe Treasury Department is disrupting Russian efforts to circumvent our sanctions,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a news release. \u201cToday\u2019s action against these deceptive actors is critical to ensure that the public is aware of the tactics undertaken by designated parties and that these actors remain blocked from the U.S. financial system.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The filmmakers explain \u2014 by text, Google Hangout and other platforms. Skype was on the fritz. I was trying to do a call with the filmmakers of \u201cSearching,\u201d a thriller that unfolds on computer screens and digital devices, but mine were not cooperating. The audio was clear but the filmmakers weren\u2019t showing up onscreen, and the clock was ticking. I didn\u2019t want to take time away to download an update to the app (and yes, I did that thing in which you deactivate and reactivate the camera button), so after some more fiddling, we decided to move the conversation to Google Hangouts instead. Trying to figure out the best way to communicate through constantly changing technology is the story of my life right now, probably yours as well. And using tech to solve problems is pretty much a daily task. \u201cSearching\u201d takes these ideas to the most urgent of places: How well could we navigate a sea of technology if someone\u2019s life depended on it? Much like those earlier films, \u201cSearching\u201d takes an unconventional approach to storytelling, which meant even the screenplay was written in an unconventional way. I asked Mr. Chaganty via iMessage about the difference. He texted, \u201cWhat we ended up writing was a scriptment \u2014 a creative mix of a screenplay and a treatment that factored in the mouse movement, text messages and browser windows.\u201dAnd yet, with all these forms of expression, sometimes they pull us away from those closest to us. That becomes clear when David realizes he doesn\u2019t know where his daughter has been spending her time. (In one scene, someone tells David that Margot has a Tumblr account. He Googles \u201ctumbler.\u201d) To visualize that difference, the filmmakers created a look for each character\u2019s computer. David\u2019s is more private, with less on his desktop and a sense of order. Margot\u2019s is a social world that keeps opening up further, forcing David to figure out how to navigate it.

{"Headline": "Stumbles? What Stumbles? Big Tech Is as Strong as Ever", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtYou may have heard that the tech giants are on their heels.The concerns span the gamut. There are calls for renewed antitrust investigations. Some people have accused the companies of political biases, while others have criticized their lack of diversity and how narrowly they distribute their wealth. Then there are the questions of their vulnerability to foreign influence and their capacity for addicting us to their products.Wait, but what about Facebook, which told investors to expect lower growth rates and higher expenses, causing its stock to lose $120 billion in market value in a single day?In a strange way, the social network\u2019s troubles only underscored its dominance. Even after its stock crash, Facebook remains the fifth most valuable corporation in the American markets, ahead of Berkshire Hathaway, and there are almost no serious calls for its chief executive to resign, as you might expect for any other company experiencing such a loss. That\u2019s because the company reported little to cause experts to alter their long-term outlook. Pretty much everyone who studies Facebook believes that it will hold its grip on the culture and the advertising industry for the foreseeable future.\u201cThis is one of the most profitable business models I\u2019ve ever seen, and that really hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at the firm RBC Capital. He added that Facebook\u2019s stock now \u201cmay be the single most attractively priced asset across technology.\u201dTogether the earning statements tell a clear story. Despite the public outcry, the five are all expanding their foothold in our lives, and the forces arrayed against them, which range from regulation to apathy, aren\u2019t having a substantial impact. To the extent that the five companies face meaningful competition, it is usually from other members of the group; that is, one of the five might steal market share from another without affecting the overall dynamic in the tech business.Why is this happening? If you dig into their reports, you find several powerful forces keeping these companies at the top.Back when it was just an e-commerce company, Amazon was dogged by a persistent worry: Could it ever make a lot of money? The company has spent more than two decades methodically building out its capacity to deliver an ever larger number of products at an ever-increasing rate. That takes a lot of investment, so even though Amazon\u2019s sales grew like crazy every year, it had to plow its revenue back into further expansion.Three years ago, Amazon began to report small but consistent profits. And in the last year, its earnings began to grow, and now they\u2019ve reached a level that stands out even in the tech industry. In the quarter ending in June, Amazon booked a $2.5 billion profit. That\u2019s only about half what Facebook made, but it is real money.Where did Amazon find all the new money? The same place the tech industry always finds profits: software. Though most people think of Amazon as a place to buy toilet paper, the vast majority of its profits come from its cloud-services business, Amazon Web Services, which allows companies to store their data on Amazon\u2019s servers rather than locally. Another new source of profits is its advertising business, which charges companies to place ads for their products across Amazon\u2019s site.\u201cThese high-margin businesses allow Amazon to run its entire store at close to zero margin \u2014 and once you do that, it becomes effectively impossible for someone whose sole business is commerce to compete with you,\u201d said Youssef Squali, an analyst at the firm SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.But Big Tech\u2019s earnings so far don\u2019t show much of an impact from the increased scrutiny. Google paid its fine and still reported a $3.2 billion quarterly profit. Neither Google nor Facebook saw much of an effect from Europe\u2019s new privacy rule, the General Data Protection Regulation. Facebook\u2019s user base declined by only a million users in Europe (367 million people use it every month there). Both companies warned that the law may have a greater effect in the future, but several analysts said both Google and Facebook could benefit from the law, because compliance costs could sink their smaller rivals.Or consider the changing dynamics of the digital advertising business, which is dominated by Google and Facebook and has been a top target of antitrust activists. Amazon\u2019s growing ad business poses a threat to both Google and Facebook \u2014 which suggests that the ad economy is becoming more competitive even without the government\u2019s help.\u201cThere\u2019s been this fear that advertising was going to become a duopoly owned by Google and Facebook,\u201d Mr. Mahaney said. \u201cNow it\u2019s going to be a triopoly \u2014 but if you were worried about the duopoly, you\u2019re probably saying, \u2018Couldn\u2019t the third company have been someone besides Amazon?\u2019\u201dFinally, there are what Mr. Mahaney calls the \u201cgreen fields\u201d \u2014 the nearly endless opportunities that many of the Five have to start minting more and more money from various parts of their businesses.Facebook, for instance, has experienced a slowdown in the growth of its core social network, but its other properties \u2014 Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp among them \u2014 are still growing quickly, and the company has only just started to make money from them. At Google, there\u2019s a similar opportunity for YouTube, which, like Facebook, will benefit from the billions in TV advertising money that marketers will shift online over the next few years.And that\u2019s just in the short term. The earnings reports show that all of the five are investing heavily in the tech that will dominate the future, from artificial intelligence to voice services to self-driving cars.\u201cThe one thing that is likely to keep these companies at the top for much longer than traditional megacap companies is that they are not afraid to reinvent themselves,\u201d Mr. Squali said. \u201cThey see themselves as laboratories for new ideas, and they\u2019re not afraid to destroy something that\u2019s working today to make the longer-term work even better for them.\u201dIn other words: Get used to the Five. They\u2019re not going anywhere.Advertisement"}

That puts the Big Apple in a unique position to address a diversity problem that plagues the tech industry on the opposite coast.\n \nFrom fashion to finance, New York tech is a melting pot of startups, established companies and industries. And the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program channels the variety of backgrounds, perspectives and professions to foster multidisciplinary thinkers who can diversify an overwhelmingly white and male tech industry in the United States.A focus on diversity attracts tech talent to the city, according to a 2018 survey by the nonprofit Tech: NYC, with 89 percent of respondents citing the diverse population as a draw and 74 percent citing the variety of industries to choose from as a lure.\n \n\u201cDiversity is very important for innovation, as people with different perspectives, training, backgrounds and cultures come together to look at the same problem differently,\u201d said Erik Grimmelmann, president of the nonprofit NY Tech Alliance.In New York\u2019s tech sector, gender, ethnic and racial diversity start in the classroom. The Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management and Cornell Tech started the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program in 2014, taking up temporary residence in Google office space in New York and officially relocating to Cornell Tech\u2019s 12-acre campus on Manhattan\u2019s Roosevelt Island in fall 2017. The program has since attracted women, minorities and international students with resumes and interests from an array of backgrounds.\u201cThe amazing thing about building an [academic program] from scratch is that you can be really deliberate about important things like diversity,\u201d said Julie Samuels, the executive director of Tech:NYC, which supports the city\u2019s tech sector.The Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program was built around the concept that the best leaders and innovators have a variety of skill sets, and that they seek out unique perspectives in others. That\u2019s evident in the way student teams in the program\u2019s Studio curriculum mimic the most successful tech companies, said Mukti Khaire, the Girish and Jaidev Reddy Professor of Practice at Cornell Tech and the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business.Some projects might see a computer scientist paired with, say, a market expert and a designer. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than to show students that diversity is important in these teams for really creative problem solving,\u201d Khaire said.John Quinn, who graduated in spring 2018, said he had to up his game academically and creatively because of the mix of races, ages and backgrounds. Quinn\u2019s career was on track, with him working in digital payments at MasterCard in Dublin, his hometown. But he realized tech expertise alone wasn\u2019t enough to continue advancing at the company. Now, with a Johnson Cornell Tech MBA, he\u2019s starting a new role at MasterCard\u2019s NYC Technology Hub.For Quinn, diversity and inclusion workshops on campus were also eye openers.\u201cIt was amazing how honest people could be,\u201d he said, referring to sessions in which women and minorities spoke about the challenges they face in tech. \u201cIt will make me a better co-worker and a better manager to be aware of these things.\u201dNew York\u2019s large and diverse network of students, workers and entrepreneurs attracts tech professionals who might otherwise have headed to Silicon Valley. On the West Coast, \u201cYou get a lot of homogeneity in thought and how people approach problems,\u201d said David Cheng, a 2017 Cornell Tech MBA grad.That\u2019s a big reason Cheng, a former software engineer and consultant in Washington, chose New York to start a mobile speech therapy app he developed with classmates. Just last year, Speech Up won Cornell Tech\u2019s Startup Award, which included workspace at its Tata Innovation Center, where students and companies work to bring new ideas to market.Cheng, who attended speech therapy sessions as a child, said he was drawn to New York because so many of its industries are reinventing themselves through tech. \u201cBeing part of the community that is doing that is something that really appealed to me,\u201d he said.Kendall Jakes, also a 2017 Cornell Tech MBA grad, said the program\u2019s multicultural and multidisciplinary approach attracted her as well. She worked for a Chicago food company in a role that combined technology and business. But as she looked into M.B.A. programs to help with her next career, she found most wanted to put her in either a tech or a business \u201cbucket.\u201d\u201cThat isn\u2019t how the world works. Why should we be siloed?\u201d said Jakes, now a technical solutions specialist at Microsoft\u2019s New York office, adding that the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program was a place where she was totally accepted.Jakes also said she loved that her class was 40 percent female, a contrast to the broader U.S. tech workforce, which is 76 percent male. \u201cWe were a force to be reckoned with,\u201d she said.New York\u2019s thriving tech industry is no Silicon Valley, and that\u2019s just fine, said Grimmelmann, the NY Tech Alliance president.\u201cOut West, it\u2019s all tech, all the time,\u201d he said. Conversely, New York mixes tech with other disciplines and radically changes them. FinTech, EdTech and HealthTech, for example, are flourishing in the city.Diversity in industries, cultures and backgrounds creates the best innovators and leaders, said Samuels, Tech:NYC's executive director. \u201cThe most successful employees,\u201d she said, \u201care the ones who are really good at problem solving and can navigate a fast-growing company \u2014 versus stay in your lane and do your own job.\u201dJakes agrees. In New York \u2014 and in the Johnson Cornell Tech MBA program \u2014 she doesn\u2019t feel pigeonholed, she said, but rather celebrated for being a \u201ccreative techie.\u201d\u201cI love the energy here,\u201d Jakes said. \u201cThat\u2019s something really different about New York.\u201dThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

Cameo \u201ctalent\u201d is free to reject any request found \u201cconfusing, difficult, or not in line with an athlete\u2019s or influencer\u2019s image,\u201d so the potential thrill of being recognized by a B-list celebrity always comes with the risk of being rebuffed by one.Steven Galanis, a former LinkedIn account executive who is C.E.O. of Cameo, realized a couple years ago that \u201cthe celebrity selfie is the new autograph\u201d and set out to democratize the experience with the help of co-founders Devon Townsend, a former Microsoft engineer, and Martin Blencowe, a producer and N.F.L. agent. Now, you no longer need to hope for a random celebrity run-in to secure such an image; you can pay Cameo to engineer it for you.But Mr. Galanis\u2019s even-more-valuable intuition was this: Famous people are willing to do a lot more for money than was previously assumed. Mr. Galanis recalled asking the New York Knicks player Lance Thomas, a friend of his from college, how much it would cost for him to make an appearance at a Long Island bar mitzvah, and he replied, \u201cBro, I\u2019ll go anywhere for $2,000.\u201d Along the way, Cameo has unwittingly created a new style of performance.

Even a \u201cbad\u201d Cameo offers something of value, which is a totally new way of analyzing a celebrity persona. Dina Lohan, best known for giving birth to Lindsay, has struggled to adapt to the form.

{"Headline": "Lego Wants to Completely Remake Its Toy Bricks (Without Anyone Noticing)", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBILLUND, Denmark \u2014 At the heart of this town lies a building that is a veritable temple to the area\u2019s most famous creation, the humble Lego brick. It is filled with complex creations, from a 50-foot tree to a collection of multicolored dinosaurs, all of them built with a product that has barely changed in more than 50 years.A short walk away in its research lab, though, Lego is trying to refashion the product it is best known for: It wants to eliminate its dependence on petroleum-based plastics, and build its toys entirely from plant-based or recycled materials by 2030.The challenge is designing blocks that click together yet separate easily, retain bright colors, and survive the rigors of being put through a laundry load, or the weight of an unknowing parent\u2019s foot. In essence, the company wants to switch the ingredients, but keep the product exactly the same.\u201cWe need to learn again how to do this,\u201d said Henrik Ostergaard Nielsen, a production supervisor at Lego\u2019s factory here in Billund.With so many large businesses changing their practices, recycling will \u201cbecome the norm,\u201d said David Blanchard, Unilever\u2019s head of research and development.Lego faces a more complex problem than other consumer businesses, though \u2014 for this Danish company, plastics are not the packaging, they are the product.The toymaker\u2019s highly automated manufacturing facility here in Billund is a picture of clock work. At a mammoth factory more than 500 yards long, machines arranged in rows melt plastic pellets into a molten paste and press them into molds. A few seconds later, a batch of colored bricks pops out, and is deposited into driverless carts, taken to be stored for shipment. Each day, the facility churns out about 100 million \u201celements,\u201d the term Lego uses for the bricks, trees and doll parts it sells.Lego \u2014 the company\u2019s name is a contraction of the Danish words for \u201cplay well\u201d \u2014 traces its roots back to the early 1930s, when a carpenter named Ole Kirk Kristiansen began making and selling handsome fire engines and other wooden toys.By the 1950s, he was experimenting with plastic bricks. His son Godtfred began marketing the distinctive little blocks not just as toys, but as a building system that could be expanded and passed on to later generations. Bricks that date back to 1958 are still compatible with current products, according to Lego.Today, the company sells its wares worldwide and has secured partnerships with film franchises like Batman and Star Wars to market not just themed brick sets, but movies and video games featuring Lego toys. It brought in 7.8 billion kroner, or about $1.2 billion, in profit last year, making it larger than its American rivals Mattel and Hasbro. The Kirk Kristiansen family, which still controls Lego, was paid a $1.1 billion dividend.Its heft, however, brings with it a substantial carbon footprint. Lego emits about a million tons of carbon dioxide each year, about three-quarters of which comes from the raw materials that go into its factories, according to Tim Brooks, the company\u2019s vice president for environmental responsibility.Lego is taking a two-pronged approach to reducing the amount of pollution it causes. For one, it wants to keep all of its packaging out of landfills by 2025 by eliminating things like plastic bags inside its cardboard packaging.It is also pushing for the plastic in its toys to come from sources like plant fibers or recycled bottles by 2030.The problem with that target, though, is that virtually all of the plastic used worldwide \u2014 including that molded by Lego into toy bricks \u2014 is created from petroleum.Currently, Lego mostly uses a substance known as ABS, short for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, a common plastic also used for computer keys and mobile phone cases. It\u2019s tough, yet slightly elastic, and also has a polished surface.To wean itself off products like ABS, Lego has begun an exhaustive search for new, sustainable materials.It is investing about 1 billion kroner and hiring about 100 people to work on these changes. Technicians methodically test promising materials to see whether they can take a whack without breaking, or survive a hard pull. They are checked to see if they withstand the heat of a Saudi Arabian summer, and take on the bright color palette that Lego bricks are famous for. The company\u2019s bricks may look simple, but they are made with incredible precision.\u201cWe look at how does it look, and how does it feel,\u201d said Nelleke van der Puil, Lego\u2019s vice president for materials.Company researchers have already experimented with around 200 alternatives. Among them, Ms. van der Puil said, was a substance called PLA, one of the few bio-based plastics that are readily available. Lego is also already using polyethylene made from sugar-cane husks in flexible pieces like dragon wings, palm trees and fishing rods, but these constitute only 1 percent to 2 percent of its output, and the material is too soft for the company\u2019s toy blocks.Most test materials, both bio-based and recycled, have so far fallen short. Some bricks made with the new materials have broken, leaving sharp edges that could injure a child, or have popped out with ugly, muddied colors. Others have on occasion produced misshapen or pockmarked bricks.The search for a substitute for petroleum-based plastic could yet take years of work, Mr. Brooks acknowledged. Still, executives argue that, as a company that models itself as a de facto educator as much as a profitable enterprise, it has little option but to keep trying.\u201cIt is important,\u201d said Mr. Brooks, \u201cthat we can make a toy that doesn\u2019t jeopardize\u201d children\u2019s future.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Is Worth $1,000,000,000,000. Two Decades Ago, It Was Almost Bankrupt.", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple\u2019s ascent from the brink of bankruptcy to the world\u2019s most valuable public company has been a business tour de force, marked by rapid innovation, a series of smash-hit products and the creation of a sophisticated, globe-spanning supply chain that keeps costs down while producing enormous volumes of cutting-edge devices.A look at how Apple\u2019s trillion-dollar value stacks up against other companies and entire industries.\u201cCould anyone really imagine this back then?\u201d said Apple\u2019s former software chief Avie Tevanian, who joined Apple in 1997. \u201cWe hoped to make the company very successful and very valuable. But to think it would get to where it was today? Of course not. And Steve wouldn\u2019t have thought that, either.\u201dApple was founded in 1976 with the mission of making computers \u2014 then bulky, complicated industrial machines \u2014 cheap, small and simple so they could become a mass-market product. By the 1980s, the company was one of the world\u2019s best-known brands.But in 1985, Mr. Jobs was ousted in a boardroom coup. In the following years, the company was increasingly outgunned and outmaneuvered in the personal-computer market it helped invent.Apple, hamstrung by a lack of new ideas, failed products and leadership turmoil, had lost its way.Fred Anderson, Apple\u2019s former chief financial officer, said that shortly after he joined in 1996, he initiated a $661 million bond offering to keep the company afloat. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how bad it was until I started digging in,\u201d he said.By the end of that year, Apple had lost $867 million and the total value of its shares was less than $3 billion.The ailing company decided to take a gamble. It bought Next, a tech firm run by Mr. Jobs, for $400 million. Mr. Jobs, still synonymous with the Apple brand, would return to the company he had founded.Mr. Jobs slashed 70 percent of Apple\u2019s product plans, commissioned the company\u2019s \u201cThink Different\u201d ad campaign and reimagined how it put its products together.The focus on simplicity became a hallmark of Apple, from the way Mr. Jobs dressed \u2014 jeans and black mock turtlenecks became his uniform of sorts \u2014 to the way his products operated to the eventual look of his company\u2019s retail stores.In 1998, Apple introduced the iMac G3, a round, colorful, all-in-one desktop computer. It became a hit. Apple had its swagger back.The company\u2019s revitalization was confirmed with the iPod, the portable music player that almost immediately changed consumers\u2019 relationship with music. The iPod, which debuted in 2001 and went on to sell more than 400 million units, showed that Apple wasn\u2019t just a computer company. The device was paired with iTunes, the company\u2019s music store, which would help upend the recording industry. And it portended a bigger product to come.\u201cThe iPod was a step \u2014 a really important one,\u201d said Ken Kocienda, a longtime Apple software engineer who will soon release a book about Apple called \u201cCreative Selection.\u201d \u201cBut the iPhone was really the definitive answer to the question: What comes next after personal computers?\u201dThe iPhone transformed the way society interacts with technology, and quickly became one of the best-selling products ever: More than 1.4 billion have been sold since it was introduced in 2007.No product or decision was remotely as instrumental to Apple\u2019s rise to $1 trillion as the iPhone. When Mr. Jobs first announced the iPhone, Apple was worth $73.4 billion.Former employees and analysts said that while Mr. Jobs deserved credit for overseeing the reinvention of the company\u2019s vision and its innovation, his successor, Timothy D. Cook, had also played a crucial role in the turnaround by overhauling the way Apple built its products.Mr. Cook, as chief operating officer under Mr. Jobs, remade Apple\u2019s distribution pipeline to heavily rely on contract manufacturers in China, which gave it the flexibility, cost savings and scale to build such a big business.As chief executive, Mr. Cook has also overseen most of the rise in Apple\u2019s value. (The total value of the company\u2019s shares was $346 billion when he took the helm in August 2011.) Mr. Cook has been a steady, if unflashy, hand as chief executive, building the iPhone into a huge business, including sales of accessories and services off it.Now, with Apple reaching the $1 trillion milestone and the iPhone turning 11 years old, pressure is likely to increase for the company to develop a hit new product.There have been other popular devices, like the iPad, the Apple Watch and routinely updated versions of Apple\u2019s personal computers. But none have come close to the impact of the iPhone.The company also has been linked to self-driving cars and augmented reality glasses, but Apple would face major technical and even social hurdles with either product.\u201cIt\u2019s been one of the most miraculous corporate turnarounds in business history,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, a technology analyst and consultant who has tracked the company for nearly 40 years. \u201cThe question going forward is: Can Apple continue to innovate?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Facebook, or Anybody, Solve the Internet\u2019s Misinformation Problem?", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtThe social network was slow to recognize such campaigns as threats before the 2016 presidential election, and it surely deserves some credit for what Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, described as the company\u2019s shift from \u201creactive to proactive detection\u201d of coordinated propaganda operations.But it was not just Iran, and not just Facebook.Feeling better yet? Yeah, me neither.These drip-by-drip revelations inspire something like the opposite of confidence. Find one cockroach in the kitchen and you might feel better for having caught the sucker. Find another, and then another, and pretty soon you start to wonder if you should burn your house down.And these revelations of mischief underscore the novelty of the threats we are dealing with \u2014 and how unprepared we might be to handle them.Some of these disclosures are about actual criminal activity. But others, like the Iranian campaign, describe a more fuzzy kind of misbehavior, one that is not obviously illegal, and whose tactics amount to something that lots of people do everyday: Lying on the internet.Given the gray area some of these activities occupy, figuring out what to make of each revelation \u2014 how to assess its potential impact and our collective capacity to respond to it \u2014 is going to be the next great task of digital society. And the task is far bigger than any of us realize now.\u201cThe work you see now from Facebook, Microsoft and others to be more proactive is a trend that is positive \u2014 it\u2019s part of the solution, and I would want to see that trend continue,\u201d said Graham Brookie, director of the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, a think tank that has been working with Facebook on election-security issues.But Mr. Brookie added: \u201cIs this a solution? No, definitely not.\u201dA solution, he said, would involve a society-wide reckoning with the problem of the vulnerabilities that the internet has uncovered in democratic society. A solution would involve the federal government taking the lead in such an effort, which is not really happening at the moment. A solution would also involve citizens becoming far more vigilant about what they see online, how they respond to it, and the effect it has on their political lives.And even with all that, we may not really get an actual solution. Instead, the best we might hope for is something like an ongoing cat-and-mouse game between good and bad actors online: a fight that never ends, but whose damage we can at least hope to reduce.That\u2019s the long game. The short game is rather more depressing.Consider the most pressing question: How confident should you be that the coming midterm elections will be safe from hacking and propaganda operations online? The most likely answer: Nobody knows for sure, but probably not very confident.Facebook and other tech companies are stepping up their efforts to police their sites before the midterms. But some of the threats they have spotted so far have little to do with the election. The Iranian operation, for example, has been going on for years, and to judge by some of the content posted by these Facebook pages, was not aimed squarely at American elections, but instead American policy.In a call with reporters on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg argued that Facebook has been making progress on keeping elections safe, having learned from several races around the world since 2016.\u201cThere was the French election, the German election, the Alabama special election, the Mexican election \u2014 and in each of these elections, our systems have been able to find a lot of fake accounts that were attempting potentially to do bad things on the system,\u201d he said.Each time the company finds something, Mr. Zuckerberg added, \u201cWe get better at identifying this kind of activity up front and putting barriers in place to those who would try to abuse these systems.\u201dHis words are somewhat reassuring, but only in that they feel like the bare minimum that a company like Facebook should do.The government\u2019s failure to address these threats have left the United States \u201cunprepared to protect the 2018 elections,\u201d Mr. Stamos said. He outlined a set of legislative, regulatory and law enforcement steps Americans might take to secure their digital house.If we move fast, he said, we might be able to salvage 2020.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Tech Billionaires Hack Their Taxes With a Philanthropic Loophole", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLate in 2014, Nicholas Woodman, the founder and chief executive of GoPro, announced what appeared to be an extraordinary act of generosity.Mr. Woodman, then 39, had just taken his camera company public, and was suddenly worth about $3 billion. Now he was giving away much of that wealth \u2014 some $500 million worth of GoPro stock \u2014 to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, an organization based in Mountain View, Calif., that would house the assets of the newly formed Jill and Nicholas Woodman Foundation.The executive basked in prestige and gratitude. The Chronicle of Philanthropy named Mr. Woodman one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s most generous donors\u201d that year, placing him alongside established philanthropists like Bill and Melinda Gates and Michael R. Bloomberg.But four years on, there is almost no trace of the Woodman Foundation, or that $500 million. The foundation has no website and has not listed its areas of focus, and it is not known what \u2014 if any \u2014 significant grants it has made to nonprofits. An extensive search of public records turned up just one beneficiary: the Bonny Doon Art, Wine and Brew Festival, a benefit for an elementary school in California.Instead, the Woodman Foundation essentially exists as an account within the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, which is not required to disclose details about how, if at all, individual donors spend their charitable dollars. Mr. Woodman, GoPro and the Silicon Valley Community Foundation all declined to discuss the Woodman Foundation.If the benefit to the needy is difficult to see, the benefit to Mr. Woodman is clear. After GoPro\u2019s initial public offering, he faced an enormous tax bill in 2014. But by donating via the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, he eased his tax burden in two ways. First, Mr. Woodman avoided paying capital gains taxes on that $500 million worth of stock, a figure that most likely would have been in the tens of millions of dollars. He was also able to claim a charitable deduction that most likely saved millions of dollars more, and probably reduced his personal tax bill for years to come.Mr. Woodman achieved this enticing combination of tax efficiency and secrecy by using a donor-advised fund \u2014 a sort of charitable checking account with serious tax benefits and little or no accountability.Donor-advised funds, or D.A.F.s, allow wealthy individuals like Mr. Woodman to give assets \u2014 usually cash and stock, but also real estate, art and cryptocurrencies \u2014 to a sponsoring organization like the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, Fidelity Charitable or Vanguard Charitable. But while donors part ways with their money, they don\u2019t give up control. The sponsoring organizations make grants to hospitals, schools and the like only at a donor\u2019s request. So while donors enjoy immediate tax benefits, charities can wait for funds indefinitely, and maybe forever.For these reasons and more, D.A.F.s have become one of the most controversial issues in the charitable world.Proponents say D.A.F.s have democratized giving, because they are simple to create and the individuals who use them are more generous than those who establish family foundations. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win,\u201d said Greg Avis, interim president of the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. \u201cThe donor has a tax benefit, and the beneficiaries are the nonprofits.\u201dBut to critics, D.A.F.s represent the worst of philanthropy today \u2014 a system of guaranteed perks for the rich and uncertainty for the rest.Unlike family foundations, which are required to distribute 5 percent of their assets each year and have historically been the way wealthy donors disbursed their philanthropic firepower, D.A.F.s have no distribution requirements, meaning that billions of dollars earmarked for charity can sit idle for decades. And because organizations that manage D.A.F.s are not required to report which funds give money to which causes, it is impossible to know how much money individual donors are giving away to nonprofit organizations.That D.A.F.s have become so popular with Silicon Valley billionaires has only added to their intrigue. Society is still reckoning with the dark sides of social media and online privacy, and there is concern that D.A.F.s \u2014 a dream vehicle for the overnight wealthy \u2014 may prove to be another instance of techno-optimists disrupting a system with unintended consequences.\u201cThey\u2019re a fraud on the American taxpayer,\u201d said Ed Kleinbard, a tax professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cThey\u2019re a way for the affluent to have their cake and eat it, too.\u201dApproaching the Silicon Valley Community Foundation after a tech windfall has become a familiar pattern. In December 2012, just months after Facebook went public, Mr. Zuckerberg donated $500 million of Facebook shares to the group. In 2014, soon after Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion, Mr. Koum and Mr. Acton donated a combined $846 million to the foundation. In both cases, the establishment of D.A.F.s allowed the men to reap a substantial tax advantage just when they needed it most.Some of this money is put to swift use. Mr. Zuckerberg has used his D.A.F. to give away tens of millions to schools and hospitals in the San Francisco area. Mr. Hastings has used his D.A.F. to give to the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley and the United Negro College Fund. In each case, the donors voluntarily publicized their gifts.Organizations that manage D.A.F.s say most of their account holders, anonymous though they may be, are similarly generous. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation distributed $1.3 billion during the last fiscal year to groups including the South San Francisco Unified School District and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Schwab Charitable, another big sponsor of D.A.F.s, said it distributed nearly $2 billion during the last fiscal year, making some 420,000 grants to nonprofits including Feeding America, the American Red Cross and Planned Parenthood.Yet in the case of Mr. Woodman, there is reason to question how much money was made available for charity. He established his D.A.F. the day after GoPro stock approached its highest-ever price, about $95 per share. From a financial perspective, Mr. Woodman could not have timed his gift more perfectly.News of his donation sent GoPro shares tumbling as much as 14 percent the next day, as investors interpreted the move as a lack of confidence in the stock. By the end of the year, GoPro had lost more than a third of its value. By the end of 2015, the stock traded near $18 a share. Today, GoPro stock is worth less than $6 a share.\u201cSmart donors have been playing timing games with the charitable deduction for a long time,\u201d said Roger Colinvaux, a tax professor at the Catholic University of America\u2019s Columbus School of Law. \u201cIn this case, he potentially gets a very large deduction and gives nothing away. That\u2019s a disturbing public policy issue.\u201dOn Reddit, Mr. Woodman suggested that his wealth was reaching charities: \u201cThe Foundation has gone on to fund causes supporting women and children and will continue to do so!!!!\u201d Just how much money has gone to which organizations, of course, remains a mystery.When it comes to D.A.F.s, the United States tax code rewards the promise of good intentions. Wealthy donors \u2014 including many of the Silicon Valley billionaires who have asked the public to trust them with their digital lives \u2014 pledge to distribute their funds to charity once they get their tax break. But in the absence of rules requiring donors to give their money away, it is hard to know what public good comes in exchange for those lucrative write-offs.Skeptics see a system ripe for abuse. Donors might wait years to engage in meaningful philanthropic activity, or decide to simply leave the fund for their children to manage.\u201cWe\u2019ve put this rule in place that says you get maximum tax benefits when you make a donation,\u201d said Ray Madoff, a professor at the Boston College Law School and a vocal critic of donor-advised funds. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do anything with it.\u201dMs. Norley of Fidelity Charitable argues that on balance, account holders are generous. At her organization, roughly a quarter of the assets held in D.A.F.s have been distributed to nonprofits in each of the past two years. Other sponsor organizations report similar distribution rates.Yet such statistics can be skewed. In many instances, these figures include transfers from one D.A.F. to another. In the most recent fiscal year, for instance, Vanguard Charitable sent more than $15 million from its D.A.F.s to Fidelity Charitable. Sponsor organizations say this is simply a matter of wealthy donors adjusting their accounts. But it also creates the illusion of meaningful philanthropic activity where there is none.And while the overall payout rate at an organization that manages D.A.F.s may be substantial, the numbers could be warped by a few donors who give away huge sums, while a majority of donors give away virtually nothing at all.Critics argue that some sponsor organizations even have an incentive to keep funds undisbursed to charities. That is because D.A.F.s have emerged as a lucrative source of revenue for financial firms.For example, Fidelity Charitable, which is structured as an independent public charity, pays millions in annual fees to Fidelity Management, the big asset manager. Fidelity Management then invests the billions of dollars held in Fidelity Charitable\u2019s D.A.F.s, making money there as well. Vanguard, Schwab and Goldman Sachs all get millions in fees from their affiliated public charities. The more money held in D.A.F.s, the greater the potential earnings for the financial groups.The fact that D.A.F.s have become a profit center for Wall Street firms is a perversion of the philanthropic system, critics say.\u201cThe charitable deduction is not meant to give tax breaks to very wealthy people. It\u2019s meant to encourage giving to worthy nonprofit organizations,\u201d said Dean Zerbe, an attorney who worked for Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, when Mr. Grassley was chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got instead is a huge warehousing of funds with massive amount of fees being extracted by Wall Street.\u201dFidelity and Goldman brush off such criticism as misinformed, arguing that they are simply providing a valuable service to their clients by streamlining their charitable giving and offering them legal tax benefits. Some D.A.F. sponsors have rules in place that require accounts to disburse at least some money every few years.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d said Karey Dye, president of the Goldman Sachs Philanthropy Fund, where Laurene Powell Jobs and the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer recently established D.A.F.s. \u201cPeople have irrevocably given money away to charity. Most often they are wanting to give money away to things that are meaningful to them and make a difference.\u201dAt the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, the drive to accumulate assets appears to have been particularly intense. Former and current employees said the former chief executive, Emmett Carson, wanted to make the organization one of the largest sponsors of D.A.F.s in the country, and engaged in an arms race of sorts to woo big donors.In spite of his ouster, Mr. Carson appears to have succeeded in his goal. Thanks to big gifts from tech billionaires like Mr. Woodman and Mr. Zuckerberg \u2014 and the relatively new practice of accepting highly volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether \u2014 the Silicon Valley Community Foundation is now one of the largest such groups in the country, with more than $13 billion in assets.It wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Washington has tried to take action. The Pension Protection Act, passed in 2006, was the first law to specifically address D.A.F.s. It established some basic rules that barred self-dealing, but stopped short of more fundamental changes, such as mandated distribution requirements or less generous tax breaks.\u201cWe were basically trying to undo a giveaway by the government,\u201d said Mr. Zerbe, who worked on that bill while he was at the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cBut I\u2019m never convinced we can totally keep the weasels down the hole.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alphabet\u2019s Plans for a China Comeback Go Beyond Google Search", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut for Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet, the opportunities in the world\u2019s largest internet market may be too good to resist. And the full scope of the company\u2019s interest in China now appears to be broader than just internet search.Other recent steps that Google has taken in China include opening a research center and promoting its software tools to developers.In artificial intelligence and other areas in which Alphabet is seeking to advance the technological frontier, China today is more than just the planet\u2019s biggest audience of internet users. It is an ecosystem of sophisticated potential business partners, talent and tech-hungry customers from which tomorrow\u2019s innovations could emerge.Alphabet\u2019s investments in future technologies make it particularly important for the company to get a foot into China early. Driverless cars have prompted regulatory and political debate, which means starting sooner could help reduce Chinese authorities\u2019 concerns. More time in China for Waymo also means more experience on Chinese roads for its cars, and more data collected on the country\u2019s driving environment.\u201cI think they\u2019ve realized that developing in the United States won\u2019t produce a car that will work in China,\u201d said Gansha Wu, the chief executive and a co-founder of Uisee, an autonomous vehicle start-up in Beijing. \u201cThe road conditions are totally different.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said the company did not have a comment for this article.For Alphabet, any play at significant expansion in China would bring unique challenges.Its major moneymaking activities, such as search and video, run up against the Communist Party\u2019s controls on information in a way that online shopping, for instance, does not.Waymo\u2019s company registration in China still puts it a long way from having wheels on the road. Its Shanghai subsidiary has an initial capitalization of about $500,000. A visit on Friday to the address listed on its registration filing turned up only a cramped, unmarked office, empty but for some simple furniture.Even with more investment, Waymo\u2019s place in the Chinese market is hardly assured.Baidu, maker of the country\u2019s leading search engine, has made its autonomous-vehicle software platform available to dozens of local and foreign companies. SAIC Motor, China\u2019s largest carmaker, is working with the e-commerce titan Alibaba. BMW and Daimler have received permission in China to test their own self-driving vehicles.That might leave only China\u2019s newer, smaller automakers for Waymo should it someday seek a local partner for building intelligent cars, said Yale Zhang, managing director at Automotive Foresight, a consultancy in Shanghai.\u201cThat\u2019s their chance,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.A Waymo spokeswoman confirmed that the company had set up and staffed a legal entity in China, but declined to comment on further plans.If Google wanted to serve Chinese search users, it would face a formidable rival. For most Chinese, Baidu, which has a market capitalization of more than $70 billion, is about as synonymous with search as Google is for people elsewhere.Smaller Chinese search engines receive relatively little traffic on their own apps and websites, said Juan Lin, an analyst in Shanghai with the research firm 86Research. Many of their queries come to them from external sources, such as WeChat \u2014 a sign of how little influence they command among Chinese web users, and of how much dominance Baidu enjoys.There is another problem for Google.Another potential avenue to more sales for Google in China would be to win permission to operate Google Play, its store for apps and digital media. Hundreds of millions of smartphones in the country use Google\u2019s Android operating system, but people download apps from a variety of third-party sources.For that, Google would likely need local help to win Beijing\u2019s regulatory blessing. One potential ally is Tencent, the video game and social media behemoth. The two companies recently completed a deal to share patents. Tencent also offers cloud computing services. Google executives have said that they hope to make their cloud business a global operation, something that would be hard to achieve without being in China.Making friends could benefit Google in other ways. It could cut deals with software companies to have its search engine embedded in their mobile browsers, or team up with phone makers to have its apps preinstalled on their devices.In all of these areas, Google would need to overcome wariness among potential Chinese partners, said Ms. Lin of 86Research. Google left China in 2010 in a huff.\u201cWho would want to partner with a company that exited China because of its slogan of \u2018Don\u2019t be evil\u2019?\u201d she said.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attempted Hacking of Voter Database Was a False Alarm, Democratic Party Says", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe blunder was caused by a lack of communication between the national committee and one of its state branches, the officials said. The Michigan Democratic Party had hired hackers to simulate an attack known as phishing, but did not inform the national committee.The jolts of panic caused by what turned out to be an intraparty action underscored the fear of another major breach of the party\u2019s systems just weeks before the midterm elections, even as computer security has been made a priority and shored up since 2016. American intelligence officials have said there continue to be real threats from Russia to interfere in American elections.\u201cThere are constant attempts to hack the D.N.C. and our Democratic infrastructure, and while we are extremely relieved that this wasn\u2019t an attempted intrusion by a foreign adversary, this incident is further proof that we need to continue to be vigilant in light of potential attacks,\u201d Mr. Lord said in a statement.Brandon Dillon, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, called the situation a \u201cmisstep\u201d and said it was part of efforts to improve cybersecurity \u201cespecially as the Trump administration refuses to crack down on foreign interference in our elections.\u201d\u201cIn an abundance of caution, our digital partners ran tests that followed extensive training,\u201d he added.In 2016, Russian state-backed operatives penetrated the Democratic National Committee using a phishing campaign, in which hackers create website login pages that appear to be legitimate to trick unsuspecting users into giving up their user names and passwords. Hackers can then use the stolen credentials to log in to systems like email or voter registration databases.Now campaigns often test their employees with phishing simulations like the one conducted by the Michigan party, in which it had third parties set up a fake page that mimicked the party\u2019s login page for its voter-registration website.That page was detected late Monday by the cybersecurity firm Lookout, which informed the Democratic National Committee. The fake page appeared to be aimed at hacking the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Votebuilder database, which Mr. Lord has referred to as \u201cthe party\u2019s most sensitive information.\u201dThe database is a particular prize for hackers because it contains personal details on Democratic voters that could be used to unlock other information, including personal email accounts and computer files. Its successful penetration could have set off other hacking in a domino effect, cybersecurity experts said.\u201cPhishing attacks to get credentials or install malware are the ammunition that\u2019s currently being used to attack our election systems,\u201d said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, an election security expert and the chief technologist of the Center for Democracy and Technology.In an interview, Mr. Lord said that the fake page did not contain any educational features \u2014 leading the Democratic National Committee to believe it was an actual hacking attempt rather than a test.\u201cIt very closely mimicked the infrastructure you\u2019d see actual hackers using,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time that it was detected by outside parties, it did not exhibit any of the characteristics of a training system.\u201dThe committee\u2019s incident response plan requires it to notify law enforcement in the event of a hacking attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to make sure that when we believe that we are the victim of a criminal act, that we take appropriate action and involve law enforcement,\u201d Mr. Lord said.Mike Murray, the head of security intelligence at Lookout, said it was essential that the activity was caught, even if it was benign.\u201cYou don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a false alarm until you show up with the ladders and the fire trucks and the hoses,\u201d he said. \u201cOur goal is to detect bad people doing bad things, regardless of whether that\u2019s crime or espionage or some kid messing around. We don\u2019t want anybody to be attacked.\u201dWith the midterms just over 70 days from now, political groups and systems administrators have been on high alert about hacks and foreign meddling.Eileen Sullivan and Noah Weiland reported from Washington, and Kate Conger from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the U.S. Is Fighting Russian Election Interference", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senior Trump administration officials warned on Thursday that Russia is trying to interfere in November\u2019s midterm elections and the 2020 presidential election and vowed to combat Moscow\u2019s aggression.\u201cThis is a threat we need to take extremely seriously and to tackle and respond to with fierce determination and focus,\u201d said the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray.Here is what you need to know about Russia\u2019s interference and American efforts to fight it.Russia is trying to spread propaganda on hot-button issues using social media, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, has said, highlighting what he called persistent and pervasive efforts. Moscow\u2019s strategy, he said, is to exacerbate sociopolitical divisions.Mr. Coats again singled out Russia on Thursday, saying its disinformation campaign is ongoing. \u201cWe continue to see a pervasive messaging campaign by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States,\u201d Mr. Coats said at the White House. Mr. Wray also cited attempts to manipulate news stories, spread disinformation and escalate divisive issues.Intelligence and law enforcement officials are also looking out for voter suppression efforts, illegal campaign financing, hacks targeting elected officials and voting infrastructure, he said.As for computer security, experts see political campaigns as vulnerable, particularly in state and local elections, where campaigns frequently lack the money and expertise to forestall attacks. Microsoft detected spear-phishing attacks, apparently by Russian intelligence, targeting computers of two 2018 election candidates, a senior company official said last month; Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat seeking re-election, said last week that her Senate office computer network was one of them.\u201cI hope I\u2019m wrong. But I think we\u2019ll see attacks on campaigns in which the Russians in particular have already stolen information,\u201d said Eric Rosenbach, an intelligence veteran and cybersecurity expert at Harvard University\u2019s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.Nationally, the two major political parties stepped up security after the 2016 breach of computers at the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.Voting machines, often described as old, insecure and lacking a paper trail, are more secure than widely understood. Four in five Americans vote on machines that incorporate paper ballots or backups. Many state voter-registration databases also have been hardened against outside attack since 2016. While it is possible to hack voting devices to rig an election, experts say, intruding into enough of them to change the outcome would be extremely difficult.Election officials and the Department of Homeland Security set up a council to coordinate the response to threats, and the department offers security scans, equipment and other services to election officials nationwide. Top state election officials are gaining security clearances to see and assess threats, and in February, all 50 states and more than 1,000 localities opened a center to exchange data. Virtually every state has taken steps to lock down its election processes.A public-private committee has also approved a new standard for voting equipment that will significantly improve security. More voting machines than ever have verifiable paper backups, and nearly all should have them by 2020, said David J. Becker, the director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research. States also are adopting more advanced auditing techniques for vote counts.The most important work the intelligence community has done, according to current and former officials, is to penetrate foreign networks and spy on Russian groups conducting the attacks. The agencies have also monitored networks in the United States to try to detect information campaigns as they begin.\u201cThey are gathering intelligence,\u201d said Michael Sussmann, a former Justice Department official who is now a partner at Perkins Coie. \u201cThey are trying to figure out what our adversaries are planning and what is being done. That includes penetrating foreign networks and other kinds of spying they do. And they are doing surveillance on U.S. networks to detect influence of all kinds.\u201dIntelligence agencies are working more closely with technology companies, though some firms have said too little intelligence has been shared, hampering Silicon Valley\u2019s efforts to detect threats and warn Americans.Mr. Coats has said the intelligence agencies and White House consider threats to the electoral system a top priority. Mr. Coats has called not just on technology companies to boost protections but also to make sure Americans take steps to verify the information they consume. \u201cIt is essential that we all apply critical thinking to all sorts of information,\u201d he said.Mr. Coats\u2019s appearance at the White House was important for informing the public, said Laura Rosenberger, a former Obama administration official and the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. \u201cBuilding resiliency in the population is really important to inoculate against the effect of some of this,\u201d she said.Cybersecurity experts praised Thursday\u2019s briefing as an important step to bringing high-level focus to the fight against interference. But they said that to deter Russia, Moscow needs to believe that the United States will impose costs beyond the sanctions and other punishments it has doled out, and that requires Mr. Trump to make clear he will act against interference.\u201cIf you are going to stop what is going on, that could require a presidential-level decision,\u201d Mr. Sussmann said.An earlier version of this article misspelled on a second reference the last name of a former Justice Department official.

And in some cases, public records show, small suppliers over the past several months have claimed they failed to get paid for services supplied to Tesla.No one spoke of wanting to cut ties to Tesla. Elon Musk responded that when his company hadn\u2019t paid promptly, it was sometimes because the suppliers had sent the wrong parts.

{"Headline": "Facebook Identifies New Influence Operations Spanning Globe", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe activity originated in Iran and Russia, Facebook said. Unlike past influence operations on the social network, which largely targeted Americans, the fake accounts, pages and groups were this time also aimed at people in Latin America, Britain and the Middle East, the company said.Some of the activity was still focused on Americans, but the campaigns were not specifically intended to disrupt the midterm elections in the United States, said FireEye, a cybersecurity firm that worked with Facebook on investigating the fake pages and accounts. The operations \u201cextend well beyond U.S. audiences and U.S. politics,\u201d FireEye said in a preliminary report.But the aims of the latest campaigns appeared to be similar to those of past operations on the social network: to distribute false news that might cause confusion among people, and to alter people\u2019s thinking to become more partisan or pro-government on various issues.\u201cWe believe these pages, groups and accounts were part of two sets of campaigns,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said in a conference call late Tuesday about the activities. \u201cOne from Iran, with ties to state-owned media. The other came from a set of people the U.S. government and others have linked to Russia.\u201dNow, those same social media influence tactics that were used in 2016 and last month appear to have been adopted by operatives in other countries as well.Renee DiResta, director of research at New Knowledge, an organization that studies disinformation campaigns, said Iran\u2019s involvement \u201creinforces that this is an ongoing information war, that our social ecosystem is vulnerable to manipulation by a variety of adversaries.\u201dIn a statement, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt.\u201d He added, \u201cIranians are now following the Kremlin\u2019s playbook from 2016.\u201dSenator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he planned to ask technology company executives more about the matter on Sept. 5 at a hearing in Washington to discuss social media and disinformation. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, as well as others, are expected to appear at the hearing.\u201cAddressing this threat requires technology companies, law enforcement, Congress, and the intelligence community working together,\u201d Mr. Burr said.Facebook\u2019s announcement on Tuesday was followed by one by Twitter, which said that it had also removed accounts from its social media service that had ties to Iran.YouTube said it deleted one channel \u2014 Liberty Front Press, a website linked to some of the fake Iranian accounts on Facebook \u2014 for violating its community guidelines, but did not offer more detail.Facebook said on Tuesday that it had identified some of the new influence operations last month after a tip from FireEye about a network of Facebook pages called \u201cLiberty Front Press.\u201dAfter Facebook investigated those pages, it said it linked them back to Iranian state media using their website registration information and internet protocol addresses. Some of the pages were created in 2013, the company said, and they posted political content focused on the Middle East, Latin America, Britain and the United States.Other fake pages also had a far more international bent than the earlier batches uncovered by the social media company. The pages believed to have originated in Iran were written in several languages, including English, Arabic and Farsi. They carried a number of pro-Iranian themes, as well as language attacking Israel and promoting Palestinians. Some included anti-Trump language and were tied to relations between the United States and Iran, including references to the Iranian nuclear weapons deal.Newer accounts, created in 2016 and later, had additional goals, including spreading malware and stealing passwords, Facebook said. The accounts that originated in Russia focused on activity in Ukraine and Syria. They did not appear to target the United States. In Syria, the accounts promoted a pro-Russian agenda and that of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad.The company added that accounts linked to Iran had spent more than $12,000 for ads on Facebook and its photo-sharing site Instagram, using United States and Australian currency. The earliest ad ran in July 2012, while the most recent one ran this month. Facebook said at least some of those ads had been caught because of its new rules requiring that political ads be labeled as such. Facebook did not comment on the content of the ads, or say who they were targeting.In the conference call, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook was working with government agencies and private companies to proactively find malicious actors using the platform. He said the company had several investigations underway by a team dedicated to finding influence operations. He did not reveal the number or scope of the investigations, but said that given the amount of important elections happening worldwide, Facebook was looking at disinformation as a global problem.\u201cAuthenticity matters and people need to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Nicholas Fandos from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "S.&P. Closes at a Record, as Profits Defy Turmoil", "Date": "2018-08-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor much of the year, the stock market has been on the ropes. Trade wars have erupted, the Federal Reserve raised rates, emerging market currencies collapsed, and major technology firms faced regulatory scrutiny \u2014 and, in the case of Amazon, presidential broadsides via messages on Twitter. Investors quailed at times, sending stocks down by as much as 10 percent.But the nine-year-old bull market never completely crumbled. By April, stocks had started a fresh climb. And after a 0.6 percent rise on Friday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index closed at a record high of 2,874.69 points, reflecting investor faith in a single fundamental fact: Big American companies are making lots of money.\u201cWe\u2019ve had record earnings growth, we\u2019ve had record numbers of earnings and sales beats,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, chief United States equity strategist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBasically the fundamentals couldn\u2019t look better.\u201dBecause owners of stock are entitled to a share of the money a company makes, corporate profits are a key ingredient of stock market rallies. And profits for companies in the S. &P. 500 were up roughly 25 percent in the second quarter, after a surge of 27 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.About 80 percent of companies reported results that were better than Wall Street analysts expected. (In a typical quarter, some 64 percent of companies outperform the analysts\u2019 predictions.) This year\u2019s crop of quarterly earnings has been the best since 2010, when the American economy was just emerging from the recession that ended the previous year, making big leaps in annual profit growth much easier.The current rosy profit picture shouldn\u2019t be surprising. The Trump administration\u2019s deep tax cuts that went into effect in January reduced corporate tax expenses sharply and raised profitability almost automatically. But other metrics \u2014 such as sales growing at an annual rate of more than 9 percent in the second quarter \u2014 suggest that corporate America is riding a robust American economy. The unemployment rate is near 18-year lows. Gross domestic product expanded by 4.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace since 2014.\u201cIt\u2019s a 3-percent-plus growth world, and that\u2019s because the fundamentals underlying consumer spending, underlying business spending, underlying our manufacturing sector are in superb shape,\u201d said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics, a consulting firm.Since the bulk of companies began reporting their quarterly results in July, that upward economic pressure has erupted in gushers of profits, especially at some of the giant technology-centered firms that have been hugely influential in determining how the stock markets move.Amazon reported a $2.53 billion quarterly profit, its largest ever. Microsoft notched $8.87 billion in earnings, beating estimates. Apple\u2019s quarterly profit jumped 32 percent to $11.52 billion, beating Wall Street expectations and pushing the company\u2019s market value above $1 trillion, a milestone that no American company had ever reached before.The earnings boom has also reached far beyond tech. Earnings at financial firms jumped more than 27 percent. Quarterly profits at industrial companies rose 20 percent.Even the retail sector, which has been squeezed by online competition and soft prices in recent years, is enjoying a respite. Home Depot raised earnings and sales targets for the year. Walmart reported better-than-expected earnings, including a 40 percent rise in online sales in the United States. And Target said quarterly sales at stores it had previously opened rose at the fastest pace in 13 years, sending its stock to a record high.There could be more market gains to come. From the bargain hunter\u2019s perspective, the combination of blockbuster profits and a prolonged stock market soft patch for much of the year, means that stocks \u2014 compared to their earnings \u2014 are significantly cheaper than they were earlier this year.A key valuation measure, the price of the S. & P. 500 index compared with analyst estimates for corporate earnings over the next 12 months, has fallen this year. Some observers see that as a positive sign, indicating that the rising market over the last few months has been fueled by solid earnings growth, rather than wild optimism by stock market investors.On the other hand, the stock market is by no means dirt cheap, as it was in the aftermath of the financial crisis. And there are plenty of risks that could still derail the recent rally, from disorderly decline of some emerging markets, such as Turkey, to the continuing fallout from trade tensions between the United States and other large economies.\u201cThe big talk on the street is obviously trade and China,\u201d said Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, head of United States equity strategy at J. P. Morgan Securities.On the other hand, Mr. Lakos-Bujas thinks that a resolution of the trade fight between the world\u2019s two largest economies, could generate a pop in the stock market, by removing a risky overhang clouding an otherwise bright picture. The American economy, he says, is in something of a sweet spot, with strong growth, low unemployment, low inflation and high corporate profits.\u201cIn this kind of environment, generally, risk assets such as equities, they tend to do well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Attempting the Impossible: A Thoughtful Meditation on Technology", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.What began as a vague apprehension \u2014 unease over the amount of time we spend on our devices, a sense that our children are growing up distracted \u2014 has, since the presidential election of 2016, transformed into something like outright panic. Pundits and politicians debate the perils of social media; technology is vilified as an instigator of our social ills, rather than a symptom. Something about our digital life seems to inspire extremes: all that early enthusiasm, the utopian fervor over the internet, now collapsed into fear and recriminations.\u201cBitwise: A Life in Code,\u201d David Auerbach\u2019s thoughtful meditation on technology and its place in society, is a welcome effort to reclaim the middle ground. Auerbach, a former professional programmer, now a journalist and writer, is \u201ccautiously positive toward technology.\u201d He recognizes the very real damage it is causing to our political, cultural and emotional lives. But he also loves computers and data, and is adept at conveying the awe that technology can summon, the bracing sense of discovery that Arthur C. Clarke memorably compared to touching magic. \u201cMuch joy and satisfaction can be found in chasing after the secrets and puzzles of the world,\u201d Auerbach writes. \u201cI felt that joy first with computers.\u201dThe book is a hybrid of memoir, technical primer and social history. It is perhaps best characterized as a survey not just of technology, but of our recent relationship to technology. Auerbach is in a good position to conduct this survey. He has spent much of his life on the front lines, playing around as a kid with Turtle graphics, working on Microsoft\u2019s Messenger Service after college, and then reveling in Google\u2019s oceans of data. (Among his lasting contributions, for which he does not express adequate contrition, is being the first, while at Microsoft, to introduce smiley face emoticons to America.) He writes well about databases and servers, but what\u2019s really distinctive about this book is his ability to dissect Joyce and Wittgenstein as easily as C++ code. One of Auerbach\u2019s stated goals is to break down barriers, or at least initiate a conversation, between technology and the humanities, two often irreconcilable domains. He suggests that we need to be bitwise (i.e., understand the world through the lens of computers) as well as worldwise. We must \u201cbe able to translate our ideas between the two realms.\u201dAuerbach\u2019s polymathishness is impressive; it can also be overwhelming. This is not a book that wears its knowledge lightly, and the trail is sometimes meandering, littered with digressive pathways and citations. It\u2019s hard to pin down a clear line of argument. Still, this doesn\u2019t really detract from the overall pleasure of reading. \u201cBitwise\u201d is best approached as a series of essays and snippets. This is one of those books you dip in and out of, surrendering to what the American travel writer Gretel Ehrlich \u2014 in a very different context \u2014 has called \u201cambulation of the mind.\u201dIt\u2019s sometimes hard to remember this, but the internet is young \u2014 a mere three decades or so have passed since its mass adoption. Our relationship to technology is still evolving, characterized by inevitable spats and rapprochements. Yet throughout these cycles, we are increasingly intimate, ever more intertwined and interdependent. The danger is that this relationship will, like so much else in our public lives, be captured by extremism: that we will be forced to choose camps, that we will divide ourselves into mutually antagonistic factions of technology lovers and technology haters. We need guides on this journey \u2014 judicious, balanced and knowledgeable commentators, like Auerbach.Akash Kapur is the author of \u201cIndia Becoming: A Portrait of Life in Modern India.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos, Style Icon", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Amazon chief executive has quietly been grooming a new image to go with his new status as rocket scientist, richest man in the world and potential Washington big shot.It has happened as steadily, and stealthily, as Amazon\u2019s relentless march to vie with Apple for the title of world\u2019s most valuable company. According to Joseph Rosenfeld, a personal style adviser who specializes in the tech world in Silicon Valley and New York, and whose clients work at companies like Apple, Intuit and Google, \u201che is doing something with style that differentiates him from any one else in tech. We have seen him sharpen up, with a wardrobe rooted in tradition but also very modernist and minimal. It creates a focus on him, and has evolved in accordance with his business.\u201dIt\u2019s a transformation that in many ways is as unexpected as Amazon\u2019s swerves into original moviemaking and web services. Snaps! What was he thinking? He was apparently already focused on saving time, even in those early years.There he is, for example, arm veins a-popping, next to a poster of the even balder and more built Dwayne Johnson in \u201cRampage,\u201d with the caption: \u201cStill working on my smolder.\u201d There he is with Patrick Stewart in matching tuxedos at the Vanity Fair Oscars party earlier this year (Bezos is a famous Trekkie), a photo that provoked many commentators to remark on their similarity.There he is in the desert in faded denim, a cowboy hat, those \u201clucky\u201d cowboy boots (apparently a gift from a friend) and shades leaning against his space capsule and striking a \u201cRight Stuff\u201d pose.And there he is with robot dogs and spaceships, and atop a giant windmill in Amazon\u2019s new wind farm, modeling a hard hat and shades and smashing a Champagne bottle.Which leads inevitably to thoughts of Tony Stark. Indeed, in November 2017 Mr. Bezos wore a jeans-black-polo-leather-jacket combination to Summit LA17 that echoed, almost exactly, the jeans-black-T-shirt-leather-jacket look Robert Downey Jr. modeled in \u201cIron Man 2.\u201dPointedly, and unlike his fellow tech entrepreneurs who have enshrined the dress-down uniform in the mythology of their sector and equated it with a life of the mind, Mr. Bezos has a facility for dressing up. He has also shown a willingness to sample outfits, much as he samples industries, the better to make them his own. It\u2019s an expression of an omnivorous, rather than laserlike, focus.The result is a new model for a major tech entrepreneur. If Amazon does win the race to the trillion-dollar mark, look for it coming soon to a Silicon Alley near you.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Strong Women on the March at Seattle Art Fair", "Date": "2018-08-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe prominent placement was no coincidence.\u201cImages of strong females sell easily,\u201d said William Rau, the president of M.S. Rau Antiques, a New Orleans-based gallery that had staked out a position by the door and positioned the $198,500 piece front and center. He said that more female art buyers are out buying, and they are responding, as are men, he added, to art showing women in charge. \u201cWhether that\u2019s a \u2018me too\u2019 connection or just female equality, I can\u2019t answer,\u201d he added.But diversity is a complicated subject in a city where the white male still dominates, especially in the computer-science and engineering world that is Seattle\u2019s economic driver.And as questions of power relationships and abuse have percolated through Hollywood, politics and business, encouraging artists to make statements of race or gender runs the risk, fair organizers said, of looking cynical or crass, as if you\u2019ve thrown some diversity into the mix after meeting with your consultants, or simply awkward, because there might be no right way to do it.\u201cIf you\u2019re a man telling a woman\u2019s story, you\u2019re open for investigation,\u201d Mr. White said. \u201cBut I love strong women characters in literature and art and this has inspired me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not unaware that we live in a very crazy political period, but I think it\u2019s also important not to get caught up in the \u2018nowness,\u2019\u201d he said. Indigenous people, for example, he said, have faced existential issues for generations. \u201cYou say, \u2018this is a tough political time\u2019 to an indigenous person, and they would be like, \u2018huh?\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cIn tech, it gets simplified into numbers \u2014 how many women and minorities do we have in the company,\u201d said Professor Katyal, who is also a co-director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. Art can look deeper, she said, at both itself and the broader world. \u201cThe task of art is for us to say, \u2018are these numbers enough,\u2019\u2019\u2019 she said.Ms. Hupfield said that for her, performance art was also an assertion of authority. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who set the terms for the audience,\u201d she said.But where lines of power, gender and tech converge, things can also be pretty messy.Mr. White\u2019s puppet installation, for example, featured a rope system that visitors were encouraged to yank on to make the hand-holding Boren sisters dance. It was also in its way a tech statement, as in low-tech. \u201cI love the fact that he made it entirely out of cardboard,\u201d said Greg Canote, 67, a fair visitor who said the Boren sisters had stolen his heart.The dancing pioneers also provided a stark contrast with a robotic project out in the parking lot by the artist Mark Pauline, whose clanking metal behemoths, looking like something from the dystopian future of the Mad Max movies, prowled their display space treating art as prey. In one performance, the robots, directed by a member of the team, methodically shredded a copy of an Andy Warhol painting.And the Rau Gallery took \u201cDevant la Mer\u201d home without selling it. One elegantly dressed woman stopped by on the fair\u2019s opening morning, assessed the Cassigneul for a long time, then asked Mr. Rau what his best price offer would be. He scribbled some numbers. She assessed again for a while and kept shopping.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Google Tried to Change China. China May End Up Changing Google.", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtEver since its founding 20 years ago in a Silicon Valley garage, Google has proudly and often ostentatiously held itself up as the architect of a new model for corporate virtue.Still, if you work at Google or have bought into its missionary brand, you can point to moments when its ethos did rise to something more than marketing puffery. The most obvious example: In 2010, after four years of attempting to operate a censored search engine in China under a regime there that was becoming increasingly hostile to online freedoms, Google did something that a more conventional company would not have done. It said that it had had enough, and pulled its search engine out of the massive market.The defenses are not unsound. Under any rational business sense, it would be insane to expect one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies to stay out of the world\u2019s largest internet market, especially when many of Google\u2019s American rivals happily operate under that government\u2019s intrusive rules. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, and Microsoft and Amazon both offer a host of services there.But wasn\u2019t standing apart supposed to be the hallmark of Google\u2019s Googliness? Leaving China was the kind of unorthodox decision the search company once reveled in \u2014 a move that sacrificed financial prosperity for the moral high ground, that showed employees and customers that Google, with its planet-swallowing mission to organize all of life\u2019s information, was motivated by something deeper than financial ambition.Activists for online freedoms worry that Google\u2019s return would have dangerous real-world consequences, perhaps accelerating a great new wave of online restrictions in China and elsewhere. But the most lasting impact might be in how we would have to reimagine what kind of company Google was and what it stood for.It is hard to see how going back to China would be anything other than a terrific comedown \u2014 the most telling act of a company that, day by day, has come to resemble the utterly conventional corporation it once vowed never to become.\u201cIf Google wants to be judged like any other global company, that\u2019s fine,\u201d said Ben Wizner, director of the Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cThey should just say so \u2014 that their principal obligation is to their shareholders and their bottom line. But that has not been the rhetoric coming out of Google, and I think it\u2019s fair to judge them by the standards they have set for themselves.\u201dIn a statement, a Google spokesman said that \u201cwe don\u2019t comment on speculation about future plans.\u201d But the company\u2019s leaders have disputed the idea that returning to China would be a moral reversal. At last week\u2019s staff meeting, Mr. Pichai suggested that returning to China would be in accord with the vision the company had in 2006, when it first agreed to censor results to accommodate Beijing.Mr. Pichai underlined this argument \u2014 that providing some access to the outside world is better than none \u2014 by citing his experience growing up in India.\u201cMy dad worked for a U.K. company, and they went through whether they should be in India or should they pull out,\u201d he told Google\u2019s staff, according to a transcript obtained by The New York Times. \u201cAnd they stayed, and that made a difference for my dad. And in all likelihood, I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it weren\u2019t for that.\u201dThere are other factors behind Google\u2019s potential reversal. The internet has changed a great deal since 2010, and the company\u2019s executives have increasingly come to see their decision to leave China as rash, na\u00efve and ultimately counterproductive.\u201cThis argument makes me very sad: The world is becoming more like China, so therefore we might as well be in China,\u201d said Rebecca MacKinnon, an internet freedom advocate at New America, a think tank.She said that advocates of free speech and human rights had long found Google to be an ally in their efforts, and that a reversal in China would be regarded as a major defeat.\u201cI wrote a book where I warned that China is Exhibit A for how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and then begin to change the internet,\u201d Ms. MacKinnon said. \u201cAnd if companies like Google are now throwing in the towel and saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s where the internet is going\u2019 and \u2018If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u2019 \u2014 well, that\u2019s deeply troubling.\u201dIf Google does go back to China, it will very likely have to agree to an even more restrictive censorship regime than what it tolerated previously. Mr. Pichai has vowed to be transparent about how such a plan might roll out. But advocates said transparency alone would not mitigate their worries about Google\u2019s shift.\u201cIf Google is trying to promote openness and free societies, then transparency is going to be an insufficient way to make this better,\u201d said Mr. Wizner of the A.C.L.U. \u201cThe transparency would be aimed at the rest of the world. Google wouldn\u2019t be telling Chinese people, \u2018Here\u2019s what you can\u2019t see.\u2019\u201dSure, it\u2019s early, and Google\u2019s plans are not clear. There remains the possibility that Google will think of some completely nontraditional way to satisfy China\u2019s censors without losing its soul.But that seems unlikely. The more plausible conclusion is the more obvious one: Google took on China, and Google lost.\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d said Michael Posner, a professor of ethics and finance at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business, \u201cthis will be a huge victory for the Chinese government and anyone else who wants to severely restrict the internet.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unlikely Activists Who Took On Silicon Valley \u2014 and Won", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "FeatureMining personal data has become a trillion-dollar business \u2014 which is why activists are pushing laws to curb the practice, and why Facebook and other companies are desperate to stop them.Supported byThe way Alastair Mactaggart usually tells the story of his awakening \u2014 the way he told it even before he became the most improbable, and perhaps the most important, privacy activist in America \u2014 begins with wine and pizza in the hills above Oakland, Calif. It was a few years ago, on a night Mactaggart and his wife had invited some friends over for dinner. One was a software engineer at Google, whose search and video sites are visited by over a billion people a month. As evening settled in, Mactaggart asked his friend, half-seriously, if he should be worried about everything Google knew about him. \u201cI expected one of those answers you get from airline pilots about plane crashes,\u201d Mactaggart recalled recently. \u201cYou know \u2014 \u2018Oh, there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u2019\u2009\u201d Instead, his friend told him there was plenty to worry about. If people really knew what we had on them, the Google engineer said, they would flip out.Mactaggart had spent most of his adult life in the Bay Area, running a family real estate business with his uncle. The rise of the tech industry had filled his condo developments with ambitious engineers and entrepreneurs, making Mactaggart a wealthy man. But he never really thought about how companies like Google or Facebook got so big so fast. The vast pools of data they collected and monetized were abstractions, something he knew existed but, as with plane crashes, rarely dwelt on.And no one knew more about what people did or were going to do than Facebook and Google, whose free social and search products provided each company with enormous repositories of intimate personal data. They knew what you \u201cliked\u201d and who your friends were. They knew not just what you typed into the search bar late on a Friday night but also what you started to type and then thought better of. Facebook and Google were following people around the rest of the internet too, using an elaborate and invisible network of browsing bugs \u2014 they had, within little more than a decade, created a private surveillance apparatus of extraordinary reach and sophistication. Mactaggart thought that something ought to be done. He began to wonder whether he should be the one to do it.Mactaggart, who is 52 but boyish, did not think of himself as a radical. He often describes himself as a capitalist. He is the kind of man who wears chinos with a braided belt; it is easy to picture him on a sailboat. But his research on privacy had stirred something in him. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Buddhist thing, where you walk past a mess and a mop and say, \u2018Someone ought to clean up that mess,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cAnd eventually you realize you have to pick up the mop.\u201dOver evening walks around his neighborhood, Mactaggart batted around ideas for a new state law with his friend Rick Arney, a finance executive. But Arney, who worked in the California Legislature after business school, suggested a different approach. Instead of going through Sacramento, Arney suggested, they could put the question directly to the people of California, gathering signatures for a statewide ballot initiative. Mactaggart liked the idea. He also had the money to do something with it. Early last year, he hired a small staff, set them up in a two-room office in Oakland and began cold-calling privacy experts to figure out just what his initiative should say.\u201cI thought it was a joke at first, to be contacted by someone named \u2018Alastair Mactaggart,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Chris Jay Hoofnagle, who teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mactaggart was wary of proposing a sweeping law like the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., fearing that Californians would find it mystifying and reject it. He wanted a solution that consumers would embrace and Silicon Valley could live with. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill businesses \u2014 I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Hoofnagle recalls Mactaggart\u2019s telling him. \u201cI just think the data use by these companies is out of control.\u201dAlmost by accident, though, Mactaggart had thrust himself into the greatest resource grab of the 21st century. To Silicon Valley, personal information had become a kind of limitless natural deposit, formed in the digital ether by ordinary people as they browsed, used apps and messaged their friends. Like the oil barons before them, they had collected and refined that resource to build some of the most valuable companies in the world, including Facebook and Google, an emerging duopoly that today controls more than half of the worldwide market in online advertising. But the entire business model \u2014 what the philosopher and business theorist Shoshana Zuboff calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d \u2014 rests on untrammeled access to your personal data. The tech industry didn\u2019t want to give up its powers of surveillance. It wanted to entrench them. And as Mactaggart would soon learn, Silicon Valley almost always got what it wanted.And increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn\u2019t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.In Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook\u2019s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups \u2014 including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley\u2019s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.Soltani knew exactly how hard Facebook and Google would fight to protect their business model, because he had watched them do it before. In February 2012, senior officials from the Obama administration unveiled what some of them hoped would become a signature initiative of President Obama\u2019s second term: a \u201cconsumer-privacy bill of rights.\u201d The proposal called for limits on the data that companies were collecting and more control for consumers over how it was used, and the tech industry had at least some incentive to consider it: The previous year, Facebook and Google each entered into consent decrees with the Federal Trade Commission after regulators found that the companies had deceived users about their privacy policies. Soltani, then serving as an F.T.C. technologist, worked on both investigations, and his efforts helped highlight a more pervasive problem: Most consumers simply didn\u2019t have the time or experience to navigate the personal-data economy on their own. \u201cSilicon Valley\u2019s model puts the onus on the user to decide if the bargain is fair,\u201d Soltani told me recently. \u201cIt\u2019s like selling you coffee and making it your job to decide if the coffee has lead in it.\u201d When it comes to privacy, he said, \u201cwe have no baseline law that says you can\u2019t put lead in coffee.\u201dWhite House officials believed at first that many tech companies were open to the administration\u2019s ideas. But the following year, as a team of experts at Obama\u2019s Commerce Department worked on drafting a detailed privacy bill, The Guardian and The Washington Post began publishing an explosive series of articles about United States government surveillance programs. Relying on thousands of documents provided by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, the articles revealed how the N.S.A. was collecting rivers of personal data \u2014 emails, photos, instant-message conversations \u2014 from nine leading internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft. Soltani by then had left the F.T.C. and joined The Post as a consultant on the series, working on articles that showed how the N.S.A. had collected hundreds of thousands of user address books from email providers and even hacked into the private networks that companies like Google and Yahoo use to transport their data.The Snowden scandal robbed Obama\u2019s consumer proposal of both momentum and moral authority. Stung by the perception that it had colluded with United States spy agencies, Silicon Valley demanded that the government regulate itself instead, allying with civil liberties groups to push for legislation reining in the N.S.A. Over the next several months, scores of tech executives flew to Washington for high-level meetings with Obama, including Sandberg, who also sat with Obama\u2019s new commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, the Chicago billionaire who was the co-chairwoman of his re-election campaign.In early 2014, Pritzker traveled to Silicon Valley for a highly publicized listening tour. She hailed the tech industry as a model for government \u2014 a partner, not an antagonist. Data, she proclaimed, was \u201cthe fuel of the 21st century.\u201d Pritzker\u2019s tour included visits to eBay, Google and the Menlo Park campus of Facebook, where she met again with Sandberg. The women discussed an array of issues, including consumer privacy and how to ensure that American tech businesses remained competitive around the world. Two former Obama administration officials told me that those conversations appeared to have shaped Pritzker\u2019s early views on privacy. \u201cOur goal at the Department of Commerce as a service organization is to support you, whether you are a researcher, inventor, entrepreneur, mentor or investor,\u201d Pritzker told her audience at a start-up accelerator in Sunnyvale.When the Obama administration finally returned to its consumer-privacy bill the following fall, Pritzker and her team voiced concerns about its sweep and scope, according to former Obama officials I spoke with. Pritzker wanted to make sure the bill could win industry support, and with it, Republican support. In January 2015, her office persuaded the White House to delay public release of the draft, which had been planned to coincide with an Obama speech at the F.T.C. Instead, her aides began previewing the bill in dozens of meetings with different business executives and lobbyists. According to the former Obama officials, the industry raised a host of objections. Facebook and Google, in particular, objected to how many kinds of data the rules covered, which included not only conventional personal information like Social Security numbers but also data linked to particular devices, which was critical to compiling the digital dossiers relied on by the advertising industry. (Facebook disputed that account.) Jim Hock, Pritzker\u2019s chief of staff at Commerce and now a spokesman for her private investment firm, PSP Partners, says Pritzker weighed all points of view. \u201cNo one meeting was more important than another,\u201d he says.But when consumer advocates were finally shown the new draft, they were furious. The bill now had a welter of exceptions and carve-outs. It drastically scaled back financial penalties and did not specifically protect location data. More broadly, it seemed to retreat from the idea of consumer privacy as an inherent right. Most of the bill\u2019s protections applied only if collecting or using a given piece of information posed a serious risk of economic or emotional harm. That March, Washington\u2019s leading consumer-privacy groups signed an open letter criticizing the Obama proposal, arguing that it did not do nearly enough. The Internet Association, a trade group representing Google, Facebook, Amazon and other companies, also weighed in, attacking the bill as overbroad and burdensome. \u201cThe feeling was that it didn\u2019t do much, and no one really liked it,\u201d Soltani told me.The language of the resulting ballot initiative, which Mactaggart finalized last November, reflected lessons from the painful failure of Obama privacy\u2019s initiative. It wasn\u2019t called a \u201cbill of rights.\u201d And on its face, it was not a frontal attack on the giants of Silicon Valley. Mactaggart\u2019s proposal instead took aim at the so-called third-party market for personal data, in which companies trade and sell your information to one another, mostly without your knowing about it.Under the proposed law, every California consumer could demand, from most large businesses, an outline of his or her digital dossier, showing what categories of personal information the company had collected. Mactaggart and Soltani included nearly every category of personal information that they could think of: not only whether the companies had collected your name and address but also if they had collected your browsing history, your fingerprints, your face scans or your location data. They would also be required to inform consumers if they were drawing \u201cinferences,\u201d the sophisticated guesses companies make about, say, your dating habits or your taste in convertibles. And if consumers didn\u2019t like the deal, they could \u201copt out,\u201d demanding that companies no longer sell or share any data in a given category.The ballot initiative had significant implications for the Silicon Valley giants, however. If adopted, Mactaggart and Arney hoped, it would cripple the tech industry\u2019s \u201cnotice and choice\u201d consent model, where companies dictated all the terms of service up front, forcing consumers to either agree or find a different app. As more people opted out of data sharing, they believed, the rules would slowly dry up the supply of personal information that companies could buy or trade on the open market. \u201cThird-party tracking would essentially end,\u201d Mactaggart says. \u201cSo when you log in to Spotify, you wouldn\u2019t be logging into, like, 100 partners. You wouldn\u2019t have 75 percent of the websites in the world looking over your shoulder.\u201dStill, Mactaggart and Soltani imagined their rules to be comparatively light-touch, a way to inhibit only the most invasive and creepy kinds of commercial surveillance while leaving Silicon Valley to thrive. Imposing them in California, the beating heart of the tech industry, offered another advantage. Through California\u2019s referendum process, they could end-run the entire tangle of interests that had stymied the Obama bill in Washington. And if they succeeded, the effect would ripple far beyond the state\u2019s borders: Any company in the world that wanted to do business with California\u2019s 40 million residents would need to follow California\u2019s rules. Mactaggart liked to compare it to California\u2019s strict auto-emissions standards, which forced the world\u2019s automakers to develop cars that guzzle less fossil fuel.But Soltani also knew how aggressively the tech companies used their connections in state capitals. In 2015, a Facebook user named Carlo Licata filed suit in Illinois, arguing that the company\u2019s photo \u201ctagging\u201d feature, which automatically identified Facebook users in photos uploaded to the site, violated his privacy rights. Illinois is among the few states in the country with a strict law governing biometric data, the 2008 Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting fingerprints, voiceprints or a \u201cscan of hand or face geometry.\u201d (\u201cIllinois only has this law because it recognized the need to protect biometrics before Silicon Valley began trying to control state legislation,\u201d says Jay Edelson, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer in Chicago who represents Licata.) Other Facebook users in Illinois filed similar suits, which were consolidated and transferred to a federal court in California. Facebook argued that the Illinois law did not specifically apply to its methods for identifying people in photographs. The judge disagreed, ruling in May 2016 that the lawsuit could proceed.Just weeks later, the original sponsor of the Illinois privacy act, a genial Chicago-area lawmaker named Terry Link, abruptly proposed an amendment to his own law. The amendment clarified that digital photographs did not count as a source of biometric information and that the law only protected facial scans conducted \u201cin person.\u201d A Facebook official told me that the company had provided Link with suggestions for clarifying the law, not the language itself. But in a recent interview, Link recalled that the amendment language was given to him directly by a lawyer for Facebook. (Link did not specify who, and would not comment on why he had pursued the amendment in the first place.) Indeed, the amendment, introduced with only a few days left in the year\u2019s legislative session, seemed tailored to buttress Facebook\u2019s arguments in the California lawsuit, leaving Facebook and other companies free to create face scans from digital pictures without consent.Link had attached his amendment to a bill that was already sailing through the Legislature, an otherwise bland measure dealing with state procedures for unclaimed property. After national privacy groups leapt into action, Link withdrew the amendment. This April, the judge certified Licata\u2019s case as a class action, applying to as many as eight million Facebook users in Illinois. If Facebook loses, the company could face a judgment as high as $40 billion.Arney met with three Google representatives, including Mufaddal Ezzy, a former aide in the State Legislature who runs Google\u2019s California lobbying operation. They had lunch in a private room at San Francisco\u2019s Wayfare Tavern, a trendy downtown restaurant with taxidermied heads of wild game on the walls. The executives were friendly, Arney recalls, but mostly they were confused, even a little disconcerted. \u201cGoogle\u2019s angle was, No. 1, \u2018Who are you?\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me recently, with a chuckle. No one in tech had ever heard of Arney and Mactaggart. They didn\u2019t understand why a finance guy and a real estate developer cared so much about privacy. One asked whether either of the two men were planning to run for office. Eventually, the idea was floated that they all work together on an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s initiative \u2014 a piece of legislation in Sacramento, where they could all have input. \u201cTheir idea was that we could fix this in the State Legislature,\u201d Arney says.Facebook seemed to have different worries, Mactaggart told me. Mactaggart\u2019s uncle was friends with a former San Francisco city official who had gone to work for Facebook. The friend reached out to arrange a meeting with Facebook\u2019s vice president for state and local policy: Will Castleberry, a gravel-voiced veteran of the tech and telecom industry. When Castleberry met Mactaggart and Arney at a different San Francisco restaurant in December, Mactaggart found him charming and sincere. \u201cA lot of people who we talked to told us these were evil people,\u201d Mactaggart said later. \u201cBut they seemed nice.\u201dCastleberry praised Mactaggart\u2019s proposal but asked whether he was willing to rewrite it. Facebook\u2019s chief concern, he said, was a feature of the proposal called a \u201cprivate right of action.\u201d Unlike the Obama bill, which left most enforcement to the F.T.C., Mactaggart proposed letting consumers sue companies that violated the law. (Illinois had included such a right in its biometrics law, allowing Licata to sue Facebook.) Facebook feared that if interpretation of the new rules was left to juries, rather than regulators, it would take years just to determine what the company\u2019s compliance obligations were. \u201cWe support more disclosure in principle,\u201d Castleberry explained to me. \u201cBut the stakes are just much higher with the private right of action.\u201dMactaggart wanted to make sure his bill had teeth. But as a businessman, he said, he was sympathetic to Facebook\u2019s concerns. He urged Facebook to send him some alternative language. \u201cWe thought, Gosh, if Facebook came back with something reasonable, and we could get behind it, that would be a win-win,\u201d he recalls.But as Mactaggart waited, the tech companies \u2014 and other industries dependent on free data \u2014 were preparing to crush him. In January, California\u2019s Chamber of Commerce filed paperwork to register a group called the Committee to Protect California Jobs. The committee soon collected six-figure contributions from Facebook, Google and three of the country\u2019s biggest internet service providers: Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. The money paid for polling, which showed that Californians indeed had ample concerns about privacy, and to retain Gale Kaufman, a respected Democratic referendum specialist with close ties to the state\u2019s labor unions. The group also hired Steven Maviglio, a prominent Democratic public-relations consultant whose clients included the Democratic speaker of the California State Assembly. Silicon Valley was girding for war.Mactaggart also knew that the tech and cable money, while less than the $2 million he had so far put into his own campaign, was only just the start. His own consultants warned him that the Committee to Protect California Jobs would most likely raise $100 million or more by Election Day. Mactaggart was rich. But he wasn\u2019t that rich.The Cambridge Analytica scandal engulfed Facebook, sending the company\u2019s stock price plunging and setting in motion the worst crisis in the company\u2019s history. Cambridge executives had long bragged about deploying powerful \u201cpsychographic\u201d voter profiles to manipulate voters. Now Facebook was forced to acknowledge that Cambridge had used voters\u2019 own Facebook data to do it. The damage was not only legal and political \u2014 Facebook faced lawsuits and new inquiries by regulators in Brussels, London and Washington \u2014 but also reputational. Silicon Valley\u2019s public image had survived the Snowden revelations. But tech companies, already implicated in the spread of \u201cfake news\u201d and Russian interference in the 2016 election, were no longer the good guys. When Arney took one of his sons canvassing on the train, it was suddenly easy to get people to sign their ballot petition. \u201cAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal, all we had to say was \u2018data privacy,\u2019\u2009\u201d he told me.The scandal forced Facebook to take complaints about privacy more seriously \u2014 or, at least, to sound as if it did. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we shouldn\u2019t be regulated,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg, the company\u2019s chief executive, told CNN. Mactaggart pressed the advantage, posting an open letter accusing Zuckerberg of misleading Facebook users, then calling up media outlets to remind them that Zuckerberg\u2019s company was, at that moment, financing a campaign to stop new privacy regulations in California. When Zuckerberg appeared before Congress, in April, he again appeared contrite. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take a broad-enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake,\u201d Zuckerberg told lawmakers. The next day, Facebook announced that it would no longer contribute money to the Committee to Protect California Jobs.Yet even as his canvassers racked up petition signatures from voters in the state, Mactaggart was being spurned by almost every prominent privacy group in the country. Like any other movement, the world of privacy experts has its radicals and moderates, feuds and schisms. In the wake of the Cambridge revelations, some advocates in Washington and California called for regulations, similar to Europe\u2019s G.D.P.R., that were much more sweeping than what Mactaggart proposed; some privacy advocates told me that they feared his initiative would crowd out their own, more sweeping proposals. (Whereas Mactaggart\u2019s initiative allowed consumers to \u201copt out\u201d of data sales between companies, G.D.P.R., which went into effect across the continent in May, required companies to obtain consumers\u2019 permission for collecting the information in the first place.) Once voters approved Mactaggart\u2019s initiative, these critics pointed out, California lawmakers would need to muster an almost unobtainable supermajority to amend it.Corbin did not mention her firm\u2019s new client: the Committee to Protect California Jobs. Still at work for its remaining backers, the committee had hired Corbin\u2019s firm in February. According to Corbin, the industry coalition wanted her to provide an overview of existing privacy rules as well as areas of potential compromise with the other privacy activists, a move that could further isolate Mactaggart. Such an alliance would not have been totally unprecedented. Despite disagreements over consumer rules, tech companies have contributed millions of dollars to groups like the E.F.F. and the Washington-based Center for Democracy and Technology while working closely with some of them in pushing for post-Snowden surveillance reforms. \u201cSometimes politics makes for strange bedfellows,\u201d Corbin told me by email, when I asked about the payment. \u201cI can tell you there was plenty to concern industry and privacy groups alike about the ballot initiative.\u201dFacebook, for its part, contacted the C.D.T., asking the center\u2019s top expert on data-privacy protection, Michelle De Mooy, to help develop an alternative to Mactaggart\u2019s proposal \u2014 language that could be submitted to lawmakers in Sacramento, either replacing or pre-empting Mactaggart\u2019s proposal. De Mooy told me that after some initial discussions, she turned them down, in part because Mactaggart did not seem interested in further compromise, but also because he seemed likely to succeed. \u201cThey were looking for options,\u201d De Mooy says of Facebook. \u201cUltimately, we said that that wasn\u2019t something we were going to do.\u201d But C.D.T. also remained neutral.Facebook chose that moment to make another direct appeal to Mactaggart. The company had developed a legislative counterproposal, which in April Will Castleberry emailed to Mactaggart, copying De Mooy. Mactaggart read it on a plane, flying back from a memorial service in Canada. He wasn\u2019t impressed. It was vague about data collected from mobile phones, and it appeared to exclude Facebook\u2019s own network of \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons around the Web, one of the company\u2019s chief means of tracking consumers when they weren\u2019t on Facebook. And while it limited the sale of data, it seemed to allow companies to make deals to swap data back and forth, potentially a major loophole.But Mactaggart didn\u2019t want to waste his money on a ballot fight if he could get a deal in Sacramento \u2014 and now that his initiative looked sure to get on the ballot, lawmakers in Sacramento had taken a renewed interest in passing their own privacy bill. Some privacy groups, including Common Sense Kids Action, were already negotiating with them. \u201cI\u2019m a real estate developer,\u201d Mactaggart told me later, describing his thinking. \u201cI\u2019ve never gotten everything I want, ever. If the legislature passed my entire bill, I\u2019m fine. And if it was almost as good \u2014 sure. Who needs to have a fight for the sake of having a fight?\u201dNevertheless, Mactaggart was willing to compromise. He had told California lawmakers that he would drop his campaign if they could pass a reasonable privacy bill by June 28, the legal point of no return for formally withdrawing his initiative from the ballot. Mactaggart and his team were scheduled to meet Ed Chau, a mild-mannered lawmaker from outside Los Angeles who leads the Assembly\u2019s committee on privacy and consumer protection. Chau had been designated as the Assembly\u2019s chief negotiator on a potential deal between industry and privacy advocates. After lunch, we all walked over to the Capitol and filed into Chau\u2019s fifth-floor office, where staff members had promised Mactaggart an update on the negotiations.Many privacy advocates in California regarded Chau as their champion. In 2017, he tried to pass a bill that would have required cable companies and other internet service providers to obtain customers\u2019 consent before selling their browsing history and other sensitive personal data. Known as AB 375, the bill was designed to replicate a popular Obama-era regulation that Trump and Republicans in Congress overturned during Trump\u2019s first months in office. To get it done quickly, Chau employed the very same tactic the tech industry had used in Illinois, gutting a different bill that had already passed the Assembly and inserting the broadband privacy provisions. \u201cCalifornia is going to restore what Washington stripped away,\u201d he pledged at a news conference.Some privacy advocates believed de Le\u00f3n was deliberately setting up Chau\u2019s bill to fail. While de Le\u00f3n is a progressive Democrat \u2014 he is now seeking to oust his fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from her United States Senate seat \u2014 he has also had a long relationship with AT&T, among the most feared and influential companies in Sacramento. As Senate leader, de Le\u00f3n was responsible for the health and size of the Democratic majority in the chamber, and the telecom and tech industries were a critical source of campaign cash. (AT&T also employed at least one of de Le\u00f3n\u2019s former top advisers among its swarm of lobbyists.) Most of the chamber\u2019s Democrats declined to go on the record supporting or opposing AB 375, fearful of enraging either the state\u2019s most powerful companies or privacy-minded anti-Trump voters. It never reached the floor, sparing them a painful vote. The reason for its demise remains murky. (Dan Reeves, a de Le\u00f3n aide, told me: \u201cWe said, if the author wants a vote, we\u2019ll put it up for a vote. We never heard back from them.\u201d Chau says he did ask for a vote. \u201cThe response from leadership then was, I didn\u2019t have the support,\u201d he says.) Now Chau had a second chance. Democratic leaders had resurrected his legislation, making a modified AB 375 the vehicle for a potential compromise with Mactaggart.But when we arrived in his office, Chau seemed ill at ease. He had not yet heard from Facebook or Google, he told us, and did not really know what their position was. He spoke in bland generalities. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of reaching out to all the stakeholders to see whether we can build consensus,\u201d Chau said. Mactaggart asked if the tech companies were being reasonable. Chau repeated himself, a nervous smile stuck on his face. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out to all potential stakeholders,\u201d he said. After 15 minutes, Chau\u2019s assistant interrupted to say that he had another meeting. We filed out. No one else appeared to be in Chau\u2019s waiting room.Outside, it was a beautiful California day, so we strolled along a footpath on the Capitol grounds. Mactaggart was struck by Chau\u2019s evasiveness \u2014 and worried about the tech companies\u2019 seeming silence. \u201cIf you are Facebook and Google, and you are serious about legislation and reform,\u201d Mactaggart said, \u201cyou would think that it might make sense to go talk to the head of the committee that\u2019s in charge of crafting the legislative response to this initiative.\u201d It was possible that the companies had abandoned compromise. It was also possible that everybody was playing a more complex game. State lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cede policymaking authority to Mactaggart, and tech companies disliked his initiative so much that they might be willing to come to a reasonable compromise with the Legislature instead. If Democratic leaders were careful, they could devise a win-win: A bill that Mactaggart and the industry would accept, that privacy activists would hail and that lawmakers could take credit for. But Mactaggart found the delays and secrecy maddening. His deadline was fast approaching. \u201cDaylight\u2019s burning,\u201d he said.We got in his SUV and headed back to Oakland. I asked him whether he thought Chau could deliver a bill that would satisfy him and still pass the Legislature. But Mactaggart took my question both more broadly and more personally: What would happen if he failed? \u201cThese companies know so much about you,\u201d Mactaggart said as he drove. \u201cAnd as time goes on, it is only going to get worse and worse.\u201d Approaching Oakland, we drove past the Benicia refinery, a small mountain of pipes and distillation towers looming over an inlet of San Francisco Bay. Mactaggart suggested that the refinery, originally constructed for Exxon in the 1960s, could never be built there today, given California\u2019s strict environmental-impact laws. Reform movements of earlier eras had managed to rein in Big Oil, Mactaggart noted. It was time for Big Tech to face a similar reckoning.It began to dawn on at least some people that Mactaggart\u2019s vote might be the most important one. Without it, Mactaggart\u2019s initiative would move forward. There would be no win-win. Hertzberg, in particular, really wanted a deal. Where Chau is modest, Hertzberg, who represents the San Fernando Valley, is voluble and insistent, with a slicked-back mane of hair and a steady borscht-belt patter. \u201cI called Alastair \u2014 we had some friends in common,\u201d Hertzberg told me. Hertzberg proposed that Mactaggart take the pen. Mark it up however you want, he told Mactaggart, and I\u2019ll bring your proposal back to the industry. On a Wednesday in mid-June, Mactaggart went to his lawyer\u2019s office and got on the phone with a small group of negotiators, among them Hertzberg, Chau and an adviser to Common Sense Kids Action. Twelve hours later, they had an agreement, which Mactaggart and Common Sense Kids Action agreed to support. Hertzberg and Chau sent it off to the Legislature\u2019s lawyers to be formally drafted into a bill.Mactaggart had agreed to whittle down his biggest stick: The private right of action would permit consumer lawsuits only in the case of a traditional data breach, as when your credit-card information is stolen. And instead of naming every third party they shared your data with, companies would have to disclose only the kinds of data they were sharing, an obligation the companies already had to European consumers under G.D.P.R. Many privacy activists hated the deal, and some of the same groups that had refused to support Mactaggart\u2019s initiative now savaged him for compromising on it. The A.C.L.U. and E.F.F., both of which rely heavily on civil litigation to win advocacy battles, were particularly upset by the narrowed private right of action.But as Mactaggart saw it, the core of his initiative remained intact \u2014 and was in some ways strengthened. Now you could see exactly what information Silicon Valley and the data brokers had collected about you. You could still demand that they stop selling or swapping your data. And if they refused, the California attorney general could investigate and impose fines. Even in this reduced form, Mactaggart and Soltani believed, this would be the most stringent consumer-privacy law in the country \u2014 the most significant step in years toward regulating the surveillance capitalists, and a proof of concept for activists and industry alike. If it passed, the tech industry could no longer claim that no one cared about privacy, or that data rules would kill jobs, or were too technically challenging. California\u2019s attorney general could police the entire industry, while other states worked on their own versions of the rules. \u201cUnder this law, the attorney general of California will become the chief privacy officer of the United States of America,\u201d Mactaggart argued. Eventually, it might drive the tech industry back to the negotiating table in Washington, in hopes of getting a single national standard.The next morning, Hertzberg summoned tech lobbyists to a meeting. They had a simple choice, he explained. They could agree to the deal, or take their chances with Mactaggart in the fall. Hertzberg told the lobbyists they could probably scare his colleagues into killing this new bill, too. But Mactaggart\u2019s initiative was polling extraordinarily well. To beat him in November, the tech industry and its allies \u2014 the cable companies, the data brokers and the financial companies and retailers that used their data for advertising \u2014 would have to mount a huge negative campaign, at considerable cost to their own image. \u201cAnd if they do, we\u2019ll be right back here next year,\u201d Hertzberg told me later that day.Legislative staff members had finished rewriting AB 375, and a deal seemed imminent. That Friday, as he drank his morning coffee, Mactaggart decided to read the new bill \u2014 the fine print \u2014 one more time. He noticed a seemingly minor alteration in one section, the kind of thing most people would skip over. Mactaggart realized it would completely gut what remained of the private right of action. Furious, he called Hertzberg and Chau and told them the deal was off. Neither lawmaker could explain who made the change, Mactaggart told me, but Hertzberg scrambled to fix it. \u201cIn most negotiations, you are talking to all these different interest groups,\u201d Hertzberg told me recently. \u201cThis is a situation where we had to go and reach out to everyone and bring that information to Mr. Mactaggart and ask him what he wanted to do.\u201d By Monday morning, the deal was back on again.That Tuesday, Facebook signaled that it would not fight the bill. In a statement emailed to reporters, Will Castleberry said that \u201cwhile not perfect, we support AB 375 and look forward to working with policymakers on an approach that protects consumers and promotes responsible innovation.\u201d At hearings, industry representatives complained that they had been put in the impossible position of either accepting the compromise or fighting a ballot initiative they had no power to change. \u201cThe internet industry will not obstruct or block AB 375 from moving forward,\u201d the Internet Association announced, \u201cbecause it prevents the even-worse ballot initiative from becoming law in California.\u201d Soltani wryly pointed out that Mactaggart had offered Silicon Valley a take-it-or-leave-it privacy policy \u2014 the same kind that Silicon Valley usually offered everyone else.Political power is a malleable thing, Mactaggart had learned, an elaborate calculation of artifice and argument, votes and money. People and institutions \u2014 in politics, in Silicon Valley \u2014 can seem all-powerful right up to the moment they are not. And sometimes, Mactaggart discovered, a thing that can\u2019t possibly happen suddenly becomes a thing that cannot be stopped.I spoke to Mactaggart shortly after the vote. \u201cIt felt like a moment \u2014 people didn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d he observed. A part of Mactaggart was already thinking ahead. The legislation would not take effect until 2020, and both the Legislature and the tech industry would have a chance to amend the new law beforehand. In the weeks after the vote, as Silicon Valley\u2019s accumulated troubles sent shares in Facebook and other tech companies plummeting anew, their lobbyists were back on the march. The Trump administration was convening meetings to discuss a new national privacy standard, one that would perhaps override California\u2019s newly minted statute. There would be plenty of chances for mischief. But as he basked in the victory, Mactaggart was giddy, even emotional. \u201cEveryone who could have blocked it didn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the system wants to work, it can.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The iGen Shift: Colleges Are Changing to Reach the Next Generation", "Date": "2018-08-02", "News": "The newest students are transforming the way schools serve and educate them, including sending presidents and deans to Instagram and Twitter.Supported byThey are, of course, super connected. But on their terms. Which is why college-bound iGens (Gen Zers, if you prefer) present a challenge to the grown-ups on campus eager to reach and teach them.Consider orientation season. Katie Sermersheim, dean of students at Purdue University, has a mother lode of information and resources to share (including wellness initiatives and a new mindfulness room). But getting iGen\u2019s attention?\u201cIt can be frustrating slash extra challenging to figure out how to get the word out, whatever that word is,\u201d Ms. Sermersheim said. \u201cI do get discouraged.\u201dA generation that rarely reads books or emails, breathes through social media, feels isolated and stressed but is crazy driven and wants to solve the world\u2019s problems (not just volunteer) is now on campus. Born from 1995 to 2012, its members are the most ethnically diverse generation in history, said Jean M. Twenge, psychology professor at San Diego State University.They began arriving at colleges a few years ago, and now they are exerting their presence. They are driving shifts, subtle and not, in how colleges serve, guide and educate them, sending presidents and deans to Instagram and Twitter.They are forcing course makeovers, spurring increased investments in mental health \u2014 from more counselors and wellness messages to campaigns drawing students to nature (hug a tree, take a break to look at insects) \u2014 and pushing academics to be more hands-on and job-relevant.They are a frugal but ambitious lot, less excited by climbing walls and en suite kitchens than by career development.Most critically, they expect to be treated as individuals. Students raised amid the tailored analytics of online retailers or college recruiters presume that anything put in front of them is customized for them, said Thomas C. Golden of Capture Higher Ed, a Lexington, Ky., data firm. He sees group designations evolving into \u201csegments of one.\u201dStudents want to navigate campus life, getting food or help, when it is convenient for them. And, yes, on their mobile devices or phones. \u201cIt\u2019s not really technology to them,\u201d said Cory Tressler, associate director of learning programs at Ohio State University, noting that the iPhone came out when most were in grade school.It is why Ohio State this year, rather than battle device use, issued iPads to 11,000 incoming students. The school designated 42 fall courses \u201ciPad required\u201d (21 more will be added in the spring) and is building an app that in addition to maps and bus routes has a course planner, grades, schedules and a Get Involved feature displaying student organizations.In the works is more customization, so when students open the app it knows which campus they are enrolled at, their major and which student groups they belong to.Speaking to students on their terms just makes sense, said Nicole Kraft, a journalism professor at Ohio State who takes attendance via Twitter (she has separate hashtags for each of her three courses). She posts assignments on Slack, an app used in many workplaces. And she holds office hours at 10 p.m. via the video conference site Zoom, \u201cbecause that is when they have questions.\u201dDr. Kraft does not use email for class, except to teach students how to write a \u201cproper\u201d one. \u201cThat is a skill they need to have,\u201d she said.While these students are called \u201cdigital natives,\u201d they still must be taught how to use devices and apps for academic purposes, Dr. Kraft said. She\u2019s had students not know that they could use Microsoft Word on an iPad. \u201cWe make a lot of assumptions about what they know how to do.\u201dCampuses also have been slow to recognize that this age group is not millennials, version 2.0.\u201cIGen has a different flavor,\u201d said Dr. Twenge of San Diego State University and author of \u201ciGen: Why Today\u2019s Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy \u2014 and Completely Unprepared for Adulthood \u2014 and What That Means for the Rest of Us.\u201dIt is tricky to define a large part of the population. But Dr. Twenge said big data sets revealed broad psychological patterns shared by those coming of age amid defining social, cultural and economic events.The difference between growing up in the prosperous 1990s versus seeing family members lose jobs and homes during the 2008 recession alters one\u2019s perspective, she said. It is why iGens are so focused on debt and insist that they get skills and experiences that will lead to a career.The prevalence of school shootings and domestic terrorism has also shaped them.\u201cThis generation defies the stereotypes of young adults,\u201d in terms of risk-taking, Dr. Twenge said. They are \u201cmore receptive to messages around safety\u201d and less eager to get driver\u2019s licenses, and they come to college \u201cwith much less experience with sex and alcohol.\u201dThey are also more cautious when it comes to academics, fear failure and have learning preferences distinct from millennials, said Corey Seemiller, professor at Wright State University and co-author of \u201cGeneration Z Goes to College,\u201d who queried 1,200 students on 50 campuses.\u201cThey do not like to learn in groups,\u201d favor videos over static content and like to think about information, then be walked through it to be certain they have it right.\u201cThey want a model\u201d and then to practice, said Dr. Seemiller, who posts samples when assigning a paper. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018Let\u2019s look through them and see what works.\u2019\u201d Having grown up with public successes and failures online, she said, students are hungry to have a big impact, yet \u201cworry they will not live up to that expectation.\u201dAnd despite their digital obsession, Dr. Seemiller\u2019s research shows this generation favors visual, face-to-face communication over texting. They are not always good at live social interaction, but they crave it. \u201cThey want authenticity and transparency,\u201d she said. \u201cThey like the idea of human beings being behind things.\u201dAs a generation that \u201chas been sold a lot of stuff,\u201d said Dr. Seemiller, iGens are shrewd consumers of the tone and quality of communication. That\u2019s pushing colleges to focus not only on what they say, but also how they say it.Which is what orientation leaders and staffers in Princeton\u2019s office of the dean of undergraduate students \u2014 known on social media as ODUS \u2014 have tried to master in the way they welcome the class of 2022.Cody Babineaux, an incoming freshman from Lafayette, La., whose video of his acceptance to Princeton has 4.6 million Twitter views, appreciated it, especially the Harvard shirt sniffed and tossed out in the first 20 seconds. \u201cIt was hilarious,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t try too hard.\u201dGetting student attention and keeping it matters to administrators trying to build excitement for campus events, but also in prodding students about housing contracts and honor codes. \u201cWe are an office that enforces university standards. We can\u2019t be firing off,\u201d said Thomas Dunne, deputy dean of undergraduate students. \u201cBut you have to be animated and human-sounding. Our voice is very personal.\u201dODUS has become an active presence on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter with a vibe that winks, pokes, weaves in memes and slang terms like BAE (before anyone else) and on fleek (flawlessly styled), and applies hashtags with wit (a free ice cream for dropping by the ODUS office with dance moves worthy of Dean Dunne? #GetServed, #GameOfCones).Mr. Dunne, whose Facebook page began as a student prank without his knowledge more than a decade ago, leans on staff members who include 20-somethings. One, Ian Deas, who favors Snapchat, identifies student \u201cinfluencers,\u201d following them on Facebook and Instagram.In posts, he looks for \u201cthose trendy phrases that help us stay in the conversation.\u201d When ODUS staff members respond to student posts, it amplifies their reach. \u201cWhen we are being interactive, our stuff pops up in other people\u2019s feeds\u201d and drives curiosity about \u201cwho is behind the voice.\u201dBeing social on social media attracts students who might tune out official communication. Mr. Babineaux said he and his friends noted when college posts sounded \u201cgoofy\u201d or \u201clike your grandfather trying to say swag.\u201dHe also notices that his generation is criticized \u201cbecause we are always on our phones,\u201d which gets interpreted as being disconnected. In fact, he said, \u201cwe just have more connection with everyone all the time.\u201dIt is also how students like Mr. Babineaux learn and get information.\u201cSocial media has helped me get a lot more prepared for Princeton,\u201d he said, adding that he has scrolled through old posts of campus (\u201cI have never seen snow\u201d) and watched videos, including of graduation. \u201cI thought, \u2018That will be on my Instagram page in four years.\u2019\u201dThis is the third of four new Learning sections being published this year.

{"Headline": "Here\u2019s the Conversation We Really Need to Have About Bias at Google", "Date": "2018-08-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut that concludes the \u201cdefense of Google\u201d portion of this column. Because whether he knew it or not, Mr. Trump\u2019s false charges crashed into a longstanding set of worries about Google, its biases and its power. When you get beyond the president\u2019s claims, you come upon a set of uncomfortable facts \u2014 uncomfortable for Google and for society, because they highlight how in thrall we are to this single company, and how few checks we have against the many unseen ways it is influencing global discourse.Dr. Noble argues that many people have the wrong idea about Google. We think of the search engine as a neutral oracle, as if the company somehow marshals computers and math to objectively sift truth from trash.But Google is made by humans who have preferences, opinions and blind spots and who work within a corporate structure that has clear financial and political goals. What\u2019s more, because Google\u2019s systems are increasingly created by artificial intelligence tools that learn from real-world data, there\u2019s a growing possibility that it will amplify the many biases found in society, even unbeknown to its creators.Google says it is aware of the potential for certain kinds of bias in its search results, and that it has instituted efforts to prevent them. \u201cWhat you have from us is an absolute commitment that we want to continually improve results and continually address these problems in an effective, scalable way,\u201d said Pandu Nayak, who heads Google\u2019s search ranking team. \u201cWe have not sat around ignoring these problems.\u201dFor years, Dr. Noble and others who have researched hidden biases \u2014 as well as the many corporate critics of Google\u2019s power, like the frequent antagonist Yelp \u2014 have tried to start a public discussion about how the search company influences speech and commerce online.There\u2019s a worry now that Mr. Trump\u2019s incorrect charges could undermine such work. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s complaint undid a lot of good and sophisticated thought that was starting to work its way into public consciousness about these issues,\u201d said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia who has studied Google and Facebook\u2019s influence on society.Dr. Noble suggested a more constructive conversation was the one \u201cabout one monopolistic platform controlling the information landscape.\u201dSo, let\u2019s have it.In the United States, about eight out of 10 web searches are conducted through Google; across Europe, South America and India, Google\u2019s share is even higher. Google also owns other major communications platforms, among them YouTube and Gmail, and it makes the Android operating system and its app store. It is the world\u2019s dominant internet advertising company, and through that business, it also shapes the market for digital news.Google\u2019s power alone is not damning. The important question is how it manages that power, and what checks we have on it. That\u2019s where critics say it falls down.Google\u2019s influence on public discourse happens primarily through algorithms, chief among them the system that determines which results you see in its search engine. These algorithms are secret, which Google says is necessary because search is its golden goose (it does not want Microsoft\u2019s Bing to know what makes Google so great) and because explaining the precise ways the algorithms work would leave them open to being manipulated.But this initial secrecy creates a troubling opacity. Because search engines take into account the time, place and some personalized factors when you search, the results you get today will not necessarily match the results I get tomorrow. This makes it difficult for outsiders to investigate bias across Google\u2019s results.A lot of people made fun this week of the paucity of evidence that Mr. Trump put forward to support his claim. But researchers point out that if Google somehow went rogue and decided to throw an election to a favored candidate, it would only have to alter a small fraction of search results to do so. If the public did spot evidence of such an event, it would look thin and inconclusive, too.\u201cWe really have to have a much more sophisticated sense of how to investigate and identify these claims,\u201d said Frank Pasquale, a professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s law school who has studied the role that algorithms play in society.Google has no similar program, but Dr. Nayak said the company often shares data with outside researchers. He also argued that Google\u2019s results are less \u201cpersonalized\u201d than people think, suggesting that search biases, when they come up, will be easy to spot.\u201cAll our work is out there in the open \u2014 anyone can evaluate it, including our critics,\u201d he said.The kind of blanket, intentional bias Mr. Trump is claiming would necessarily involve many workers at Google. And Google is leaky; on hot-button issues \u2014 debates over diversity or whether to work with the military \u2014 politically minded employees have provided important information to the media. If there was even a rumor that Google\u2019s search team was skewing search for political ends, we would likely see some evidence of such a conspiracy in the media.That\u2019s why, in the view of researchers who study the issue of algorithmic bias, the more pressing concern is not about Google\u2019s deliberate bias against one or another major political party, but about the potential for bias against those who do not already hold power in society. These people \u2014 women, minorities and others who lack economic, social and political clout \u2014 fall into the blind spots of companies run by wealthy men in California.Eventually, this error was fixed. But how many other such errors are hidden in Google? We have no idea.Google says it understands these worries, and often addresses them. In 2016, some people noticed that it listed a Holocaust-denial site as a top result for the search \u201cDid the Holocaust happen?\u201d That started a large effort at the company to address hate speech and misinformation online. The effort, Dr. Nayak said, shows that \u201cwhen we see real-world biases making results worse than they should be, we try to get to the heart of the problem.\u201dYet it is not just these unintended biases that we should be worried about. Researchers point to other issues: Google\u2019s algorithms favor recency and activity, which is why they are so often vulnerable to being manipulated in favor of misinformation and rumor in the aftermath of major news events. (Google says it is working on addressing misinformation.)Some of Google\u2019s rivals charge that the company favors its own properties in its search results over those of third-party sites \u2014 for instance, how it highlights Google\u2019s local reviews instead of Yelp\u2019s in response to local search queries.The danger for Google is that Mr. Trump\u2019s charges, however misinformed, create an opening to discuss these legitimate issues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democratic Party Says It Thwarted Attempted Hack of Voter Database", "Date": "2018-08-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Democratic National Committee said Wednesday that it was alerted to an attempted hack of its voter database this week and that it had notified law enforcement.This week\u2019s attempt was aggressive, two officials briefed on it said. The hackers set up a fake page that mimicked the party\u2019s login page for its voter-registration website, a tactic that could gather names, passwords and other credentials of those using the voter database. The hackers also may have sent emails to people within the national committee to try to trick them into using the fake page, a tactic known as \u201cspearphishing,\u201d the officials said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident, one of the officials said.\u201cThis attempt is further proof that there are constant threats as we head into midterm elections, and we must remain vigilant in order to prevent future attacks,\u201d said Bob Lord, chief security officer for the Democratic National Committee. He called the voter file \u201cthe party\u2019s most sensitive information.\u201dThe combination of this attack on the committee, continued influence operations by Russia and others using social media, and efforts to breach think tanks underscores that the cyber age has changed elections forever. So many systems are vulnerable to manipulation, from the voter-registration systems in the 50 states to the inner workings of the parties, that the opportunities for foreign and domestic manipulation are many.\u201cThe focus has gone from using the cyber realm to steal secrets to using it to impose national power,\u201d Rob Joyce, the White House cybersecurity coordinator until the position was eliminated a few months ago, said this month at Defcon, an annual convention that focuses on hacking and defenses against it.On Sunday, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, suggested that Russia was not the only threat in the November elections.\u201cI can say definitively that it\u2019s a sufficient national security concern about Chinese meddling, Iranian meddling and North Korean meddling that we\u2019re taking steps to try and prevent it,\u201d Mr. Bolton said in an interview with ABC.Many of the hacking attempts are mimicking the techniques that were used to penetrate the Democratic National Committee in 2016. At the time, Russian state-backed hackers used trick emails to take senior party officials, including Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, to a page that looked identical to a password screen for Google\u2019s email service, Gmail. In fact, the page gave attackers access to the officials\u2019 accounts.Many of the warnings the national committee received several years ago about potential attacks either were ignored or did not reach the right individuals.Since then, the committee has taken steps to improve its cybersecurity. This year, it hired Mr. Lord, who previously held top technology roles at Yahoo and Twitter, and Raffi Krikorian, a former Uber executive, as its chief technology officer.The party\u2019s team has put new security practices into place and begun testing employees in spearphishing drills to see if they will click on the malicious emails. The national committee has also improved its cooperation with the F.B.I., according to law enforcement officials.The Votebuilder database is a particular prize for hackers because it contains personal details on Democratic voters that could be used to unlock other information, including personal email accounts and files. A successful penetration of the database could have set off other hacks in a domino effect, cybersecurity experts said.Lookout first detected the fake website late Monday, using a newly built artificial intelligence system that spots fake sites as they are created, said Mike Murray, the company\u2019s vice president of security intelligence.\u201cWe realized the significance,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin hours, we started waking up people to get them on the phone.\u201dBecause the website was caught so quickly, it is impossible to know who the hackers were or how they planned to use the site, Mr. Murray said. Such attacks are easy, he said, because anyone with decent programming skills can make a fake website in a few hours.\u201cThe adversaries are becoming more sophisticated in how they use these websites, but the attack is the same,\u201d he said.Mr. Lord said the White House also needed to get involved to improve cyberdefenses.\u201cThese threats are serious, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s critical that we all work together, but we can\u2019t do this alone,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need the administration to take more aggressive steps to protect our voting systems.\u201dThe attempted hack was revealed as the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s cybersecurity division hailed its efforts to protect the nation\u2019s election systems from foreign intrusions.During a tour of the agency\u2019s National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center near Washington on Wednesday, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, and Christopher C. Krebs, her top deputy for cybersecurity, said the department was more prepared than it had been during the 2016 elections.\u201cWe are better positioned than at any time in history,\u201d Ms. Nielsen said, standing before a bank of computers and giant monitors showing real-time threats to the nation\u2019s cyber and physical infrastructure.An earlier version of this article misstated what cybersecurity officials said about hackers\u2019 efforts to gain access to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s voter database. The officials said the hackers may have sent so-called spearphishing emails to D.N.C. officials, not that they did send such emails.Sheera Frenkel reported from San Francisco, and Jonathan Martin from Washington. David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Sydney, Australia, and Ron Nixon from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Are Targeted Ads Stalking You? Here\u2019s How to Make Them Stop", "Date": "2018-08-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixOnline ads have always been annoying, but now they\u2019re worse than ever.Consider what happens when you shop online for a wristwatch. You peruse a few watch websites and the next thing you know, a watch advertisement is following you everywhere. On your computer, it\u2019s loading in your Facebook feed. On your phone, it\u2019s popping up on Instagram. In your web browser on either, it\u2019s appearing on news sites that have nothing to do with watches. Even if you end up ordering the watch, the ads continue trailing you everywhere.They\u2019re stalker ads.To the ad industry, targeted ads are better for people than the old days of randomly blasting commercials.\u201cThe content isn\u2019t free, so what would you rather see?\u201d said Sarah Hofstetter, the chairwoman for the ad agency 360i. \u201cAds that are at least trying to be of interest to you, or ads that are spray and pray?\u201dFortunately, I have good news. After several years of interviewing internet companies and privacy experts and testing many web tools, I finally managed to make my stalker ads go away.Before you try to exorcise targeted ads, it helps to understand what\u2019s going on behind the scenes.Let\u2019s say you are shopping online for a blender. You load a webpage for a blender from Brand X, then close the browser. The next time you open the browser, ads for the blender are following you from site to site. They\u2019re also showing up in some of your mobile apps like Facebook and Instagram.When you visited Brand X\u2019s website, the site stored a cookie on your device containing a unique identifier. Brand X hired multiple ad tech companies to do its marketing. The ad tech companies embedded trackers that also loaded on Brand X\u2019s website, and the trackers took a look at your cookie to pinpoint your device.The trackers can tell if you are interested in buying something. They look for signals \u2014 like if you closed the browser after looking at the blender for awhile or left the item in the site\u2019s shopping cart without completing the purchase. From there, the ad tech companies can follow your cookie through trackers and ad networks on various sites and apps to serve you an ad for the blender.Ms. Hofstetter said that among ad tech companies, there are good actors and bad actors. The good ones will try to minimize the chances of annoying you by showing you the blender ad only a few times and stopping if they detect that you made the purchase. The bad ones only care to persuade you to buy the blender, so they will relentlessly serve you the ad and not bother to determine whether you already bought it.Things get extra messy when brands employ multiple ad tech companies that employ different approaches. Perhaps one ad company finished serving you the blender ad after a few times on Facebook. But elsewhere on the web or inside another app, another ad tech company served you that same ad endlessly.Here are a few simple steps you can take if you are being pestered by an ad and want that to end:There are more extreme methods to take if you want to prevent targeted ads from ever following you around. But this isn\u2019t for the faint of heart: In my experience, you have to take all, not just some, of these steps to get the pesky ads to leave you alone forever.It will probably take you a couple of hours to set yourself up to prevent ads from haunting you. I gradually made all these changes to my devices and internet accounts over the last few years and only recently stopped seeing targeted ads. It was a grueling process.But I\u2019ve been happy with the results. Those wristwatch ads that once followed me are gone. And recently, I was served an ad for 7-11 on Instagram.Was that ad irrelevant to me? Yes. But was it a sign that I was no longer being well tracked? Also yes. I confess I was pretty happy to see it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Small Fry,\u2019 Steve Jobs Comes Across as a Jerk. His Daughter Forgives Him. Should We?", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "ProfileLisa Brennan-Jobs has written a memoir about her famous father. The details are damning, but she doesn\u2019t want them to be.Supported byWhen Steve Jobs told his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs that the Apple Lisa computer was not named after her, it was not a cruel lie to a little girl, she insists \u2014 he was teaching her \u201cnot to ride on his coattails.\u201dWhen Mr. Jobs refused to install heat in her bedroom, he was not being callous, she says \u2014 he was instilling in her a \u201cvalue system.\u201dWhen a dying Mr. Jobs told Ms. Brennan-Jobs that she smelled \u201clike a toilet,\u201d it was not a hateful snipe, she maintains \u2014 he was merely showing her \u201chonesty.\u201dIt\u2019s a strange thing to write a devastating memoir with damning details but demand that these things are not, in fact, damning at all. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Ms. Brennan-Jobs has done in a new memoir, \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d and in a series of interviews conducted over the last few weeks.Thanks to a dozen other biographies and films, Apple obsessives already know the broad outlines of Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s early life: Mr. Jobs fathered her at 23, then denied paternity despite a DNA match, and gave little in financial or emotional support even as he became a god of the early computing era. \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d which goes on sale Sept. 4, is Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s effort to reclaim her story for herself.The backdrop to her raw depictions of life with and without Mr. Jobs is 1980s Silicon Valley, where artists and hippies mixed with technologists, ideas of how to build the future flourished, and a cascade of trillions of dollars was just beginning to crash onto the landscape. Ms. Brennan-Jobs navigated a childhood on welfare with her mother, the artist Chrisann Brennan, and an adolescence ensconced in her father\u2019s wealth.In passage after passage of \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Mr. Jobs is vicious to his daughter and those around her. Now, in the days before the book is released, Ms. Brennan-Jobs is fearful that it will be received as a tell-all expos\u00e9, and not the more nuanced portrait of a family she intended. She worries that the reaction will be about a famous man\u2019s legacy rather than a young woman\u2019s story \u2014 that she will be erased again, this time in her own memoir.On the eve of publication, what Ms. Brennan-Jobs wants readers to know is this: Steve Jobs rejected his daughter for years, but that daughter has absolved him. Triumphantly, she loves him, and she wants the book\u2019s scenes of their roller skating and laughing together to be as viral as the scenes of him telling her she will inherit nothing.Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s forgiveness is one thing. What\u2019s tricky is that she wants the reader to forgive Mr. Jobs, too. And she knows that could be a problem.\u201cHave I failed?\u201d she asked, in one of our conversations. \u201cHave I failed in fully representing the dearness and the pleasure? The dearness of my father, and the outrageous pleasure of being with him when he was in good form?\u201dAfter college, Ms. Brennan-Jobs left the United States to work in finance in London and Italy; she later shifted into design, and then freelance writing for magazines and literary journals. Now 40, she has long avoided publicity. She has never been profiled, and she has carefully eluded most of her father\u2019s chroniclers. (One exception: Aaron Sorkin, who called her \u201cthe heroine\u201d of his 2015 Steve Jobs biopic.) Ms. Brennan-Jobs said she did not trust Walter Isaacson, who wrote the definitive, megaselling biography of her father in 2011.\u201cI never spoke with Walter, and I never read the book, but I know I came off as cold to my father and not caring whether he felt bad,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said in late July, sitting in Cantine, a small, vegan-friendly cafe in Brooklyn\u2019s Carroll Gardens neighborhood. \u201cI was devastated by it.\u201d\u201cI felt ashamed to be the bad part of a great story,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I felt unresolved.\u201dAnd so in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d she seeks to resolve some of that shame by describing how her childhood unfolded, who key characters were, why it all happened. Ms. Brennan-Jobs went back to Silicon Valley and interviewed her family, her friends, her mother\u2019s ex-boyfriends, and her father\u2019s ex-girlfriend. In her childhood, the region had been green with eucalyptus and full of garage hackers. Now it is the greatest wealth-creation machine in the history of the world, and Mr. Jobs remains its towering hero.Ms. Brennan-Jobs began work on what would become \u201cSmall Fry\u201d not long after her father\u2019s 2011 death. Years into writing, she felt rushed by her publisher, Penguin Press, and feared being \u201ctarted up\u201d and made to take advantage of her father\u2019s legacy. She wanted to be with a smaller publisher who would work with her and give her more time, and switched to Grove, taking what she says was a 90 percent cut in her advance. (A spokesperson for Penguin declined to comment.)One result of the delay is that \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is entering the public conversation at a time when, across industries, formerly disempowered or ignored women are having their say about powerful men. A memoir by Steve Jobs\u2019s firstborn was always going to be a publishing sensation, but Ms. Brennan-Jobs has inadvertently timed hers to land when the public is even more attuned to marginalized voices \u2014 and when many are having darker thoughts about the world Mr. Jobs created with his attention-devouring devices.None of that, of course, was imaginable when Ms. Brennan-Jobs was born on May 17, 1978, on a commune farm in Oregon. Her parents, who had met in high school in Cupertino, Calif., were both 23. Mr. Jobs arrived days after the birth and helped name her, but refused to acknowledge that he was the father. To support her family, Ms. Brennan cleaned houses and used government assistance. Only after the government sued Mr. Jobs did he agree to pay child support.\u201cSmall Fry\u201d describes how Mr. Jobs slowly took a greater interest in his daughter, taking her skating and coming over to her house for visits. Ms. Brennan-Jobs moved in with him for a time during high school, when her mother was struggling with money and her temper, but Mr. Jobs was cold and had extreme demands for what being a member of the family entailed. The neighbors next door worried about the teenage Lisa, and one night, when Mr. Jobs was out, they moved her from his house and into theirs. Against Mr. Jobs\u2019s wishes, the neighbors paid for her to finish college. (He later paid them back.)In an interview, Ms. Brennan-Jobs spoke of \u201cnot wanting to alienate people\u201d she loves, but acknowledged that her memoir might do just that. Aside from Mr. Jobs, all the central characters are very much alive. \u201cI hope Thanksgiving\u2019s O.K.,\u201d she said.Her mother, Ms. Brennan, is portrayed as a free spirit who nurtured her daughter\u2019s creativity \u2014 but could be mercurial, hot-tempered and sometimes neglectful. \u201cIt was horrendous for me to read,\u201d Ms. Brennan said in an interview. \u201cIt was very, very hard. But she got it right.\u201dMr. Jobs\u2019s infamous venom is on frequent display in \u201cSmall Fry.\u201d Out one night at dinner, Mr. Jobs turns to his daughter\u2019s cousin, Sarah, who has just unknowingly offended him by ordering meat. \u201c\u2018Have you ever thought about how awful your voice is?\u201d Mr. Jobs asks Sarah. \u201cPlease stop talking in that awful voice,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cYou should really consider what\u2019s wrong with yourself and try to fix it.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs describes her father\u2019s frequent use of money to confuse or frighten her. \u201cSometimes he decided not to pay for things at the very last minute,\u201d she writes, \u201cwalking out of restaurants without paying the bill.\u201d When her mother found a beautiful house and asked Mr. Jobs to buy it for her and Lisa, he agreed it was nice \u2014 but bought it for himself and moved in with his wife, Laurene Powell Jobs.Ms. Brennan said that her daughter has, if anything, underplayed the chaos of her childhood. \u201cShe didn\u2019t go into how bad it really was, if you can believe that,\u201d she said.But \u201cSmall Fry\u201d also contains moments of joy that capture Mr. Jobs\u2019s spontaneity and unparalleled mind. When Ms. Brennan-Jobs goes on a school trip to Japan, he arrives unannounced and pulls her out of the program for a day. Father and daughter sit, talking about God and how he sees consciousness. \u201cI was afraid of him and, at the same time, I felt a quaking, electric love,\u201d she writes.\u201cWhen I started writing,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be so interesting on the page, and I was almost frustrated that he pulled so much gravity.\u201dAfter Ms. Brennan-Jobs moved in with Mr. Jobs as a teenager, he forbade her from seeing her mother for six months, as a way to cement her connection to his new family. At the same time, Mr. Jobs shifted from neglectful to controlling. When Ms. Brennan-Jobs was getting increasingly involved at her high school, starting an opera club and running for freshman-class president, he got upset. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working out. You\u2019re not succeeding as a member of this family,\u201d Mr. Jobs says in the memoir. \u201cYou\u2019re never around. If you want to be a part of this family, you need to put in the time.\u201dTo appease her father, Ms. Brennan-Jobs transferred to another school that was closer to her father\u2019s house. She persisted in becoming editor in chief of the school newspaper. Her mentor there, a journalism teacher named Esther Wojcicki, says \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is a faithful account.\u201cThe dialogue that she had in there between her and Steve was just exactly right,\u201d Ms. Wojcicki said. \u201cThe book is a gift to all of us.\u201dEarly copies of the memoir have circulated among family and friends. Ms. Powell Jobs, her children and Mr. Jobs\u2019s sister, Mona Simpson, gave this statement to The Times: \u201cLisa is part of our family, so it was with sadness that we read her book, which differs dramatically from our memories of those times. The portrayal of Steve is not the husband and father we knew. Steve loved Lisa, and he regretted that he was not the father he should have been during her early childhood. It was a great comfort to Steve to have Lisa home with all of us during the last days of his life, and we are all grateful for the years we spent together as a family.\u201dOn a hot August day in Brooklyn, Ms. Brennan-Jobs and I walked to her studio, a small apartment with brick walls she painted white and a bamboo floor she painted black. While writing \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d she told me, she covered the mirrors around her work space with paper. \u201cI don\u2019t like catching myself in the mirror,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s like \u2014 \u2018Oh, self.\u2019\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs said she was nervous about how she would be described physically in a profile, and so I asked her to use her own words. \u201cMy face is uneven,\u201d she said. \u201cI have small eyes. I wish I had dimples, but I don\u2019t. I think right now I look jowly.\u201dI interjected to say she had delicate features, and freckles, and was about 5 foot 2, with slightly reddish brown hair.\u201cMy nose,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs replied, \u201cis not particularly delicate.\u201dShe is deeply self-deprecating, saying she was horrified to be doing \u201ca celebrity memoir.\u201d She said she was sure The New Yorker would not review the book, and that years ago, her first meeting at Grove only occurred because Elisabeth Schmitz, the editorial director, was doing a favor for a mutual friend.\u201cMy first thought on being pitched the book was, \u2018I don\u2019t do this kind of thing. I don\u2019t know how to publish a celebrity memoir,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Schmitz, who has acquired literary memoirs like the naturalist Helen Macdonald\u2019s \u201cH is for Hawk.\u201d But something about Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s writing made her reconsider. \u201cFrom the first page,\u201d she said, \u201cher language is fresh, surprising, unpredictable.\u201dI\u2019ve read it, and her writing really is compelling. Ms. Brennan-Jobs takes the same linguistic knife to herself as she does to others. She writes with disgust about using anecdotes from her childhood to elicit sympathy from others, and she is ashamed to have dropped her father\u2019s name during an interview to get into Harvard.On Aug. 1, Vanity Fair published an excerpt from \u201cSmall Fry\u201d under the digital headline \u201cI Have a Secret. My Father Is Steve Jobs.\u201d A few nights later, Ms. Brennan-Jobs called me, worried. She hated the title, and on social media, readers were feasting on the more savage details of her account \u2014 especially the \u201ctoilet\u201d comment.\u201cHe was telling me the truth,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me, adding that the rosewater perfume she wore had turned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it. Sometimes it\u2019s nice of someone to tell you what you smell like.\u201dIt was another uncomfortable reminder that even though \u201cSmall Fry\u201d is Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s story \u2014 one written in a precise, literary style \u2014 her father\u2019s myth looms so large that she cannot control how her words are received. When choosing a narrator for the audio version, she nixed the ones who spoke his lines too harshly or without humor.So much of Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019s effort with the memoir seems to be to show how brutal Steve Jobs could be \u2014 and, in doing so, to reclaim that brutality for herself. And how she wants to reclaim it is to love it.\u201cYou get your inheritance, delivered in a lump of coal or whatever in a sort of awful package,\u201d she told me at one point. \u201cAnd you have to take a lot of time to turn the awful package on its head, and it reveals something kind of glorious, and then you\u2019re set free.\u201dIf Ms. Brennan-Jobs was alarmed by the reaction to the toilet-water excerpt, she may be unprepared for what happens when readers encounter more disturbing material. Several times in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Mr. Jobs engages in what seems like inappropriate affection in front of his daughter.Ms. Brennan-Jobs describes him embracing Ms. Powell Jobs one day, \u201cpulling her in to a kiss, moving his hand closer to her breasts,\u201d and up her thigh, \u201cmoaning theatrically.\u201dWhen Ms. Brennan-Jobs tries to leave, her father stops her: \u201c\u2018Hey Lis,\u2019 he said. \u2018Stay here. We\u2019re having a family moment. It\u2019s important that you try to be part of this family.\u2019 I sat still, looking away as he moaned and undulated.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs emphasized in an interview that she never felt threatened by her father, and that to her, these scenes show he was \u201cjust awkward.\u201dThis kind of display was not an isolated incident, said Ms. Brennan-Jobs\u2019 mother, who described an upsetting, sexualized conversation between Mr. Jobs and their daughter in her 2013 memoir, \u201cA Bite in the Apple.\u201d One evening, Ms. Brennan writes, she let Mr. Jobs babysit 9-year-old Lisa. When Ms. Brennan came home early, she found Mr. Jobs with the girl, \u201cteasing her nonstop about her sexual aspirations,\u201d \u201cridiculing her with sexual innuendos,\u201d and \u201cjoking about bedroom antics between Lisa and this or that guy.\u201dMs. Brennan, in her memoir, describes feeling scared for her daughter that night, and wanting to place her body between them and get out of there. \u201cI will be clear,\u201d Ms. Brennan writes. \u201cSteve was not a sexual predator of children. There was something else going on.\u201d Still, after that night, Ms. Brennan tried to make sure there was \u201ca chaperone\u201d when Mr. Jobs was with his young daughter for long hours, she told me recently.\u201cHe was so inappropriate because he didn\u2019t know how to do better,\u201d Ms. Brennan said. In her book, she characterizes Mr. Jobs as \u201con a slide whistle between human and inhuman.\u201dOne afternoon in August, as Ms. Brennan-Jobs and I talked in her kitchen, she made a juice of dandelion greens, pineapple, turmeric and ginger roots. She eats an extremely healthy diet and knows it mirrors her father\u2019s, which veered into esoteric California wellness trends, even as pancreatic cancer took over more of his body.Ms. Brennan-Jobs has a husband, Bill, a longtime Microsoft employee now launching a software start-up. He has two daughters, aged 10 and 12, and he and Ms. Brennan-Jobs have a 4-month-old son. As she drinks her juice, Bill is nearby with the children, and there\u2019s an easygoing energy in the house.\u201cI see my husband and the way he is with his daughters \u2014 responsive and alive and sensitive in ways my father would have liked to be,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said. \u201cMy father would have loved to be a man like that, and he surrounded himself with men like that, but he couldn\u2019t be.\u201dDecades after his child-support lawsuit, Mr. Jobs erased his paternity again. \u201cSmall Fry\u201d notes that on his corporate bio on the Apple website, the detail-obsessed chief executive was listed as having three children. But of course he had four.The most public torchbearer for Mr. Jobs\u2019s character and legacy is Ms. Powell Jobs. With an inherited fortune of some $21 billion, she has engaged in philanthropy and launched the Emerson Collective, an organization that pursues liberal political activism and for-profit investments, and owns a majority stake in the Atlantic magazine.Ms. Powell Jobs plays a somewhat \u201ctonic note\u201d in \u201cSmall Fry,\u201d Ms. Brennan-Jobs said. Her stepmother brings her into family photos, for example, but many of the descriptions of Ms. Powell Jobs are biting.Ms. Brennan-Jobs told me that she gave Ms. Powell Jobs \u201cthe best line\u201d in the book. It appears in a scene where Ms. Powell Jobs and Mr. Jobs go to a therapy session with a teenage Lisa. Ms. Brennan-Jobs cries and says she feels lonely and has wanted her parents to say good night to her.Ms. Powell Jobs responds to the therapist: \u201cWe\u2019re just cold people.\u201dToward the end of Mr. Jobs\u2019s life, he finally apologized to his daughter. Ms. Brennan-Jobs calls it her \u201cmovie ending.\u201d In the book, she writes that Mr. Jobs said he was sorry he had not spent more time with her, and for disappearing during her adulthood, forgetting birthdays and not returning notes or calls.In reply, Ms. Brennan-Jobs says she knows he was busy. Mr. Jobs answers that he acted the way he did because she had offended him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I was busy. It was because I was mad you didn\u2019t invite me to the Harvard weekend,\u201d he says in the book, referring to a matriculation event.He also cries and tells her over and over again, \u201cI owe you one\u201d \u2014 a famously articulate communicator unable to summon the basic language of contrition.Ms. Brennan-Jobs may be experiencing a kind of author\u2019s remorse as her book makes its way toward store shelves. But details as lethal as these \u2014 they sink into Mr. Jobs\u2019s legend like daggers to the hilt \u2014 are more proof than any DNA test that she is her father\u2019s daughter.Ultimately, Mr. Jobs left his daughter an inheritance in the millions \u2014 the same amount as his other children \u2014 and she is not involved in the allocation of his financial legacy. If she was in charge of his billions, she says, she would give it away to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 a curious twist given her father\u2019s epic rivalry with Apple\u2019s archnemesis.\u201cWould it be too perverse?\u201d she asked. \u201cI feel like the Gates Foundation is really doing good stuff, and I think I would just hot potato it away.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs said she wrote \u201cSmall Fry\u201d in part to figure out why he withheld money from her even as his wealth ballooned, and as he spent it more freely on the children he had with Ms. Powell Jobs. She said she now sees it was about teaching her that money can corrupt.The ethos \u201cfelt true and kind of beautiful and kind of enlightened for somebody like that,\u201d she said. Still, the question was \u201cwhy he would have taken that value system and applied it so severely to me.\u201d\u201cYou can have a value system and be unable to totally live it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you can imagine being that rich and famous and how amazing it is if you can hold on to some of your value system. He didn\u2019t do it right. He didn\u2019t apply it evenly. But I feel grateful for it.\u201dMs. Brennan-Jobs told me she likes toying with the strange power of being a memoirist writing about trauma because the reader knows she made it out O.K. She is here in the privileged position of writing this book, after all. And as a memoirist, even a reluctant one, she gets the final word.One night toward the end of Mr. Jobs\u2019s life \u2014 and the end of the book \u2014 he is watching \u201cLaw and Order\u201d in bed.\u201c\u2018Are you going to write about me?\u2019\u201d he asks her.She tells him no.\u201c\u2018Good,\u2019 he says, and turns back to the television.\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly described an Emerson Collective investment. It holds a majority stake in the Atlantic magazine, not Atlantic Media.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Company Keeps Lies About Sandy Hook on the Web", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLeonard Pozner says he spends hours every day trying to erase online conspiracy theories that the death of his 6-year-old son Noah at the Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax.But the bulk of his work is more methodical. Sandy Hook conspiracies are strewn around the internet on various platforms, each with its own opaque rules and reporting mechanisms. So Mr. Pozner has studiously flagged countless videos and posts for a wide variety of offenses \u2014 invasions of privacy, threats and harassment, and copyright infringement \u2014 prompting Facebook, Amazon and Google to remove false material about his son.Twitter has been less receptive to his claims and some smaller sites have simply not responded at all. But one company, Mr. Pozner says, has actively pushed back against his attempts.WordPress.com, one the internet\u2019s biggest blogging platforms, is operated by a company called Automattic, which also runs a wide array of smaller sites and internet services. Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists have been able to remain on WordPress.com thanks, in part, to policies put in place to resist previous campaigns to get content removed from its service, particularly through the strategic use of copyright claims.These debates have put tech companies into a sort of existential crisis. But for Mr. Pozner and others like him, the arguments have long been much more personal, as they struggle with images of family members being repurposed in horrifying new ways and experience harassment themselves because of misinformation online.\u201cThe only items that concern me is when his image is being used in a negative, ugly way \u2014 denying the tragedy, calling him a crisis actor and everything else that the typical global village idiot on the net does,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.In the absence of uniform online policies about hoaxes, Mr. Pozner\u2019s most effective tool has been filing copyright claims on images of Noah. He has filed such claims with Automattic about photos of Noah appearing on posts that labeled him a \u201ccrisis actor\u201d who had been spotted in Pakistan after Sandy Hook and others that claimed he was a \u201cfiction\u201d and that photos of him were created using images of his older half brother.Automattic has repeatedly responded to Mr. Pozner with form letters saying \u201cbecause we believe this to be fair use of the material, we will not be removing it at this time.\u201d The letters explain that fair use could include \u201ccriticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.\u201d They also warn that the company could collect damages from people who \u201cknowingly materially misrepresent\u201d copyrights.\u201cThe responses from their support people are very automated, very generic, very cold and there\u2019s just no getting through to them,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.\u201cThey have taken this incorrect interpretation of freedom of speech to an extreme,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only thing WordPress has taken out \u2014 and where I\u2019ve been successful \u2014 is if someone posts personal information like my driver\u2019s license or address.\u201dAutomattic said that the responses Mr. Pozner received were \u201ca predefined statement\u201d that is used in copyright situations. \u201cWe regret that it was used in this situation,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe offer our apologies to the family for the response we gave to them.\u201dMr. Pozner\u2019s complaints appear to have been thwarted in part by longtime policies at Automattic intended to prevent the use of copyright claims to censor criticism and journalism on its platform. The responses sent to Mr. Pozner included a link to a post from 2013 describing the company\u2019s efforts to deal with spurious but effective copyright claims. The post also highlighted that the company had filed suit against two particularly egregious offenders in an effort to \u201cfight back\u201d on behalf of people who were posting material on the platform.Online platforms are not held liable for copyright infringement claims against people who use their platforms as long as they remove or block access to content in response to the claims. This is crucial to the function of any website where people can post content, and internet companies have traditionally tended to err on the side of removal, even when claims may be dubious. This has created opportunities for abuse, and Automattic has made fighting that a corporate cause.\u201cThey avoid getting involved because fair-use determinations are notoriously complex and fact specific,\u201d Mr. Rubin said of online platforms. \u201cPlatforms would rather eliminate their own potential liability by taking the content down and leaving it to the parties to battle amongst themselves in court.\u201dIn the case of Mr. Pozner, however, Automattic suggested that its approach was imperfect. \u201cWhile our policies have many benefits to free expression for those who use our platform, our system like many others that operate at large scale, is not ideal for getting to the deeper context of a given request,\u201d the company said in a statement.Although the posts reported by Mr. Pozner \u201dare not violating any current user guidelines, or copyright law,\u201d the company said, \u201cthe pain that the family has suffered is very real and if tied to the contents of sites we host, we want to have policies to address that.\u201dHe has removed photos of Noah from Facebook by relying on policies that protect the privacy of children under 13, a process that has required him to send the company his driver\u2019s license and a copy of his son\u2019s birth certificate. Mr. Pozner has also successfully filed such reports with Google.\u201cYou can\u2019t even measure the volume of content I\u2019ve taken down at this point,\u201d Mr. Pozner said.At times, he has been able to explain the abuse he and his family have received, some of it because of his efforts to purge Sandy Hook conspiracies from the internet, and seek removals based on a slowly evolving awareness in the tech community about the issue. (In June of last year, a 57-year-old woman in Florida was sentenced to five months in prison for making death threats against Mr. Pozner and his family.)A report to Vimeo led to a response on Friday from a representative who said he would assign the case to a specialist, but first told Mr. Pozner that he was sorry to hear about his situation.\u201cEveryone has gotten better this year, especially with all the work that I\u2019ve done to shame a lot of these platforms for continuing to abuse us and the memory of our children and just all of the ugliness that goes on,\u201d Mr. Pozner said. \u201cIf you type in Noah Pozner now into an image search on Google, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s mostly normal results but it used to be 99 percent hateful angry memes, so the cleanup is huge.\u201dMr. Pozner said he was tired of hearing technology companies say that they do not want to be \u201carbiters of truth,\u201d an oft-repeated refrain, particularly as concerns around misinformation on social media grow.\u201cTechnology platforms have had this misguided, futuristic vision of freedom of speech and everything was built around that, but it doesn\u2019t really fit into the day-to-day use of it,\u201d Mr. Pozner said. \u201cBy not taking action, they have made a choice. They are the arbiters of truth by doing nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "More Than Cutting Costs: Travel Managers Now Consider Employee Comfort", "Date": "2018-08-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byItinerariesCorporate managers used to focus on one thing when it came to employee travel: saving money.But now, given the nature of travel \u2014 crowded planes, tighter seats, security hassles \u2014 corporate managers are considering employee comfort as part of the deal.Aside from seat comfort, meal service and faster Wi-Fi, there isn\u2019t much room to innovate the offerings inside the aircraft, Mr. Sheivachman said. But beyond the plane, airlines can offer perks like matching frequent-flier status earned on another airline and offering access to airport lounges, early boarding, seat upgrades and priority help with requests like midtrip ticket changes.\u201cIf you are sending someone around the world and they aren\u2019t well taken care of, that reflects badly on the company and the corporate culture,\u201d Mr. Sheivachman said.These are more than V.I.P. perks, said Mary Huddleston Tabacchi, professor emerita at Cornell University\u2019s School of Hotel Administration. \u201cIdeally, a corporate flier needs to arrive well rested to do business for their employer.\u201dThe perks do have costs, so it\u2019s up to the corporate travel managers to establish policies determining who receives the benefits. \u201cIt might be the executives, it might be the road warriors who travel the most, and it might be travelers in the divisions that bring in the most money,\u201d Mr. Sabby said.Direct nonstop travel, minimizing total trip time, is as important as any perk, Mr. Landson said. Before Southwest started operating flights from the Cincinnati airport in June 2017, it spoke with travel managers from several Fortune 500 companies in the area, as well as other businesses to learn when and where their employees traveled most.There\u2019s untapped potential in helping corporations of all sizes improve their travel, Mr. Landson said. California, for example, has thousands of companies whose employees want to make day trips within the state and get back home that night. Southwest takes those factors into account when planning its flights, he said.Alaska Airlines has had a special check-in line for Microsoft employees at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for three years and added a lane for Amazon employees in the last few months.\u201cAirlines are more interested in being creative and entertaining unique requests,\u201d Mr. Sabby said. An airline, for example, might offer more intrastate upgrades for fliers in a competitive marketplace like Los Angeles.While the tool was intended for companies to use directly, \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen an increase in interest in this tool from travel management companies and consultants to use with their clients,\u201d said Elizabeth West, editor in chief of Business Travel News.The focus on cost savings ebbs and flows, largely with the strength of the economy, Ms. West said, but there is value in having happy, productive business travelers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tech Industry Pursues a Federal Privacy Law, on Its Own Terms", "Date": "2018-08-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow top tech companies are going on the offensive.In recent months, Facebook, Google, IBM, Microsoft and others have aggressively lobbied officials in the Trump administration and elsewhere to start outlining a federal privacy law, according to administration officials and the companies. The law would have a dual purpose, they said: It would overrule the California law and instead put into place a kinder set of rules that would give the companies wide leeway over how personal digital information was handled.\u201cWe are committed to being part of the process and a constructive part of the process,\u201d said Dean Garfield, president of a leading tech industry lobbying group, the Information Technology Industry Council, which is working on proposals for the federal law. \u201cThe best way is to work toward developing our own blueprint.\u201dThe efforts could set up a big fight with consumer and privacy groups, especially as companies like Facebook face scrutiny for mishandling users\u2019 personal data. Many of the internet companies depend on the collection and analysis of such data to help them target the online ads that generate the bulk of their revenue.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the strategy here is to neuter California for something much weaker on the federal level,\u201d said Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cThe companies are afraid of California because it sets the bar for other states.\u201dIn the United States, tech companies\u2019 efforts to fight privacy regulations gained momentum in late spring, as it became clear that the California proposal might become law.At a board meeting for the Information Technology Industry Council in May, Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s top lobbyist, warned that an early proposal for privacy in California posed a threat to the industry and that the trade group needed to make the issue of privacy a priority, according to two people briefed on the meeting, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Until that moment, there had been a split in the tech industry about privacy rules. Companies like IBM and Salesforce, which sell data storage and software to other businesses, were more willing to accept consumer privacy laws, IBM and other members of the Information Technology Industry Council said. Social media and other companies that relied primarily on advertising for revenue, like Facebook and Google, were adamant that the industry should fight all rules.But at that meeting, it became clear that Facebook and Google had softened their resistance to a federal privacy law, as long as they were deeply involved in writing the rules.\u201cThere has been a complete shift on privacy,\u201d said Chris Padilla, vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. \u201cThere is now broad recognition that companies that were resistant to privacy rules can no longer just say no.\u201dGoogle said it seemed inevitable that privacy rules would come to the United States.\u201cThere are renewed efforts to define the privacy legislative frameworks of the future, and we look forward to working with policymakers around the world to move the process forward,\u201d Google said in a statement.Many of the companies also recognized that it was a good time to press ahead with a federal privacy law since Trump administration officials have expressed openness to a business-friendly approach to such rules.David Redl, the head of a division of the Commerce Department that is leading the agency\u2019s privacy efforts, said in a July speech that the administration\u2019s \u201ccommitment to prosperity will be our guide.\u201d\u201cWe also know that industry is looking to the administration to demonstrate leadership on this issue,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re rightfully concerned about the potential for a fractured and stifling regulatory landscape.\u201dLindsay Walters, White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement that the administration aimed to work with Congress on legislation \u201cthat is the appropriate balance between privacy and prosperity.\u201dThe administration said it intended to have an outline of potential rules by the end of the year. But the timeline could easily be pushed back, as numerous agencies may be involved, including the Commerce Department, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Institute for Standards and Technology.In a sign of the latitude that a federal privacy law might give tech companies, at least three trade groups \u2014 the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Internet Association, and the Information Technology Industry Council \u2014 are planning to push for voluntary standards instead of legal mandates that carry steep penalties for violations.In exchange for volunteering to follow certain guidelines on what kind of information they collect and share about users, the groups said, they would insist that the federal statute nullify California\u2019s rules.That position has outraged privacy advocates.\u201cThe idea that the companies that violated our privacy for more than a decade will suddenly have a self-regulatory blueprint is ridiculous,\u201d said Jim Steyer, president of Common Sense Media, a privacy and children\u2019s advocacy group that supported the California law.Privacy advocates said tech companies were pushing to undercut the California privacy law in other ways. Although passed in June, the law stipulates that lawmakers can pursue technical changes in its language until the end of this month. It is scheduled to take effect in January 2020.Any changes are supposed to be minor, but tech lobbyists and privacy groups continue to swarm the offices of the legislators behind the law, their aides said. Consumer privacy groups, which have been pushing lawmakers to leave the law virtually untouched, fear the companies are trying to soften protections.This month, the California Chamber of Commerce and other business and tech groups sent 19 pages of edits to the law to State Senator Bill Dodd, one of the bill\u2019s authors. They criticized language, such as the law\u2019s definition of personal information, that they said would apply to too many people or websites.In the letter, the groups said California\u2019s attorney general, Xavier Becerra, would need more time to figure out how to enforce the rules and asked to delay enactment for one year. The business groups argued that the law could hurt a typical consumer.\u201cUnless the law is clarified, he or she might also inadvertently be deprived of special discounts and promotions,\u201d the letter said.In a rebuttal letter to Mr. Dodd, several consumer privacy groups called for him and other California lawmakers to keep any changes to a minimum, saying the tech industry\u2019s moves were \u201cexcessive in nature.\u201d\u201cThe sky is not falling, as industry suggests,\u201d the groups said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the trade group that is among those pushing for voluntary standards, instead of legal mandates, when it comes to the privacy of personal information online. It is the Information Technology Industry Council, not the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Saudi Arabia\u2019s Deep Pockets May Need a Top-Up", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe kingdom has poured money from its $250 billion Public Investment Fund into the SoftBank Vision Fund, Blackstone\u2019s infrastructure fund, Uber, and Tesla shares at the behest of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Prince Mohammed, 32, and his advisers are now upending government processes in place for decades as they scramble for other sources of funding to boost its firepower, according to people familiar with the kingdom\u2019s reform plans. \u201cThe P.I.F. has made big commitments so it needs to come up with the cash,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School of Economics and a Middle East expert. \u201cBut it is seen as opaque, a black box. Few know what\u2019s going on there, including sometimes other government ministries.\u201dThe bigger question is whether Prince Mohammed will need to curb his economic ambitions. He wants to create a $500 billion megacity, and he\u2019s waging a trade war with Canada. If his kingdom is facing financial constraints, he may need to take a humbler approach.Tribune cited \u201cunnecessarily aggressive and protracted negotiations\u201d with government regulators. The F.C.C. \u2014 which had passed policies widely seen as favorable to Sinclair \u2014 raised serious concerns last month about the deal.Tribune should have few problems finding a new buyer. But Sinclair\u2019s route to national TV dominance will take more searching.At issue is whether Mr. Musk has solid financial backing for a buyout. If not, he could be in trouble for manipulating the carmaker\u2019s stock price.

The World Bank says it could \u201chelp simplify raising capital and trading securities; improve operational efficiencies; and enhance regulatory oversight.\u201d But it\u2019s unclear how big the bond offering will be, which means this could be more experiment than breakthrough.Owning more than 8 percent of the company\u2019s stock, the two argue that Campbell has struggled to diversify its products as customers flock to healthier offerings, and that the company should be sold.Here\u2019s one suggestion:All countries should tax both property and inheritance more. These taxes are unpopular but mostly efficient. In a world where property ownership brings windfalls that persist across generations, such taxes are desirable. A conservative first step would be to roll back recent cuts to inheritance tax. A more radical approach would be to introduce a land-value tax, the most efficient of all property taxes and one with a long liberal heritage.And a second:To stop companies shifting profits, governments should switch their focus from firms to investors. Profits ultimately flow to shareholders as dividends and buybacks.

{"Headline": "Judge Upholds Order for Trump Administration to Restore DACA", "Date": "2018-08-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration announced late last year that it would phase out the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which protects undocumented young adults from deportation and grants them two-year renewable work permits. The administration argued that President Barack Obama had overstepped his authority and circumvented Congress when he created the program in 2012.The decision to end the program has faced numerous legal challenges. Currently, the government must continue accepting applications to renew DACA status, if not new applications from those who meet the criteria to qualify. DACA recipients \u2014 often called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 typically were brought to the United States illegally as children through no choice of their own.Judge Bates ruled in late April that the administration must restore the DACA program and accept new applications. He had stayed his decision for 90 days to give the Department of Homeland Security, which runs the program, the opportunity to lay out its reasons for ending it.Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, responded last month, arguing that DACA would likely be found unconstitutional in the Texas case and therefore must end. She relied heavily on the memorandum that her predecessor, Elaine C. Duke, had issued to rescind the program and said that the department had the discretion to end the program, just as the department under Mr. Obama had exercised discretion to create it.Judge Bates, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, did not agree. He called the shutdown of the program \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and said that Secretary Nielsen\u2019s response \u201cfails to elaborate meaningfully on the agency\u2019s primary rationale for its decision.\u201dTwo federal judges, in Brooklyn and in San Francisco, issued injunctions this year ordering the government to keep the program. But neither of those rulings required that the government accept new applications, as the ruling by Judge Bates does. The earlier decisions are pending before appeals courts.Meanwhile, the State of Texas and several other plaintiffs have sued the government to rescind the program, contending that it is illegal.The District of Columbia lawsuit was brought by the N.A.A.C.P., Microsoft and Princeton University. The DACA program has broad bipartisan support in the business and academic worlds.Christopher L. Eisgruber, the president of Princeton, hailed the court\u2019s decision. \u201cPrinceton University\u2019s continued success as a world-class institution of learning and research depends on our ability to attract talent from all backgrounds, including Dreamers,\u201d he said. Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said that finding a solution for DACA \u201chas become an economic imperative and a humanitarian necessity.\u201dSince the 2016 presidential campaign, the young people who benefited from DACA have seen their hopes alternately elevated and dashed, sometimes in the space of a week. Neither a flurry of court decisions nor horse-trading in Congress has settled the issue.In a statement on Friday, United We Dream, an organization that represents Dreamers, offered a sobering assessment: \u201cThe situation for DACA beneficiaries remains dangerous and unstable, as we do not know how the administration will respond, and there are other court cases in progress.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "New Russian Hacking Targeted Republican Groups, Microsoft Says", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 The Russian military intelligence unit that sought to influence the 2016 election appears to have a new target: conservative American think tanks that have broken with President Trump and are seeking continued sanctions against Moscow, exposing oligarchs or pressing for human rights.In a report scheduled for release on Tuesday, Microsoft Corporation said that it detected and seized websites that were created in recent weeks by hackers linked to the Russian unit formerly known as the G.R.U. The sites appeared meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute, but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials.Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate, but not specific Senate offices or political campaigns.The shift to attacking conservative think tanks underscores the Russian intelligence agency\u2019s goals: to disrupt any institutions challenging Moscow and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\u201cWe are now seeing another uptick in attacks. What is particular in this instance is the broadening of the type of websites they are going after,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, said Monday in an interview.\u201cThese are organizations that are informally tied to Republicans,\u201d he said, \u201cso we see them broadening beyond the sites they have targeted in the past.\u201d\u201cThis is another demonstration of the fact that the Russians aren\u2019t really pursuing partisan attacks, they are pursuing attacks that they perceive in their own national self-interest,\u201d said Eric Rosenbach, the director of the Defending Digital Democracy project at Harvard University, on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s about disrupting and diminishing any group that challenges how Putin\u2019s Russia is operating at home and around the world.\u201dThe State Department has traditionally helped fund both Republican and Democratic groups that engage in promoting democracy.\u201cIt is clearly designed to sow confusion, conflict and fear among those who criticize Mr. Putin\u2019s authoritarian regime,\u201d Mr. Twining said in a statement.The goal of the Russian hacking attempt was unclear, and Microsoft was able to catch the spoofed websites as they were set up.But Mr. Smith said that \u201cthese attempts are the newest security threats to groups connected with both American political parties\u201d ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\u201cThese attacks are seeking to disrupt and divide,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an asymmetric risk here for democratic societies. The kind of attacks we see from authoritarian regimes are seeking to fracture and splinter groups in our society.\u201dOn Sunday, the current national security adviser, John R. Bolton, suggested that Russia was not the only threat in the fall elections. He also named China, Iran and North Korea \u2014 the other most active cyberoperators among state adversaries \u2014 as threats.But so far Microsoft and other firms have not found extensive election-related actions by those nations.Senior United States intelligence officials have also warned that the midterm elections will be targeted by foreign governments looking to influence American voters.Speaking last month at the Aspen Security Forum, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said that his agency was seeing information operations \u201caimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in the country.\u201dThe attempt revealed by Microsoft mirrored efforts by Russian state-backed hackers before the 2016 presidential election.A single letter, or even a punctuation mark, was often the only difference between the real and fake websites.The fake websites were used as the conduit for a number of attacks, including persuading victims to download harmful malware or to reveal passwords and other personal information. But for the past year, Microsoft has grown increasingly aggressive in countering them.In 2016, a federal judge in Virginia agreed that the group Microsoft calls \u201cStrontium\u201d and others call \u201cAPT 28,\u201d for \u201cadvanced persistent threat,\u201d would continue its attacks. The judge appointed a \u201cspecial master\u201d with the power to authorize Microsoft to seize fake websites as soon as they are registered. As a result, the hackers have lost control of many of the sites only days after creating them.But it is a constant cat-and-mouse game, as the Russian hackers seek new vectors of attack while Microsoft and others seek to cut them off.\u201cThese attacks keep happening because they work. They are successful again and again,\u201d said Thomas Rid, a professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University, who doubts whether anyone can stay ahead of the hackers.\u201cMicrosoft is playing whack-a-mole here,\u201d Mr. Rid said. \u201cThese sites are easy to register and bring back up, and so they will keep doing so.\u201dLast month, Microsoft announced that it had detected and helped block similar attacks against two senators who are up for re-election. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who faces one of the toughest political challenges this year, acknowledged that her campaign was among them after months of keeping the news quiet \u2014 apparently to avoid alienating voters who doubt the Russian role in election interference.Microsoft says it is expanding its effort to help political candidates counter foreign influence. It is starting an initiative it calls \u201cAccountGuard\u201d to bolster protections to candidates and campaign offices at the federal, state and local level, as well as think tanks and political organizations.With the midterms less than three months away, Microsoft said greater cooperation was needed between tech companies and the federal government over efforts to interfere in the American elections.\u201cOver the last year, the larger tech companies, in particular, have put into place stronger information-sharing practices where we have seen these threats emerge,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cThose agreements, however, are informal.\u201dDavid E. Sanger reported from Boston, and Sheera Frenkel from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facing New Russian Hacking, Senators Signal They Are Ready to Act", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd in three separate hearings on Capitol Hill, senators prodded the Trump administration to do more with its existing authorities to deter Russia and protect the United States\u2019 political infrastructure.\u201cCongress is going to act; you might as well know that,\u201d Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, predicted in a meeting of the Banking Committee, which oversees sanctions law. \u201cI\u2019d rather it act in a way that has your insights about what would be helpful, but if you fail to provide insights then we will provide you with a law that ultimately takes place without your insights.\u201dBut administration officials argued that the current sanctions regime provided all the authority they needed, and they dismissed concerns that President Trump\u2019s equivocation on questions of Russian interference had harmed their efforts.\u201cIf you look at the wide range of activities that this administration has undertaken under the direction of the president, including the very significant sanctions that we have been able to launch, including the expulsion of 60 Russians out of our country, including the closing of Russian entities in the United States, what Russia sees is a United States that is very aggressively targeting malign activity,\u201d Sigal P. Mandelker, a senior Treasury Department official, told the Banking Committee.The senators\u2019 pleas took on more urgency after Microsoft Corporation revealed on Monday that it had detected and seized websites that were created in recent weeks by hackers linked to the Russian military intelligence unit formerly known as the G.R.U. The sites appeared meant to trick people into thinking they were clicking through links managed by the conservative Hudson Institute and the International Republican Institute, but were secretly redirected to web pages created by the hackers to steal passwords and other credentials.Both institutions have taken aim at Russian corruption, and on Tuesday the Hudson Institute said in a statement that was not the first time an authoritarian government had targeted its work, nor did it expect it to be the last. Microsoft also found websites imitating the United States Senate, but not specific offices or political campaigns.\u201cTo Republicans, if you think the Russians don\u2019t have you in mind, you are making a great mistake,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said as he led a hearing of the Judiciary subcommittee focused on election security. \u201cThey are trying to undermine the democratic process.\u201dBut senators were skeptical of the administration\u2019s actions. They questioned the effectiveness of sanctions passed overwhelmingly last year to target Russia\u2019s defense and intelligence sectors, and tried to solicit input from the officials on how to proceed. And with the latest targets being conservative groups, concern could spread.Mr. Graham said efforts to deter Russia had clearly fallen short and called on party leaders to move quickly.Even Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said he was \u201cpersonally very interested\u201d in additional bipartisan sanctions legislation, but he cautioned that there may not be time to fully consider it before the election.\u201cThe chances of sandwiching that in, honestly, in the month of September with all the other items we have swirling around, is probably pretty slim, but we will be here longer this year,\u201d Mr. McConnell told reporters. \u201cIt would be high on the list for consideration for floor time.\u201dThe report from Microsoft sharpened the warnings. It said that the company had identified and shut down several websites linked to a Russian military intelligence unit that set out to influence the 2016 American elections.Amid those warnings and the fallout from Mr. Trump\u2019s July summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, senators from both parties have been anxiously debating how to raise the pressure on Moscow.Two approaches dominate the discussion.Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, have drafted legislation to deter Russia from further interference, putting the Kremlin on notice that the United States will enact broad economic sanctions if it does not stand down before the November elections.The competing bill, written by Mr. Menendez and Mr. Graham, would seek to immediately drop a package of what they call \u201ccrushing\u201d new punishments on the country for actions already underway.The Banking Committee appeared ready to sort through the differences.\u201cIt\u2019s not often that Congress acts together in such a strong manner, as marked by such near-unanimous votes\u201d last year, said Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, the committee\u2019s chairman. \u201cBut then, Russia is a menace on so many different levels today that Congress can be compelled to act with a single voice to find solutions that will protect America and democratic values across the world.\u201dSenator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, was more forceful, calling the latest denial by the Kremlin \u201cnonsense\u201d and insisting that Mr. Trump do the same.\u201cOur government \u2014 the president and Congress together \u2014 must right now send a more powerful and direct message to Putin and those within his circles: We know what you\u2019re doing, it must stop and if you continue, you and your government will pay a dear price,\u201d he said.The hearings were combative at times, with senators venting that administration officials were dodging simple questions.\u201cOne of the things I thought would come from this hearing is a recommendation or a set of recommendations of what Congress might consider legislatively for additional sanctions,\u201d Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, said at the Banking Committee hearing. \u201cAm I to take from your unwillingness to answer that kind of question that there is opposition by the administration to additional sanctions?\u201dMs. Mandelker would not give a straight answer, repeatedly telling senators that the Treasury Department had the authority it needed.In the Foreign Relations Committee, senators were clearly frustrated with what they said was a lack of progress in curbing Russian behavior.\u201cWhy, given all the things we are doing, are we not making better progress?\u201d asked Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio. \u201cI think sanctions are necessary,\u201d he continued, but \u201cit\u2019s obviously not working the way we\u2019d like. What would be more effective?\u201dA. Wess Mitchell, an assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, replied that \u201cthe chilling effect on the Russian economy has been significant and measurable.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Beginning of a Wave\u2019: A.I. Tiptoes Into the Workplace", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is no shortage of predictions about how artificial intelligence is going to reshape where, how and if people work in the future.But the grand work-changing projects of A.I., like self-driving cars and humanoid robots, are not yet commercial products. A more humble version of the technology, instead, is making its presence felt in a less glamorous place: the back office.New software is automating mundane office tasks in operations like accounting, billing, payments and customer service. The programs can scan documents, enter numbers into spreadsheets, check the accuracy of customer records and make payments with a few automated computer keystrokes.The technology is still in its infancy, but it will get better, learning as it goes. So far, often in pilot projects focused on menial tasks, artificial intelligence is freeing workers from drudgery far more often than it is eliminating jobs.But all the signs point to much more to come. Big tech companies like IBM, Oracle and Microsoft are starting to enter the business, often in partnership with robotic automation start-ups. Two of the leading start-ups, UiPath and Automation Anywhere, are already valued at more than $1 billion. The market for the robotlike software will nearly triple by 2021, by one forecast.\u201cThis is the beginning of a wave of A.I. technologies that will proliferate across the economy in the next decade,\u201d said Rich Wong, a general partner at Accel, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and an investor in UiPath.The emerging field has a klutzy name, \u201crobotic process automation.\u201d The programs \u2014 often called bots \u2014 fit into the broad definition of artificial intelligence because they use ingredients of A.I. technology, like computer vision, to do simple chores.For many businesses, that is plenty. Nearly 60 percent of the companies with more than $1 billion in revenue have at least pilot programs underway using robotic automation, according to research from McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.The companies and government agencies that have begun enlisting the automation software run the gamut. They include General Motors, BMW, General Electric, Unilever, Mastercard, Manpower, FedEx, Cisco, Google, the Defense Department and NASA.Holly Uhl, a technology manager who leads the automation program, estimated that within two years the company\u2019s bot population would double to 60 and its hours saved would perhaps triple to 75,000, nearly all in year-after-year savings rather than one-time projects.Cutting jobs, Ms. Uhl said, is not the plan. The goal for the company, whose insurance offerings include auto, commercial and workers\u2019 compensation, is to increase productivity and State Auto\u2019s revenue with limited additions to its head count, she said.Ms. Uhl said her message to workers is: \u201cWe\u2019re here to partner with you to find those tasks that drive you crazy.\u201dRebekah Moore, a premium auditor at the company, had one in mind. Premium auditors scrutinize insurance policies and make recommendations for changing rates. They audit less than half of the policies, Ms. Moore said.The policies that will not be audited then have to be set aside and documented. That step, she explained, is a routine data-entry task that involves fiddling with two computer programs, plugging in codes and navigating drop-down menus. It takes a minute or two. But because auditors handle many thousands of policies, the time adds up, to about an hour a day, she estimated.Starting in May, a bot took over that chore. \u201cNo one misses that work,\u201d Ms. Moore said.Is she worried about the bots climbing up the task ladder to someday replace her? Not at all, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find things to do with our time, higher-value work,\u201d said Ms. Moore, 37.On State Auto\u2019s current path, her confidence seems justified. If the company hits its target of 75,000 hours in savings by 2020, that would be the equivalent of fewer than 40 full-time workers, compared with State Auto\u2019s work force of 1,900. The company plans to grow in the next two years. If so, State Auto would most likely be hiring a few dozen people fewer than it would otherwise.Automation companies are eager to promote the bots as helpful assistants instead of job killers. The technology, they say, will get smarter and more useful, liberating workers rather than replacing them.\u201cThe long-term vision is to have one bot for every employee,\u201d said Bobby Patrick, chief market officer for UiPath. The company, which is based in New York, recently reported that its revenue more than tripled in the first half of 2018, to a yearly rate of more than $100 million.Mihir Shukla, chief executive of Automation Anywhere, refers to his company\u2019s bots as \u201cdigital colleagues.\u201d In July, the company announced it had raised a $250 million round of venture funding, valuing the company at $1.8 billion.The market for A.I.-enhanced software automation is poised for rapid growth, but that expansion, analysts say, will ultimately bring job losses.Forrester Research estimated that revenue would nearly triple to $2.9 billion over the next three years. And by 2021, robotic automation technology will be doing the equivalent work of nearly 4.3 million humans worldwide, Forrester predicted.In a dynamic global labor market, that is not a clear-cut forecast of 4.3 million layoffs. The bots may do work not previously done by humans, and people may move onto new jobs.\u201cBut these initial bots will get better, and the task harvesting will accelerate,\u201d said Craig Le Clair, an analyst for Forrester. \u201cFor workers, there will be a mix of automation dividends and pain.\u201dThe recent research has examined jobs as bundles of tasks, some of which seem ripe for replacement and others not. So the technology\u2019s immediate impact will resemble the experience to date with robotic software, changing work more than destroying jobs.For Ms. Uhl of State Auto, the most persistent pushback has come not at the company but at home, from her two young sons, Christian, 9, and Elijah, 7, who are eager to glimpse the future.Hearing their mother talk about robots at work, they keep asking her to bring one home. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of robot you can see,\u201d Ms. Uhl said she has told her disappointed sons.Advertisement"}

The total was $40 million higher than that of last August, thanks to an additional 183 cars, but the average price of $436,982 represented growth of 1 percent, according to the data.\u201cIt\u2019s a strong collectors\u2019 market, and they\u2019re an astute crowd,\u201d Mr. Hagerty said.The market was certainly perceived as strong enough for owners to part with some exceptional cars, mainly at RM Sotheby\u2019s and Gooding, both of which held two-day auctions.The 250 GTO sold by RM Sotheby\u2019s was not as valuable: It is one of seven with the less-coveted \u201cSeries II\u201d body shape, and it has a less prestigious racing history. The car was owned by Greg Whitten, the former chief software architect at Microsoft, who bought the car in 2000 for $7 million.Mr. Whitten had been guaranteed an undisclosed minimum price by RM Sotheby\u2019s. That financial mechanism, usually supported by a third party, is often used at high-end contemporary art sales, where it can dampen bidding. After a flurry of activity on the telephones, the Ferrari sold for $48.4 million with fees, just above the low estimate of $45 million, based on hammer prices. \u201cProspective buyers bid beyond the guarantee,\u201d Meghan McGrail, a spokeswoman for the auction house, said in an email, without providing further details.At least five bidders pushed the price far beyond the low estimate of $10 million, to $22 million with fees \u2014 a high for any American automobile at auction. The price, given by an American collector, momentarily confounded market perceptions that prewar cars had fallen out of fashion.\u201cIt was the first \u2018masterpiece\u2019 quality prewar car to have come on the market for some time,\u201d said David Gooding, chief executive and founder of the auction house. \u201cIt shows you that if you can offer something completely fresh to the market at a reasonable estimate, you can still create auction magic.\u201dMr. Kidston, who negotiated private sales of two Ferrari 250 GTOs for undisclosed prices within the past year, wrote in a recent magazine article that the demographic of the classic car market was \u201cprimarily white, middle-aged, male and conservative.\u201dHow long can such a clientele sustain heady prices for classics that often mean much less to a younger, more environmentally conscious generation?\u201cDemographics will be the biggest factor of change in the car collecting market,\u201d Mr. Kidston said. \u201cFor the younger generation, cars of the \u201960s and \u201970s have become old masters. The best of the best will still appreciate, but will people still want to buy a two-plus-two E-Type?\u201dMaybe they will, if it converts to electric.Advertisement"}

What makes you say that?Obviously that is a relative term for anyone who works in digital media in 2018. I have an iPhone in my pocket almost all my waking hours, and spend an enormous proportion of my time, both at work and at home, looking at a screen.So I do most of my writing in Microsoft Word, the same program I used for term papers in high school. I got an iPhone a few years after everybody else because I liked my old BlackBerry so much.I also favor using different devices for different purposes, which I realize is a little old-school. When I record an interview, I bring a little Olympus digital recorder instead of using an app on my phone. I\u2019ve been using those digital recorders for my whole career and know exactly how it works \u2014 and I know it won\u2019t get messed up if somebody calls me in the middle of the interview.For the same reason, I keep a laptop in the living room for piddling around, a desktop computer in my home office for doing serious work and a Kindle for reading books. It\u2019s a bit of a psychological trick: My brain knows that each device is for a different purpose.What is your theory behind this Luddism?I think most digital technology is more mature than we think. People have been using personal computers since the 1980s, and smartphones for more than a decade. And the thing about a mature product is that improvements tend to be marginal rather than transformational.So if you go to a hardware store and pick up a hammer, it probably has a better grip and is made of a stronger material than it would have been 10 years ago, but it\u2019s still basically the same hammer. The improvements aren\u2019t enough that you would buy a new one just to upgrade \u2014 you\u2019d wait until your old one broke or got lost. I think more technology products than many tech people would like to admit are at or approaching that phase of maturity.Economics is a topic full of data. What tools do you use to parse that data? And what sites or apps do you use to keep on top of the latest economic trends?A big part of the advantage is simply that once you\u2019re familiar with the interface, which is intuitive, you don\u2019t have to relearn the data retrieval tool for each statistical agency every time. So, for example, I write about the European economy only now and again, so I have to relearn how to use the Eurostat database every time if the data isn\u2019t in Fred. That\u2019s not for the faint of heart.I generally use Microsoft Excel for data analysis, which is powerful enough to do most of the stuff I know how to do on my own. That\u2019s to say, if a project requires a bigger data set or more complex statistical techniques than Excel can handle, I probably will need help from a colleague with more advanced programming skills anyway.Or for a quick calculation of, say, percentage change I use a Texas Instruments scientific calculator I keep on my desk (see previous discussion of separate devices for separate purposes).What tech do you use a lot at home that you don\u2019t use at work?I use a Bose SoundTouch 30 speaker to play music via Pandora when I\u2019m around the house. I basically listen only to a single station that is built around songs I liked when I first set the system up seven or eight years ago.My wife makes fun of me for that, too.
