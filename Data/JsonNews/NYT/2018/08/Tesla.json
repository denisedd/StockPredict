Funding secured.Add it all together, and it appears that an investigation has the potential to move down a number of paths. The question is how this might play out for Tesla and Mr. Musk.A formal investigation does not mean a case will be filed. It does indicate that the S.E.C. is committing resources, and investigations tend to take on lives of their own. Where they end is not always where they started heading, especially when there is a thorough review of corporate records.Rule 10b-5 prohibits any scheme to defraud, which includes misstatements or omissions of material information that affect the market value of shares. Given how erratic Tesla\u2019s stock has been, and how it responded so quickly to Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, showing that the information was material and might have harmed investors if it was misleading does not appear to be difficult.One possible defense to a potential fraud charge would be that Mr. Musk reasonably believed there was sufficient financing at the time he posted the statement.But there are hurdles to that defense. The S.E.C. would need to prove only that Mr. Musk\u2019s actions had been reckless, defined as a significant departure from the proper standards of business conduct. Evidence that Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund or the private equity firm Silver Lake had reservations about financing a deal, or that the discussions were still continuing, may be enough to show recklessness.It is a difficult violation to prove. It requires the S.E.C. to show that the person acted with that specific purpose. Making a case based only on a single tweet would be a challenge even though the statement drove up Tesla\u2019s stock. Mr. Musk could offer a more innocent explanation, such as he was merely jumping the gun to reveal his desire to take the company private.This tack has advantages for Mr. Musk, Tesla and the S.E.C. It requires showing only that the issuing of corporate information was mistaken or at least inartful. It would not jeopardize the company\u2019s ability to issue shares, because it is a claim only of negligence, not of fraud, and the S.E.C. appears to have stopped requiring companies and individuals to admit culpability as part of a settlement, so a resolution under this provision would not affect private litigation.If serious consideration is being given to taking Tesla private, the company and Mr. Musk have an incentive to reach a resolution with the S.E.C. as quickly as possible. The firms that might help fund a deal may be hesitant to commit financing if the cloud of an S.E.C. investigation is hanging over Tesla. But resolving the investigation will not be easy, at least not until there is greater clarity about what exactly Mr. Musk meant with his ill-fated tweet.Advertisement"}

In the post, he said that the financing for such a transaction, which would probably run into the tens of billions of dollars, had been \u201csecured.\u201dIt has become clear since then that neither Mr. Musk nor Tesla had actually lined up the necessary financing aside from having preliminary conversations with some investors.The Twitter post by Mr. Musk, who has considered taking Tesla private in the past, was something of a flip remark, said several people familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about the episode.The serving of a subpoena, which typically requires the approval of top S.E.C. officials, indicates that an inquiry has advanced to a more formal, serious stage.

Even before Mr. Musk\u2019s message on Aug. 7, the S.E.C. had been inquiring about issues at Tesla.About a week earlier, Martin Tripp, a former Tesla employee who has filed a whistle-blower complaint against the company, was interviewed by commission officials over the phone, his lawyer, Stuart Meissner, said.Mr. Tripp, who was an engineer at a Tesla battery plant in Nevada, said he had seen problems with some of the batteries installed in the company\u2019s cars. He has accused Tesla of misleading investors about some production figures.Tesla has sued Mr. Tripp, accusing him of trying to steal trade secrets. Mr. Tripp has said the company and Mr. Musk have wrongly portrayed him as a saboteur.Over the past few months, there has been a war of words between the parties.

{"Headline": "Tesla Board Surprised by Elon Musk\u2019s Tweet on Taking Carmaker Private", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn abrupt tweet last week by Elon Musk about the prospect of taking Tesla private was dashed off with little forethought, and had not been cleared ahead of time with the company\u2019s board, two people familiar with the chain of events said Monday.The account raised new questions about the cryptic Twitter post last week in which Mr. Musk, the mercurial co-founder and chief executive of the electric-car maker, said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a buyout of the $60 billion company.Since early 2017, the fund \u201chas approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote. Two weeks ago, he added, the fund\u2019s managing director \u201cstrongly expressed his support for funding a going-private transaction.\u201d\u201cI understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed,\u201d he added.But three people familiar with the workings of the Saudi fund cast doubt on his account. They said the fund had taken none of the steps that such an ambitious transaction would entail, like preparing a term sheet or hiring a financial adviser to work on the deal.And even if the fund were ready to move forward with such an agreement, it would invite review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government body that reviews the national-security implications of such transactions.A spokesman for the Saudi investment fund declined to comment.In his blog post Monday, Mr. Musk portrayed his Twitter musings last week as part of a deliberate effort to be \u201ccompletely forthcoming\u201d with shareholders about his desire to take the company private.But the episode appears to have been much more extemporaneous.The tweet did not disclose the sum he had supposedly secured, its source, or any terms of the plan \u2014 the kind of transaction that would typically be detailed in documents of 200 pages or more.A person with direct knowledge of the Tesla board\u2019s thinking said some members of the board had been totally blindsided by Mr. Musk\u2019s decision to air his plan on Twitter.On Monday evening, Mr. Musk took to Twitter again. Signaling that he remained serious about pursuing the potential buyout, he cited two financial firms and two law firms that he said he was \u201cexcited to work with\u201d on the proposal. He named Silver Lake Partners and Goldman Sachs as financial advisers, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Munger, Tolles & Olson as legal advisers.The pursuit of a buyout has come at a crucial time for the company, as it struggles to turn out its first mass-market automobile, the Model 3. Tesla has taken on a mounting debt load and has yet to turn an annual profit. And while Mr. Musk has always been synonymous with the brand, he has never been under greater scrutiny.In the past few months, he has mocked industry analysts for asking \u201cbonehead\u201d questions, pursued online tirades against investors betting against the company\u2019s stock, clashed with a government agency investigating a fatal Tesla crash, and accused a disgruntled employee of sabotage.Then he suddenly announced the idea of taking the company private.In his blog post on Monday, Mr. Musk said he had notified the Tesla board on Aug. 2, five days before sending out the tweets, that \u201cin my personal capacity, I wanted to take Tesla private at $420 a per share.\u201dHe said that after the board\u2019s outside directors discussed the matter \u2014 without the participation of Mr. Musk or his brother, Kimbal Musk, also a board member \u2014 the full board agreed to have Mr. Musk discuss the matter with some of the company\u2019s largest shareholders.Since then, Mr. Musk said, he had stayed in contact with representatives of the Saudi fund, which recently bought a stake of almost 5 percent in Tesla, and had been in touch with other investors.A Tesla spokesman declined to comment beyond the blog post.Tesla shares declined on Monday morning, then recovered in the afternoon to end the day 0.3 percent higher at $356.41. It was a far cry from the volatility of last Tuesday, when trading was halted in the confusion that followed Mr. Musk\u2019s initial tweet, eventually closing 11 percent higher on the day.The Nasdaq exchange, like the rest of Wall Street, seemed to have been stunned by the news. Companies that list on Nasdaq are required to inform the exchange\u2019s market surveillance group at least 10 minutes before the release of news that could have a major effect on shares.After Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, however, frenzied trading went on for more than an hour before it was halted pending a fuller announcement from Tesla, which came a half-hour before the market closed.\u201cAs an officer of a public company that was a clearly a market-moving event and he knew or should have known that,\u201d said Laura Unger, a former S.E.C. commissioner, said of Mr. Musk\u2019s initial tweet. \u201cHe was at least reckless whether he meant to drive up the price or not. What it does point out is that executives and people in power should be thoughtful about what they tweet. The stakes are high.\u201dAside from the scrutiny of market regulators, the frantic Tesla trading after the \u201cfunding secured\u201d tweet has also exposed Mr. Musk to shareholder lawsuits. At least two law firms initiated potential class-action lawsuits late last week, saying the Tesla chief had deliberately acted to move the company\u2019s share price without actually having funding in place. Such suits rarely go to trial; more often they are settled.John Reed Stark, a former longtime lawyer at the S.E.C. who specialized in investigating internet fraud cases, said that commenting online about the prospects of taking the company private was inadvisable at best. But he said that a case of market manipulation would come down to Mr. Musk\u2019s intent.\u201cThese are very difficult cases to prove,\u201d said Mr. Stark, who runs a cybersecurity consulting business.As it scrambles to ramp up production of the Model 3, Tesla continues to burn cash. Looming in the months ahead are two key bond payments \u2014 one in November for $230 million and another early next year for $920 million that analysts believe will be harder for Tesla to make.The recent rise in Tesla\u2019s stock could make a difference; the company can pay off the second convertible bond with stock rather than cash if its share price is above $360.Amid all the tension, Tesla has become a target of short sellers \u2014 investors who are betting the company\u2019s stock will fall. Mr. Musk has openly feuded with short sellers on Twitter, taunting them when Tesla shares rise and accusing them of spreading negative news to hurt the company.Shares of Tesla have one of the highest short-interest ratios in the United States stock market \u2014 that is, the most investor money betting against the stock, as a percentage of shares available for trading. So when shares rise, as they did after Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet last week, it can cost the skeptics dearly.Among those who have been betting big against Tesla is David Einhorn, founder of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital. A letter from the fund to investors at the end of July said that Mr. Musk \u201cappears erratic and desperate,\u201d recapitulating some of his provocative interactions with analysts, regulators and Twitter followers. It also lamented that \u201cthis bravado\u201d was a hit in the market, sending Tesla\u2019s shares up 29 percent in the second quarter and resulting in the fund\u2019s second biggest loss.One benefit of taking Tesla private, Mr. Musk has said, is that it would eliminate the influence of short sellers, as well as the demands of reporting quarterly earnings. Doing so, he said in the blog post, would \u201cenable Tesla to operate at its best.\u201dMatthew Goldstein, Tiffany Hsu and Matt Phillips contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

When Rollie Atkinson, who owns four weekly newspapers in Sonoma County, reduced the number of print pages a couple of years ago, loyal readers \u201craised holy hell,\u201d he said.So this year, Mr. Atkinson, in what is believed to be a first for a local newspaper, began making his pitch at cocktail gatherings and dinner parties and in full-page advertisements. The so-called direct public offering \u2014 essentially a small scale I.P.O. but without investment banks \u2014 has so far raised $100,000 by selling equity. The offering lasts until next March, and Mr. Atkinson said he hoped to raise $400,000.That money, first and foremost, will go toward higher wages for his journalists, some of whom have been making about $15 an hour. Mr. Atkinson\u2019s company, Sonoma West, includes four newspapers \u2014 The Healdsburg Tribune, The Cloverdale Reveille, The Windsor Times and Sonoma West Times & News \u2014 whose combined paid circulation is about 9,900.Some readers who invested said they did so not just to support their local paper, but also as statement against the rise of fake news, and against a president who has constantly battled the notion of a free press.\u201cI think, now more than ever, we can support democracy by supporting our communities,\u201d said Marie Gewirtz, who is retired and has invested in the newspapers.Sonoma County, with an abundance of wealth, vineyards and aging baby boomers, is fertile territory for Mr. Atkinson\u2019s experiment.\u201cWe are a liberal society that believes in taking care of your neighbors and supporting local stores,\u201d said Rick Theis, another reader who invested.Mr. Theis said that the local newspaper often has stories about people he knows well, and that he often finds uplifting stories there as well. It\u2019s not all the doom and gloom he gets from the national news media.\u201cThe national news is so depressing,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk and Tesla Resolved One Issue. Now for the Rest.", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter deciding not to try to remove its shares from the market, the electric carmaker must focus on some stubborn challenges while facing new ones.So Tesla is no longer seeking to go private. Now what?On Monday, the electric carmaker began to take stock of the residual damage from its August whirlwind \u2014 including the prospect of harsher scrutiny of its bottom line and of its chief executive, Elon Musk. In the past, analysts, investors and even admirers of the company were sometimes willing to overlook quarterly losses and missed targets because of the persuasiveness of Mr. Musk\u2019s long-term vision.\u201cNow that the going-private process is out the window, we can go back to valuing the company on fundamentals,\u201d said Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Cowen & Company. Tesla\u2019s core auto business is \u201cextremely challenged,\u201d Mr. Osborne said, adding that he found it \u201chard to believe\u201d that Tesla would deliver on Mr. Musk\u2019s promise to generate a profit and positive cash flow in the current quarter.Other analysts voiced similar sentiments, noting damage to Mr. Musk\u2019s credibility and concerns over the distraction the going-private issue had caused.[Read more about how Mr. Musk came to the conclusion that going private was not the solution to his problems, from insiders\u2019 accounts.]Monday provided the first chance for investors to signal their reaction to the about-face, and they sent Tesla\u2019s stock lower than its Friday close, though not by much. It closed at $319.27, a decline of barely 1 percent. The shares had reached nearly $380 immediately after Mr. Musk\u2019s declaration on Aug. 7 before falling back, indicating doubt about his ability to carry off his plan. But they remain comfortably above the sub-$300 level where they were trading in July before Tesla\u2019s quarterly earnings announcement, and its declaration that it saw profitable quarters ahead.Of course, there are still the short-sellers \u2014 those betting against Tesla in the markets, whose sway was a major motivation for Mr. Musk to seek to flee the public markets. They have not been neutralized.And major questions remain, including how the company will manage its financial challenges as it scrambles to meet the production goals for the Model 3 sedan, the lower-priced offering it has called the key to its profitability, and the legal and regulatory issues that have kicked up by the going-private gambit. One of the most critical tasks is ramping up production of the Model 3. He has said the company needs to make 5,000 a week to become profitable, and it reported hitting that mark in the final week in June. Since then, however, analysts believe the Model 3 line has been operating at a slower pace on average.\u201cThe tent shows there\u2019s clearly an issue with throughput,\u201d he said. \u201cMaking cars in a tent obviously wasn\u2019t the way Tesla originally planned it.\u201dKarl Brauer, executive editor at Cox Automotive, a research firm, contrasted the length of time that had been needed for the Model 3 to reach full production capacity with the typical rollout of a new model by an established automaker. Tesla is still working out kinks more than a year after starting production.\u201cWith most automakers, it\u2019s normal that full capacity is not reached in the first month or even after three to six months,\u201d he said. \u201cBut certainly within a year, you\u2019re at high volume.\u201dAs more Model 3 cars have been delivered, questions about the quality of the cars\u2019 construction have cropped up. The investment bank UBS recently commissioned a team of engineers to deconstruct a Model 3 and reported uneven gaps between the car\u2019s steel panels, missing bolts and components held in place by plastic zip ties.Mr. Osborne said he had observed uneven panel gaps in new Model 3s himself. \u201cTesla\u2019s core competency is in design and battery technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are having trouble with manufacturability.\u201dOne photo circulating on Twitter showed a Model 3 with a brown interior panel on one door and a white one on another. A Tesla spokeswoman acknowledged the mistake and said the company had contacted the owner to resolve the matter. But she said the company had seen \u201chuge improvements in Model 3 quality\u201d and steady improvements in customer satisfaction since the start of the year, even as output increased.Tesla is a fast-growing company that needs huge amounts of cash to finance its production. If the company fails to sell enough Model 3 cars in the coming months, its cash might dwindle to a precarious level. But any problems with Model 3 production, or any shortfall in sales, could leave Tesla low on cash. The company may also need to find money in the next few months to repay holders of convertible bonds. If Tesla's stock is trading above a certain price, the company may be able to repay the holders in shares; otherwise, the holders may demand cash. Paying with cash instead of shares could require around $1 billion to repay bonds that fall due in November and March. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s interest in Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201cfunding secured\u201d declaration has not been put to rest with the decision to stay public. The uncertainty about regulatory penalties could seriously hinder raising capital and prompt Wall Street firms that arrange securities offerings to progress with caution. \u201cIt was clearly incomplete disclosure,\u201d Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said in an email. \u201cThe issue is going to be whether the S.E.C. decides it was fraudulent, whether it misled investors. The danger for Tesla is if the S.E.C. decides to go forward with a fraud case.\u201d Banks and other firms providing financing will want clarity about the potential course of the investigation, because underwriters and advisers would face legal penalties for any misleading or incomplete disclosures in the offering documents, Mr. Henning said. \u201cAs part of the due diligence, there will be a demand for lots of disclosure, which Tesla (and Musk) don\u2019t seem to like to do,\u201d he said. Tesla\u2019s directors may also have a more fundamental question to consider: whether Mr. Musk is the right person to lead the company. \u201cGiven the drama he\u2019s created, and the S.E.C.\u2019s investigation around that drama, the question is where the board goes next,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, a professor specializing in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThey have to decide what to do with him.\u201dDavid Gelles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From Elon Musk\u2019s Interview With The Times About Tesla", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla is not considering hiring a second in command, the electric carmaker\u2019s founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, said in wide-ranging comments to The New York Times.Mr. Musk\u2019s remarks came during an hourlong interview Thursday in which he described the extraordinary demands of running Tesla and the profound effect it has had on his personal life.\u201cIf you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job,\u201d he said from his home in Los Angeles. \u201cIs there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.\u201dHere are five takeaways from the interview.En route, he typed out the message that provoked the latest crisis over his leadership of Tesla.Mr. Musk said no one reviewed or saw the tweet before he sent it, but the post sent Tesla\u2019s shares soaring. He then reached the airport and took a private jet to a Tesla battery plant in Nevada. Later that evening, he flew to the San Francisco Bay Area and held meetings into the night.When Mr. Musk sent out the tweet, Tesla\u2019s share price rocketed upward, finally closing up 11 percent to finish the day just above $379. He said in the interview that he had sought to offer shareholders a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had recently been trading, and rounded up to $420 a share.Since then, however, Tesla\u2019s share price has nose-dived. On Friday, Tesla shares ended trading at $305.50, a fall of about 9 percent for the day \u2014 and about 24 percent lower from where the price closed on the day of the tweet.\u201cTo the best of my knowledge,\u201d Mr. Musk told The Times on Thursday, there was \u201cno active search right now.\u201d People familiar with the matter, however, said that executives were looking for a No. 2 executive, and one person said the hunt had intensified in recent weeks.A couple of years ago, Tesla approached Sheryl Sandberg, currently Facebook\u2019s second most senior executive, about the job, Mr. Musk said.\u201cWhy would I?\u201d he asked.Once Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet about taking Tesla private was posted, speculation was rife that his target share price, $420, held an implicit message \u2014 the number has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore.Mr. Musk was, however, definitive in his response. \u201cI was not on weed, to be clear,\u201d he said.\u201cWeed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dHe did note, though, that he sometimes takes Ambien to help him sleep when he is not working, a practice that has worried some of Tesla\u2019s board members.They worry that the drug does not put Mr. Musk to sleep, but instead contributes to late-night Twitter sessions, a person familiar with the matter said. Some board members are also aware that Mr. Musk has occasionally used recreational drugs, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Musk outlined the toll that running Tesla had taken on his personal life, from spending the entirety of his birthday at work to nearly missing his brother\u2019s wedding, where he was to be best man.But while that effort appears to have helped Tesla gain a firmer footing, things could get worse for him personally, he said.\u201cI thought the worst of it was over \u2014 I thought it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint.\u201d\u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint,\u201d Mr. Musk added, \u201cthe worst is yet to come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Elon Musk Reversed Course on Taking Tesla Private", "Date": "2018-08-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Elon Musk declared this month that he wanted to take Tesla private, his board was caught off guard. Barely three weeks later, the chief executive told the board he had changed his mind. Tesla would be staying public, after all.In that time, according to five people close to the events, Mr. Musk came to realize that his thinking had been overly simplistic. While going private might have removed some problems, it would have introduced new ones.Among his concerns were ceding too much control to private investors \u2014 including conventional car companies and Saudi Arabia, a symbol of big oil \u2014 and shutting out smaller investors who might be unable to retain a stake.Those were issues both symbolic and substantive for Tesla, which has staked its future on making electric vehicles the transportation of choice \u2014 a vision that has made it the nation\u2019s most highly valued car company. Even with its shares worth $55 billion, it faces concerns common to many young companies, including its vulnerability to the whims of public shareholders.For his part, Mr. Musk has come under new scrutiny as his impulsiveness has played out in real time in the stock market, with billions of dollars on the line.And even with the decision to stand pat, Mr. Musk and the company could remain in the sights of the Securities and Exchange Commission over the circumstances of the original announcement.\u201cTesla investors must realize that they have a panicky, erratic, possibly self-destructive C.E.O. at the helm,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cNo C.E.O. is ever this confused and confusing.\u201dFor years, Mr. Musk had romanticized the idea of Tesla going private. Doing so, he has mused publicly, would free him from the short-term pressures of the public markets, unburden him of the distractions of a volatile stock price and, more recently, get rid of the short sellers betting that Tesla would fail. Instead, Mr. Musk believed he could focus on Tesla\u2019s work of popularizing electric vehicles and reducing the world\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels.In his note announcing that Tesla would remain public, Mr. Musk cited four main factors that changed his mind: existing shareholders believe Tesla is better off as a public company; not all existing investors would be able to own shares of a private company; it wasn\u2019t clear how individual investors would take part in a deal; and the process could distract the company from production of its first mass-market offering, the Model 3, which is crucial to its financial health.By the account of people familiar with Mr. Musk\u2019s thinking, deepening ties with new private investors presented its own challenges. By taking money from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund \u2014 something Mr. Musk said he believed was a sure thing \u2014 Tesla would have been teaming up with a country whose very foundation is fossil fuels, and one often criticized on human-rights grounds.That cognitive dissonance \u2014 an electric-car company backed by big oil \u2014 was pointed out to Mr. Musk several times, these people said.As Tesla representatives reached out to officials at the Saudi fund and other sovereign funds, it also became clear that they might want more than just Tesla equity in exchange for an investment. Some, said someone briefed on those talks, would expect Tesla to open manufacturing operations in their countries, for example.And while several big carmakers approached Tesla about funding a deal, people familiar with the discussions said, there were issues there, too. Some of those companies have their own reputational baggage. And Mr. Musk, proud that Tesla\u2019s cars are made in America, did not want to let foreign interests dictate his decisions about manufacturing.At the same time, it became clear that not all of Tesla\u2019s big institutional shareholders would have been able to take part in a buyout. Many big investors hold Tesla stock in funds that can only own publicly traded stocks.\u201cOn the whole, some of our clients will find it very difficult to follow,\u201d James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, which is Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder after Mr. Musk, said in an interview before Mr. Musk called off a deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation with Mr. Musk himself. He understands that there is an issue here.\u201dThose pleas were notable because many individual investors are not able to invest in private companies for regulatory reasons.On Thursday morning, Elon Musk and Tesla\u2019s board gathered for a meeting on the factory floor of the company\u2019s manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif., people with knowledge of the events said. They were joined by representatives from the investment bank Goldman Sachs and the private equity firm Silver Lake, which were advising on a deal.After a Silver Lake representative made a presentation expressing confidence in their ability to manage the process of taking Tesla private \u2014 a transaction that could have required $24 billion or more \u2014 the Wall Street representatives left the room, and the floor was given to Mr. Musk.But instead of telling his board just how far he\u2019d come in securing new investors for a potential deal, Mr. Musk backtracked: He no longer believed going private was in the best interest of the company, and he would not be bringing forward a proposal to buy out the company.Doing so would be too distracting, big institutional investors could not all take part and there was no easy path for retail shareholders to be involved, he told the board.During the meeting, the board voted to dissolve the special committee established to evaluate a potential deal. And before lunchtime, the meeting \u2014 held in the same room where Mr. Musk sometimes sleeps during late nights at the factory \u2014 was over.Later that day, Mr. Musk drafted a statement announcing that Tesla would remain public, which the board approved Thursday night. On Friday, working from the office of SpaceX, his private rocket company, based near Los Angeles, Mr. Musk and his team refined the letter.Still, the S.E.C., which is investigating whether Mr. Musk\u2019s original tweet about a potential buyout violated securities law, may have more to say about the sequence of events \u2014 particularly the \u201cfunding secured\u201d declaration. The initial tweet sent Tesla\u2019s stock soaring and caused a halt in trading pending a fuller announcement. The stock tapered off in ensuing weeks and never came close to the $420 buyout price that Mr. Musk had said was in prospect, indicating investor skepticism.\u201cIn a sense it lessens the impact of the initial tweet,\u201d Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said of the reversal. \u201cBut the S.E.C. looks at what happens at the time of the disclosure. Walking it back later doesn\u2019t necessary mitigate the effect. And it was clearly incomplete.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t throw out information that moves the market and say, \u2018Never mind,\u2019\u201d Mr. Henning added. \u201cThis is the C.E.O. of the company. His statements are the company\u2019s statements. Will they make an example of him? Maybe.\u201dAnd while Mr. Musk may have appeased some constituencies, management experts were left shaking their heads at the chaotic process, which began with a tweet as Mr. Musk drove his Tesla Model S through Los Angeles just over two weeks ago.\u201cA major enterprise should not navigate its ownership path and market valuation through the frantic, public, volatile impulses of the C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cLet alone through the selective disclosures of elite shareholder referenda.\u201dKate Kelly and Jessica Silver-Greenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But since then, Mr. Musk \u2014 who is chatty on Twitter but has a testy relationship with journalists \u2014 had not spoken to the press.By Thursday, appetite for stories about Mr. Musk and Tesla was still strong, and I was part of a team pursuing several leads. The goal was to explain what was happening inside Tesla, and to the extent we could, inside Mr. Musk\u2019s own head. At best, we hoped we might get some of his associates, or perhaps even a Tesla board member, to speak to us on the record. And while we had been trying to get Mr. Musk to agree to an interview for days, working through intermediaries, it wasn\u2019t looking promising. The company was in damage control mode, and no one seemed to be talking.Then, suddenly, Mr. Musk was on the phone.While each of those articles was different, my interactions with the executives were more or less the same. There was almost always a public relations representative for the company in the room, hovering nearby to make sure the boss didn\u2019t say something inappropriate.

They were programmed not to say anything that might make them appear vulnerable, and certainly not anything that might raise suspicions about their ability to lead a company.\u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,\u201d he said early in the conversation. \u201cIt was excruciating.\u201dBut the most intense moments of the interview came when I asked Mr. Musk whether his extreme work ethic was taking a toll on his physical and emotional well-being.\u201cIt\u2019s not been great, actually,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u201dHe paused, the line going quiet as he was seemingly overcome by emotion.\u201cThere were times when I didn\u2019t leave the factory for three or four days \u2014 days when I didn\u2019t go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.\u201dMidway through our conversation, I asked Mr. Musk if he believed he had turned a corner. Were things about to get better for him?\u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint,\u201d he said.It was the kind of bland answer I\u2019ve come to expect from the C.E.O. of a public company, and I assumed he had completed his thought.Then, after a moment of silence, Mr. Musk continued: \u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.\u201dIt was one of the most extraordinary interviews of my career, and by one simple measure it was a first: In all the conversations I\u2019ve had with business leaders over the years, not until Elon Musk got on the phone had an executive revealed such vulnerability. By speaking with such candor \u2014 choking up, pausing repeatedly to regain his composure \u2014 Mr. Musk made clear just what a steep toll his work was taking on his personal life. It was a reminder that despite all their efforts to make the public believe otherwise, C.E.O.s have feelings, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Reports Another Big Loss, but Sees Only Profit Ahead", "Date": "2018-08-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla recorded another huge loss last quarter and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in cash as it ramped up production of its first mass-market model.But the electric-car maker intends for that loss to be its last.Tesla is about to turn the corner, Elon Musk, the chief executive, told analysts and investors on Wednesday during a conference call after the company announced its quarterly results.\u201cOur goal is to be profitable and cash-flow positive for every quarter going forward,\u201d Mr. Musk said. Outside of a recession or major economic shock, the company is confident that it can reach that target, he said.Investors liked the promise. Tesla\u2019s stock rose about 9 percent in extended trading, after closing at $300.84.The quarter that ended June 30 was a crucial one for Tesla in its quest to build a successful future around the Model 3, the more affordable sedan it is offering alongside the flagship Model S sedan and the Model X sport-utility vehicle. To meet its Model 3 production goals, the company set up a tent at its factory in Fremont, Calif., to augment its assembly line, and Mr. Musk said he had taken to sleeping at the plant.Tesla used up more than $430 million of its remaining cash during the quarter, decreasing its cash supply to $2.2 billion. But analysts had braced for worse.\u201cI was expecting more cash burn,\u201d David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar.The output it anticipates in the third quarter \u2014 7,000 vehicles per week across its entire fleet, or 350,000 per year \u2014 \u201cshould enable Tesla to become sustainably profitable for the first time in our history,\u201d the company said in a note to investors.That would be a significant accomplishment for a company that has never reported an annual profit \u2014 its latest quarterly loss was $743 million on $4 billion in revenue \u2014 and some analysts remain skeptical. The goal is plausible but could easily be derailed by production glitches, delivery delays and softer-than-expected demand for the Model 3, said Brian Johnson, an analyst at Barclays.Tesla has set a base price of $35,000 for the vehicle, but it is currently taking orders only for versions that start at $49,000.\u201cWe still have fundamental concerns with the actual demand for the higher-priced variants,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Tesla\u2019s ambitions \u2014 its stated corporate mission is to \u201caccelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy\u201d \u2014 are expensive. Its dwindling financial safety net has prompted some analysts to predict that it will soon need to raise more money, but Mr. Musk strongly disputed that on Wednesday\u2019s call.\u201cWe will not be raising any equity, at any point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly could raise money, but I think we do not need to. I think it\u2019s better discipline not to.\u201dThe amount that Tesla owed its suppliers ballooned in the second quarter, which may have helped the company conserve cash. Its accounts payable, the balance-sheet item for yet-to-be-paid bills, totaled $3 billion at the end of the second quarter, an increase of more than $425 million from the first quarter.That factory will be paid for with loans from Chinese banks and \u201clocal debt,\u201d Mr. Musk said Wednesday.\u201cThere\u2019s really no excuse for bad manners,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are reasons for it. I\u2019ve gotten no sleep and been working sort of 110-hour, 120-hour weeks. But nonetheless, there\u2019s still no excuse. \u201cMr. Musk also apologized for rambling at times on Wednesday\u2019s call.\u201cSorry if I sound a little tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working like crazy in the body shop lately.\u201dPeter Eavis contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Is the Id of Tech", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLet me answer the question many are thinking: Is he crazy? Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.Not crazy like a fox, but crazy as a loon.So let me answer that question: Is he crazy? No, he\u2019s not. Not, at least, in my various encounters with him over nearly two decades \u2014 including recently \u2014 in which he has been alternately funny, rude, compelling, obnoxious, accessible, easy to deal with, hard to deal with, always on, outspoken to a fault even when he might be at fault, angry, charming, intense and also strikingly confident. Which is a long way of saying deeply human, with all the positive and negative characteristics that suggests. And that is why, to me, Elon Musk has become the id of tech. But his desires and needs are never unconscious or hidden; they are all out there in the brightest Technicolor for all to see. In the oddest of ways, he is transparent, so utterly direct that it is unsettling and even painful at times to those around him.This week I have talked to a lot of people who know Mr. Musk, including those who adore him and those who have had it with his brusque intensity. And what I found among his current and former colleagues is that they really have the exact same story about an impulsive and driven boss who runs a very hot and messy kitchen and does not spend a lot of time apologizing for it. Some grew weary of this and left, while others thrive under the withering lights. Still others left and then came back, drawn in by the glow.This is not a new phenomenon in tech, and especially in Silicon Valley, a place that needs its complicated gods.Too much? Sure, but it was a pretty good myth and even better since it was largely true. Over the ensuing years, Mr. Jobs used his famous reality distortion field to bend the news media and investors and everyone else to his will. He also warred many times with some journalists and investors, but no one remembers that anymore. His death, much too early and so very tragic, sealed his epic tale for eternity. And so it was Mr. Musk who became the obvious choice, although the comparison to Mr. Jobs is certainly not a perfect one. Mr. Jobs was elegant and spare and even quiet; Mr. Musk is all pomp and circumstance. Mr. Jobs traveled in his mind; Mr. Musk wants to die on Mars (just not on landing, as he told me in an interview a few years ago).What they do share is a proclivity for what is perhaps the most important element of all truly legendary makers of important things: Creative destruction.For Mr. Jobs, it was a bet-the-company approach that ushered in a whole new way of computing. For Mr. Musk it is a lot of big notions, any one of which would be hard to do alone, from electric self-driving cars to ubiquitous solar energy to landing a spent rocket ship on a platform in the ocean. Yeah, he did that, too.This is not to say I am an Elon fanboy, as I find the hagiography around him tiresome and even toxic when it comes to some of his acolytes, who cannot take one valid criticism of their leader without descending into madness. (And Mr. Musk doesn\u2019t do himself any favors by whipping them up \u2014 it\u2019s indulgent and irresponsible.) But I will say that this whole debate brings to mind something that an angel investor named Pejman Nozad said to me offhand many years ago, when he was bemoaning all the stupid start-up ideas that he saw littering the landscape. Silly social networks, dumb photo filter apps, yet another delivery service for millennials. \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d he said, \u201cis a lot of big minds chasing small ideas.\u201dMake no mistake, Mr. Musk\u2019s mind and ideas are big ones. He has said publicly, and others agree, that he is simply exhausted and under intense pressure, and these recent mistakes will soon be forgotten. But he has been careless, and fewer people are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. He has tarnished his reputation by going after imagined enemies, fair critics and those who don\u2019t wish him well with the same tweet daggers. It\u2019s a huge waste of time, when what he has to do to seal his status is actually to build a strong and stable company that is not just revolving around his aura, and a team that does its best work with or without him.And, of course, delete that Twitter app off his phone. After all, can you imagine Steve Jobs tweeting? No, neither can I.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Kate Conger, a tech reporter, here to tell you about how the tech world got caught up again this week in a debate about censorship and free speech.All of the furor comes at an inconvenient time for executives, some of whom are scheduled to testify before Senate and House committees. Election interference and social media influence campaigns will almost certainly come up, but expect plenty of questions about how these companies moderate political speech, too.Most tech companies strive to be politically neutral \u2014 Google, Facebook and Twitter all have political action committees that tend to donate evenly to Republicans and Democrats. Yet they\u2019re still struggling to counter allegations of bias.Part of the blame lies with the companies, which are consistently opaque about how their services work. This can leave users to invent conspiratorial explanations for how the companies work.But the continued pressure on tech companies to clean up election interference on their platforms seems to be nudging them toward transparency. Several companies have introduced ad transparency tools ahead of the midterm elections, giving details about political ads that run on their platforms. Opening up about their moderation guidelines might help users understand how companies police and organize the content on their platforms.In other news from the week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Yosemite National Park Reopens to Visitors", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Nearly three weeks after a wildfire closed Yosemite Valley to the public, park officials welcomed back visitors on Tuesday. This was great news for tourists from Israel, Italy, Germany and many other points on the globe who drove into a park still hazy from the diminished but still active Ferguson Fire.But the reopening was most likely a disappointment for some of the park\u2019s longstanding residents \u2014 namely the bears, gray foxes, coyotes, deer and bobcats that had taken advantage of the park\u2019s closing to ramble more freely across the valley floor.\u201cThe bears were having a field day,\u201d said Scott Gediman, a spokesman for the park. \u201cWith so few people there they were roaming everywhere, kind of just walking around. It was cool, an unforeseen benefit.\u201dThe bears were especially happy to climb some of the apple trees in Curry Village and feast on the harvest.The closing came at the busiest time of year for the park, when visitors typically number around 15,000 to 18,000 people a day, Mr. Gediman said. He estimates the park lost between $2.5 and $3 million in admission fees, a shortfall that will force the park to dip into reserves. Yosemite was serene during the closing but filled with choking smoke from the nearby fires.The last time the park was closed for an extended period was during massive flooding in January 1997 that stranded hundreds of visitors and caused more than $250 million in damage. The park closed for two and a half months.Mr. Gediman has an office at the park headquarters in Yosemite Valley, but he spent Tuesday outside, greeting visitors as they streamed in.\u201cSeeing people back here is wonderful,\u201d Mr. Gediman said by telephone, pausing to answer a query from a carload of foreign tourists. \u201cIt was certainly great with all the wildlife coming out and it was quiet,\u201d he said of the closing. \u201cBut it\u2019s great to welcome visitors back.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)They don 18th-century matador uniforms and bota bags of liquor, but at these bullfights in the Central Valley, there is no bloodshed.In a state famous for defending animal rights, Portuguese-Americans gather every year to put on huge festivals with bullfighters brought in from overseas.

The province\u2019s Supreme Court found itself considering something out of the ordinary: Does the sasquatch exist? Or at minimum, is there enough doubt about the answer to that question to justify a lawsuit against the province?Todd Standing, a lumber mill worker and self-described sasquatch tracker from Golden, British Columbia, asked the court not to dismiss his lawsuit against the provincial government. Mr. Standing claims to possess, as he repeatedly told me, \u201cirrefutable evidence that they are real.\u201dMr. Standing is not after money. Rather, he wants the province to formally declare that the hairy giant \u2014 giganto horridus hominoid, or gigantopithecus, as he also calls it in his court filing \u2014 does indeed lurk in the forests and mountains of British Columbia. He is also seeking an order requiring that the province\u2019s fish and wildlife service give the sasquatch the protections it has offered to other creatures.The province\u2019s view can best be summed up in its request to quash the case. It says that Mr. Standing\u2019s lawsuit lacks \u201can air of reality\u201d and that it is \u201cgroundless, fanciful, trifles with the court.\u201dSkepticism about his sasquatch claims are nothing new for Mr. Standing, who is originally from Alberta. He said that he first began looking for the beast about 12 years ago, aiming to disprove the legend. He wound up a believer, and his life since then has been a quest to persuade the rest of the world.\u201cI deal with the ridicule, I deal with the people who mock me,\u201d Mr. Standing said. \u201cI only put up with it because I\u2019m so passionate. People mocked Einstein, but Einstein was vindicated.\u201d\u201cMy documentary, financially, has been a total flop,\u201d Mr. Standing said. \u201cThe sales were dismal.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear when the court will announce its decision in the sasquatch case.\u201cIf it goes to trial, I\u2019ll win, I\u2019ll smoke them,\u201d Mr. Standing predicted. \u201cThis is the discovery of the millennium.\u201dBe sure to set aside time for Dan Bilefsky\u2019s engaging and funny profile of Sugar Sammy, the comedian from Montreal.Sammy is the son of immigrants from Northern India and an outspoken voice for Canadian federalism in Quebec.

The approach has made him a well-known figure in the province, and a millionaire.But, Dan wrote, \u201cThis being Quebec, he was also pilloried by some French-speaking Quebec nationalists for bastardizing the language of Moli\u00e8re by speaking Franglais.

There was no immediate activity on the chief executive\u2019s personal account, which he had used to reveal his thoughts about going private and has employed regularly to spar with critics and investors who have bet against Tesla, known as shorts.In his statement, Mr. Musk indicated discussions with Tesla shareholders and with hastily enlisted advisers on the deal \u2014 the investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as Silver Lake, a technology investment firm \u2014 led him to give up on the idea of taking his car company private.He also noted that there was \u201cno proven path\u201d for most individual investors to stay with the company if it became a private concern. Mr. Musk wrote that he continued to believe \u201cthere is more than enough funding to take Tesla private,\u201d although neither he nor the company detailed where the money would come from.The decision to remain publicly owned resolves perhaps the most burning issue for Mr. Musk and Tesla, but many others continue to dog them.The company has never reported an annual profit since its founding in 2003. Tesla has been striving to produce at least 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week, the level at which it can turn a profit, according to Mr. Musk. It has said it reached that level in recent weeks, although it has taken some extreme measures to do so.Jacey Fortin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Your Check May Be in the Mail", "Date": "2018-08-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore from Tim Higgins, Marc Vartabedian and Christina Rogers of the WSJ:Separately, several suppliers in interviews said Tesla has tried to stretch out payments or asked for significant cash back. And in some cases, public records show, small suppliers over the past several months have claimed they failed to get paid for services supplied to Tesla.No one spoke of wanting to cut ties to Tesla.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Pitch to Take Tesla Private Has Wall Street Salivating", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExecutives at banks including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are discussing ways a deal could be structured, angling to land the potentially prestigious assignment of taking the maker of electric cars off public markets, according to people familiar with the discussions. Bankers and lawyers on Wall Street said any deal is likely to be valued at $10 billion to $20 billion.Some of Tesla\u2019s big institutional investors \u2014 including Fidelity and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2014 also were blindsided by Mr. Musk\u2019s comments, according to people close to those companies.On Wednesday, officials from the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission contacted Tesla officials to inquire about Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets, according to a person briefed on the inquiry. The S.E.C. officials asked Tesla about the veracity of Mr. Musk\u2019s comments and why the company did not make an announcement via a regulatory filing. Tesla shares fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday.The S.E.C. declined to comment on its inquiry. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the inquiry.A deal to take Tesla private could generate a gusher of fees for Wall Street, and bankers are scrambling to position themselves for an assignment. One way to do that is to come up with possible structures for a deal that they can pitch to Tesla and its advisers.The traditional way for a publicly traded company to go private is through a leveraged buyout, in which private equity firms or other investors purchase all of the outstanding public shares with money they have borrowed from banks or other sources.But investment bankers said on Wednesday that a leveraged buyout of Tesla \u2014 which in theory could cost as much as $70 billion if all of Tesla\u2019s shares were bought at the price of $420 a share that Mr. Musk floated \u2014 is likely a nonstarter. The company, which has never turned a profit, is burning through cash so quickly that it would be hard to find banks or bond investors willing to lend tens of billions of dollars to finance a private buyout.\u201cThe numbers don\u2019t work as it is,\u201d said Ronald A. Kahn, the head of the debt advisory and valuation practice at Chicago-based investment bank Lincoln International. \u201cWhy would anyone even give him a few billion more?\u201dThat does not mean, however, that a deal to take Tesla private is off the table.One structure being studied by banks and Tesla, according to people familiar with the matter, is a transaction that would reduce the number of shareholders to such a degree that Tesla\u2019s shares could be delisted from the Nasdaq stock exchange and the company no longer would be required to make quarterly filings with the S.E.C.That would be expensive \u2014 it could cost $10 billion to $20 billion \u2014 but much less so than a full leveraged buyout, these people said.How might such a transaction work?One possibility is a maneuver called \u201cgoing dark.\u201d In this situation, Tesla could buy out many but not all of its shareholders to reduce the total number of investors who hold Tesla stock. One way to make that math work would be to persuade as many small shareholders as possible to sell their holdings.The largest shareholders of the company \u2014 including Mr. Musk, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Scotland\u2019s Baillie Gifford, who collectively own about 45 percent of Tesla shares \u2014 would not need to sell their stakes under that arrangement.Tesla\u2019s shares would no longer be listed on the Nasdaq, but investors could buy or sell them on loosely regulated, over-the-counter markets that are typically the domain of small companies. Because shares on these exchanges are generally traded less heavily than those on larger public markets, it would likely be harder for investors to bet against, or short, Tesla\u2019s stock, which is one of the rationales Mr. Musk outlined on Tuesday for taking the company private.There are many potential problems with this approach. For example, institutional and individual investors are likely to object to holding Tesla shares that do not trade on mainstream national exchanges. In addition, index funds that own Tesla stock could probably not hold the shares if they were not part of benchmarks like the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Going-dark transactions traditionally have been the province of tiny companies, said Gilbert J. Bradshaw, a New York lawyer who works with small companies and has written about companies going dark.\u201cI don\u2019t know of any large company that has done a voluntary deal like this,\u201d he said.Kate Kelly, Landon Thomas Jr., Matt Phillips, Emily Flitter and Neal E.

{"Headline": "When It Comes to a Trade War, China Takes the Long View", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyYe Fangsu, a retired Shanghai schoolteacher, doesn\u2019t need any lessons about the dangers of trade wars. For nearly 60 years, she has lived in the former French Concession, a leafy part of Shanghai whose name itself carries the humiliation of China\u2019s biggest trade war. The \u201cconcession\u201d was one of many slices of territory, including Hong Kong and parts of other port cities, that China was forced to hand over to foreign powers after its defeat in the mid-19th-century Opium Wars. \u201cChina was so weak and backward then,\u201d Ye said, shaking her head as she offered me slices of apple and pear on a hot July afternoon. \u201cWe had to give in.\u201dThe first salvos of today\u2019s trade war have barely been felt yet in China. But for many Chinese, there\u2019s a sense of history repeating itself. The Opium Wars, as every Chinese schoolchild is reminded, began as a British attempt to pry open the Chinese market. Much as it does today, China in the 17th and 18th centuries ran a huge trade surplus with the West, exporting large quantities of tea, porcelain and silk but importing little in return. (It balanced its current-account surplus by buying up loads of Latin American silver; these days, Beijing has piled up $1.2 trillion in United States government securities.) By hooking China on opium, British and American merchants redressed the trade imbalance even as they weakened the country\u2019s social fabric. The Chinese revolted, but they were no match for Western gunboats \u2014 leading to the unequal treaties that have fueled China\u2019s sense of historical grievance and patriotic ambitions ever since.Ye Fangsu was a teenager in 1949 when Mao Zedong\u2019s Communist troops marched into Shanghai, the vanguard of a revolution that vowed to end China\u2019s \u201ccentury of humiliation.\u201d Now 84 and widowed, Ye says she was \u201cangry\u201d when she learned from state-run media about the United States\u2019 punitive trade tariffs on Chinese products. \u201cIt just seems like the foreigners are bullying us again,\u201d she told me. But this time will be different, she said, pointing out that rather than panic or surrender, China\u2019s leaders announced a reciprocal \u201ccounterattack\u201d aimed at products, like soybeans and pork, meant to hit the heart of President Donald Trump\u2019s rural base. \u201cWe\u2019ve become strong now, and our leaders are more tenacious. They won\u2019t back down.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to understand why Trump and his advisers believed China might blink first. The country exports nearly four times more taxable goods to the United States than it imports ($505 billion compared with $130 billion in 2017), so it could never keep up with Washington in a tit-for-tat tariff war. Moreover, the Chinese economy is slowing, weighed down by debt and unemployment and dependent on the American market. Still, in targeting China\u2019s high-tech industry, Washington seemed to forget that Beijing has more than a trillion dollars in reserves to cushion the blow and that 21st-century supply chains are truly global. The Peterson Institute for International Economics calculates that 87 percent of the high-tech Chinese products hit by United States tariffs get some of their parts or financing from companies based outside China. American tariffs, in other words, could inflict even greater pain on allies like South Korea, Japan and Taiwan \u2014 and on the United States itself. As the Ministry of Commerce spokesman Gao Feng put it, \u201cThe U.S. is opening fire on the world and on itself, too.\u201dChina\u2019s retaliatory tariffs have been less scattershot. By taking aim at soybeans and pork, Beijing struck at Trump country in the Midwest, while going after a smaller export like Kentucky bourbon hit the district of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. \u201cChina targets Trump\u2019s interest groups with surgical precision,\u201d a former government official in Shanghai told me. \u201cThat\u2019s China\u2019s institutional advantage. It understands America, but the United States doesn\u2019t really understand how China operates politically.\u201d So far, the United States is feeling the brunt of the trade war: Soy and pork exports to China have collapsed, and China has scuppered one major tech deal: Qualcomm\u2019s proposed $44 billion takeover of the Dutch chip maker NXP Semiconductors. Meanwhile, in Shanghai, residents seem almost oblivious to the trade war, as if it were a storm on a distant horizon. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d says a waitress at a local dumpling shop. \u201cBut the price of soy sauce hasn\u2019t gone up yet.\u201dThe United States would be wise not to underestimate China\u2019s resolve. President Xi Jinping, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao, has staked his legitimacy on restoring China\u2019s greatness. Backing down is not an option for him; he can\u2019t afford to look weak in a face-off with China\u2019s biggest rival. Xi may hope the trade war eases up after the midterm elections, but he seems ready to dig in. \u201cIf it comes down to a war of attrition, China will win,\u201d says James L. McGregor, chairman of the greater China region for the consulting firm APCO Worldwide. \u201cAt the end of day, we may end up making China great again.\u201dChinese leaders have so far been careful not to rouse much nationalist fervor, however. In disputes with other countries \u2014 France, Japan and, most recently, South Korea \u2014 Beijing ramped up the hostility, orchestrated street protests and even encouraged consumer boycotts. The trade war has evoked a more measured response. Some Chinese-language articles online have highlighted China\u2019s historical grievances \u2014 \u201cNever Forget the Eight Lessons of the Opium War,\u201d one reads \u2014 but the official tack has been to calm public opinion. \u201cDon\u2019t attack Trump\u2019s vulgarity,\u201d a government guidance memo instructed media outlets earlier this summer, according to the website China Digital Times. \u201cDon\u2019t make this a war of insults.\u201dIf the trade war persists, China could make life even more difficult for American companies by adding to the web of nontariff barriers (red tape, for example) or by supporting a consumer boycott. American-owned subsidiaries in China sold $280 billion worth of goods and services there in 2017, more than double the amount of United States imports, and famous brands like Apple and Starbucks make about 20 percent of their revenue in China. As vulnerable as those companies might be, China has no interest, yet, in alienating its biggest market. \u201cAt some point, Chinese leaders may want to get nationalistic and stir up anger against U.S. companies, but that\u2019s a dangerous road,\u201d McGregor says. \u201cRight now, Chinese leaders are just studying the battlefield. They are not running around with shock and awe.\u201dAs the trade war escalates, in fact, China is seeking to shift the blame and portray itself suddenly as a champion of openness. In the past month, Beijing has approved two major deals \u2014 with Tesla and the German chemical giant BASF \u2014 that give those companies what the foreign business community has long desired: full ownership without the need for a local joint-venture partner. Xi Jinping also held a rare meeting with American and European business executives, though his words on the trade war were defiant. In the West, he reportedly told them, \u201cyou turn the other cheek. In our culture, we punch back.\u201dBack in Shanghai\u2019s former French Concession, Ye Fangsu walked me to the gate of her lane. Across the street stands an old factory that has been transformed into a cluster of hip new restaurants and marketplaces, selling everything from Japanese tapas to French pastries. Two young Chinese men with fancy fade haircuts parked their BMW and wandered in. \u201cChina is rich now,\u201d Ye said. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are better.\u201d Her neighborhood, once a symbol of China\u2019s weakness, is now evidence of its economic vitality. By her street-level calculus, that means China may have the strength, this time, to stand up to the West.Advertisement"}

With time, I believe that truth always wins out in the public markets, as has been the case for Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Salesforce, and other companies with visionary leaders.\u201dMs. Wood said that over time, Tesla would become less of a hardware company and more of what she called a \u201cmobility as a service\u201d provider. That includes providing autonomous cars and trucks on demand, similar to what Uber and other companies are racing toward. By her firm\u2019s calculations, that could lift Tesla\u2019s gross margins from 19 percent to 80 percent.But that kind of transformation would be more difficult to do as a private company, she wrote, given how much harder it would be for Tesla to tap public markets for financing.ARK\u2019s hyper-bullish valuation rests on a surge in Tesla\u2019s revenue to more than $180 billion over the next five years from $13 billion. Of course, Tesla has attracted plenty of investors with starkly different views of its prospects. They point to the company\u2019s production delays, cash burn and increasing competition to explain their bets against the stock.ARK expressed an interest in staying invested in Tesla if Mr. Musk succeeded, Ms. Wood said in a statement. Doing so might require revamping the rules of ARK\u2019s mutual funds that are invested in the company, and its exchange-traded funds would have to sell their holdings.If Mr. Musk keeps Tesla public, her firm\u2019s forecast for what the company\u2019s shares could be worth: between $700 and $4,000 in five years.Advertisement"}

One tidbit: He bumped up the price tag, which he\u2019d calculated at $419 a share, to $420 because it was more auspicious. (He added, \u201cI was not on weed, to be clear.\u201d But his use of Ambien and, occasionally, recreational drugs worries his board.)For his part, Mr. Musk has no regrets: \u201cWhy would I?\u201dGoogle\u2019s C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, said at a staff meeting yesterday that the company isn\u2019t close to unveiling that search product.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Says Tesla May Go Private, and Its Stock Soars", "Date": "2018-08-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk has become one of the world\u2019s most prominent chief executives, and a billionaire several times over, by boldly making big bets on ideas that few others thought possible.Through it all, he has shown a maverick \u2014 some would say arrogant \u2014 management style. On Tuesday, he may have outdone himself.In a terse and cryptic Twitter post, he declared that he was ready to take Tesla private. The stock market that made his company worth over $60 billion wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.\u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFunding secured.\u201dTesla\u2019s stock was already up sharply on a report that Saudi Arabia was taking a sizable stake in the company. But investors were left to puzzle out the implications of Mr. Musk\u2019s proposition, its relationship to the Saudi report, and even the authenticity of the tweet. And so, starting at 12:48 p.m., the market that Mr. Musk threatened to forsake went into a frenzy.At 2:08 p.m., with shares up more than 7 percent for the day, trading was halted pending news \u2014 news that finally came shortly before 3:30.\u201cI fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we\u2019re all trying to achieve,\u201d the statement said.Mr. Musk said that no final decision had yet been made about taking the company private, and that any such proposal would have to be approved by shareholders.He outlined a plan under which shareholders could be bought out for $420 a share \u2014 a 20 percent premium over the stock price after the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call last week \u2014 or they could remain as private shareholders.\u201cThis has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI own about 20 percent of the company now and don\u2019t envision that being substantially different after any deal is complete.\u201dTesla trading resumed 15 minutes before the end of the trading session, and the shares added to their gains, closing at $379.57, up 11 percent.Mr. Musk did not elaborate on any sources of financing to take Tesla private. The announcement followed a report that the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia had acquired a stake in the company.A person briefed on the matter, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal, said the Saudi fund had taken a stake of less than 5 percent.The Financial Times reported that the shares had been acquired for the fund in the secondary market with the help of JPMorgan Chase. The bank declined to comment.If the transaction got done at $420 per share, Tesla would be valued at just over $70 billion, making it the biggest deal in which a company is taken private.Although Tesla has become the most valuable American car company, it has yet to turn an annual profit since its founding in 2003. And its chief executive, a 47-year-old native of South Africa, has come under increasing pressure as he has scrambled to increase production of the Model 3, a midsize sedan that he is counting on to drive up revenue and enable the company to become profitable.Still, this is not the way multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts are typically announced. Companies would normally line up banks, private equity firms or other deep-pocketed investors to agree in advance to provide money to finance the purchase of shares.Officials representing a number of large banks and investment funds said on Tuesday that they had not talked with Tesla about financing a buyout, although it is possible the company had secured funding from other sources.Mr. Musk\u2019s comments on Tuesday \u2014 mentioning the specific price of a possible buyout and declaring that Tesla had already arranged funding \u2014 were virtually guaranteed to send the shares flying. Still, while it was unusual for a chief executive to make a market-moving announcement on Twitter, there is nothing improper about it on its face.But the S.E.C. has also advised that intentional releases of market-moving information on social media platforms or websites must be accompanied by a simultaneous release to the broader public. The delay between Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet and Tesla\u2019s corporate announcement could be of interest to the S.E.C., said Michael Liftik, a former deputy chief of staff at the commission who is now a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\u201cSimultaneously really means simultaneously,\u201d he said. And he said a tweet would be held to the same standard of factuality as a news release.Others pointed out that Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet could have opened his company up to legal exposure from investors with financial incentives to sue.\u201cWhat they have to show is there was a material misstatement, in these loose statements, by Mr. Musk,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia Law School\u2019s Center on Corporate Governance. Mr. Coffee said the statement \u201cfunding secured\u201d could be a legal gray area where plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys see an opportunity to make a case.\u201cThat\u2019s a very broad statement about what is still an extraordinarily amorphous transaction,\u201d Mr. Coffee said.The S.E.C. had no comment, and Tesla would not comment beyond what was in Mr. Musk\u2019s statement to employees.Being a public company and reporting earnings every three months \u201cputs enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long term,\u201d he said. Having its stock traded publicly also means that Tesla can attract short-sellers \u2014 investors who are betting against Tesla \u2014 whom he described as \u201cpeople who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dTesla has attracted more so-called short-sellers than any other publicly traded company, in part because many investors doubt the company can achieve the lofty targets that Mr. Musk has set.Tesla\u2019s short-sellers on Tuesday racked up about $1.5 billion in losses, according to S3 Analytics, a technology and research firm. That brings their losses so far this year to $3 billion.Going private \u201cwould definitely benefit Elon Musk and the way he\u2019d like to run the company,\u201d said Efraim Levy, an analyst at CFRA Research. \u201cIt\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t like the intrusion he gets as a public company.\u201dHe has also objected to analysts\u2019 conclusions that the company may have to raise additional capital from investors later this year as it continues to post losses and use up hundreds of millions of dollars in cash each quarter.Mr. Levy, the analyst, said that even if Tesla went private, it would probably still need to borrow to pursue its plans for new models and new factories. \u201cThe question is whether they will have the same investor support,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a private company with a lot of debt, the risk goes up.\u201dHe characterized Mr. Musk\u2019s management style as \u201cunique.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of unexpected surprises,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to the ambitions of SpaceX, a company run by Tesla\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.

{"Headline": "Tesla Slashes Spending, and May Add to Its Troubles", "Date": "2018-08-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs questions swirl about whether Tesla will go private \u2014 and the well-being of its chief executive, Elon Musk \u2014 one crucial factor looms large over the fate of the electric car company: Tesla\u2019s own financial health.The company has undertaken drastic measures as it seeks profitability, cutting costs and even erecting a tent-covered third assembly line at its manufacturing plant. But many of those tactics may not be sustainable for long, and some could even hurt the company down the road.The state of Tesla\u2019s balance sheet, and particularly its near-term cash position, are important to the company\u2019s future, perhaps even more so since Mr. Musk\u2019s surprise declaration on Aug. 7 that he would explore taking the company private.\u201cTesla is going to be profitable and cash flow positive,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cFrom a Tesla standpoint, I think it is a good place.\u201dHis remarks echo what he said on the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, when he predicted the company would turn a profit in the next quarter.Mr. Musk is under intense pressure from Wall Street to make good on that promise, and Tesla has been plagued by manufacturing issues while ramping up production of its mass-market Model 3.Meanwhile, short-sellers continue to target the stock, injecting a destabilizing element to the company\u2019s share price. Good financial results would be bad news for the hedge funds betting Tesla will fail, and serve as vindication for Mr. Musk.And Tesla\u2019s financial position will have a significant impact on any potential effort to take Tesla private. Investors evaluating a potential take-private deal will be assessing not only Tesla\u2019s long-term prospects, but its current cash on hand and debts.To achieve that profitability, Tesla is scrambling to slash spending in almost all areas of it operations.In June, it announced it would lay off about 3,500 employees, about 9 percent of its work force, in a cost-cutting move. It has approached some suppliers about refunding some money Tesla has paid for projects that are still underway.Tesla has said it is working to reduce costs by delivering completed vehicles faster. At the end of second quarter, it held inventory valued at $579 million, a figure the company said was \u201ca substantial increase\u201d from previous quarters.And Tesla has even more drastic cost cutting plans in store. It has said it plans to cut capital expenditures by a fourth this year \u2014 to about $2.5 billion from $3.4 billion in 2017.\u201cThere are a lot of levers they are pulling to be cash-flow neutral or positive in the second half, but there\u2019s trade-offs,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein.Tesla declined to comment for this story.But while analysts say Tesla may very well achieve profitability soon, the spending cuts necessary to do so could be costly, delaying the introduction of new models that could help boost revenues.\u201cThose are not necessarily the best for the long-term growth of the company,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said. \u201cCutting back on capex is not sustainable,\u201d he said, referring to capital expenditures. \u201cCutting inventories is not sustainable.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, Tesla\u2019s push to conserve cash will soon be complicated by two bond payments that come due in the next several months.It is scheduled to pay off a $230 million convertible bond in November, and a payment of $920 million on a second convertible bond is due next February. Tesla could pay the second bond in stock instead of cash, if its share price is above $360. It has traded above that level in recent weeks, but on Friday it closed at $305.50.Tesla has slipped into financial difficulties, in part because of how much cash it has been using up \u2014 nearly $1 billion every three months. It ended the second quarter with $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the beginning of the year.The company\u2019s precarious cash position prompted Moody\u2019s Investors Service to downgrade Tesla\u2019s debt in March, citing \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201dMr. Musk has said no such capital raise would be necessary, because Tesla will soon be profitable. But Bruce Clark of Moody\u2019s said he still expected the company may have to tap the capital markets.\u201cThe company has made some important progress with the Model 3 production and has reduced capital expenditures, but I still think they are going to need additional capital,\u201d Mr. Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as tight as it had been, but they have to stay on the track they\u2019ve been on recently.\u201dMr. Musk has said that the production issues that bedeviled Tesla earlier this year are being resolved.Those gains have required round-the-clock production, however, which may not be possible for Tesla to sustain. Other automakers have found 24-hour production is untenable in the long run because workers become burned out and machinery tends to break down more frequently.To deal with the investigation, the Tesla board and the special committee of the board evaluating a potential buyout, have each retained law firms. Additionally, the special committee has retained a crisis communications firm, and other public relations firms are angling for assignments.Those legal fees will add up, and the threat of lengthy legal proceedings could also complicate Tesla\u2019s efforts to raise more cash should it need to.Early Sunday morning, Mr. Musk took to Twitter and reminded his followers just how hard he is working as he struggles to make Tesla profitable.Responding to a post from Arianna Huffington, the Huffington Post founder and member of Uber\u2019s board of directors, who suggested he take a vacation and focus on his physical and mental health, Mr. Musk said: \u201cI just got home from the factory.

Over the past year, at lunches with various Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, I have been told at least four times that magic mushrooms will help me become a better reporter (maybe) and three times that Ecstasy will make me a nicer person (doubt it). I have also been offered several chances to microdose on LSD (pass!) and now that it is legal in California, weed, weed and more weed in every conceivable delivery method (yum, gummy bears!).He had me until vomiting. Thanks, but no thanks. Now Burning Man, the annual gathering in Nevada\u2019s Black Rock Desert, is about to begin. Techies and many others will flock there to look at art, dress in costumes, burn things and perhaps discover the next great start-up idea with the help of a tiny bit of ketamine. \u201cNo one can afford to lose a step here anymore, so they want to hack the experience to make it work for their time-constrained schedules,\u201d said one techie. \u201cYou want to be super lucid now.\u201dAnother tech executive compares it to what Bradley Cooper did in the movie \u201cLimitless,\u201d about a man who uses a mystery drug to become much smarter than anyone else. \u201cIt was a terrible movie, but the idea of a having a heightened sense of awareness and also being totally functional appeals to people now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever can get you to that place without a lot of downside \u2014 like addiction \u2014 is preferred.\u201dThat is why everyone he knows microdoses, saving the longer-acting drugs like Ecstasy for the rare occasions when they want to party and relax. As always, Adderall is often used to plow through work.And marijuana, he told me, had become more like drinking a glass of wine, noting that he sees people openly vaping at tech events. Why? \u201cNo one does a stupid tweet on weed like they might on alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most that happens is that you get lazy and eat badly.\u201dIt is all, another tech worker said, about the \u201cintellectualizing of drug use as a stimulant for the brain.\u201dMichael Pollan, whose recent book, \u201cHow to Change Your Mind,\u201d talks about the resurgence of psychedelic drugs, told me in an interview that the exploration of drugs by tech workers remains part of the industry\u2019s \u201chacking ethos.\u201d\u201cScientists answer specific questions, but engineers deal with complex irreducible variables that you need to find patterns in,\u201d Mr. Pollan said. \u201cLSD helps with that.\u201d His book also discusses new studies being done on the use of psychedelics to treat depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, which are getting big financial support from techies. That research might eventually move the category of drugs from their turn-on-tune-in-drop-out heyday in counterculture San Francisco to the mainstream. \u201cIt is all about finding a technology to improve biology,\u201d said Mr. Pollan. He recently met someone who had just made a fortune selling his start-up and was now experimenting with mind-altering drugs. \u201cHe told me he had discovered art and he never knew how to look at it until he used these drugs,\u201d said Mr. Pollan. \u201cHis entire life as a young kid was looking at a screen, and it was like he was in a tunnel the whole time and now was not.\u201d\u201cThey have taken something like microdosing and kind of made it into a product,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take a moment of inspiration and adapt it to capitalism.\u201dIn other words, to make more money.

{"Headline": "In Elon Musk\u2019s World, Brakes Are for Cars, Not C.E.O.s", "Date": "2018-08-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk was up early on Saturday. He departed Los Angeles, where he runs SpaceX, his private rocket venture, and flew north in his white Gulfstream jet. Stopping in Silicon Valley, he picked up two engineers from Tesla, his electric-car company. They flew on to Reno, Nev., where they spent the day at Tesla\u2019s battery plant, the Gigafactory.It might have been just another workday for Mr. Musk \u2014 a multistate jaunt to personally fix a drive-unit production line. But this was no ordinary morning. He was a brief night\u2019s sleep removed from one of his most consequential decisions: scrapping his plan to take Tesla private.\u201cThe reason Elon seems to attract drama is that he is so transparent, so open, in a way that can come back to bite him,\u201d said Kimbal Musk, Mr. Musk\u2019s younger brother and a Tesla board member. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to do it differently. It\u2019s just who he is.\u201dMr. Musk, a brilliant but erratic billionaire, is the animating force behind Tesla, responsible for everything from its push into renewable energy to the design of the air vents in its newest electric car. His singular role gives him extraordinary influence over the fate of Tesla, its more than 40,000 employees and its investors.Associates, including several people inside the company interviewed over the past week, portray him as a workaholic who zeroes in on the smallest details. His deep involvement suggests that the company can\u2019t do without him. Yet these days, it\u2019s not always clear that he knows what\u2019s best for Tesla.And at the office, he is hardly a typical chief executive. Racing to resolve critical production issues, he can often be found on the factory floor, working to fix robots. At night, he sometimes sleeps under his desk. All the while, he has been confronting an exodus of senior employees, preparing to be interviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and was working with Goldman Sachs and Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to take Tesla private \u2014 until he wasn\u2019t.James Anderson, a partner at the asset management firm Baillie Gifford, Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder after Mr. Musk, said he still had faith in the 47-year-old chief executive, calling him a \u201cvisionary leader\u201d who had unmatched technical expertise and remained \u201cobsessive about the details.\u201dYet Mr. Anderson said he had grown increasingly worried about Mr. Musk, believing that his volatile personal life and intense work ethic were taking a steep toll. \u201cHe is so demanding, so driven by the imperative to do something good for the world,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cYou could always see something like this happening.\u201dAt 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 18, three robots in the paint shop at the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., started malfunctioning. The incident forced a production halt on the Model 3, the key to the company\u2019s future.Made aware of the stoppage, Mr. Musk went to the factory and worked into the night. The problem was resolved, but Tesla reached a troubling conclusion: The robots had been infected with malware in an act of industrial sabotage. And though they could not prove it and did not level any specific allegations, executives suspected they knew the culprit: a rogue employee, working at the behest of short-sellers.Tesla is among the most shorted stocks, meaning that hedge funds are betting against it and quick to note a missed production goal or cash shortfall. David Einhorn, the billionaire founder of Greenlight Capital, is in that camp. In a letter to investors last month detailing his argument, Mr. Einhorn wrote, \u201cElon Musk appears erratic and desperate.\u201dKimbal Musk, reflecting on the battles with short-sellers, said, \u201cWe feel like we are at war.\u201dPlenty of other companies face the wrath of short-sellers. The issue at Tesla seems to be that for Mr. Musk \u2014 who talks earnestly about weaning the world off fossil fuels with Tesla, and colonizing the solar system with SpaceX \u2014 these attacks are not just the cost of doing business. They are malicious and misguided efforts to derail his efforts to help humanity.\u201cTesla is his baby,\u201d said Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cHe takes it extremely personally.\u201dBut with Tesla now staying public, Mr. Musk will have to continue to contend with those who doubt his vision and are rooting for Tesla to fail.The delays were a result of what Mr. Musk called \u201cmanufacturing hell,\u201d an inferno that has preoccupied him for much of the past year. \u201cThis has been the most difficult time for Tesla,\u201d said JB Straubel, the company\u2019s chief technical officer. \u201cWe knew this was going to be the case, but it\u2019s been even harder than any of us expected.\u201dSome of the wounds were self-inflicted.In preparing the assembly lines, Mr. Musk became convinced that the process should be close to fully automated, using robots rather than humans whenever possible. Doing so, he believed, could make cars move through the factory at one meter per second, 10 to 20 times the speed of existing lines.So Tesla built a factory with hundreds of robots, many programmed to perform tasks that humans could easily do. One robot, which Mr. Musk nicknamed the \u201cflufferbot,\u201d was designed to simply place a sound-dampening piece of fiberglass atop the battery pack.But the flufferbot never really worked. It would fail to pick up the fiberglass, or put it in the wrong place, frequently delaying production. It was eventually replaced by factory workers.As the challenges have mounted, Mr. Musk has thrown himself into his work, spending hours each week walking factory floors, trying to diagnose and fix various problems on the assembly line.\u201cHe demands personal accountability from the people that are closest to the machines,\u201d Mr. Straubel said. \u201cThis freaks people out. They are worried that he will come to their area and start asking questions.\u201dAmid the turnover, Mr. Musk has become even more hands-on. Recently, he and Mr. Straubel were at the Gigafactory, assessing a bottleneck in the manufacturing process. A machine that wound electrodes into formations known as jelly rolls was too slow, and employees could not figure out a remedy.Then Mr. Musk intervened, suggesting that the machine be reprogrammed to work more rapidly. By the end of the day, the machine was 10 percent faster.It was a small victory, and a reminder of Mr. Musk\u2019s technical acumen. But it was also a stark example of how he operates. Apparently unable or unwilling to delegate, the chief executive has embedded with the line workers.\u201cA C.E.O.\u2019s most important job is build a great team around you,\u201d said Bill George, the former chief executive of the medical device maker Medtronic and a Goldman Sachs board member. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the factory floor. I\u2019d rather have him sleeping at home.\u201dMr. Musk has increasingly complained about his lifestyle\u2019s physical toll. He has said he works 120 hours a week, sometimes not going outside for days at a time. At a meeting last week at SpaceX, he was lying on the floor in his cubicle, using a foam roller to relax his back muscles.\u201cHe is absolutely working incredibly hard, but Elon has always worked incredibly hard,\u201d said Mr. Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cHe\u2019s very tough, too. He can eat glass.\u201d\u201cI know that it has been a difficult year for him,\u201d said Gwynne Shotwell, the SpaceX president and chief operating officer. \u201cNot because he\u2019s frowning or throwing things, but because I can tell he\u2019s physically exhausted.\u201dIn the interview with The Times, Mr. Musk said his work had been so consuming that he nearly missed Kimbal\u2019s wedding in Spain this summer. \u201cI got there two hours before the ceremony,\u201d he said. \u201cI left directly from the factory. And then I went straight back.\u201dBut while Mr. Musk is clearly working hard, his recounting paints an incomplete picture of his travels. He was away for five days during his trip to Spain, and on the way back, he stopped with his children in Belfast, Northern Ireland, to tour the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d set.Mr. Musk also told The Times that he had not taken a full week off since 2001, while recovering from malaria. But he has made time for memorable holidays over the past year.A few days before New Year\u2019s Eve, he boarded his jet with Kimbal, their families and another close friend, Bryn Mooser. The plan was to go to Antarctica. But on the way there, weather worsened, and they had to land in Santiago, Chile.\u201cHe cares deeply about the world and the people on it,\u201d Mr. Mooser said. \u201cHis fault is that he cares too much, sometimes.\u201dOn Thursday morning, Mr. Musk addressed his board at a hastily convened meeting in a conference room at the Tesla factory. His sleeping bag was still on the floor. When he announced that Tesla would be staying public, at least one director cheered out loud.Mr. Musk\u2019s stunning reversal came about after he realized that while going private would remove some headaches \u2014 such as short-sellers \u2014 it could introduce others, including entanglements with conventional auto companies or oil kingdoms that hardly symbolize an all-electric future.Peter Henning, professor of law at Wayne State University, said Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet was \u201cclearly incomplete disclosure,\u201d adding that if the S.E.C. decided to pursue a fraud case, the consequences could be severe.\u201cThe penalty that scares everyone is a director and officer bar,\u201d Mr. Henning said. \u201cIf you are found to have misled investors, the S.E.C. can seek to bar you from serving as an officer or director of a public company. That could remove Elon Musk from Tesla.\u201dMr. Musk also must contend with a shareholder lawsuit that challenges Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, his solar panel business. And he must try to replenish the executive ranks and stabilize Model 3 production, all while managing his volatile social life.As he juggles these disparate challenges, Tesla\u2019s fans and foes will be scrutinizing Mr. Musk\u2019s words, his actions and even his moods. Will he spar with short-sellers on Twitter? Will he erupt on the next analyst call?Whatever he is thinking, Mr. Musk seems likely to make it known. \u201cElon always speaks very frankly, sometimes to his detriment,\u201d Ms. Shotwell said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way he knows how to communicate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(That\u2019s more than 17 hours a day.)And that doesn\u2019t count those of us who take work home.With that in mind, we spoke to Anat Lechner, a business professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, about mental health in the workplace and how to avoid hitting a breaking point.What are some of the signs that a colleague is hitting a breaking point?The signs are usually emotional. \u201cYou can see people get angry, short, and start to resent the people who don\u2019t work as hard,\u201d Ms. Lechner said. Another telltale sign: sloppiness. But it\u2019s important to understand what messy work means, she added. \u201cPeople who become overburdened, and therefore become sloppy, are usually your best employees. Weak employees drop off the bus quickly. The best employees are the people who get assigned more and more work. An overburdened employee is a reflection of bad management.\u201dWhat are the best ways to personally prevent a breaking point?Avoidance and engagement. \u201cAvoid being on the grid 24-7,\u201d Ms. Lechner said. \u201cCarve out for yourself the three or four hours that you need every day to get off the grid and relax and teach the rest of the world, as well as yourself, that not all hours are email hours.\u201d And engage more effectively. \u201cLearn to collaborate better. When you learn the skill of collaboration, or working together, the work naturally gets distributed more effectively,\u201d she said.How can I help a struggling colleague?Talk, listen and lend a hand.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Keep your umbrella at the ready.Showers are very likely this morning, with bouts of heavy rain, and we may see thunderstorms.The day will gradually get drier and we may see a fair bit of sun before it hits the horizon.And the gig economy, as it\u2019s known, can come with its own pressures: a lack of financial security, access to health care or a comfortable place to work that doesn\u2019t make you buy a $4 coffee.But soon, New York freelancers will get a boost.At 10 a.m. today, the Mayor\u2019s Office of Media and Entertainment will announce the creation of a \u201cFreelancers Hub\u201d at the Made in NY Media Center in Dumbo, Brooklyn.Think of the hub as a free WeWork with areas for networking, legal clinics for workers and workshops in marketing, accounting and filing your taxes.It\u2019s the first effort by an American city to create a hub for freelancers who work in the gig economy, according to the Office of Media and Entertainment.The new center, operated by the Freelancers Union, is geared toward freelancers in media and entertainment.It\u2019s slated to open in early October.Advertisement"}

Others, who have enjoyed working with him for decades, say they are \u201cstunned\u201d by the revelations and still processing. But there\u2019s another reason for the quiet that no one will admit: I believe many men in the entertainment industry are staying mum because these charges hit too close to home. I\u2019ve heard grumbling from colleagues, male and female, that the rules on sexual harassment are \u201cconfusing\u201d and that behavior from decades ago can\u2019t be viewed through today\u2019s prism. Actually, the laws are clear and have been in place for almost four decades. Sexual harassment is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as recognized by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1980 and affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1986. If someone with the power to hire or fire makes a sexual advance, it\u2019s not a line being crossed \u2014 it\u2019s a law being broken.\u201cAlthough the law doesn\u2019t prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not very serious, harassment is illegal when it is so frequent or severe that it creates a hostile or offensive work environment or when it results in an adverse employment decision (such as the victim being fired or demoted).\u201dThe laws haven\u2019t suddenly changed, but what may be shifting are the unwritten yet commonly accepted rules of Hollywood. No one gives up perks without a fight, and the ending of this CBS drama has yet to be written. Two New York City law firms are investigating the allegations and overall corporate culture at the network while Mr. Moonves remains at the top. And while we wait, the question being quietly texted all over town is: \u201cWill he keep his job?\u201d Answers range from \u201cNah, he\u2019s gone\u201d to \u201cHe just has to wait for it to blow over\u201d to \u201cSix months ago, I would have said he\u2019d go down but now I don\u2019t know.\u201d Yes, there\u2019s silence in Hollywood, but the screaming inside the heads of women is as loud as ever.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Details \u2018Excruciating\u2019 Personal Toll of Tesla Turmoil", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk was at home in Los Angeles, struggling to maintain his composure. \u201cThis past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was excruciating.\u201dIn an hourlong interview with The New York Times, he choked up multiple times, noting that he nearly missed his brother\u2019s wedding this summer and spent his birthday holed up in Tesla\u2019s offices as the company raced to meet elusive production targets on a crucial new model.Asked if the exhaustion was taking a toll on his physical health, Mr. Musk answered: \u201cIt\u2019s not been great, actually. I\u2019ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u201dFor two decades, Mr. Musk has been one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most brash and ambitious entrepreneurs, helping to found several influential technology companies. He has often carried himself with bravado, dismissing critics and relishing the spotlight that has come with his success and fortune. But in the interview, he demonstrated an extraordinary level of self-reflection and vulnerability, acknowledging that his myriad executive responsibilities are taking a steep personal toll.In the interview, Mr. Musk provided a detailed timeline of the events leading up to the Twitter postings on Aug. 7 in which he said he was considering taking the company private at $420 a share. He asserted that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for such a deal \u2014 a transaction likely to be worth well over $10 billion.That morning, Mr. Musk woke up at home with his girlfriend, the musician known as Grimes, and had an early workout. Then he got in a Tesla Model S and drove himself to the airport. En route, Mr. Musk typed his fateful message.Mr. Musk has said he saw the tweet as an attempt at transparency. He acknowledged Thursday that no one had seen or reviewed it before he posted it.Tesla\u2019s shares soared. Investors, analysts and journalists puzzled over the tweet \u2014 published in the middle of the day\u2019s official market trading, an unusual time to release major news \u2014 including the price Mr. Musk cited. He said in the interview that he wanted to offer a roughly 20 percent premium over where the stock had been recently trading, which would have been about $419. He decided to round up to $420 \u2014 a number that has become code for marijuana in counterculture lore.\u201cIt seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBut I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dMr. Musk reached the airport and flew on a private plane to Nevada, where he spent the day visiting a Tesla battery plant known as the Gigafactory, including time meeting with managers and working on an assembly line. That evening, he flew to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he held Tesla meetings late into the night.What Mr. Musk meant by \u201cfunding secured\u201d has become an important question. Those two words helped propel Tesla\u2019s shares higher.But that funding, it turned out, was far from secure.Mr. Musk has said he was referring to a potential investment by Saudi Arabia\u2019s government investment fund. Mr. Musk had extensive talks with representatives of the $250 billion fund about possibly financing a transaction to take Tesla private \u2014 maybe even in a manner that would have resulted in the Saudis\u2019 owning most of the company. One of those sessions took place on July 31 at the Tesla factory in the Bay Area, according to a person familiar with the meeting. But the Saudi fund had not committed to provide any cash, two people briefed on the discussions said.Another possibility under consideration is that SpaceX, Mr. Musk\u2019s rocket company, would help bankroll the Tesla privatization and would take an ownership stake in the carmaker, according to people familiar with the matter.Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet kicked off a chain reaction.An hour and 20 minutes after the tweet, with Tesla\u2019s shares up 7 percent, the Nasdaq stock exchange halted trading, and Tesla published a letter to employees from Mr. Musk explaining the rationale for possibly taking the company private. When the shares resumed trading, they continued their climb, ending the day with an 11 percent gain.The next day, investigators in the San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission asked Tesla for explanations. Ordinarily, such material information about a public company\u2019s plans is laid out in detail after extensive internal preparation and issued through official channels. Board members, blindsided by the chief executive\u2019s market-moving statement, were angry that they had not been briefed, two people familiar with the matter said. They scrambled to cobble together a public statement trying to defuse a mounting uproar over the seemingly haphazard communication.Mr. Musk said in the interview that board members had not complained to him about his tweet. \u201cI don\u2019t recall getting any communications from the board at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely did not get calls from irate directors.\u201dBut shortly after the Times published its interview with Mr. Musk, he added through a Tesla spokeswoman that Antonio Gracias, Tesla\u2019s lead independent director, had indeed contacted him to discuss the Aug. 7 Twitter post, and that he had agreed not to tweet again about the possible privatization deal unless he had discussed it with the board.In the interview, Mr. Musk added that he did not regret his Twitter post \u2014 \u201cWhy would I?\u201d \u2014 and said he had no plans to stop using the social media platform. Some board members, however, have recently told Mr. Musk that he should lay off Twitter and focus on making cars and launching rockets, according to people familiar with the matter.The S.E.C. investigation appears to be intensifying rapidly. Just days after the agency\u2019s request for information, Tesla\u2019s board and Mr. Musk received S.E.C. subpoenas, according to a person familiar with the matter. Board members and Mr. Musk are preparing to meet with S.E.C. officials as soon as next week, the person said.In the interview on Thursday, Mr. Musk alternated between laughter and tears.He said he had been working up to 120 hours a week recently \u2014 echoing the reason he cited in a recent public apology to an analyst whom he had berated. In the interview, Mr. Musk said he had not taken more than a week off since 2001, when he was bedridden with malaria.\u201cThere were times when I didn\u2019t leave the factory for three or four days \u2014 days when I didn\u2019t go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has really come at the expense of seeing my kids. And seeing friends.\u201dMr. Musk stopped talking, seemingly overcome by emotion.He turned 47 on June 28, and he said he spent the full 24 hours of his birthday at work. \u201cAll night \u2014 no friends, nothing,\u201d he said, struggling to get the words out.Two days later, he was scheduled to be the best man at the wedding of his brother, Kimbal, in Catalonia. Mr. Musk said he flew directly there from the factory, arriving just two hours before the ceremony. Immediately afterward, he got back on the plane and returned straight to Tesla headquarters, where work on the mass-market Model 3 has been all consuming.Mr. Musk paused again.\u201cI thought the worst of it was over \u2014 I thought it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThe worst is over from a Tesla operational standpoint.\u201d He continued: \u201cBut from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come.\u201dHe blamed short-sellers \u2014 investors who bet that Tesla\u2019s shares will lose value \u2014 for much of his stress. He said he was bracing for \u201cat least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla\u2019s destruction.\u201dReferring to the short-sellers, he added: \u201cThey\u2019re not dumb guys, but they\u2019re not supersmart. They\u2019re O.K. They\u2019re smartish.\u201dTo help sleep when he is not working, Mr. Musk said he sometimes takes Ambien. \u201cIt is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien,\u201d he said.But this has worried some board members, who have noted that sometimes the drug does not put Mr. Musk to sleep but instead contributes to late-night Twitter sessions, according to a person familiar with the board\u2019s thinking. Some board members are also aware that Mr. Musk has on occasion used recreational drugs, according to people familiar with the matter.Tesla executives have been trying for years to recruit a chief operating officer or other No. 2 executive to assume some of Mr. Musk\u2019s day-to-day responsibilities, according to people familiar with the matter. A couple of years ago, Mr. Musk said, the company approached Sheryl Sandberg, who is Facebook\u2019s second-highest executive, about the job.Mr. Musk said that \u201cto the best of my knowledge,\u201d there is \u201cno active search right now.\u201d But people familiar with the matter said a search is underway, and one person said it had intensified in the wake of Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets.In response to questions for this article, Tesla provided a statement that it attributed to its board, excluding Elon Musk. \u201cThere have been many false and irresponsible rumors in the press about the discussions of the Tesla board,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe would like to make clear that Elon\u2019s commitment and dedication to Tesla is obvious. Over the past 15 years, Elon\u2019s leadership of the Tesla team has caused Tesla to grow from a small start-up to having hundreds of thousands of cars on the road that customers love, employing tens of thousands of people around the world, and creating significant shareholder value in the process.\u201dMr. Musk said he had no plans to relinquish his dual roles as chairman and chief executive.But, he added, \u201cif you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job. Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.\u201dAndrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How China Wins the Trade War", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Lovely is a professor of economics and an expert on trade with China.If jobs and wealth are the metric for \u201cwinning the trade war,\u201d China, not America, will emerge the victor. China will win not because of one-party rule, although it certainly helps President Xi Jinping weather difficulties caused by trade tensions. Rather, China will win because it is playing this game more skillfully. The tariffs imposed by the United States will mostly be paid by American companies and consumers, while China is retaliating with moves that soften the blow for companies in China, including those that are foreign-owned.To \u201cwin\u201d a trade war on these terms, the United States would have to impose tariffs that somehow hurt the Chinese economy so badly that its leaders improve their treatment of American intellectual property, a longtime demand by American trade negotiators. The health of China\u2019s economy depends on exporting to the United States, so, the thinking goes, the Chinese government will capitulate to American demands.This strategy is certain to backfire.First, about 60 percent of China\u2019s exports to the United States are produced at factories owned by non-Chinese companies. Many of them produce customized inputs for American manufacturers, such as computer routers, LED fixtures and boat motors. That means the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration that are directed at China actually affect many American (and European) companies that own factories in China.Reduced American demand for Chinese products does hurt China. American merchandise imports account for about 3 percent of Chinese manufacturing revenue. That\u2019s a large enough share for tariffs to do a bit of damage, but certainly not catastrophic.Moreover, much of what the United States imports from China contains value created in other locations, including America. Much of the value in an iPhone imported from China, for example, includes displays from South Korea, chips from Japan and design and programming from America. So each dollar of sales lost by a Chinese company actually has a less-than-$1 impact on the Chinese economy. In computers and electronics, which account for the largest share of China\u2019s exports to the United States, the Chinese value added in each dollar of imports is about 50 cents. Consequently, the negative effect of tariffs on Chinese manufacturing is unlikely to be large enough to have much of an impact on China\u2019s trade practices.As the trade war escalates, China\u2019s leadership appears to have deepened its commitment to international supply chains. This is the opposite of the Trump administration, which seems intent on isolating American manufacturers.To be sure, China still engages in policies that undermine fairness in the world trading system. China has failed, for example, to meet commitments to open specific sectors to foreign participation. It also continues to subsidize heavy industries that flood markets in other countries, depressing prices and causing job losses. But the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump fail to address these challenges.Instead, when the next round of tariffs hits, American households will face higher prices on computers, clothing and thousands of other products. China, not the United States, will improve its standing in the world as a place to make and build the future.Mary E. Lovely is a professor of economics at Syracuse University and a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cities\u2019 Offers for Amazon Base Are Secrets Even to Many City Leaders", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJared Evans, a member of the Indianapolis City-County Council, is proud that the city is among 20 finalists for one of the most coveted prizes in the country: the planned second headquarters of Amazon.He does, however, have one small question: What financial incentives did his city dangle in front of Amazon?\u201cWhat have I been told?\u201d Mr. Evans said. \u201cAbsolutely nothing.\u201dAcross the country, the search for HQ2, as the project has been nicknamed, is shrouded in secrecy. Even civic leaders can\u2019t find out what sort of tax credits and other inducements have been promised to Amazon. And there is a growing legal push to find out, because taxpayers could get saddled with a huge bill and have little chance to stop it.\u201cThe only time the public may become aware if the city has promised Amazon incentives is if we win and then we need to get those incentives passed,\u201d Mr. Evans said.A primary reason for the information blackout is that, in many cases, the bids were handled by local private Chamber of Commerce affiliates or economic development groups that aren\u2019t required to make their negotiations public. Many of the groups are also not covered by Freedom of Information Act or state open-records requests.But another reason is gamesmanship. Some cities say they want their Amazon proposals to remain confidential to avoid showing their hand to rivals. And Amazon required the finalists to sign nondisclosure agreements that forbid the local groups to release proprietary information about the company.\u201cI don\u2019t know what we offered Amazon in terms of financial incentives, but I believe Amazon wants to see the biggest incentive package that any city will offer them,\u201d said Leslie Pool, a member of the Austin City Council. The city, also a finalist, submitted a bid put together by the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, which had no consultations with the City Council.But that kind of transparency is the exception.\u201cWe are not releasing documents related to Amazon HQ2. We are not subject to F.O.I.A.,\u201d Michael Finney, the president and chief executive of the Miami-Dade Beacon Council, a public-private partnership that handled the Amazon bid, said in an email. Similar requests to Austin, Atlanta and Indianapolis met with similar responses.And when officials in Montgomery County, Md., did respond to a request for information on their bid, they delivered, among other items, a 10-page document of incentives \u2014 with every single line of text redacted.Companies are often stealthy when searching for a location for a critical factory or relocating a headquarters, as General Electric or Bechtel have done in recent years. And it has been reported that Apple has been holding behind-closed-doors meetings with government leaders as it shops for a new corporate campus.In the case of Amazon, it is the size and scope of its search that some officials find shocking \u2014 and galling.\u201cTypically, you see companies bid a couple of places against each other as they try to land a corporate deal,\u201d said Brad Lander, a member of the New York City Council who has not seen the city\u2019s proposal to Amazon. (New York is a finalist.) \u201cThis process is highly unusual. It creates a real race-to-the-bottom aspect with the potential of companies bidding multiple cities against one another.\u201dIt is unclear how much promised tax credits and financial incentives will weigh into Amazon\u2019s decision. Three of the first four questions Amazon asked cities to answer in their proposals were centered on incentives. But the e-commerce giant also sought information on possible building sites, the local labor force, transit options, computer science programs in local schools and cost-of-living data.The cities see more at stake than just the jobs and investment that Amazon\u2019s second headquarters would bring. Amazon says its presence and investment in Seattle have created an additional 53,000 jobs beyond its own direct hires and added $38 billion to Seattle\u2019s economy from 2010 to 2016.But there have also been serious downsides for the city. In a be-careful-of-what-you-ask-for address to the U.S. Conference of Mayors this summer, Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle said that housing prices in her city average $824,000, that rents have soared 57 percent in the last five years and that there are 4,000 homeless people on the streets every night.Those are the types of concerns raised by Ms. Pool, the Austin councilwoman. Ms. Pool said she thought her city lacked the infrastructure and housing to accommodate 50,000 high-paying jobs and that such fast growth would alter the city\u2019s socioeconomic makeup and quality of life.\u201cThis is a city where you want to put down roots,\u201d Ms. Pool said. \u201cThe people here are the friendliest. The parks are beautiful. But if someone like Amazon comes in, a big con is the massive amount of dislocation it causes. You put out the small businesses and longtime property owners, the very businesses and people that give the city its flavor and, I would argue, its brand.\u201dStill, the project is too good to pass up, even for some of the nation\u2019s mayors who are most focused on housing and affordability, such as Bill de Blasio of New York and Rahm Emanuel of Chicago.\u201cThey are about ending inequality and creating more inclusive cities,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the School of Cities and the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. \u201cNow they\u2019re in a game competing with one another to throw money at one of the most powerful companies in the world run by one of the world\u2019s richest men.\u201dMr. Florida was on the board of directors for Toronto Global, whose bid is one of the 20 finalists, but he said he resigned this year so that he could raise concerns about the general lack of transparency in the bidding.\u201cI think the lack of transparency of this whole process is galling,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be all out in the public. This is taxpayer money.\u201dEventually, the taxpayers whose area wins will have to be told how much money Amazon was promised. And when they discover how much they will have to hand over, Mr. Florida said, \u201cthere is going to be hell to pay.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Did Elon Musk Violate Securities Laws With Tweet About Taking Tesla Private?", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseElon Musk had better be right.At two sentences and just 53 characters \u2014 \u201cAm considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\u201d \u2014 it was probably the shortest offer ever. (General Motors\u2019 prospectus in 2010 was over 230 pages.)The announcement came via Twitter at about 12:48 p.m. from Mr. Musk personally, not, as is customary, in a news release or regulatory filing from the company.Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.Mr. Musk offered no basis for the $420 offering price, which would ordinarily be arrived at after reams of analysis by investment bankers and negotiations with a committee of independent Tesla directors.Given the offbeat sense of humor that Mr. Musk has sometimes displayed in his Twitter posts, there was immediate speculation that the $420 figure was a reference to a widely used numerical code \u2014 420 \u2014 that refers to marijuana. (April 20, 4/20, is celebrated by some people as a kind of national marijuana holiday.)But it was Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201cfunding secured\u201d statement on Twitter that may put the iconoclastic founder most at risk. He provided no details about how much funding had been secured, from whom or under what conditions. His email to employees did not mention anything about the funding.\u201cThat\u2019s a clear factual statement,\u201d said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in corporate law and securities fraud. \u201cIf it\u2019s not fully secure, that\u2019s potentially a very material misrepresentation, and a very straightforward violation of Rule 10b-5\u201d of the securities law \u2014 in short, securities fraud.It is illegal for a director or officer of a public company \u201cto knowingly or recklessly make material misstatements about that company,\u201d said John Coates, a professor at Harvard Law School who teaches mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Musk\u2019s \u201ctweets seem cryptic at best, and it is hard to see how he has complied with his duty to not be misleadingly incomplete.\u201dA Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.The Securities and Exchange Commission contacted Tesla on Wednesday to inquire about the accuracy of Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets and why the announcement was not made in a regulatory filing, according to a person briefed on the inquiry, who was not authorized to speak publicly on behalf of the S.E.C. Such questions typically precede the launch of any formal investigation.Even at a time when Twitter is the preferred medium for presidential communiqu\u00e9s, this is no way to commence a takeover bid. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Professor Coates said. \u201cIf I assigned this scenario to my students, the list of legal issues would fill many pages.\u201dFor one thing, it is doubtful that a private Twitter account provides adequate notice for a public announcement of a $72 billion deal that is likely to move a stock\u2019s price. (By the end of the day, Tesla shares had shot up over 10 percent.)In 2013, the S.E.C. ruled, in a case involving the Netflix founder Reed Hastings, that companies can announce important news via social media as long as they have previously told investors they might do so, and simultaneously announce that news to the broader public.Mr. Hastings was not sanctioned for the relatively innocuous remark at issue in the matter: that Netflix subscribers had surpassed a viewing milestone of one billion hours. That\u2019s a far cry from Mr. Musk\u2019s announcing what would be the largest private buyout offer ever, one that could very well run afoul of the commission\u2019s guidance. (Tesla did say in a 2013 S.E.C. filing that it might use social media to make material information public.)\u201cThis approach doesn\u2019t even come close to adhering to S.E.C. rules,\u201d Professor Coffee said.Then there is the question of the price, for which Mr. Musk offered no rationale.\u201cA chief executive can\u2019t just say he\u2019s taking the company private at a price he determined, without any explanation and without any attempt to negotiate a deal,\u201d Professor Coates said. \u201cHe has to go to the board, which needs to appoint a special committee of independent directors, which would hire investment bankers and lawyers to help negotiate a deal. There must be some attempt at an arms-length transaction.\u201dProfessor Coates predicted a \u201cwelter\u201d of lawsuits from disgruntled shareholders and short sellers who lost money on the big jump in Tesla\u2019s stock price on Tuesday. And if the shares plunge on subsequent disclosures, disappointed buyers will sue, especially if no buyout materializes.Professor Coffee agreed. Short sellers, he noted, lost over a billion dollars on Tuesday and may be eager to sue, especially given Mr. Musk\u2019s frequently hostile comments about them. Punishing short sellers would be no justification for false or misleading statements.\u201cAnd you can be sure there will be people who sold their Tesla stock before the price ran up, who will say they didn\u2019t follow Musk on Twitter and didn\u2019t know about his tweet,\u201d Professor Coffee added. \u201cThere are plenty of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers who would be happy to take that case.\u201dMr. Musk has also put the company itself in an awkward situation. \u201cIf I were their lawyer, I\u2019d tell them to have an 8-K filing at the S.E.C. the first thing in the morning,\u201d Professor Coates said, referring to a regulatory filing used to disseminate information that may be important to shareholders. \u201cIt needs to explain if this was a joke or a mistake, and if not, what he really meant.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shadow of Mt. Etna, Europe Makes a Last Stand for Solar", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCATANIA, Italy \u2014 The enormous glass building on the outskirts of this Sicilian city had been intended for making silicon wafers for flash memory chips. That plan got crushed by the global financial crisis.Built in the early 2000s, it was overhauled in 2011 to churn out conventional panels used to build solar farms in Greece, Italy and South Africa. Once again, the factory struggled, this time losing ground to Chinese rivals that trumped it on price, as well as on technology.Now, the facility\u2019s owner, the Italian utility Enel, is changing tack again, betting on an advanced, commercially untested system for solar panels. This time, Enel hopes it finally has what it takes to challenge the industry behemoth \u2014 China.A short distance beyond the toe of Italy\u2019s boot, Europe is making what may be its last-gasp bid to remain a player in the global solar sector.The region was an early backer of technology harnessing the sun\u2019s energy. But manufacturing of solar panels here has fallen off in the years since, as Chinese companies have cut prices and ramped up production.Enel believes that by focusing on an esoteric technology, it can afford to make panels here and avoid a price war. It hopes that its products, which can capture more energy from the sun\u2019s rays than those of rivals, will offer greater value than cheaper models.\u201cMaking solar power is not rocket science,\u201d said Jenny Chase, a solar analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, a research firm. \u201cIt is something you can do more cheaply when you have a big manufacturing base.\u201dAt the foot of Mount Etna, Catania is known for its trove of ornate buildings fashioned from black and gray lava rock and decorated with winged cherubs. The city has also long served as an industrial and agricultural hub for Sicily, thanks in part to a busy port, which is also an entry point for thousands of migrants from North Africa, across the Mediterranean.More recently, it has fallen on harder times. And, like the city itself, the building housing the Enel factory has struggled to adapt to economic shifts. Every time it charted a path, Chinese rivals were quick to crowd it out.In the latest such instance, as prices for solar power dropped sharply in recent years, the Italian utility came to a difficult conclusion: Its panels were already a third less efficient than those developed by Chinese manufacturers, and that gap is likely to widen over time.\u201cWe said to ourselves: \u2018We have bought the company. What do we do?\u2019\u201d said Antonello Irace, the head of the Catania unit, known as EGP 3Sun.Mr. Irace eventually admitted defeat, shutting down the old production line last fall to retool the plant.Enel is spending 87.5 million euros, or about $101 million, on new equipment and other changes, of which the Italian government is chipping in \u20ac14 million. The European Union is adding an extra \u20ac9 million to help cover operating expenses.The Catania plant is likely to begin producing state-of-the-art solar panels next year, after trial runs in the coming months. It is embracing heterojunction technology, a system that has not been commercially proven. It involves adding a new, microscopic layer of silicon to solar cells, increasing their ability to gather sunlight and convert it into electricity.These new panels will also be \u201cbifacial,\u201d meaning they will be able to gather light not only directly from the sun but also from stray beams that bounce off the ground.Enel expects that panels made in the first year will be able to convert around 20 percent of sunlight to energy, which is toward the higher end of industry averages. It hopes to reach 25 percent in five years \u2014 which would help offset their higher cost.That could make a big difference in winning projects. Bids on giant solar farms worth hundreds of millions of dollars are increasingly price sensitive, and costs are falling fast.Those efforts may amount to little, however, if Enel cannot produce its panels on a larger scale, sufficient to compete with rivals from China.For now, Enel aims to produce around 500,000 panels a year, a drop in the bucket compared with its Chinese competitors. In effect, it is \u201cshipping cartons and crates,\u201d said Chris Buckland, head of technology at Lightsource BP, a British solar developer. By contrast, Chinese companies are filling \u201c40-foot containers.\u201dThe Italian utility\u2019s difficulties ramping up output point to the vastly changing fortunes of the solar sectors in Europe and China.Solar energy was largely commercialized in Europe around 20 years ago. Governments stimulated demand with generous subsidies, encouraging homeowners to install panels on their roofs and utilities to invest in larger-scale solar farms.But its popularity was limited in those early years by the high cost of the electricity that was being generated. Seeing little prospect of widespread sales, companies in the West built small factories, the largest of which had only a few hundred workers.China now makes about 65 percent of the world\u2019s solar panels, and Chinese companies build at least another 10 percent at factories in Southeast Asia, according to GTM Research, a unit of the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.Europe, by contrast, has less than a tenth of the market. Dozens of American and European companies have gone bankrupt or closed production. Factories have shut down, and equipment makers have moved to Asia.A few companies, notably Tesla, are trying to establish production lines in the West, using new technologies that Chinese factories cannot easily emulate.That is the route Enel is trying to follow in Sicily. Although heterojunction technology is not patented, Enel hopes that refinements it has made to the manufacturing process will give it a head start on rivals.\u201cWe have to manufacture modern, advanced, innovative products in their initial life cycle,\u201d said Antonio Cammisecra, the chief executive of Enel Green Power.If Enel succeeds, it will give a crucial lift to a region that has lost as much as a quarter of its industrial capacity since the financial crisis, said Armando Castronuovo, an expert on the area at the University of Catania. The city\u2019s economic backbone \u2014 agribusiness and tourism \u2014 has held up relatively well, but youth unemployment remains around 40 percent.Enel has drawn on the local university to find the advanced science graduates necessary to ensure it can continue to come up with cutting-edge technology. In all, it has preserved some 300 jobs at the plant and a nearby research center.Andrea Canino, 38, said science students like himself had benefited from close collaboration between the university and companies like Enel.Mr. Canino obtained his doctorate in physics from the University of Catania in 2008, at the depths of the downturn, but managed to get work at a research institute and, later, at a small semiconductor company. Finally, in 2012, he landed his job with Enel.\u201cHere in Sicily, it is not easy to find technology work,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prepared for other possibilities.\u201dStanley Reed reported from Catania, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Infowars and China\u2019s Great Firewall", "Date": "2018-08-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsHello, readers! Greetings from Hong Kong. I\u2019m Li Yuan, Asia tech columnist, and it\u2019s my turn to write the newsletter. This week, the tech world on both sides of the Pacific got embroiled in the topic I\u2019m most passionate about: censorship. Allow me to indulge a bit.But as exhausting and exasperating as the debate about tech companies\u2019 role in policing content may be for many Americans, I often watch it with envy and wish we could have similarly vigorous discussions about free speech and due process in China.As many of you may know, China has the world\u2019s most sophisticated and brutal internet censorship system called the Great Firewall. Over the past decade, the Chinese government blocked Google, Facebook and Twitter, along with thousands of other foreign websites. In their places rose the homegrown search engine giant Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter called Weibo, and the Facebook-like app called WeChat. The government also carried out many crackdowns on tools that help circumvent the Great Firewall.I was surprised by the reactions (good and bad) to the column. Some readers were sarcastic. Not having access to Google, Facebook or Twitter? \u201cLucky them!\u201d wrote one Facebook user. \u201cThey have not missed anything important!\u201d said another.The point of the column wasn\u2019t about access to those websites, which, as flawed as they are, constitute much of the internet in many countries. It was about access to information and what happens when a government controls the flow of information.I\u2019m especially surprised that the column went viral on the Chinese internet. Censorship is a tired topic to many Chinese, who live it everyday. Since both The Times and its Chinese website are blocked in China, people made screenshots or PDF versions of the column, then posted it on social media timelines or shared it in chat groups. I posted the links on my Weibo account but the tweet got blocked quickly.\u201cAfter reading your article, I\u2019m very worried about China\u2019s future,\u201d a lawyer in Beijing messaged me. Her family has been using tools to bypass the Great Firewall for years. She said her son was considered \u201cweird\u201d by his high school classmates because he shared information he learned from some blocked foreign websites. Now he\u2019s studying at a college in the United States.\u201cHe had to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was too different.\u201dThere were some discussions about how representative the young people in my column were. Some readers, especially expats, said they know plenty of Chinese who scale the Great Firewall. Some of my closest Chinese friends also said they will have to send themselves into exile if the government blocks all censorship-bypassing tools. It will be the last straw for them.But outside of these circles, it\u2019s often a different picture. Some people \u2014 even those who have many ways to get out of the Great Firewall \u2014 decide to stay in and defend it.So my column wasn\u2019t just about the young generation of Chinese. It was about all Chinese who grew up without access to uncensored information. Once inside the wall, it\u2019s hard to escape because often you don\u2019t even know what you don\u2019t know.In other news this week:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Directors, in Damage Control Mode, Want Elon Musk to Stop Tweeting", "Date": "2018-08-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMembers of Tesla\u2019s board are scrambling to control a chief executive who some directors think is out of control.Tesla\u2019s board members are also racing to inoculate themselves from the possible fallout from Mr. Musk\u2019s public statements.While it\u2019s standard for boards to retain lawyers to counsel them on complicated matters, Tesla\u2019s outside directors have hired two law firms to represent them.The independent directors retained Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to help deal with a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry related to the posts, which is at an early stage but which directors expect could intensify into a full-blown investigation, one person said. And three of those directors have separately hired the law firm Latham & Watkins to advise them as they consider any proposal by Mr. Musk to take the company private.Tesla declined to make Mr. Musk available for an interview.The tumult is the latest blow to Tesla, which has been struggling financially and facing mounting questions from investors about the company\u2019s ability to meet Mr. Musk\u2019s ambitious financial targets.Mr. Musk said this week that he has been in talks with Saudi Arabia\u2019s main government investment fund about possibly working on a deal to take Tesla private. But there were no indications that Mr. Musk has actually nailed down any commitments to bankroll such a transaction, and the Securities and Exchange Commission last week contacted the company about Mr. Musk\u2019s Twitter posts, which drove up the company\u2019s shares and prompted a halt in trading.Even before the controversy over the going-private transaction, Tesla and its board of directors faced scrutiny because of multiple directors\u2019 close ties to Mr. Musk.One director is Mr. Musk\u2019s brother, Kimbal. Others include Antonio Gracias and Steve Jurvetson, who are both directors of SpaceX, Mr. Musk\u2019s rocket company. Mr. Jurvetson has been on leave from Tesla\u2019s board since late last year, after he resigned from his venture-capital firm amid allegations of misconduct. He has denied those allegations. Tesla said Mr. Jurvetson has not participated in the board\u2019s discussions on a possible buyout.Another board member, Ira Ehrenpreis, is a SpaceX investor. Brad W. Buss had served as chief financial officer of SolarCity, the solar-panel maker run by Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin and where Mr. Musk previously served as chairman. Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016.Until last year, the only director without direct ties to Mr. Musk was Robyn Denholm, chief executive of an Australian telecommunications company.The California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System and four other large investors subsequently called on Tesla to add outside directors and tighten its corporate governance.Board members\u2019 past chumminess with Mr. Musk continues to present a problem.One independent director\u2019s personal relationship was deemed too close for him to sit on a committee the board established to evaluate Mr. Musk\u2019s potential going-private transaction, according to two people familiar with the matter. As a result, that key committee only has three members.\u201cThe issues facing Tesla relate to a lack of operational maturity,\u201d said Roger McNamee, a Silver Lake founder who is now a managing director of the private-equity firm Elevation Partners. \u201cThe market has been remarkably patient as Tesla struggles to scale its manufacturing.\u201dThat patience has been tested by Mr. Musk in recent months. He has publicly disparaged financial analysts and insulted a cave diver who was helping rescue members of a Thai soccer team.Board members\u2019 frustrations have intensified in recent days.Directors were upset that Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets forced them to rush out a public statement explaining a transaction that was at an embryonic stage, according to people familiar with the thinking of board members.Multiple directors have recently told Mr. Musk that he should stop using Twitter, with one urging him to stick to building cars and launching rockets, according to people familiar with the board\u2019s communications. Tesla employees, including the company\u2019s public-relations staff, have echoed that point, another person said.But neither Goldman nor Silver Lake \u2014 a private-equity firm focused on technology investments \u2014 had actually signed on with Tesla or Mr. Musk to play those roles, according to people familiar with the matter.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He may even be in \u201ca class of one,\u201d as he recently described Tesla, the revolutionary electric car company he founded.\u201cWhat does this say about the judgment of the person who set all this in motion?\u201d said Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cThat\u2019s what the board has to find out.\u201dMr. Musk, in subsequent blog posts, has stressed that he was only trying to be as transparent with the public as he was about to be with a few major investors.That is a laudable goal. But there are plenty of effective, conventional methods for achieving it, which include keeping his board fully informed, consulting lawyers, and following Securities and Exchange Commission procedures before tweeting about what could be a transformative, hugely expensive corporate buyout.\u201cEntrepreneurs often have a temperament and a constellation of traits that can create enormous value but are also associated with significant risks,\u201d said Michael A. Freeman, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco whose research and practice focuses on entrepreneurs.While Dr. Freeman said he couldn\u2019t comment on Mr. Musk, whom he\u2019s never treated, he said that his research and experience with clients show that entrepreneurs generally \u201chave mental health profiles that are associated with higher levels of creativity, higher levels of energy, higher levels of risk tolerance and higher levels of impulsivity. Another way to look at impulsivity is a need for speed, a sense of urgency, higher motivation, and greater restlessness.\u201dAll of that would seem consistent with Mr. Musk\u2019s Twitter habits.Scott Shane, a professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University, put it more simply: \u201cThese people are just wired differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re quicker to spot and act on opportunities, but that same tendency can get them into trouble in other situations.\u201d\u201cThere are a number of behavioral destabilizers in the world of entrepreneurship,\u201d Dr. Freeman said, \u201cand sleep deficiency is high on the list. The consequences can be impaired functioning, higher irritability, and judgment can be adversely affected.\u201dDuring Tesla\u2019s most recent earnings conference call, Mr. Musk apologized to Wall Street analysts he had insulted during a previous call for asking \u201cboring, bonehead questions.\u201dIt\u2019s also a common trait of entrepreneurs that they feel rules don\u2019t apply to them. From their perspective, many rules \u201cget in the way of getting things done,\u201d said Dr. Freeman.Whatever the exact circumstances of his tweet, Mr. Musk would benefit from what Dr. Freeman calls \u201cpersonal boards of directors,\u201d something he often recommends for his entrepreneurial clients. \u201cThere are some simple strategies for dealing with impulsivity, like sleep on something overnight and get a second opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re hard-wired to go full speed ahead at all times, you need to create a filter for yourself to decrease those risk factors.\u201dTesla\u2019s board should play an important role. \u201cBalancing corporate responsibilities, and the constraints they can impose, against the creativity that made the corporation great in the first place is much more of an art than a science,\u201d said Charles K. Whitehead, who leads the law, technology and entrepreneurship program at Cornell Law School. \u201cDirectors and lawyers need to credibly manage that balance, but as importantly, founders need to be willing to consult with them, recognizing that the advice \u2014 even if it slows things down \u2014 may simply reflect the realities of the day.\u201dDr. Freeman agreed. The Tesla board and others close to Mr. Musk \u201cneed to find ways to make all the positive aspects of those strengths work for him and for us while minimizing the downside.\u201dAnd Mr. Musk may want to curb his use of Twitter. \u201cOne good rule of thumb: never make important and, in Tesla\u2019s case, complex announcements through Twitter,\u201d Mr. Whitehead said.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for anyone to control the behavior of a grand visionary,\u201d Mr. Shane said. \u201cThese people don\u2019t like to be controlled.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If you didn\u2019t know about pro basketball\u2019s MIAMI Heat, you could have been very confused.Anyway, it was a struggle to find an a/v accessory to today\u2019s column that wasn\u2019t too lowbrow; here is a pair of ducklings who patterned after a dog.6D: Another sports reference: There\u2019s a term for when a baseball team dips into its farm system for some fresh arms or legs \u2014 they CALL UP new players.12D: Most of us (Scots included?) let plaids be the prevailing pattern and set them off with SOLIDS.

They borrow shares, then sell them in the hopes of buying them back later at a lower price and profiting on the difference. But if the share price goes up, those investors may face steep losses.News that Mr. Musk is considering taking his company private has not seemed to weaken the conviction of the investors wagering against the stock. The number of shares shorted has increased slightly in the days since the announcement.Tesla is among the most shorted stocks in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index. More than a quarter of Tesla\u2019s shares valued at about $13 billion are being shorted.In May, he took to Twitter with a warning for anyone betting against Tesla. \u201cShort burn of the century comin soon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFlamethrowers should arrive just in time.\u201dA little more than a month later, he warned that those betting against Tesla \u201chad three weeks before their short position explodes.\u201d More recently, Mr. Musk taunted David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital hedge fund has performed poorly this year in part because of its short bet on Tesla.Since the start of April, Tesla\u2019s shares have rebounded 40 percent, costing short-sellers $4.4 billion.But then betting on Tesla\u2019s shares to fall has proved expensive for several years now. Since 2016, those betting on Tesla\u2019s stock to fall have lost $6.4 billion on as the stock climbed more than 50 percent, according to S3 Partners.And the pain could get worse. Investors do not appear convinced that Tesla will be taken private. But if a deal seems more likely, Tesla share could rise quickly and force short-sellers to buy the stock in droves to cover their bets. That could push the share prices up even further \u2014 an effect known as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Asks S.E.C. to Study Quarterly Earnings Requirements for Public Firms", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to consider eliminating requirements that publicly traded companies post quarterly earnings reports, a move that could do away with a cornerstone of American capital markets.In speaking with some of the world\u2019s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S. \u201cStop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system,\u201d said one. That would allow greater flexibility & save money. I have asked the SEC to study!The directive does not mean the imminent demise of quarterly earnings reports, which keep investors informed on the financial health of publicly traded companies. The disclosures are required under federal securities law. The commission is independent of the executive branch, although the White House nominates the chairman of the S.E.C. and the other four commissioners, who all serve staggered, five-year terms.\u201cThe president has highlighted a key consideration for American companies and, importantly, American investors and their families \u2014 encouraging long-term investment in our country,\u201d the S.E.C. chairman, Jay Clayton, said in a statement. \u201cThe S.E.C.\u2019s division of corporation finance continues to study public company reporting requirements, including the frequency of reporting.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s suggestion is not unheard-of. In 2013, the European regulators abolished requirements that publicly listed companies file quarterly reports. On the other hand, Japan has moved closer to current American rules, requiring quarterly reporting starting in 2008.Still, any move away from the system of quarterly reporting would be a significant shift for investors, who have come to rely on the regular financial disclosures on the performance of publicly held companies.\u201cThe fact of the matter is, investors are used to getting updates four times a year on the status of companies\u2019 financials, and changing that would require a change in behavior,\u201d said Ed Clissold, the chief United States strategist for Ned Davis Research. \u201cOn the positive side, getting frequent updates holds companies accountable. They lay out plans to grow their business, and quarterly updates are a chance for investors to see the progress toward those objectives. The downside is that companies have occasionally managed their businesses to meet those quarterly objectives.\u201dThe paper also found that once companies go public, their appetite for capital spending tends to diminish. That finding is consistent with the idea that being a public company can promote short-term thinking, perhaps because of the scrutiny of disclosures such as quarterly earnings reports. But the authors of the paper also emphasized that other explanations could also be responsible for the shift.Investors, on the other hand, are less likely to support the idea floated by Mr. Trump, which would cut down on the information available about how the companies were performing.\u201cInvestors and other stakeholders benefit when regulations ensure that important information is promptly and transparently provided to the marketplace,\u201d said Amy Borrus, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a group representing large investors such as pension funds and endowments. \u201cInvestors need timely, accurate financial information to make informed investment decisions.\u201dJames Chanos, a well-known investor who specializes in shorting stocks, or betting on their decline, agreed.\u201cI\u2019m in the camp of more disclosure is better than less,\u201d Mr. Chanos said. \u201cAnd the U.S. financial disclosure is the best in the world.\u201dHe added, however, that some elements of the quarterly reporting process should be re-examined, including the \u201crampant\u201d release of quarterly numbers that do not conform to the standard set of accounting rules used in the United States, a practice that often makes a company\u2019s financial results look better.Others argue that longer stretches without corporations providing public information could lead to to abuse by those with inside information.\u201cQuarterly disclosures are very important. A lot can happen in six months, and it\u2019s just not appropriate to reduce disclosures,\u201d said Marcus Stanley, the policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, a coalition of foundations, unions and public interest groups that pushes for stronger financial regulation. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to advantage insiders further.\u201dEven those who criticize quarterly earnings may not want to abolish them altogether. In an essay published in The Wall Street Journal this summer, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, and the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett said that they favored eliminating quarter-earnings guidance, which are the targets companies hope to hit, but not the quarterly earnings results themselves.\u201cTransparency about financial and operating results is an essential aspect of U.S. public markets,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe support being open with shareholders about actual financial and operational metrics.\u201dMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A $70 Billion Deal for Tesla? Elon Musk Faces 2 Huge Questions", "Date": "2018-08-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk is plotting the biggest ever attempt to take a company private, but it\u2019s unclear how he\u2019ll pay for it \u2014 or if it\u2019s really worth it.Investors were not too bothered by this lack of clarity: Tesla\u2019s shares jumped 11 percent. They should be.Tesla may find it difficult to line up banks and investors to lend it large sums. Typically, companies taken private have somewhat steady cash flows. Tesla does not. In the second quarter, it recorded another huge loss and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in cash.Companies that are taken private usually have low valuations and are unloved by investors. Tesla does not fit that description, either, which could prove partly useful.In theory, Mr. Musk could pull off the transaction without taking on massive amounts of debt. He could persuade as many current investors as possible to exchange their public shares for new ones in the private company. The more that agree, the less debt needed.Mr. Musk is Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder, holding 20 percent of its stock. The next four largest hold nearly 30 percent combined. He might not get all of those to buy into his plan. (One, Fidelity, also has a stake in SpaceX, a private company led by Mr. Musk.)He could also turn to his individual investors, who own nearly 13 percent of Tesla\u2019s shares. Many of those are incredibly bullish about the company.To increase the chances of success with all of his investors, Mr. Musk has to convince them that their shares in a private Tesla will one day be worth more than the $420 that the transaction offers them.Doing so will require convincing them that Tesla will perform better out of the spotlight. Shareholders would also have to be willing to potentially get less information about the company\u2019s performance and have less opportunity to sell their shares if it is no longer publicly traded.\u201cBeing public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dArguably, though, the public markets have been very good to Tesla. The company has successfully tapped them for capital, and, even when it has racked up losses and consumed cash, its market value has marched higher and higher. Its stock market value currently exceeds that of General Motors.Investors are, in effect, giving Tesla much the same leeway as it would get if it were private. Big institutional shareholders have remained patient as the company strives to achieve long-term objectives, and have stood by the company even when Mr. Musk\u2019s behavior was unorthodox. They have even tolerated a board that has been criticized for its oversight.Investors must now weigh whether giving even more freedom to Mr. Musk, and the extra debt the deal may incur, is worth it. It very well may not be.Advertisement"}

Few know what\u2019s going on there, including sometimes other government ministries.\u201dThe bigger question is whether Prince Mohammed will need to curb his economic ambitions.

{"Headline": "Elon Musk Wants to Take Tesla Private. Can He Make the Math Work? ", "Date": "2018-08-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA buyout of the electric-car maker would be complicated and costly.The public markets have treated Mr. Musk well, supplying him with plenty of equity capital over the years. He also has many patient shareholders who have stood by him as he has behaved in unorthodox ways, missed important production targets and used Tesla to purchase his solar company, SolarCity. And Tesla\u2019s shares were on a tear just before he fired off his tweet.Mr. Musk is the single largest Tesla shareholder, owning just under 20 percent of the company. After Mr. Musk, there is a steep drop-off. Baillie Gifford, an investment firm based in Scotland, is Tesla\u2019s second-largest shareholder, with about 8 percent of the shares. Mr. Musk has made clear that he is not envisioning a traditional leveraged buyout, in which buyers borrow money to take a company private and then saddle the company with the new debt. Few banks would be willing to back such a transaction, given that Tesla\u2019s cash flows are erratic and it already has a fair amount of debt. Instead, Mr. Musk believes that \u201capproximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how he came up with that number, and which investors, if any, have committed to take part in a deal. If Mr. Musk did get shareholders owning two-thirds of the stock to take part, he would need around $24 billion to buy out the others at $420 a share. But if he is unable to muster that much support, the deal could get much costlier. But not all of these investors might be able to own substantial stakes in a private company. Some big institutional investors hold Tesla shares in index funds, and would most likely sell in the event of a deal. And in recent months, two of Tesla\u2019s largest holders, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity Management, sold large chunks of their shares in the company.Here's where Tesla\u2019s broad investor base may help Mr. Musk: Even if some of the top shareholders don't stick around, allowing many of the smaller shareholders to buy in could, in theory, replace the loss of one or two big investors. That\u2019s the $24 billion question. Mr. Musk suggested that financing was secured for the deal when he sent his Twitter message on Aug. 7. In his blog post, Mr. Musk elaborated, saying that he had been discussing taking Tesla private with the Saudis for nearly two years. Mr. Musk said he was working with Silver Lake, the private equity firm. Silver Lake took part in the buyout of Dell, and could contribute capital to a deal for Tesla. Institutional investors like T. Rowe Price and Fidelity sometimes take equity stakes in private technology companies, and could do something similar here. And Mr. Musk, a billionaire, could draw on his broad network of relationships and companies, including SpaceX. Another, more likely maneuver would see Mr. Musk sell some of his SpaceX stake to help finance the Tesla deal, or use it as collateral for a big loan. In that case, Mr. Musk would need a buyer for his SpaceX shares. \u201cThe intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla,\u201d he wrote in the letter to employees.If Mr. Musk can muster enough support for a deal, he will bring forward a proposal. If the board approves it, shareholders will be given the opportunity to roll into a newly private Tesla, or tender their shares. But to ensure that the deal is protected against legal challenges, a majority of Tesla's shareholders, excluding Mr. Musk, would most likely have to vote for the deal, said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware. So instead of simply needing 31 percent of Tesla shareholders to combine with Mr. Musk's 20 percent stake, a much larger proportion of the minority shareholders would in theory need to vote for the deal.

The company said it separately hired the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati \u201cas legal counsel in this matter.\u201dSilver Lake\u2019s aim is to invest in the carmaker as part of its potential delisting, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The firm isn\u2019t going to be paid for any work it does to help the Tesla co-founder explore his options, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations.Senior executives of Silver Lake, one of the biggest technology-focused private-equity investors, have known Mr. Musk for years and have had him speak at an annual meeting of its portfolio companies on at least one occasion. An arm of the firm, Silver Lake Kraftwerk, had invested $100 million in SolarCity, the solar-power company that Mr. Musk co-founded and is now part of Tesla.The people wouldn\u2019t say when Silver Lake began working with Mr. Musk on his plan. A spokeswoman for the investment firm declined to comment.Tesla\u2019s efforts to wrest the situation from its unpredictable chief executive and co-founder come after Mr. Musk declared in a blog post on Monday that he had communicated for more than a year with a Saudi sovereign wealth fund about taking the company private. He said he had left one recent meeting \u201cwith no question\u201d that a deal with the fund could be closed, though people familiar with the workings of the fund cast doubt on his account on Monday.The blog post appeared to be an attempt to address investors and financiers who were caught off guard by his initial tweet, on Aug. 7, announcing that he was \u201cconsidering taking Tesla private at $420.\u201d Such disclosures are usually made in regulatory filings; the tweet led to an inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission about Mr. Musk\u2019s choice of forum.In his blog post, Mr. Musk said that \u201cthe right thing to do was to announce my intentions publicly\u201d to all shareholders. But according to people familiar with the situation, Mr. Musk told an informal adviser that he had posted on Twitter impulsively and as an angry reaction to the company\u2019s critics.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Investors Betting Against Tesla Made $1 Billion on Friday", "Date": "2018-08-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe investors betting against Tesla just got a gift from the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk.The day after the interview, the stock of the electric-car maker tumbled 9 percent to $306.Mr. Musk had long sparred with investors who make money when the company\u2019s stock falls. And he is bracing for the fight to get worse. Mr. Musk told The New York Times that he was expecting \u201cat least a few months of extreme torture from the short-sellers, who are desperately pushing a narrative that will possibly result in Tesla\u2019s destruction.\u201dTesla is among the most shorted stocks in the United States. More than a quarter of its stock valued at more than $11 billion is being shorted, according to S3 Partners.In March, a driver was killed after a Model X crashed into a concrete highway divider while Autopilot, Tesla\u2019s driver-assistance feature, was in use.That same month, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded the company\u2019s credit rating, concerned that the company was burning through cash.It has made for a bumpy ride for Tesla investors \u2014 on either side of the trade.Through it all, Mr. Musk\u2019s public attacks on shorts have only intensified.In May, he took to Twitter and warned of the \u201cshort burn of the century comin soon.\u201d A month later, he predicted that those wagering on the stock\u2019s decline \u201chad three weeks before their short position explodes.\u201d He even taunted David Einhorn, whose Greenlight Capital hedge fund has performed poorly this year in part because of its short bet on Tesla.Mr. Musk has pointed to short-sellers as a reason he is considering taking Tesla private. In a message to employees explaining his thinking, he wrote: \u201cAs the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company.\u201dHe isn\u2019t exactly right on his history of short-sellers. At various points in the past 10 years, the value of bets against Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson exceeded Tesla\u2019s high of roughly $13 billion, according to IHS Markit.The value of short bets against Alibaba currently stands at $25 billion.Even by the percentage of shares being shorted, it is not the highest. It's not even the biggest of 2018. So far this year, 26 companies have had a higher percentage of their stock shorted than Tesla did at its peak of 33 percent in May.But he does have a point about the persistence of short-sellers trying to profit on Tesla\u2019s troubles. The short position in Tesla\u2019s shares has remained above $10 billion for nearly five months. In the past decade, short-sellers have not held a position valued at more than $10 billion in any other American company for more than three months, according to IHS Markit.Betting against Tesla has been expensive. Since 2016, short-sellers collectively have lost $5 billion, as the company\u2019s shares rose 27 percent.Even this year, amid all of Tesla\u2019s woes, betting on a decline in the company\u2019s share price has not been a winner. Its short-sellers remain down $650 million this year.Advertisement"}

I grew up in a rural Pennsylvanian town devoid of Confederate memorabilia, feeling no remote connection to the southern side of the Civil War. As such, I have always struggled to understand why some people are desperately clinging to a past that appears, to me, so clearly reprehensible.After reading this article, I gained some perspective. Not everyone who supports Confederate monuments does so out of hatred or in support of slavery. Many see it as a symbol of the South\u2019s heroism, a way to celebrate the bravery of their ancestors.However, this viewpoint did nothing to convince me that the monuments should stay. While pro-Confederates may hail the statues as a testament of the South\u2019s bravery, this is purposefully ignoring the uglier side of history. The side of history in which slavery was commonplace, glorified, and defended ferociously.The fact that Confederate flags are waved at white supremacist gatherings is a clear representation of what it symbolizes to the American people: racism. The Confederacy is a symbol of hate; it is the embodiment and blatant promotion of discrimination.With politics polarizing the nation, it is increasingly important to strive for unity. This can not be achieved by promoting a symbol of violence and oppression. We must stop touting a past where inequality was rampant, and instead build a future that everyone can celebrate._________Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Tweets on Tesla Started a Tizzy. Someone Should Hit the Brakes.", "Date": "2018-08-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWhy do people say the craziest things on Twitter?What is it about social media that makes powerful, accomplished individuals say things that they later need to recant, walk back or at least explain?This isn\u2019t about President Trump (although it could be). It is about chief executives.For years, companies and their executives were limited to disclosing market-moving information in news releases that were widely distributed over services like Business Wire or in interviews with media outlets. That is, until Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, broke ranks in 2012 and wrote on his Facebook page that the company\u2019s video-streaming service had \u201cexceeded 1 billion hours for the first time.\u201dThat, in turn, led to what\u2019s known as the Reed Hastings Rule, when the Securities and Exchange Commission permitted such use of social media. \u201cMost social media are perfectly suitable methods for communicating with investors,\u201d said George S. Canellos, the agency\u2019s acting enforcement chief at the time.But given the brevity Twitter requires \u2014 its character limit was doubled to 280 characters last year \u2014 it is perhaps inevitable that people will be misunderstood, even when they tweet with the best of intentions.\u201cAll tweets are misleading with such a short character limit,\u201d said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. \u201cCompanies shouldn\u2019t be encouraging the use of Twitter for its executives. They should forbid it.\u201dMr. Sonnenfeld said such a prohibition should be a company guideline, not a legislative requirement, adding he did not believe the government should get involved in what constitutes a news release.But still, regulators could at least encourage companies to remind their executives that Twitter is better used as a place to offer idle musings rather than corporate missives.Individuals are responsible for their own behavior \u2014 or what comes out of their mouth or keystrokes. Still, all too often, boldface-name executives, politicians and celebrities have needed to \u201cclarify\u201d their comments on Twitter. (I\u2019ve had to do it myself.)Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul, once tweeted about \u201cscumbag celebrities\u201d only to return to Twitter with a clarification: \u201cI never referred to any particular people, just some \u2018dodgy\u2019 self promoting celebrities. Repeat apology for language.\u201dRob Goldman, a Facebook vice president, defended the company on Twitter over the role that Russia-linked advertisements played in the 2016 United States presidential election. \u201cI have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal,\u201d he wrote. The company ended up issuing a clarification.For reasons that remain inexplicable, Twitter seems to create an impulse control problem for too many \u2014 and when billions of dollars of investors\u2019 money is on the line and the credibility of the markets are at stake, that seems like a risk not worth taking.Regulators may end up not having a problem with Mr. Musk\u2019s message, but the existing rule has an important caveat that involves the audience it reached.In discussing enforcement of the Reed Hastings Rule, Mr. Canellos said social media was not an appropriate vehicle for announcements \u201cif the access is restricted or if investors don\u2019t know that\u2019s where they need to turn to get the latest news.\u201dThat means if companies and their executives want to use Twitter to disseminate news, they should not be allowed to block people from following their accounts, including those who manage to get under their skin. Mr. Musk has repeatedly blocked such trolls on Twitter.This issue is a variation of a theme that emerged in a court case this year in which a judge found it inappropriate for Mr. Trump to block users, given his public role.Mr. Trump\u2019s use of Twitter has illustrated the danger of disclosing market-moving information, exemplified by his tweet before the employment report in which he seemed to hint the numbers were going to be good.It is perhaps an irresistible temptation, but one that companies have seen fit to punish in the past. Gene Morphis, chief financial officer for the specialty women\u2019s retailer Francesca\u2019s, was fired in 2012 for his use of social media posts like, \u201cBoard meeting. Good numbers=Happy Board.\u201dPerhaps the original executive maverick on Twitter was Alan Meckler, chief executive of WebMediaBrands. He started sending tweets in 2011 that would regularly move his company\u2019s stock.\u201cGood chance we will be making a few acquisitions by middle of March,\u201d he would write. Or he would send a tweet pointing out that the company\u2019s earnings report would be out in a week, with a winking reference to promising revenue numbers: \u201cRev. Growth big.\u201dThe Securities and Exchange Commission inquired about Mr. Meckler\u2019s use of Twitter, but eventually closed the case.It shouldn\u2019t have, or at least it could have sent a warning. Maybe Mr. Musk would have heard it.Advertisement"}
