Duo\u2019s technology allows companies to provide employees or customers with remote access. Its software verifies the identity of users, scans their device for security weaknesses and then lets them connect, a kind of supercharged username-and-password. Cisco said it would integrate Duo\u2019s technology across its network, device and cloud platforms.The acquisition is part of a trend in which cloud providers and cybersecurity companies are trying to bolster the services they offer.Many businesses have turned to the cloud to run everything from human resources administration to artificial-intelligence analysis on remote computers. The attractions are numerous: The cloud allows workers to be more mobile, data to be accessible and processed from anywhere, and hardware systems to be less frequently updated.But some organizations have balked at handing their data to third parties like Amazon.\u201cWith more sensitive data and critical information needing to be protected in these cloud deployments, we believe security vendors stand to benefit,\u201d wrote Daniel Ives, the chief strategy officer and head of technology research of GBH Insights, in a note this week.Big tech companies have turned to acquisitions in recent years to \u201cbolster their existing offerings to customers,\u201d Mr. Ives said.

A boom in mobile devices and video games, as well as the rise of artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, sent shares of chip makers soaring. Since the start of 2016, shares of semiconductor companies in the S. & P. 500 as a whole have nearly doubled.

{"Headline": "India Pushes Back Against Tech \u2018Colonization\u2019 by Internet Giants", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 In India, American companies dominate the internet. Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp is the most popular app on phones. Virtually every smartphone runs on Google\u2019s Android system. YouTube is the favorite video platform and Amazon is the No. 2 online retailer.For some Indian political leaders, it is as if their nation \u2014 which was ruled by Britain for a century until 1947 \u2014 is being conquered by colonial powers all over again.And they are determined to stop it.\u201cAs a country, we have to all grow up and say that, you know, enough of this,\u201d Vinit Goenka, a railways official who works on technology policy for India\u2019s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said at a conference last week.In recent months, regulators and ministers across India\u2019s government have declared their intention to impose tough new rules on the technology industry. Collectively, the regulations would end the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of 1.3 billion people, which is the world\u2019s fastest-growing market for new internet users.The proposals include European-style limits on what big internet companies can do with users\u2019 personal data, a requirement that tech firms store certain sensitive data about Indians only within the country, and restrictions on the ability of foreign-owned e-commerce companies to undercut local businesses on price.Salman Waris, an expert in international technology law at TechLegis in New Delhi, said India was trying to establish strong data protections for its citizens, as Europe did, while giving the government the right to obtain private information as it sees fit, much as China does. Foreign tech companies will have little choice but to go along.\u201cEveryone is going to fall in line and do what is necessary,\u201d Mr. Waris said. \u201cThese companies have to do it in China and Europe, and they will do it here.\u201dIndia\u2019s new policies are still a work in progress, with competing government agencies jousting with foreign and domestic lobbyists and policy advocates to shape them.But new restrictions are definitely coming, said officials and industry executives involved in the process. The country\u2019s Supreme Court declared last summer that Indians have a fundamental right to privacy and pushed Parliament to pass a data privacy law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his B.J.P. party have embraced an India-first economic nationalism to address weak job growth ahead of elections next year. Law enforcement authorities are also demanding more legal tools to extract private customer data from WhatsApp, Facebook and financial firms.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to build walls, but at the same time, we explicitly recognize and appreciate that data is a strategic asset,\u201d said Aruna Sundararajan, the nation\u2019s secretary of telecommunications, who has been deeply involved in the policy discussions. \u201cThere is a strong feeling in many quarters that the reason that India has not been able to develop a Tencent or Baidu or Alibaba is because we have not been nuanced in our policies.\u201dThe Indian government, which sees data as vital to a whole new generation of technologies such as artificial intelligence, appears particularly determined to reel in Facebook and its WhatsApp messaging service.WhatsApp has refused, saying that building such technology would break the encryption that keeps messages private. The government, for its part, is holding up a new Indian payments service from WhatsApp until it complies with local laws, including a new rule that requires financial data to be stored only in India.More broadly, the Indian government says it wants to ensure that Indian and foreign companies have to follow the same rules on taxes, data storage, security, pricing and cooperation with law enforcement.For example, Indian travel agencies complain that current tax laws allow foreign services such as Booking.com to avoid collecting hotel taxes, which can run as high as 28 percent of the room price. The disparity, they say, gives foreign firms a price advantage.\u201cIt\u2019s not about protectionism. It\u2019s about saying if 10 laws apply to me, the 10 laws should also apply to someone else operating in India,\u201d said Rameesh Kailasam, chief executive of IndiaTech.org, a newly formed lobbying group that represents local investors and start-ups, including MakeMyTrip and the ride-hailing company Ola.In a statement, Booking.com said it made a \u201cfull effort\u201d to comply with Indian tax laws.The big American technology companies are trying to fend off or dilute the regulations behind closed doors. Many consider the topic so sensitive that they refused to discuss it on the record.They also warned that India has fewer legal protections than the United States against government searches and data requests, so private data stored in the country could more easily end up in the hands of the police.The issue may become a topic in trade and economic discussions between the United States and Indian governments scheduled for the fall.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a policy group whose board includes top executives at Cisco, Adobe, and Mastercard, said that India risked hurting its own economy by imposing stringent rules on foreign tech companies. Forcing data to be stored in India, for example, could prompt similar rules from the United States, which would hurt India\u2019s big outsourcing companies.India also needs multinational companies to build its tech economy, he said.\u201cIt requires deep pockets. It requires world-class technologies. It requires a global supply chain,\u201d Mr. Aghi said. \u201cThese companies are creating jobs.\u201dAjay Sawhney, the information technology secretary, who is helping to draft the regulations, said the government was keeping an open mind as it developed the final rules.\u201cOur framework will be fair to all stakeholders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deeply appreciate the value that the tech companies and their platforms bring to our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Qatar\u2019s BeIN Sports Says It Has Proof of Saudi Role in Piracy Dispute", "Date": "2018-08-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs European soccer\u2019s top leagues begin another season, the world\u2019s biggest pirate television network is back on the airwaves too.All 10 games played on the opening weekend of the Premier League last weekend were broadcast on beoutQ, a sophisticated Arab-language channel whose brazen theft of sports broadcasts has emerged as a high-profile battleground in the bitter and protracted dispute between Qatar and a group of its neighbors led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.The rights to show Premier League games \u2014 as well as those in the UEFA Champions League and France\u2019s Ligue 1, among others \u2014 in the Middle East are owned by the Qatar-based beIN Media Group, which has committed billions of dollars to acquire valuable sports properties for its beIN Sports network. The Premier League rights are the crown jewel of the beIN Sports portfolio; the package is among the most expensive sports properties, worth more than $10 billion to the Premier League in each three-year cycle via payments from broadcasters in dozens of countries.\u201cThe evidence is irrefutable,\u201d said Sophie Jordan, beIN Media Group\u2019s legal counsel. \u201cOn a daily basis it is carrying out \u2014 in broad daylight \u2014 a mass-scale theft of highly valuable intellectual property rights.\u201dBeIN officials said tests on beoutQ\u2019s signal were conducted over a number of months by three technology firms: the United States-based Cisco, the Swiss company Nagra, and Overon, a company located in Spain. BeIN is touting the findings a month after Arabsat released a statement claiming seven experts, whom it did not identity publicly, had concluded that its frequencies were not being used by beoutQ.\u201cThe reports speak for themselves,\u201d said Cameron Andrews, the executive responsible for coordinating beIN\u2019s antipiracy operation. \u201cThere\u2019s no possible way these internationally well-known firms would compromise their reputations.\u201dArabsat and its outside legal counsel, Squire Patton Boggs, did not respond to a request for comment on the most recent beIN accusations, or the companies\u2019 findings. Saudi Arabia\u2019s media ministry acknowledged receiving a request for comment but did not provide one.In June, the punishing blockade being enforced by a Saudi-led coalition entered its second year. Last year, the countries in the coalition \u2014 Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Bahrain and Egypt \u2014 accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and criticized its relationship with Iran. In addition to a trade embargo, the countries cut off diplomatic ties, closed borders and set up the blockade of the energy-rich emirate, shutting off Qatar\u2019s access to many of the region\u2019s ports and much of its airspace. Qatar has denied the accusations, and has noted the assistance it has provided to the United States in its war on terrorism.Saudi Arabia has also been lobbying international sports organizations to end their agreements with beIN Sports, frustrating those unwilling to be drawn into what they consider a political, rather than a sporting, dispute. In the middle of the World Cup, for example, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sports minister, Turki al-Shiekh, took to Twitter to call on FIFA to break its contract with beIN, before making a personal attack on the European soccer head Aleksander Ceferin. Ceferin\u2019s organization, UEFA, had a few hours earlier released a statement saying beoutQ was based in Saudi Arabia and had been pirating its content.FIFA announced last month that it had hired lawyers to take action specifically in Saudi Arabia, and it said that the organization \u201cis working alongside other sports-rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interest.\u201dBeIN is relying on the help; while it has begun legal actions in the United States and France, it has been unsuccessful in its attempts to find lawyers willing to represent its interests in Saudi Arabia because of the broader embargo.As it has remained on the air, beoutQ, an operation that experts say would cost millions of dollars a year to operate, has grown increasingly sophisticated and audacious. During the World Cup, it added its own commentary over some of the pirated coverage, and recently it began showing anti-Qatar messaging and personal insults against members of Qatar\u2019s ruling family between its broadcasts.Its presence has also spread to other parts of the Arab world. BeoutQ set-top boxes, which are able to broadcast the channel over satellite and the internet, have been found across the Middle East. Elsewhere, there is evidence the channel is itself being pirated by other illegal broadcast operations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Beginning of a Wave\u2019: A.I. Tiptoes Into the Workplace", "Date": "2018-08-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is no shortage of predictions about how artificial intelligence is going to reshape where, how and if people work in the future.But the grand work-changing projects of A.I., like self-driving cars and humanoid robots, are not yet commercial products. A more humble version of the technology, instead, is making its presence felt in a less glamorous place: the back office.New software is automating mundane office tasks in operations like accounting, billing, payments and customer service. The programs can scan documents, enter numbers into spreadsheets, check the accuracy of customer records and make payments with a few automated computer keystrokes.The technology is still in its infancy, but it will get better, learning as it goes. So far, often in pilot projects focused on menial tasks, artificial intelligence is freeing workers from drudgery far more often than it is eliminating jobs.But all the signs point to much more to come. Big tech companies like IBM, Oracle and Microsoft are starting to enter the business, often in partnership with robotic automation start-ups. Two of the leading start-ups, UiPath and Automation Anywhere, are already valued at more than $1 billion. The market for the robotlike software will nearly triple by 2021, by one forecast.\u201cThis is the beginning of a wave of A.I. technologies that will proliferate across the economy in the next decade,\u201d said Rich Wong, a general partner at Accel, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, and an investor in UiPath.The emerging field has a klutzy name, \u201crobotic process automation.\u201d The programs \u2014 often called bots \u2014 fit into the broad definition of artificial intelligence because they use ingredients of A.I. technology, like computer vision, to do simple chores.For many businesses, that is plenty. Nearly 60 percent of the companies with more than $1 billion in revenue have at least pilot programs underway using robotic automation, according to research from McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.The companies and government agencies that have begun enlisting the automation software run the gamut. They include General Motors, BMW, General Electric, Unilever, Mastercard, Manpower, FedEx, Cisco, Google, the Defense Department and NASA.Holly Uhl, a technology manager who leads the automation program, estimated that within two years the company\u2019s bot population would double to 60 and its hours saved would perhaps triple to 75,000, nearly all in year-after-year savings rather than one-time projects.Cutting jobs, Ms. Uhl said, is not the plan. The goal for the company, whose insurance offerings include auto, commercial and workers\u2019 compensation, is to increase productivity and State Auto\u2019s revenue with limited additions to its head count, she said.Ms. Uhl said her message to workers is: \u201cWe\u2019re here to partner with you to find those tasks that drive you crazy.\u201dRebekah Moore, a premium auditor at the company, had one in mind. Premium auditors scrutinize insurance policies and make recommendations for changing rates. They audit less than half of the policies, Ms. Moore said.The policies that will not be audited then have to be set aside and documented. That step, she explained, is a routine data-entry task that involves fiddling with two computer programs, plugging in codes and navigating drop-down menus. It takes a minute or two. But because auditors handle many thousands of policies, the time adds up, to about an hour a day, she estimated.Starting in May, a bot took over that chore. \u201cNo one misses that work,\u201d Ms. Moore said.Is she worried about the bots climbing up the task ladder to someday replace her? Not at all, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find things to do with our time, higher-value work,\u201d said Ms. Moore, 37.On State Auto\u2019s current path, her confidence seems justified. If the company hits its target of 75,000 hours in savings by 2020, that would be the equivalent of fewer than 40 full-time workers, compared with State Auto\u2019s work force of 1,900. The company plans to grow in the next two years. If so, State Auto would most likely be hiring a few dozen people fewer than it would otherwise.Automation companies are eager to promote the bots as helpful assistants instead of job killers. The technology, they say, will get smarter and more useful, liberating workers rather than replacing them.\u201cThe long-term vision is to have one bot for every employee,\u201d said Bobby Patrick, chief market officer for UiPath. The company, which is based in New York, recently reported that its revenue more than tripled in the first half of 2018, to a yearly rate of more than $100 million.Mihir Shukla, chief executive of Automation Anywhere, refers to his company\u2019s bots as \u201cdigital colleagues.\u201d In July, the company announced it had raised a $250 million round of venture funding, valuing the company at $1.8 billion.The market for A.I.-enhanced software automation is poised for rapid growth, but that expansion, analysts say, will ultimately bring job losses.Forrester Research estimated that revenue would nearly triple to $2.9 billion over the next three years. And by 2021, robotic automation technology will be doing the equivalent work of nearly 4.3 million humans worldwide, Forrester predicted.In a dynamic global labor market, that is not a clear-cut forecast of 4.3 million layoffs. The bots may do work not previously done by humans, and people may move onto new jobs.\u201cBut these initial bots will get better, and the task harvesting will accelerate,\u201d said Craig Le Clair, an analyst for Forrester. \u201cFor workers, there will be a mix of automation dividends and pain.\u201dThe recent research has examined jobs as bundles of tasks, some of which seem ripe for replacement and others not. So the technology\u2019s immediate impact will resemble the experience to date with robotic software, changing work more than destroying jobs.For Ms. Uhl of State Auto, the most persistent pushback has come not at the company but at home, from her two young sons, Christian, 9, and Elijah, 7, who are eager to glimpse the future.Hearing their mother talk about robots at work, they keep asking her to bring one home. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of robot you can see,\u201d Ms. Uhl said she has told her disappointed sons.Advertisement"}
