{"Headline": "Deadly Earthquake Hits Japan, Adding to Summer of Misery", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 A powerful earthquake struck Japan\u2019s northern island of Hokkaido on Thursday, causing millions of homes to lose power, killing at least 17 people and leaving 26 others missing after a landslide crushed multiple houses.In Hokkaido on Thursday, rescue workers were struggling to get to the homes crushed by a mudslide in the towns of Atsuma and Abira after the quake, which struck just after 3 a.m. Japan\u2019s weather service said it had a preliminary magnitude of 6.7.Hokkaido officials said three bodies had been recovered from the landslides in Atsuma, and that another was found in Sapporo, Hokkaido\u2019s capital. About 300 people were injured.According to NHK, the public broadcaster, about 1,900 people were evacuated from their homes.The quake took a huge toll on Hokkaido\u2019s power grid. A nuclear plant in Tomari lost its main power supply, but a backup generator was cooling its spent fuel pools. Hokkaido Electric Power, the company that operates the plant, said it had not detected any changes in radiation levels around the plant.Hiroshige Seko, Japan\u2019s minister of economy, trade and industry, told reporters it would take about a week or more for power to be restored to all homes in Hokkaido. Rail services on the island were shut down because of the power failure.By Thursday afternoon, power had been returned to 1.4 million households, about half those on the island. Just under 250 hospitals were running on generators. Traffic lights in central Sapporo were back on, and so was a digital bulletin board on the front of a television tower, a local landmark.Thursday\u2019s quake was the strongest to hit Hokkaido, a popular skiing destination with a population of just under 5.5 million people, since 1996.A part of the ceiling at the island\u2019s main commercial airport in Chitose caved in, and a fire broke out at a petrochemical factory in the port town of Muroran. Air traffic was disrupted.Hokkaido\u2019s governor, Harumi Takahashi, asked for assistance from the military, Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces. Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, said 4,000 troops had been dispatched immediately, and that up to 25,000 could be sent to the island to help with search and cleanup efforts.Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Typhoon Mangkhut Slams Hong Kong and Southern China", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Typhoon Mangkhut battered Hong Kong and Macau on Sunday with 100 miles-per-hour wind gusts, drenching rains and 11-foot surges of seawater that inundated the first urban area of Asia to face the wrath of the year\u2019s mightiest storm.Mangkhut left a swath of damaged buildings and scores of injuries in Hong Kong and Macau before churning across the southern coast of China. Barely a day earlier, it ravaged the northern Philippines and left dozens buried in landslides, including people sheltering in a church and a dormitory for miners.The unofficial count from the Philippine police put the number of dead as at least 59. The death toll was expected to rise as rescue workers continued digging into areas buried by mud, especially in mountainous parts of Benguet Province in the northern island of Luzon. The president\u2019s office said 43 bodies had been recovered from the mine landslide and the search was continuing.Francis Tolentino, a senior adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, estimated that 5.7 million people had been affected by the storm and raised concerns about how aid could be sent to the hardest-hit areas.While the other side of the world was preoccupied with the destructive power of Hurricane Florence as it drenched the Carolinas, Mangkhut hurtled into southern China\u2019s city of Taishan, in the sprawling, densely populated province of Guangdong, making landfall around 5 p.m.The storm headed toward China after making landfall in the northern part of the Philippines.China\u2019s state television reported that at least four people had been killed in the province. As night fell, the full extent of the damage was not yet clear.Meteorologists have called Mangkhut the world\u2019s most powerful storm of 2018, with a span as wide as 550 miles and wind gusts that hit 200 miles per hour last week. At its peak, the typhoon was equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane.For Hong Kong, a metropolis that has shrugged off tropical storms in the past, Mangkhut was different. Though its peak gusts had slowed to 100 miles per hour, Hong Kongers were taking no chances.The typhoon accelerated as it crossed the South China Sea, landing a nearly direct hit on Hong Kong at midday Sunday and sweeping through the city\u2019s canyons of tall buildings.For the first time ever, Macau, the gambling capital nearby, closed its casinos because of a storm, although they reopened on Monday. By the time the winds and rain eased, central parts of Macau had suffered major flooding and 20,000 people were left without electricity.Hong Kong Airport, a central transit point for much of Asia, was virtually shut down on Sunday. Almost 1,000 flights were canceled or delayed, but by Monday the airport had reopened. The outdoor sections of the city\u2019s vaunted subway system were taken out of service.Airports and high-speed railways in Guangdong, too, were shut down, throttling traffic in one of world\u2019s most urbanized and densely populated regions, with 100 million people. By midday, most bridges in the province, which stretches southwest toward Hainan Island, were closed. Schools in the province, along with those in Hong Kong and Macau, have been ordered closed on Monday, when the storm\u2019s effects were expected to linger.China\u2019s state television did not immediately provide details about the four deaths, but they followed reports on social media of people crushed by falling debris in Shenzhen and Dongguan, two cities along the Pearl River near Hong Kong.There were no reports of deaths in Hong Kong, but the government said early Monday that nearly 400 people had sought medical treatment. More than 1,500 people sought refuge in 46 temporary shelters.As the storm reached the mainland on Sunday evening, cities along China\u2019s southern coast seemed eerily vacant, with residents mostly heeding warnings to stay indoors. As in Hong Kong, they had stockpiled water and basic foods on Saturday and Sunday, emptying stores.Guangzhou, the region\u2019s capital and largest city, ordered all restaurants closed to keep people off the streets. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, citing government reports, said that nearly 2.5 million people in the province had been affected in some way, with some seeking protection in more than 18,000 designated shelters.Tens of thousands of fishing boats \u2014 fishing is a main part of the region\u2019s economy, along with chemical and steel works \u2014 were ordered to port in advance of the storm. The authorities detained several fishermen who had defied warnings and put to sea anyway.As the storm swirled through the night, it seemed likely that casualties and damage would grow, with the full impact of the typhoon becoming clearer Monday morning.Mangkhut\u2019s assault on Hong Kong tested a metropolis that has developed intricate safeguards against typhoons. The city\u2019s mountainous terrain typically hinders flooding, and retaining walls on steep slopes prevent landslides.But on Sunday, some were in danger of failing. The Hong Kong Observatory warned people to stay away from steep hills and retaining walls and issued evacuation notices to residents living in areas prone to landslides. Temporary shelters were opened.On Sunday, most residents hunkered down in their apartments, while those in more flood-prone areas took refuge in shelters.As the storm unleashed its full force, the postings became more ominous.Videos showed glass windows and doors smashing, pedestrians blown off the ground and residents frantically bailing rainwater off their balconies to prevent flooding.In the neighborhood of Tai Kok Tsui, video captured the collapse of a crane or elevator shaft affixed to a building construction site. No injuries were reported.A NASA satellite captured the intense rainfall of 2018\u2019s strongest storm so far.Lily Chiu, a 60-year-old caregiver in Hong Kong, had stayed overnight at the nursing home where she worked to avoid commuting to an early shift when the storm hit. Other than the tape on the windows of residents\u2019 rooms, it had been a normal day, with hot meals running on schedule.But this storm felt different.\u201cThese last few hours felt more severe than other typhoons I had experienced,\u201d Ms. Chiu said, after speakers announced that train services to the station near her home had been suspended. She prepared to walk home.In the eastern Hong Kong neighborhood of Heng Fa Chuen, residents of a flooded housing complex linked arms and held hands as they waded knee-deep through pools of rainwater in streets, parking lots and stores.\u201cHow am I going to go home?\u201d one elderly man asked despondently into a phone.\u201cHeng Fa Chuen has become a water reservoir,\u201d May Siu, a longtime resident, said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here 30 years, and these storms only started looking like this with Hato last year,\u201d Hato was the biggest typhoon last year.Shaking their heads at the snapped lampposts and flooded entryways, residents said that the storm on Sunday had done far more damage than last year\u2019s. Then teenagers rolled up their shorts and prepared to wade home through floating debris.Gerry Mullany and Tiffany May reported from Hong Kong, and Steven Lee Myers from Zhanjiang in Guangdong Province, China.

{"Headline": "To Thwart Iran, Save Idlib", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy is the administration so reluctant to block Tehran\u2019s most dangerous regional gambit?Opinion ColumnistThe Trump administration has made clear that its top priority in the Middle East is to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear and regional ambitions. So why is it so reluctant to lift a finger against Tehran\u2019s most audacious gambit in Syria?That gambit is the reconquest, by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies, of Idlib Province, the last major rebel holdout in western Syria and home to about three million people. A humanitarian catastrophe is expected to follow, entailing mass casualties and another tidal wave of refugees.By now, the strategic consequences should also be obvious. Iran will have succeeded in consolidating a Shiite crescent stretching from Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf to the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. Russia will have succeeded in reasserting itself as a Mideast military victor and diplomatic power broker. Hezbollah, already the dominant political player in Lebanon, will further extend its influence in Syria.The losers in this equation: Turkey, already groaning under the pressure of millions of Syrian refugees and a crumbling economy; Israel, whose repeated strikes against Iranian targets in Syria have dented but not denied Tehran\u2019s ambitions; Europe, which could face yet another refugee crisis even as the effects of the last are felt in the resurgence of the far right; and the Syrian people, terrorized witnesses to the marriage of wickedness and indifference.And then there\u2019s the United States, where two administrations have now allowed the Syrian crisis to become depressing testimony to the worthlessness of our word, the fickleness of our friendship and hollowness of our values. Donald Trump, loudly billing himself as Barack Obama\u2019s opposite in every respect, has effectively adopted his predecessor\u2019s worst foreign policy mistake.The larger goal is to establish that the U.S. has the ability and will to achieve core foreign policy objectives at a relatively reasonable price. Those objectives are to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe; exact an increasingly heavy toll on Assad and his allies for prosecuting their offensive; create leverage for future diplomacy; and demonstrate to regional allies that we can be an effective, engaged and reliable partner, provided they\u2019re willing to do their share.But American policymakers desperately need to learn how to find the middle road between overreaction and inaction; between a missionary zeal to solve other people\u2019s agonies and the illusion that we can remain aloof from them. The Obama administration thought it could largely wash its hands of Syria. It ended up acting as a bystander to genocide, to borrow Samantha Power\u2019s famous phrase.The Trump administration might still think it can fire off a few cruise missiles and the odd tweet in the face of Assad\u2019s depredations. If so, it will wind up as a midwife to the mullahs\u2019 ambitions, however many sanctions the president might otherwise slap on Tehran.The countdown for the siege of Idlib has begun. America\u2019s enemies know the stakes. Do we?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Molly Kelly Has a Message for Republicans: \u2018Do Not Underestimate Me\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Kelly fended off a challenge from her left in the Democratic primary for governor in New Hampshire on Tuesday, but now faces a popular governor. She remains undaunted. Established Democrats have found themselves under siege from the left this year, with several prominent lawmakers falling to more liberal challengers. Molly Kelly, a former state senator, avoided that fate in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, defeating a progressive opponent to become the 15th woman to win her primary for governor this season.But in November, Ms. Kelly, 68, will be a decided underdog: Her Republican opponent, Chris Sununu, is one of the most popular governors in the country.Like most politicians, however, she is optimistic about her chances and undaunted by the challenge ahead. Ms. Kelly spoke to The Times about her victory, New Hampshire\u2019s history of voting for women and what she thinks about President Trump. The following is an edited and condensed version of the conversation.Q. Congratulations again on your big win. Were you out late celebrating?Where in the state are you this morning?No rest for the weary?No, I don\u2019t think we could anyway. I\u2019m excited, and this is where we wanted to be this morning. So I am happy to be busy and back campaigning.This is a state that Senator Bernie Sanders won in the presidential primary by 22 points. But in a year when some Democrats are losing to more progressive candidates, you bucked that trend. Why do you think that was? Is New Hampshire over Bernie-ism?No, Sydney. I have been progressive my entire life, before I was in the State Senate and during the State Senate. I think that the voters clearly saw that. I have championed women\u2019s rights, women\u2019s reproductive rights, my entire life and will continue as governor to ensure that New Hampshire does not go backwards on reproductive rights.Being progressive, being bold is not new to me. Does it say something specifically, culturally, about New Hampshire that voters seem to be willing to elect women?I think they trust women. We have been out there working hard. I have throughout my career as well. I think we have worked hard, and also our messages about putting people first, making sure the economy works for everyone, not just a few, is important.Today as well, I truly believe that women will not be silenced, and they were not last night.You are 68 and running against one of the most popular governors in the country. Why are you doing this to yourself?I am moving forward with 100 percent renewable [energy] so that we have clean air, clean water \u2014 making sure that all future generations live in a climate and environment that\u2019s healthy for them. These are the things I\u2019m focusing on.It sounds as if you are not daunted by your opponent in the general election?Look, I\u2019ve been underestimated before. And I think it\u2019s a clear message to Chris Sununu and others as well: Do not underestimate me. I\u2019ve been underestimated when I was a young single mom with three small children, raising them myself and making sure that I could go back and finish my education, and living on a college campus with my children and taking on all of those challenges and raising them myself and working my way through college. I managed an apartment complex that my children and I lived in and then I waitressed one night a week at Papa Gino\u2019s and even had a rural paper route in Peterborough, New Hampshire. I know what challenges are about, and I was underestimated then and rose to that occasion, took on those challenges. I am not afraid of a challenge when I know it\u2019s the right thing to do. How much help from Democratic Party leaders do you expect to get?I think the Democrats are going to all come together after last night. I know that they are. I\u2019m hearing from them during the evening and all day today.Who have you heard from specifically?We would be here way too long, Sydney, if I started to make a list for you. Just do know that it is leaders in our state, leaders in our community, which is most important. National leaders as well. We are energized. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some potential 2020 candidates campaigned this fall with you. We live in New Hampshire. It\u2019s a very political state, and people do come here and pound those sidewalks. So we\u2019ll see what happens. Let\u2019s talk about this election cycle\u2019s elephant in the room. What do you think of President Trump?I can\u2019t think of one thing I would agree with him on. As governor, if there are opportunities and funding to our state to deal with \u2014 issues like the opioid epidemic and that are in the best interest of the people of New Hampshire \u2014 I\u2019m sure I would work with federal agencies to make that happen.I think you said earlier this year that you would be willing to work with the White House, feelings about Mr. Trump aside. Do you still feel that way?If there is some funding that is in the best interest of the state in regard to the opioid epidemic, of course, because my priorities are the people here in New Hampshire. What about the economy? The president likes to say it is \u201cthe strongest it\u2019s ever been in the history of our country.\u201d Are people in New Hampshire feeling this?The economy is not working for everybody in New Hampshire. Lots of voters say that a key issue for them is gun control. Where do you stand on this?I\u2019ve always supported common sense gun safety. Our children need to be able to leave and go to school and know that they\u2019re safe. I have four children, and believe me, I didn\u2019t worry about if they would be affected by gun violence when they walked into school. But today, Sydney, I have seven grandchildren and I worry about them every single day. So I\u2019m not going to wait until a tragedy happens here in New Hampshire. We\u2019re going to make sure that we support common sense gun safety.It doesn\u2019t sound as if you\u2019re in favor of repealing the Second Amendment.No, of course not. What I am supporting is common sense gun safety and particularly making sure our children are safe in our schools.What else is on the agenda for today?We\u2019re talking to a lot of people like yourself and getting a lot of phone calls. And boy, I\u2019m going to be glad to meet with some voters and have a cup of coffee with them this morning.If I were you, I would definitely need a cup of coffee.[laughs]I hope you\u2019ve had one already.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018I\u2019m Winning,\u2019 Trump Tells Montana Crowd as He Tries to Regain Control Amid Turmoil", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBILLINGS, Mont. \u2014 President Trump tried on Thursday to tamp down perceptions of an out-of-control White House, after a string of devastating reports about his insurgent staff, warning supporters here that if they did not turn out to vote in November, his political enemies would subject him to impeachment.\u201cIf it happens, it\u2019s your fault because you didn\u2019t go out to vote,\u201d Mr. Trump said to an enthusiastic rally in a state he won comfortably in 2016. His impeachment at the hands of a Democratic majority, he said, would turn the United States into \u201ca third-world country,\u201d where the opposition routinely impeaches the sitting leader.Speaking to a friendly crowd during one of the most chaotic stretches of his presidency, Mr. Trump also turned his fire on the news media, accusing it of ignoring his successes and waging a campaign to delegitimize him.\u201cThe truth is, with these people, you can\u2019t win.\u201d But he insisted, \u201cI\u2019m winning.\u201dBut in the chilly Rimrock Auto Arena here, Mr. Trump glowed in the comfort of a captive and sympathetic audience: first in a brief interview on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d minutes before the rally and then in an unbridled, winding speech, both before a jubilant and rowdy crowd that booed and cheered on cue. And for nearly 90 minutes, he strove to remind his devoted followers why he was their choice \u2014 and a competent one at that, despite the reported claims.\u201cThis is going to be a lot of fun,\u201d Mr. Trump said, later referring to himself as \u201cyour favorite \u2014 of all time \u2014 president.\u201dThe event, ostensibly, was part of a Western American tour in the waning days of the president\u2019s summertime crusade against Democrats in states that he won \u2014 in this case, to raise support for Matt Rosendale, the Republican state auditor aiming to topple Senator Jon Tester in a tough re-election battle.Defensive and given a microphone, Mr. Trump derided the unnamed author as an \u201canonymous, gutless coward,\u201d and repeated his calls for The Times to reveal the person\u2019s identity. The identity of the author, who detailed efforts to prevent the president\u2019s \u201chalf-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions,\u201d is known to The Times\u2019s editorial board, but it was not shared with the reporters who cover the president.Buoyed by his fury over the coverage of the essay and Mr. Woodward\u2019s book, he relitigated some of his most persistent grievances with the news media, including coverage of his election victory nearly two years ago and the response to his meetings with Kim Jong-un of North Korea and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Reveling in his victimhood, Mr. Trump even likened himself to Abraham Lincoln, noting that Lincoln got poor reviews for the Gettysburg Address in 1863, before the speech was later regarded as one of the finest in the nation\u2019s history.\u201cI have a feeling,\u201d he told the crowd in remarks far longer than Lincoln\u2019s, \u201cthat\u2019s going to happen to us.\u201dIn the arena, the country was as he dictated it: empowered by a booming economy and Republican policy, but facing a looming threat from a blitz of opposition from Democrats and the news media. But the president also had to confront the drumbeat of disclosures that have raised questions about his competence and even his mental state.He mocked news reports that depict him raging in the White House residence \u2014 instead telling homespun anecdotes about quizzing his wife, Melania, about the news media\u2019s more provocative claims. And he painstakingly detailed examples of his competence: the political dynasties he had to defeat in the general election and his administration\u2019s economic and national security achievements as evidence of his competence.There were other reasons, outside of unflattering headlines, for Mr. Trump to be angry. Armed with leaked documents, Democrats continue to rail against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court, and protesters persist in interrupting the judge\u2019s confirmation hearings.\u201cDo you believe the anger and the meanness on the other side?\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSick. It\u2019s sick.\u201d\u201cThe problem is,\u201d Mr. Trump lamented, \u201che\u2019s never going to vote for me.\u201dEmily Cochrane reported from Billings, Mont., and Mark Landler from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Health Care Crisis: Lines Before Dawn, Violence and \u2018No Trust\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Well before dawn, nearly a hundred people stood in line outside one of the capital\u2019s top hospitals.They were hoping to get an appointment with a specialist, a chance for access to the best health care in the country. Scalpers hawked medical visits for a fee, ignoring repeated crackdowns by the government.A Beijing resident in line was trying to get his father in to see a neurologist. A senior lawmaker from Liaoning, a northeastern province, needed a second opinion on her daughter\u2019s blood disorder.Mao Ning, who was helping her friend get an appointment with a dermatologist, arrived at 4 a.m. She was in the middle of the line.\u201cThere\u2019s no choice \u2014 everyone comes to Beijing,\u201d Ms. Mao, 40, said. \u201cI think this is an unscientific approach and is not in keeping with our national conditions. We shouldn\u2019t have people do this, right? There should be a reasonable system.\u201dThe long lines, a standard feature of hospital visits in China, are a symptom of a health care system in crisis.An economic boom over the past three decades has transformed China from a poor farming nation to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The cradle-to-grave system of socialized medicine has improved life expectancy and lowered maternal mortality rates.But the system cannot adequately support China\u2019s population of more than one billion people. The major gaps and inequalities threaten to undermine China\u2019s progress, social stability and financial health \u2014 creating a serious challenge for President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party.While the wealthy have access to the best care in top hospitals with foreign doctors, most people are relegated to overcrowded hospitals. In the countryside, people must rely on village clinics, or travel hundreds of miles to find the closest facility.The country does not have a functioning primary care system, the first line of defense for illness and injury. China has one general practitioner for every 6,666 people, compared with the international standard of one for every 1,500 to 2,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.Instead of going to a doctor\u2019s office or a community clinic, people rush to the hospitals to see specialists, even for fevers and headaches. This winter, flu-stricken patients camped out overnight with blankets in the corridors of several Beijing hospitals, according to state media.Hospitals are understaffed and overwhelmed. Specialists are overworked, seeing as many as 200 patients a day.And people are frustrated, with some resorting to violence. In China, attacks on doctors are so common that they have a name: \u201cyi nao,\u201d or \u201cmedical disturbance.\u201dIn 2016, Mr. Xi unveiled the country\u2019s first long-term blueprint to improve health care since the nation\u2019s founding in 1949. Called Healthy China 2030, it pledged to bolster health innovation and make access to medical care more equal.The deficiency in doctors has taken on more urgency as the Chinese government grapples with the mounting health problems of its vast population. Heart disease, strokes, diabetes and chronic lung disease account for 80 percent of deaths in China, according to a World Bank report in 2011.Mao Qun\u2019an, the spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, acknowledged that the hospitals could no longer meet the public\u2019s needs.\u201cIf you don\u2019t get the grass roots right, then the medical problems in China cannot be solved,\u201d Mr. Mao said. \u201cSo what we\u2019re doing now is trying to return to the normal state.\u201dOn some mornings, Dr. Huang Dazhi, a general practitioner in Shanghai, rides his motorbike to a nursing home, where he treats about 40 patients a week. During lunchtime, he sprints back to his clinic to stock up on their medication and then heads back to the nursing home.Afterward, he makes house calls to three or four people. On other days, he goes to his clinic, where he sees about 70 patients. At night, he doles out advice about high-blood-pressure medications and colds to his patients, who call him on his mobile phone.For all this, Dr. Huang is paid about $1,340 a month \u2014 roughly the same he was making starting out as a specialist in internal medicine 12 years ago.\u201cThe social status of a general practitioner is not high enough,\u201d Dr. Huang said, wearing a gray Nike T-shirt and jeans under his doctor\u2019s coat. \u201cIt feels like there\u2019s still a large gap when you compare us to specialists.\u201dIn a country where pay is equated with respect, the public views family doctors as having a lower status and weaker credentials than specialists. Among nearly 18,000 doctors, only one-third thought that they were respected by the public, according to a 2017 survey by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Harvard Medical School, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the U.S. China Health Summit.\u201cThere is no trust in the primary care system among the population because the good doctors don\u2019t go there,\u201d said Bernhard Schwartl\u00e4nder, a senior aide at the World Health Organization and its former representative to China. \u201cThey cannot make money.\u201dChina once had a broad, if somewhat basic, primary health care system. \u201cBarefoot doctors\u201d roamed the countryside treating minor ailments. In the cities, people got their health care at clinics run by state-owned companies.China\u2019s \u201cbarefoot doctor\u201d system was one of the Communist revolution\u2019s most notable successes. In 1965, Chairman Mao, troubled by the lack of health care in the countryside, envisioned an army of people who spent half their time farming (many worked in the fields without shoes) and half their time treating patients. They weren\u2019t doctors, but rather a sort of health care SWAT team. The authorities gave them a short training period \u2014 several months to a year \u2014 and a bag of limited medicine and equipment.Average life expectancy in China increased to 63 years in 1970 from 44 in 1960, according to Theodore H. Tulchinsky and Elena A. Varavikova, authors of \u201cThe New Public Health,\u201d a book about global medical care. The maternal mortality rate in rural China fell to 41.3 per 100,000 people from 150 per 100,000 before 1949, according to a 2008 article published by the World Health Organization. In the same period, the infant mortality rate fell to 18.6 per 1,000 from 200.But the public was fed up that it could not get medical treatment whenever or wherever it wanted. People needed a referral to see a specialist in a hospital.In the mid-1980s, the government lifted the barriers, allowing people to be treated in hospitals. At the same time, China began an economic overhaul that led to the dismantling of the entire system. Government subsidies were cut drastically, and hospitals had to come up with ways to generate profits.As hospitals started investing in high-tech machines and expanded to meet their new financial needs, medical students were drawn to them. Many believed that being a specialist would guarantee them an \u201ciron rice bowl,\u201d a job that was secure with an extensive safety net that included housing and a pension.Dr. Huang initially followed the more lucrative path. After graduating from medical school in 2006, he started working as an internist in a hospital in Shanghai.But he kept seeing patients with simple aftercare needs like removing stitches, changing catheters and switching medication. \u201cThese things really should not be done by us specialists,\u201d he said.When Dr. Huang saw a newspaper article about general practitioners, he decided to enroll in a training program in 2007. He was inspired by his aunt, a \u201cbarefoot doctor\u201d in Mingguang, a city in Anhui Province, one of the poorest regions in China.As a boy, he had followed his aunt as she went to people\u2019s homes to deliver babies and give injections. \u201cAfter becoming a doctor, I\u2019ve realized that the people\u2019s needs for \u2018barefoot doctors\u2019 is still very much in demand,\u201d he said.In March, a doctor was killed by his patient\u2019s husband. In November 2016, a man attacked a doctor after an argument over his daughter\u2019s treatment. The month before, a father stabbed a pediatrician 15 times after his daughter died shortly after her birth. The doctor did not survive.Dr. Zhao Lizhong, an emergency room doctor in Beijing, was sitting at a computer and writing a patient\u2019s diagnosis when Lu Fu\u2019ke plunged a knife into his neck in April 2012. Around him, patients screamed.Hours earlier, Mr. Lu had stabbed Dr. Xing Zhimin, who had treated him for rhinitis, in the Peking University People\u2019s Hospital and fled. Police officers arrested him in his hometown, Zhuozhou in the northern province of Hebei, later that month. Mr. Lu was sentenced to 13 years in jail.\u201cWe know that this kind of thing can happen at any time,\u201d Dr. Zhao said.The root of the violence is all the same: a mistrust of the medical system.It goes back to the market reforms under Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s. After the government cut back subsidies to hospitals, doctors were forced to find ways to make money. Many accepted kickbacks from drug companies and gifts from patients.In a survey of more than 570 residents in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou conducted in 2013 by Cheris Chan, a sociology professor at the University of Hong Kong, more than half said they and members of their family gave \u201cred envelopes\u201d as cash gifts to doctors for surgery during 2000-12.Dr. Yu Ying, who worked as an emergency room doctor at Peking Union Hospital, one of China\u2019s top hospitals, said she was once a valiant defender of her profession. On her widely followed account on Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter, she pushed back against critics who called doctors \u201cwhite-eyed wolves.\u201d\u201cAfter I discovered the truth, I really had to give myself a slap in the face,\u201d she said.Dr. Yu said she had heard accounts from outpatient doctors who accepted thousands of dollars in kickbacks from drug companies \u2014 \u201ccash that was bundled into plastic bags.\u201d\u201cIn the entire system, the majority of doctors accept red envelopes and kickbacks,\u201d she said.It all makes for a violent mix.Many hospitals are taking measures to protect their workers. In the southern city of Guangzhou, the Zhongshan Hospital has hired taekwondo experts to teach doctors self-defense techniques. Hospitals in the eastern city of Jinan are paying private security companies for protection. Last year, the government pledged to station an adequate number of police officers in emergency departments, where most doctor-patient violence occurs.Mr. Mao, the spokesman for the health ministry, said that while the figures for attacks on medical personnel looked alarming, they needed to be put in context. Chinese patients sought medical help eight billion times in 2016, a number that is equivalent to the world\u2019s population, according to Mr. Mao. There were roughly 50,000 medical-related disputes in that period, a tiny fraction of the total number of health visits.\u201cTherefore, our judgment is the doctor-patient relationship in reality isn\u2019t tense,\u201d Mr. Mao said.If Beijing hopes to overhaul health care, it needs to persuade a skeptical public to stop going to the hospital for the sniffles.To help change the culture, China is pushing each household to sign a contract with a family doctor by 2020 and subsidizing patients\u2019 visits. General practitioners will also have the authority to make appointments directly with top specialists, rather than leaving patients to make their own at hospitals.Such measures would make it easier for patients to transfer to top hospitals without a wait, while potentially giving them more personalized care from a doctor who knows their history. It could also cut down on costs, since it is cheaper under government insurance to see a family doctor.After the government\u2019s directive, Dr. Yang Lan has signed up more than 200 patients, and monitors their health for about $1,220 a month. From her office in the Xinhua community health center, a run-down place with elderly patients milling about in the corridors, she keeps track of her patients with an Excel sheet on her computer. She said she had memorized their medical history and addresses.Dr. Yang, 31, said her practice was largely free of grumpy patients and, as a result, \u201cyi nao.\u201d She sees 50 to 60 patients in a workday of about seven and a half hours. In the United States, a family doctor has 83 \u201cpatient encounters\u201d in a 45-hour workweek, according to a 2017 survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians. That\u2019s about 16 patients in a nine-hour workday.The patients get something, too \u2014 a doctor who has time for them. Every three months, Dr. Yang has a face-to-face meeting with her patients, either during a house call or at her clinic. She\u2019s available to dispense round-the-clock advice to her patients on WeChat, a popular messaging app in China. A patient is generally kept in the waiting room for a brief period and, if necessary, gets to talk with her for at least 15 minutes.On a hot summer day, an elderly woman with white hair walked into Dr. Yang\u2019s clinic. She has cardiovascular disease, and Dr. Yang told her to watch what she ate. Next, a man with diabetes dropped in. \u201cHey, you got a haircut!\u201d Dr. Yang exclaimed. At one point, four retirees swarmed Dr. Yang\u2019s room, talking over one another.\u201cI think she\u2019s really warm and considerate,\u201d said Cai Zhenghua, the patient with diabetes. He used to seek treatment at a hospital, he said, adding, \u201cThe time spent interacting with doctors here is much longer.\u201dThe government aims to increase the number of general practitioners to two or three, and eventually five, for every 10,000 people, from 1.5 now. But to even have a chance of reaching its goals, China needs to train thousands of doctors who have no inkling of how a primary care system should function and little interest in leaving their cushy jobs in the public hospitals.It is forcing hospital specialists to staff the community clinics every week and paying those doctors subsidies to do so. It is also trying to improve the bedside manner of doctors with government-backed training programs.In Shanghai, Du Zhaohui, then the head of the Weifang community health service center, introduced a test that uses mock patients to evaluate the care and skills of general practitioners. The doctors have 15 minutes to examine \u201cpatients.\u201d The teachers use a checklist to grade the doctors on things like making \u201cappropriate eye contact\u201d and \u201cresponding appropriately to a patient\u2019s emotions.\u201dAt a recent test, one doctor, wearing crystal-studded Birkenstock sandals, examined a patient who had insufficient blood flow to the brain by swinging a tiny silver hammer, the equipment that is used for testing reflexes.\u201cThat isn\u2019t the right way,\u201d Li Yaling, head of the center\u2019s science and education department, said with a sigh. She said the doctor was probably too nervous and should have used a cotton swab to stroke the soles of the patient\u2019s feet instead.Dr. Zhu Shanzhu, a teacher in the program, said one of the main problems was that doctors did too few physical examinations in the community clinics. Many of them lean toward prescribing medicine instead. Clinical reasoning, too, is poor, she said.In 2000, Dr. Zhu designed a course to train general practitioners in Shanghai\u2019s Zhongshan Hospital, at the request of its director. Her first course was free. No one showed up.Nearly two decades later, Dr. Zhu, 71, says that training is still insufficient and doctors do not spend enough time studying the latest research and techniques in their field.\u201cIf there\u2019s more money, the good people will come,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a high economic status will elevate the social status.\u201dThe government has pledged to increase the salaries of family doctors. But Dr. Zhu isn\u2019t optimistic.\u201cAll these ministries need to coordinate among themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country\u2019s affairs, you know, they aren\u2019t easy.\u201dResearch was contributed by Zhang Tiantian, Zoe Mou, Qi Xu, Tang Yucheng, Amy Cheng and Elsie Chen.Advertisement"}

A successor to the Oldsmobile Cutlass of the 1960s to 1990s, the car was available in coupe and sedan varieties. The Alero was not largely popular like Oldsmobile models of the past, which perhaps played a hand in the division\u2019s demise. Oldsmobile\u2019s annual sales of 125,000 total vehicles paled in comparison to its one million-plus peak in the 1980s.

Economic growth and employment have clearly been on a tear since Trump took office. I\u2019m glad about that.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]What if Trump\u2019s tax cuts, deregulation, scrapping of Obamacare without any alternative and military spending surge were actually ill-thought-through, short-term-focused initiatives that all ignored expert opinion \u2014 because they mostly emerged from off-the-cuff remarks at Trump pep rallies \u2014 and collectively amount to a sugar high that not only will be unsustainable but will leave our economy far more vulnerable in the long term?When Trump simultaneously cuts corporate taxes and withdraws America from the Paris climate accord, tries to revive the coal industry by lowering pollution standards and weakens fuel economy standards for U.S.-made cars and trucks, he is vastly adding to the financial debts and carbon debts that will burden our children.And he is doing this at a time when virtually every climate scientist has warned that global-warming-driven extreme weather events \u2014 droughts, floods and wildfires \u2014 are sharply on the rise and we are staring through the last window of time to mitigate climate change so that we can manage the impacts that are already unavoidable and avoid the impacts that will be terrifyingly unmanageable.There were responsible ways to cut taxes on things we want more of \u2014 like corporate investment \u2014 while boosting them on things we want less of \u2014 like carbon, reckless financial speculation and diabetes \u2014 that could have stimulated jobs and growth but also left us more financially and environmentally resilient. But both Trump and the anonymous-G.O.P. crowd rejected them, just as they rejected smart improvements to Obamacare, preferring a total scrapping.So when Republicans say they\u2019re disgusted by Trump\u2019s ignorance and indecency but love his \u201cderegulations\u201d and \u201ctax reforms\u201d \u2014 those very sanitized words \u2014 this is what they love: taking huge fiscal and environmental risks \u2014 effectively throwing away our bumpers and spare tires that we may soon need to drive through the next financial or climate storm \u2014 for a short-term economic and political high.Here again, the anonymous-Republicans equate a bigger defense budget and more weapons with strategy and strength. Thus, by definition, if Trump increased defense spending, he did something right. Did I miss the series of congressional hearings with independent military experts that addressed the question: What are the new (and old) threats we\u2019re facing today, and how will these new and vastly expensive weapons systems enable us to better address them?Some of the smartest military analysts I know think that investing in so many big, new weapons systems is the equivalent of taking sledgehammers to droplets of quicksilver, considering that so many enemies we face today are super-empowered individuals or nations that have opted to hurt us with cheap cyberweapons and cheap but massive swarming tactics.John Arquilla, a senior strategist at the Naval Postgraduate School, likes to say that in today\u2019s networked world \u2014 where ISIS was buying drones from online shopping sites and turning them into aerial grenade launchers \u2014 \u201cmany and small can beat few and large.\u201dThe Chinese, he notes, \u201care building sea power without a traditional navy,\u201d focusing on building hundreds of cheap, small missile and torpedo boats to take on our multibillion-dollar aircraft carriers and flotillas. Moreover, Arquilla notes, \u201cwhen you have such a massive defense budget, you don\u2019t have to ask yourself hard questions\u201d such as: What the hell are we still doing in Afghanistan after 17 years of \u201cfailing to reroute the currents of history and culture there and make the place into a democracy by armed force?\u201dIn sum, I believe in a robust military and U.S. global engagement. But this does not automatically translate into support for a radically higher defense budget.So the next time anonymous-G.O.P. lawmakers tell you that while Trump is a moral wreck \u2014 and they are saving the nation from his wretchedness \u2014 they love his tax cuts, deregulation and military budget, ask them to describe the strategic vision behind that defense budget. Ask them if they really are unbothered by massively increasing the deficit at a time when our economy was already growing \u2014 just when we should be saving cash to soften our next recession. Ask them if they really think it is smart to roll back our auto mileage standards, when the last time we did that the more fuel-efficient Japanese and Korean auto industries nearly killed Detroit.Lastly, ask them if they have kids \u2014 and how they think all these Trumpian policies that they like, even if they don\u2019t like Trump, will serve the next generation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How \u2018Plaid Shirt Guy\u2019 Got Prime Seating at a Trump Rally", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt a rally in Montana last week, the crowd cheered for President Trump as he gave a freewheeling speech that touched on the economy, his 2016 victory over Hillary Clinton and his success as \u201cyour favorite of all time president.\u201dOnline, the cheers were for a teenager in a plaid shirt.Eventually, a woman approached him, gestured for his exit and replaced him in the crowd.He gained widespread attention and on social media came to be known as Plaid Shirt Guy.As his online persona took off, so did the questions: Who was he? What was he doing there? And how did he, of all people, manage to get such prime seating?Internet, meet Tyler Linfesty.That morning, Mr. Linfesty said, he got an email saying that he had been selected for V.I.P. status, which meant that he would get to meet the president and have access to premier seating. He said that he did not apply for the status and that he believed he was chosen by chance.He got to take a brief picture with the president before the rally and asked organizers whether he and his friends could sit together behind the stage. In fact, their seats could not have been more prominent.\u201cI think it was basically random that we got placed right behind him and on television,\u201d Mr. Linfesty said on Saturday.Mr. Linfesty said organizers instructed the crowd to clap and cheer, but he said he could not bring himself to applaud for things that he did not agree with. He said he did not know he was so visible until friends texted him in the middle of the speech.\u201cThat was not me trying to protest,\u201d Mr. Linfesty said. \u201cThat was just my honest reactions to the things that he was saying.\u201dAt one point during the speech, he put on a pin showing support for the Democratic Socialists of America. Finally, a woman slid into the aisle and whispered something to him. He walked off and she replaced him in the crowd: a new face, now smiling pleasantly in the background.Shortly afterward, his friends were replaced, too.Backstage, Mr. Linfesty said he was pulled aside while police officers and Secret Service officials checked his identification. After about 10 minutes, he said, \u201cthey respectfully told me to just leave and not come back.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to requests for comment about Mr. Linfesty\u2019s removal.In general, not anyone can stand behind political candidates at rallies, campaign experts said. That area is tightly controlled and often reserved for notable people, local politicians and campaign volunteers. Sometimes, campaigns may invite community members to convey a sense of local authenticity.\u201cThe question is, What is it you want to have people think when they look at the picture?\u201d said Jennifer Cunningham of SKDKnickerbocker, a political consulting firm that has worked on presidential campaigns.Most people don\u2019t need encouragement to behave appropriately, but to prevent slip-ups, campaigns typically vet people who will be near the president and instruct them on how to avoid being a distraction, experts said.\u201cFor a presidential campaign to fail to do even a cursory vetting \u2014 the guy was wearing a Democratic Socialists of America sticker, for heaven\u2019 sake \u2014 is unprecedented,\u201d said Ms. Cunningham, whose firm works with Democratic campaigns. \u201cThe rule is that you vet everything and everyone so there are no surprises.\u201dMr. Linfesty said that his parents were told that a background check was conducted before he was offered his seating, but it\u2019s unclear what that entailed or whether Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was aware of his political views.For those who don\u2019t have V.I.P. access, there\u2019s another way to get front and center at a rally: Show up early.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018Fear,\u2019 Bob Woodward Pulls Back the Curtain on President Trump\u2019s \u2018Crazytown\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesNothing in Bob Woodward\u2019s sober and grainy new book, \u201cFear: Trump in the White House,\u201d is especially surprising. This is a White House that has leaked from Day 1. We knew things were bad. Woodward is here, like a state trooper knocking on the door at 3 a.m., to update the sorry details.Some of these details, at first glance, are amusing. Trump lamented when Twitter, the social media platform on which he dispenses Pez-sized pellets of discourtesy, raised the maximum size of an individual tweet from 140 to 280 characters because, he is quoted as saying, \u201cI was the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters.\u201d Somewhere in heaven, Papa is wondering if he can\u2019t self-destruct all over again.It is stranger still to learn that Trump orders his most popular tweets printed out, so that he can study them. What lesson has he learned? That his most effective tweets are often the most unhinged. He\u2019s a focus group of one, thriving on the smell of his own sulfur. Reince Priebus, his former chief of staff, calls the presidential bedroom, where Trump goes to tweet, \u201cthe devil\u2019s workshop,\u201d and early mornings and Sunday nights, when Trump is at loose ends, \u201cthe witching hour.\u201dSome in the White House have tried to tone down the president\u2019s online effusions, but that idea seems to have been jettisoned in the havoc. His advisers are viewed in mostly pitiless terms by Woodward. \u201cTrump had failed the President Lincoln test,\u201d he writes. \u201cHe had not put a team of political rivals or competitors at the table.\u201dWoodward vividly quotes Priebus on the chaos of the White House\u2019s decision making. \u201cWhen you put a snake and a rat and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls, things start getting nasty and bloody. That\u2019s what happens.\u201d\u201cFear\u201d is a typical Woodward book in that named sources for scenes, thoughts and quotations appear only sometimes. Woodward has never been a graceful writer, but the prose here is unusually wooden. It\u2019s as if he wants to make a statement that, at this historical juncture, simple factual pine-board competence should suffice.The critic Clive James once complained that Woodward \u201cchecks his facts until they weep with boredom.\u201d Well, fact-checking and boredom seem sexy again. Even weeping is making a comeback.Woodward dispenses in \u201cFear\u201d with most of the small human details that brightened his earlier books. There is no moment like the one in \u201cBush at War\u201d (2002) in which George W. Bush said to a Navy steward on duty in the West Wing, \u201cFerdie, I want a hamburger.\u201dWoodward keeps the scene-setting to a minimum. Those he does set tend to be around policy disputes over North Korea, Afghanistan, tax reform, trade and tariffs, and the Paris climate agreement, among other issues.Woodward\u2019s subjects have always been able to trade access for spotlight and some sympathy in his books. Among the primary sources for this book are clearly Priebus; Gary D. Cohn, Trump\u2019s former chief economic adviser; and Rob Porter, Trump\u2019s former staff secretary.There are terrifying scenes in which Cohn and Porter conspire to keep certain documents out of Trump\u2019s reach. One of these would have withdrawn the United States from a crucial trade agreement with South Korea. Another would have pulled the country from the North American Free Trade Agreement.Describing one of these moments, Woodward writes: \u201cThe reality was that the United States in 2017 was tethered to the words and actions of an emotionally overwrought, mercurial and unpredictable leader. Members of his staff had joined to purposefully block some of what they believed were the president\u2019s most dangerous impulses. It was a nervous breakdown of the executive power of the most powerful country in the world.\u201dTrump rarely realizes when things go missing, Woodward suggests. Though he does quote him shouting, like a boy king, \u201cBring me my tariffs!\u201dCohn is in some ways this book\u2019s moral center. If this were a first-person novel, he would be its narrator. He is shocked at every turn by Trump\u2019s lack of knowledge and utter lack of interest in learning anything at all. It was pointless to prepare a presentation of any sort for him.Cohn and Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, had \u201cseveral quiet conversations\u201d about what they called \u201cThe Big Problem: The president did not understand the importance of allies overseas, the value of diplomacy or the relationship between the military, the economy and intelligence partnerships with foreign governments.\u201dTrump is quoted saying feckless things like, about the war in Afghanistan, \u201cYou should be killing guys. You don\u2019t need a strategy to kill people.\u201dMany insults are flung in \u201cFear,\u201d sometimes behind backs, sometimes right in the kisser. Most are from Trump. He said to Porter about Priebus: \u201cHe\u2019s like a little rat. He just scurries around. You don\u2019t even have to pay any attention to him.\u201d He calls Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in Porter\u2019s presence, \u201cmentally retarded\u201d and mocks his accent.John F. Kelly, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, is quoted as saying about the president, in a meeting, \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot. It\u2019s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He\u2019s gone off the rails. We\u2019re in crazytown.\u201dMike Pence, the vice president, comes off as a glorified golf caddy who doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat lest Trump tweet something mean about him. Stephen K. Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, simmers frequently in this book\u2019s background. About Melania Trump, Bannon says: \u201cBehind the scenes she\u2019s a hammer.\u201d Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are seen by nearly all parties as pointless. \u201cThey were like a posse of second-guessers, hovering, watching,\u201d Woodward writes. He does describe how Ivanka got her father to talk to Al Gore about climate change.Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation rattles Trump to his core in \u201cFear.\u201d Woodward suggests that the president is right, at least in one regard, to be aggrieved.The intelligence report from the C.I.A., the National Security Agency, the F.B.I. and others about Russian interference in the 2016 election was an airtight document, he says. Why then did James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, also introduce the so-called Steele dossier?\u201cIt would be as if I had reported and written one of the most serious, complex stories for The Washington Post that I had ever done,\u201d Woodward writes, \u201cand then provided an appendix of unverified allegations. Oh, by the way, here is a to-do list for further reporting and we\u2019re publishing it.\u201dThere is a strong sense here of the clock ticking. John M. Dowd, Trump\u2019s former lawyer, does not think Trump is mentally capable of testifying to the special counsel. \u201cDon\u2019t testify,\u201d he is quoted as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s either that or an orange jump suit.\u201dTrump declined to be interviewed for this book, Woodward writes in a note to readers. But the book\u2019s title is from a quote Trump delivered in a 2016 interview with Woodward and his Washington Post colleague Robert Costa: \u201cReal power is \u2014 I don\u2019t even want to use the word \u2014 fear.\u201dIf this book has a single point to drive home, it is that the president of the United States is a congenital liar. I wish \u201cFear\u201d had other points to make. I wanted more context, more passion, a bit of irony and certainly more simple history. Surely Woodward, of all people, has worthwhile comparisons to make between Trump and Richard Nixon.But this is not Woodward\u2019s way. \u201cFear\u201d picks up little narrative momentum. It\u2019s a slow tropical storm of a book, not a hurricane. You turn the pages because Woodward, as he accumulates the queasy-making details, delivers on the promise of his title.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even in Better Times, Some Americans Seem Farther Behind. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmericans\u2019 household earnings are finally stretching back to their pre-recession heights. But feeling secure and comfortable isn\u2019t only a measure of how much money you have. It\u2019s also a measure of how much you have compared with others.For many, that is one reason that recent financial progress may seem overshadowed by the gains they\u2019ve missed out on and a needling sense that they\u2019ve lost ground.As new research illustrates, two groups in particular have stalled: whites without a college degree, and blacks and Hispanics with one. Both are being far outpaced by college-educated whites.\u201cAmerica has been a story of getting ahead, of progress,\u201d said Morris P. Fiorina, a political scientist at Stanford University. \u201cThere\u2019s been no story of progress \u2014 for them.\u201dThe economic swoops and comebacks of the last three decades have chipped away at many measures of well-being. An advanced global economy has radically revalued the contributions of blue-collar labor and technological skills.The lingering economic insecurity has fired resentments, sharpened identity politics and fueled populism on the right and left that is upending hierarchies in the Democratic and Republican Parties.But parallels between whites who did not finish college and blacks and Hispanics who did show that \u201cthis is not clearly a race story and not clearly an education story,\u201d said William R. Emmons, an economist at the St. Louis Fed and a co-author of its report.Even as new data shows continuing overall gains in median incomes, some groups have lagged, especially whites without a college degree and blacks and Hispanics with one.Median income relative to population medianNON-COLLEGE GRADUATESCOLLEGE GRADUATES200%WhiteHispanic150Black1005001989-982001-072010-161989-982001-072010-16Median net worth relative to population medianNON-COLLEGE GRADUATESCOLLEGE GRADUATES500%White400HispanicBlack30020010001989-982001-072010-161989-982001-072010-16Median net worth relative to population medianMedian income relative to population medianNON-COLLEGE GRADUATESCOLLEGE GRADUATESNON-COLLEGE GRADUATESCOLLEGE GRADUATES200%500%WhiteWhite400HispanicHispanic150BlackBlack30010020050100001989-982001-072010-161989-982001-072010-161989-982001-072010-161989-982001-072010-16By The New York Times | Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. LouisTo Mr. Emmons, the most striking result was the steep declines among white families headed by someone without a college degree. Members of this group \u2014 labeled the white working class \u2014 not only were left behind financially, but also lagged in other measures of well-being, like self-reported health, homeownership, and marriage or cohabitation rates.In absolute terms, they are still doing better than their black and Hispanic counterparts, with nine times the wealth and a higher median income. But as Theodore Roosevelt observed, \u201cComparison is the thief of joy.\u201dThe white working class, which once dominated the American work force and reaped a hefty chunk of its rewards, has seen its incomes trail far behind those of college graduates. In less than three decades, its share of total income sank to 27 percent from 45 percent. For these workers, the education gap is starker than ever.At the same time, working-class blacks and Hispanics began to catch up. These groups\u2019 median incomes grew at an accelerated pace over the same period that the median income of working-class whites declined.\u201cTheir relative position has fallen dramatically,\u201d said Ronald Inglehart, a political scientist and professor emeritus at the University of Michigan, \u201cat a time when the desirable standard of living has risen a lot.\u201dTo Mr. Inglehart, expanding inequality is the primary culprit, decreasing satisfaction while fanning ethnic and racial tensions and anti-immigrant sentiment around the world. \u201cRewards are being sucked up at the top to a degree that is stunning,\u201d he said.The most plausible explanation, the report concluded, is the \u201cdiminishing set of advantages relative to nonwhite working-class families in terms of high school graduation rates, access to relatively high-paying jobs, and freedom from explicit workplace discrimination.\u201dWithout a cushion of family assets, the housing bubble and recession cut deep among minorities, gnawing away the assets even of college graduates. White households with similar education levels also lost wealth, but their relative position was enhanced. In the 1990s, their real median net worth was 256 percent of the general population\u2019s. That figure jumped to 416 percent by 2016.Black college graduates were also the only other group besides the white working class that experienced declines in all three nonfinancial measures tracked \u2014 health, homeownership, and marriage or cohabitation rates.\u201cThey\u2019re playing the game, and yet they\u2019re still facing discrimination in workplaces and neighborhoods,\u201d she said. \u201cIt absolutely harms their mental health and their physical health.\u201dThese shifting economic and social fortunes have been shaping voters\u2019 attitudes and candidates\u2019 pitches as the midterm elections approach.Within the Democratic Party, attacks on widening inequality and enduring racial privilege coupled with support for free college education have resonated with voters and delivered surprising victories to several left-leaning political challengers.The feeling of decline among the groups lagging behind is well founded, Ms. Williams said. \u201cWhat\u2019s at issue here is whether they\u2019re going to interpret that decline through the lens of race or through the lens of class,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a war over interpretation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Japan\u2019s Mothers Go Back to Work, but Find the Opportunities Lacking", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 When Hiromi Otsuzuki joined the Japanese software company Isana.net as human resources manager four years ago, she was the only part-time employee.Working just 15 hours a week so that she could care for her stepson made Ms. Otsuzuki an outcast in a country that is notorious for the long hours office workers spend at their desks.Her colleagues called her \u201cpart-no obasan,\u201d or part-time auntie. Despite being a specialist, she was asked to organize bags for recycling.\u201cWithin the company, nobody would accept me,\u201d Ms. Otsuzuki, 48, said.Things are better now. She is no longer the only part-time worker in the office, and she has been promoted.Judging by the numbers, things are looking up for other mothers in the Japanese work force. According to a government survey released in July, nearly 71 percent of women with children were working, as of Japan\u2019s most recent fiscal year, which ended in March. That is the highest level on record, and a 14-percentage-point increase since 2004.But the figures mask some major problems with the quality of work available to working mothers.Under pressure at home to maintain their child-rearing responsibilities, many professionally minded mothers are opting for part-time work. In Japan, that means accepting meager benefits, little job security, few opportunities for advancement and pay that is often so low that women\u2019s rights advocates have described it as exploitation.Only one in four mothers in Japan was employed full time in the last fiscal year.\u201cEvery company thinks that opening doors and hiring women is the end goal,\u201d said Kaori Sasaki, chair of the Committee for the International Conference for Women in Business. \u201cBut actually, that is the starting point.\u201dAfter graduating from a junior college in 1992, Ms. Otsuzuki spent 19 years in jobs that included secretary and human resources staff member, mostly at the electronics giant Sony and NHK, the national broadcaster. In 2011, she married a man who had a 10-year-old son, and she felt obligated to leave her career and care for the boy.She found life at home more stressful than being at work, and after three years she decided to find a job.\u201cIn Japan, housewives have very high expectation from society and mothers-in-law,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was too much pressure.\u201dFinding a suitable position proved to be harder than she had anticipated.\u201cCompanies don\u2019t value experience, because they have their own way of doing things,\u201d she said. \u201cI had to act like a freshman.\u201dManagers who showed an interest in hiring her also insisted that she work full time. But with the continuing tug of household responsibilities, Ms. Otsuzuki preferred fewer, and more flexible, hours.It took Ms. Otsuzuki six months to land the position at Isana.net, with an initial hourly wage that was about 40 percent of what she had earned in her last full-time job.Although Ms. Otsuzuki has managed to strike a balance between home and office, many other working mothers find that the pull between the two makes it difficult for them to stay in jobs.After she had her second child, in 2013, Misa Masuo, a longtime employee of the cosmetics company Shiseido, moved into a position as a saleswoman in a department store that allowed her to work fewer hours. Two years later, she resigned, overwhelmed by her dual duties.At home, she was what is known in Japan as \u201cone-ope child care,\u201d or one-person operation. She was expected to go home after work and cook, clean and bathe the children \u2014 a task she describes as \u201calways chaotic\u201d \u2014 entirely on her own. Ms. Masuo\u2019s husband, a chef, worked long hours at a restaurant and did little to help with the children beyond ushering them to day care each morning.At work, Ms. Masuo, 39, felt a constant sense of guilt that she was imposing extra responsibilities on her fellow saleswomen, especially during busy shopping hours.\u201cI was always saying \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry\u2019 to colleagues, as I dashed home from work early,\u201d she recalled.Such challenges frequently derail women\u2019s careers and contribute to a gender pay gap that is the third biggest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s member countries, behind only South Korea and Estonia.\u201cThe quality of jobs given to women is not that high,\u201d said Machiko Osawa, director of the Research Institute for Women and Careers at Japan Women\u2019s University. \u201cThat has to be improved. Then not only are women working but they contribute more.\u201dSevere economic pressures are forcing some change. Managers are experiencing labor shortages amid low unemployment and an aging labor force, making them more willing to accommodate working mothers.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has also made the inclusion of women in the workplace part of his campaign to revive Japan\u2019s long-stagnant economy. He has promised better access to child care, and Parliament has introduced legislation that would require large companies to publicly state their goals for hiring women.\u201cA lot of companies are desperate for workers,\u201d said Ichiro Masumura, president of BStyle, an employment agency based in Tokyo that specializes in placing female workers in jobs, including through its website, \u201cshufu-job.jp,\u201d which translates to housewife-job.Advocates for women, however, contend that more needs to be done. Tougher laws that promote gender equality in the workplace are necessary, they argue, and better training is required to sensitize male executives to the needs of their female staff members.As of now, progress is coming on a smaller scale.Isana Ishitani, who founded Isana.net in 2001, had never considered hiring housewives. But as the company grew, there were important tasks that were best suited to part-time workers. Watching his sister-in-law get pushed out of a software company after having a child also heightened his awareness of the trials faced by working mothers.\u201cThat gave me an idea of what is happening in the work environment and culture in Japan,\u201d Mr. Ishitani said. \u201cI thought that was a very good opportunity for a midsize company like us to hire people.\u201dAsked about Ms. Otsuzuki\u2019s early experiences at Isana.net, Mr. Ishitani said that when he started hiring part-time workers, he did not want to distinguish between their roles and responsibilities and those of the company\u2019s full-time staff members. But he acknowledged that because Japanese workers often see part-time work as suited only for menial or mechanical tasks, \u201cour idea was not fully understood by our team initially.\u201d\u201cBut I believe now they do,\u201d he added.Since hiring Ms. Otsuzuki, Isana.net has built a team of eight mothers who work part time \u2014 out of about 45 workers in total. Ms. Otsuzuki\u2019s status has improved, too. This year, she received a promotion and a pay raise that nearly doubled her hourly income. Even though she still works part time, she also gets the same benefits as a full-time employee.Mr. Ishitani now allows Isana.net employees to bring their children to the office if necessary and to switch between full- and part-time hours to care for children or, as is increasingly the case, older parents.\u201cWe want the employees to work for our company until they retire,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an old Japanese idea. In order to do that, people need to adapt to a lot of things in their lives.\u201dIn the meantime, Ms. Otsuzuki said, the rest of Japan has no choice but to include people like her.\u201cLuckily, Japan is so short of workers,\u201d she said, \u201cthat even \u2018part-no obasan\u2019 are welcome.\u201dChie Kobayashi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Cynical, bad-faith Republican politics.Opinion ColumnistBut this is only half right. We avoided utter disaster, but nonetheless experienced a huge, sustained employment slump, one that inflicted immense human and economic cost \u2014 and may well have helped set the stage for our current constitutional crisis. Why did the slump go on so long?There are multiple answers, but the most important factor was politics \u2014 cynical, bad-faith obstructionism on the part of the Republican Party.Beyond that, efforts to fight unemployment had to deal with a bizarre Beltway consensus that despite high unemployment and record low interest rates, debt, not jobs, was the real problem.But the most important reason the great slump went on so long was scorched-earth Republican opposition to anything and everything that might have helped offset the fallout from the housing bust.So if you want to understand why the great slump that began in 2008 went on so long, blighting so many American lives, the answer is politics. Specifically, policy failed because cynical, bad-faith Republicans were willing to sacrifice millions of jobs rather than let anything good happen to the economy while a Democrat sat in the White House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Erdogan\u2019s Charm Offensive, Germans Find Offense", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut if Mr. Erdogan was on a charm offensive, Germans seemed to agree that, after just 24 hours in Berlin, it was more offensive than charm.The first thing the Turkish president did?Mr. Erdogan apparently flashed a four-fingered Muslim Brotherhood salute in central Berlin and demanded the extradition of 69 Turkish exiles in Germany, among them journalists and lawyers investigating Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government and risking prison at home.Chancellor Angela Merkel was not impressed.Standing stiffly next to the Turkish leader at a news conference in Berlin on Friday, she noted \u201cdeep-seated differences\u201d between the two countries regarding press freedom and the rule of law, and she insisted that Mr. Erdogan release several political prisoners held in Turkey \u2014 including five German citizens.\u201cI have urged that these cases be solved as quickly as possible,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, as Mr. Erdogan stared straight ahead.Facing the worst economic crisis in his country in 15 years, the Turkish leader had toned down his anti-Western rhetoric in recent weeks. Only a year ago, he called the German government \u201cenemies of Turkey.\u201d Turkish officials accused Berlin of deploying Nazi tactics, and Turkish newspapers called German companies in Turkey spies.This week, Mr. Erdogan said, \u201cWe want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany \u2014 just like it used to be.\u201dAmong the names on the extradition list, which was submitted to the Foreign Ministry in Berlin on Monday, according to the Turkish newspaper Yeni Akit, is Can Dundar, the former editor in chief of the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet.Mr. Dundar fled Turkey in 2016 after he was convicted of treason and espionage for reporting a year earlier that Turkey\u2019s Secret Service had delivered arms to the Islamic State. His wife remains in Turkey and is not allowed to leave the country.When Mr. Erdogan was informed that Mr. Dundar planned to be at the news conference with Ms. Merkel, the Turkish president threatened to call off the whole thing. In the end, Mr. Dundar said he would not go to ensure that colleagues would have an opportunity to ask Mr. Erdogan critical questions.Asked whether Ms. Merkel considered it a provocation that Mr. Dundar\u2019s name was on the extradition list, the chancellor was blunt: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that there is controversy in this case.\u201dMr. Erdogan, meanwhile, reiterated that Mr. Dundar was \u201can agent\u201d who had published state secrets.Though not holding back her criticism, Ms. Merkel was visibly uncomfortable with a joint appearance that showed clumsy diplomacy not just from the Turkish president but also from a Western power that ultimately has to deal with a budding dictator on Europe\u2019s border.At one point during the news conference, a photographer in the front row slipped on a T-shirt with a message of support for journalists jailed in Turkey. The man, a photographer for a Turkish-language news site in Germany, was swiftly removed by security personnel as Mr. Erdogan looked on and smiled.The newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung described the scene as one \u201cyou\u2019d expect more in Erdogan\u2019s Turkey.\u201dMs. Merkel stressed that Germany and Turkey, both NATO members, had many shared strategic interests. She announced a meeting with the leaders of France, Turkey and Russia in October to discuss the situation in Syria, in particular the rebel stronghold of Idlib.\u201cWe have a lot that unites us,\u201d she said at the news conference, singling out questions of migration and the fight against terrorism. She also expressed hope that Turkey\u2019s economic turmoil would abate.\u201cGermany has an interest in an economically stable Turkey,\u201d she said.Mr. Erdogan is secure in his newly powerful presidency. But the Turkish economy is in bad shape. The lira has come under severe pressure \u2014 losing nearly 40 percent of its value this year \u2014 buffeted by high inflation and surging foreign debt. As the lira has fallen in value, Turkish companies have struggled to make debt payments.But if the Turkish president was looking to reassure financial markets, improve business ties and seek political support, he went about it clumsily.A photograph of him driving through Berlin and making what appeared to be the hand sign of Muslim Brotherhood supporters \u2014 one used by Mr. Erdogan on previous occasions \u2014 was widely shared on German social media.Cem Ozdemir, a Turkish-German lawmaker and longtime Erdogan critic, put it in an interview with the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: \u201cErdogan has no intention of changing his spots, despite his attempts at a charm offensive.\u201dThe state visit in Germany is hosted by the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial. It has been met with a wave of criticism.Thousands of protesters, including many of Turkish origin, took to the streets of Berlin near Mr. Erdogan\u2019s hotel on Friday afternoon. One banner, held by a Kurdish woman standing near the Brandenburg Gate read, \u201cErdogan you\u2019re not a leader, you\u2019re a dictator.\u201d Another declared, \u201cGet lost, Erdogan!\u201dMore protests are planned for Saturday in Cologne, where Mr. Erdogan is scheduled to open a new central mosque of one of Germany\u2019s largest Islamic organizations. The group, the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs, or Ditib, is financed by the Turkish government and is suspected of disseminating pro-Erdogan propaganda.Several German lawmakers joined the protests rather than attend a state banquet on Friday night. Bijan Djir-Sarai, the foreign policy speaker of the Free Democrats, said he could not dine with Mr. Erdogan \u201cwhile German citizens sit in Turkish prisons.\u201dThe temperature rose briefly at the dinner when Mr. Steinmeier\u2019s criticism of Turkey for pursuing government critics drew a response from Mr. Erdogan. The intellectuals and journalists wanted by the Turkish justice system, Mr. Erdogan said, are \u201cterrorists\u201d and Germany is \u201cprotecting them.\u201dBeforehand, Ms. Merkel had defended the decision to host Mr. Erdogan, saying, \u201cWe can only work through our differences if we talk to each other.\u201dBut she, too, was conspicuously absent from the state banquet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Could There Be Another Chinese Revolution?", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Lian, a native of Hong Kong, is a former lead writer and chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal.It was such an extraordinary series of mishaps and policy errors and then complaints that one wondered whether they were a concerted, if veiled, attack on Mr. Xi.The term \u201cPlebeians\u201d refers to officials without significant pre-1949 revolutionary pedigrees who rose to the top of the ruling hierarchy or were catapulted there after Mao and later Deng Xiaoping marginalized old-timers.These two factions now dominate China\u2019s New Class, to borrow the Yugoslav Milovan Djilas\u2019s phrase for Soviet communist elites. Both are self-interested, corrupt and authoritarian, but they exhibit significant policy differences and have become dangerously antagonistic.The Red Aristocrats want the C.C.P. and the state sector to control markets and corporations, a carry-over from their Marxist founding fathers. The Plebeians are more pro-market, presumably because they consolidated power (and accumulated wealth and privileges) during Deng\u2019s overhaul of the Maoist economy in the 1980s.Under Mr. Xi, the Red Aristocrats have gutted the lie-low-bide-time approach favored by Deng and his successors for an expansionist and hyper-nationalist position reminiscent of Mao\u2019s.Mao was different, and his legacy today is as well. He, too, liquidated landowners. And he sidelined, humiliated and exiled many of his comrades from before 1949. But he did not have them killed off. After he died in 1976, members of the old guard returned to power. They were ousted again later, by Deng after the crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989, for sympathizing with the pro-democracy students or resisting Deng\u2019s capitalistic reforms.That year Mr. Jiang became general secretary of the C.C.P. He wielded formal power or great influence for nearly two decades, including long after he ceased being party chairman, and planted many loyalists in key positions. His people, mostly commoners, amassed personal wealth as China\u2019s economy skyrocketed \u2014 to the dismay and envy of many Red Aristocrats.The Plebeian faction expanded during the first decade of this century, under the leadership of President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao: They tapped their power base in the Communist Youth League, a boot camp for commoners wishing to be credentialed for Party membership.But then came Mr. Xi, a high-carat Red Aristocrat whose father was a senior leader during the republic\u2019s early years. Like a Hamlet kicking out usurpers \u2014 a popular comparison \u2014 Mr. Xi promptly went after each of the two Plebeian subgroups.If Mr. Xi stays in power for more than two five-year terms, the ascendancy of the Red Aristocrats may become unstoppable. What then?Chinese society underwent radical structural changes between the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) and the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). Naito Konan, a prominent Japanese Sinologist, noted in the 1910s and 1920s that before the enlightened autocracy of the Song era, China had for many decades been ruled by an informally hereditary aristocracy whose emperors also filled top government posts and controlled the civil service examinations. The emperors created a closed, self-serving and rapacious elite \u2014 until the entire system suddenly collapsed.Naito noted that for decades the dynasties remained stable even as emperors were often overthrown by other aristocrats. It was another historian, Nicolas Tackett, who recently explained why the aristocracy was finally done in, and why so quickly. After examining hundreds of epitaphs on graves from the ninth century, he concluded that the Tang empire was brought down by Huang Chao, a disgruntled salt-merchant-turned-rebel, who tapped popular discontent to wage a rebellion that swiftly turned into a blood bath \u2014 a class genocide that physically annihilated the entire medieval aristocratic class.This is a precedent that should worry China\u2019s leaders today.If in the years ahead Mr. Xi\u2019s Red Aristocrats become even more entrenched and social mobility is further obstructed by vested interests, economic exploitation will intensify, fueling class differences. As the Plebeians head toward defeat, strife among powerful oligarchs within the Red Aristocracy will take center stage.Whether a modern-day Huang Chao would then appear \u2014 and would know how to galvanize a disgruntled population into rising up \u2014 no one can tell, of course. But some people seem to worry about the possibility.Yi-Zheng Lian, a commentator on Hong Kong and Asian affairs, is a professor of economics at Yamanashi Gakuin University, in Kofu, Japan, and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Says Tariffs Will Save American Factories. History Shows Otherwise.", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is building a wall of tariffs around the domestic economy, attempting to protect American jobs by limiting imports. But a tire factory that opened last year in Richburg, S.C., offers a reminder that globalization is hard to stop.In 2009, American tire makers persuaded the Obama administration to impose tariffs on Chinese tires, and imports of tires from China fell sharply. But Chinese companies did not stop making tires in response to the tariffs \u2014 they simply moved production to other places, including to the United States.Giti, one of the largest tire makers in China, built the South Carolina factory to make low-cost tires for Walmart. Two other Chinese tire companies are building plants in the neighboring states of Georgia and North Carolina, and a fourth Chinese company acquired a tire factory in Georgia this year.Mr. Trump on Monday said the United States would begin imposing tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on Sept. 24, on top of the $50 billion worth of products he previously taxed. The new tariffs hit many of the consumer products that Americans use every day, like food, clothing and electronics, and the president threatened to go even further, saying he is prepared to tax all Chinese imports if Beijing retaliates.The president also has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from most foreign countries, and has threatened to tax imports of cars and car parts.Tariffs are taxes ultimately paid by American consumers, in the form of higher prices. The purpose of a tariff is to raise the price of imports above the price of the domestic alternatives. The bill for this method of protecting domestic jobs is paid disproportionately by lower-income households. And it is often very large.Steel tariffs imposed in 2002 by President George W. Bush yielded similar results, penalizing not just consumers but companies that use steel to make other products, like construction companies and carmakers. The Dartmouth economist Douglas Irwin estimated 140,000 American workers make steel, while 6.5 million workers make products that include steel.\u201cIf for some reason you said, \u2018We just want to help steel producers, shareholders, possibly steel workers,\u2019 it makes sense,\u201d Mr. Irwin said. \u201cIf you care about manufacturing employment or the manufacturing sector, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201dThe political counterargument for tariffs is that change is painful. Workers who lose jobs may struggle to find new ones; communities that lose factories may crumble. Mr. Trump has presented tariffs as an effective prophylactic, arguing that import taxes will protect American workers and companies.But the United States\u2019 tire tariffs \u2014 and similar efforts by past administrations to tax everything from socks to solar panels \u2014 have generally failed to protect existing factories and jobs. The Chinese factories in the Southeast will create new jobs for American workers but, in effect, the tariffs are simply moving jobs from one place to another at a very high price.The Reagan administration\u2019s 1981 deal with Japan to restrict auto imports helped to catalyze the production of Japanese cars in the United States. Honda, an upstart manufacturer assigned a relatively small import quota, arrived first, opening an automobile factory in Marysville, Ohio, in 1982.While presidents between Ronald Reagan and Mr. Trump imposed fewer trade restrictions, the pattern continued. The Clinton administration restricted imports of Fuji film in 1993. Three years later, the Japanese company opened a plant in Greenwood, S.C.The tire industry offers a more recent example. The Obama administration imposed tariffs on Chinese car and light-truck tires for three years in September 2009. Chinese imports had surged, and several American factories had closed.After the tariffs were lifted in late 2012, Chinese imports rebounded. In 2015, the administration imposed a second round of larger tariffs, this time lasting for five years.Imports of Chinese tires for sale to American consumers fell to 12.3 million in 2017 from 43 million in 2009, according to Modern Tire Dealer, a trade magazine.Chinese companies avoided the first round of tariffs, which were explicitly temporary, by shifting production to other Asian countries, including Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. But in mid-2014, Giti Tire announced plans for a different kind of response \u2014 a $560 million tire-making plant in northern South Carolina.Giti has its headquarters in Singapore but, at the time, it made almost all of its tires at seven Chinese factories, so it was vulnerable to the threat of new tariffs.The next year, when the Obama administration announced a new round of tariffs on Giti and other Chinese tire makers, the company loudly protested, pointing to its investment plans as evidence of \u201ca sustained and significant commitment to the U.S., with no intention to harm the tire industry in the United States.\u201dThe company also enlisted Nikki R. Haley, then the governor of South Carolina, who wrote a letter of protest to the Obama administration defending Giti as a South Carolina employer. Ms. Haley is now Mr. Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations.State and local governments in the Southeast have ardently pursued Chinese investment in recent years, but it is far from clear that the Trump administration would welcome an influx of Chinese companies in response to its tariffs.Amid rising tensions, Chinese direct investment in the United States declined to $2 billion during the first half of 2018 from $45.6 billion in 2016, according to Rhodium Group, a consultancy. Wanli Tire, another Chinese company, suspended plans in May to build a $1 billion factory in Orangeburg County, S.C.Some economists and corporate executives say the Trump administration\u2019s broader trade policies, particularly the decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, also may keep companies away. The tariffs have increased the cost of domestic production, and provoked retaliatory restrictions by major trading partners.Before Mr. Trump imposed the steel and aluminum tariffs, his chief trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said other countries would not retaliate. \u201cThey know they\u2019re cheating us, and all we\u2019re doing is standing up for ourselves,\u201d Mr. Navarro told Fox News.Instead, irate policymakers in the European Union slapped tariffs on iconic American products, including Kentucky bourbon, Levi\u2019s jeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Harley, which ships 40,000 motorcycles from American factories to Europe each year, said in June it would shift production to other countries.Domestic tire manufacturers who pushed for tariff protections in 2009 and in 2015, said that the industry needs and has benefited from government protection.Paul Reitz, the chief executive of Titan International, an Illinois company that makes tires for farming equipment and other off-road uses, said the tariffs have helped, even though he said that imports have climbed to 40 percent of the off-road tire market from 20 percent of the market since 2009.Indeed, he said he would like the Trump administration to increase the tariffs on tires. Tariffs allow him to charge higher prices and to earn larger profits. \u201cI\u2019d much rather be putting it into investment than to be giving it away to fight off foreign competitors,\u201d he said.But Mr. Reitz does not like the tariffs on steel, which the company uses to reinforce tires and to make wheels. And he does not like the escalation of trade tensions with China, which is spooking the farmers who are the primary buyers of his tires and whose exports are particularly exposed to retaliation by the Chinese.\u201cIt\u2019s created a lot of uncertainty with our cost structure and our customers,\u201d Mr. Reitz said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what the full impact of the tariffs are going to be.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter: @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street May No Longer Be Able to Shrug Off Trump\u2019s Trade Wars", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis may be the point at which investors have to start taking President Trump\u2019s trade wars much more seriously.Fears about trade have at times weighed on stocks since mid-February when the Trump administration announced tariffs on steel and aluminum. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up nearly 9 percent this year, and much of those gains have come in the past two months, a move that took the stock market to a record high last week.Investors may have viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s threats since February as negotiating tactics, and believed that he would be content with limited gains. That appeared to be the case over the past week, in which the White House worked toward a trade deal with Mexico and Canada that does not appear to radically remake the North American Free Trade Agreement.But there has been unease among many investors. Fund managers have ranked trade as their primary concern over the past few months, and as Mr. Trump\u2019s statements have turned into action, some have positioned their investments for slower economic growth.Though last week\u2019s Nafta negotiations sparked a rally in stocks, investors might not want to draw too much from the talks. Mexico and Canada are predisposed to compromise, given their huge dependence on the United States market. And the European Union, which typically takes a hard line in trade negotiations, has not agreed to anything yet.While China relies on the United States market, its leaders can offset the impact of $250 billion in tariffs, by measures like stimulating their economy and bolstering exports by letting China\u2019s currency slide.China could also step up its retaliation against the United States, which may hurt American companies.That could put the stock market\u2019s gains this year at risk. This summer\u2019s rally has made stocks more expensive, which in turn makes them more vulnerable to negative news.How far could stocks fall if the trade conflict intensifies?Underlying stock market numbers give some guidance. The S. & P. 500 is now trading at 17 times earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to figures from FactSet. The lowest valuation on the index during the trade tensions this year was just over 16 times expected earnings. The benchmark would have to fall more than 5.5 percent to trade at that lower multiple.A moderate market reaction to a stepped-up conflict with China may be justified given the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations. But any sign that the conflict could hit corporate earnings would deepen worries about future profits. If the great earnings boom that has recently driven stocks to new highs falters, the S. & P. 500 would be at risk of a steep decline.Investors now have to decide whether a much nastier fight with China fits into that bullish narrative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Carolina, Warned of Rising Seas, Chose to Favor Development", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the latest updates on Hurricane Florence, read our Thursday live briefing here.As Hurricane Florence bears down on North Carolina, the state may face the consequences of policies minimizing the impact of climate change and allowing extensive development in vulnerable coastal areas.The approaching storm almost certainly gained destructive power from a warming climate, but a 2012 law, and subsequent actions by the state, effectively ordered state and local agencies that develop coastal policies to ignore scientific models showing an acceleration in the rise of sea levels.In the years since, development has continued with little regard to the long-term threat posed by rising sea levels. And the coastal region\u2019s population and economy have boomed, growing by almost half in the last 20 years.Stanley Riggs, a retired research professor at East Carolina University who helped prepare the 2010 report, said that the research could have been used to tackle the difficult problems of development on the state\u2019s delicate coast.\u201cWe were ready to step up to the plate and take a hard look at this long-term problem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we blew it.\u201dOpponents, like Deborah K. Ross, a former member of the state legislature, said that turning a blind eye to the science of climate change was self-destructive.\u201cIn order to protect our people, our property and our environment, we need the most information that we can have, in order to mitigate risk,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ignore facts, we do it at our peril.\u201dAs Hurricane Florence bore down on Wednesday, residents and business owners boarded up homes and businesses up and down the North and South Carolina coasts. Tens of thousands of people headed inland after state and local officials ordered mandatory evacuations of low-lying coastal counties, where the National Hurricane Center has predicted a \u201clife-threatening storm surge.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve said time and again, we know a lot of our coastal residents have ridden out storms before,\u201d Gov. Roy Cooper said. \u201cThis should not be one of those storms. Don\u2019t risk your life riding out a monster.\u201dThe North Carolina state legislature pushed back against the 2010 sea level warnings even though researchers and universities in the state have been at the forefront of the scientific work that produced them.Early versions of the 2012 bill even dictated how officials were allowed to forecast sea levels: Only historical data could be used, and not any computer models that showed that the rate of rise would be faster in the future than in the past \u2014 an approach that would seriously underestimate the effects of climate change.The final bill was softened a bit, but another factor helped shift policymaking in the same direction: The election of Pat McCrory as governor in 2012 meant that the Republican Party, which already dominated the legislature, now had total control of the state government, including the coastal resources commission, which was soon reshaped to be more friendly to business.Before the Republicans gained the upper hand, North Carolina was \u201ca leader in really thoughtful coastal management,\u201d said Geoffrey R. Gisler, a lawyer with the Southern Environmental Law Center.But the commission\u2019s 2010 report about sea level threw a scare into real estate developers, as well as some coastal residents, who worried that the state would respond with new policies that would crimp their profits or their way of life.\u201cA lot of folks who have interests in developing areas that are currently vulnerable, and would become more vulnerable with sea level rise, objected to the public finding out that there was this projected significant sea-level rise,\u201d Mr. Gisler said. \u201cAnd so the legislature decided to prohibit looking that far out.\u201dMr. Gisler said that while its direct effects were limited, the 2012 law went hand in hand with a broader weakening in the state of environmental regulations that developers had opposed.Under the new governor, the revamped coastal commission produced a report in 2015 that looked forward 30 years \u2014 a \u201cshorter, more credible time period,\u201d according to its chairman, Frank Gorham \u2014 and foresaw only six to eight inches of sea-level rise. \u201cEveryone looked at the 2100 time period, and the people that hated it dismissed it completely, and we just lost credibility,\u201d he said of the earlier report.Mr. Mann said it was ironic that Hurricane Florence, \u201cfueled in part by bathwater-hot Atlantic Ocean temperatures warmed by human carbon emissions,\u201d came as \u201cthe Trump administration engages in another assault on policies aimed at curbing carbon emissions.\u201dBob Emory, who was chairman of the coastal commission when the dire 2010 report was released, was at home in New Bern, N.C., on Tuesday, wondering whether he should pack up and evacuate inland to escape Florence.He said in a telephone interview that he stood by the report but felt that its purpose had been misunderstood. The commission, he said, had failed \u201cto provide sufficient assurance to local governments and to anybody else that our intention with that report was to provide information \u2014 it wasn\u2019t to regulate anybody.\u201dThe election of another new governor in 2016 \u2014 Roy Cooper, a pro-environment Democrat \u2014 has begun to reverse the shift in the state\u2019s tenor on environmental issues. For one thing, Governor Cooper reappointed Mr. Emory to the coastal commission over the summer.Even so, the legislature remains in Republican hands. Robin Smith, a new appointee to the commission who served for years as an environmental lawyer for the state, said that, \u201cbased on the legislature\u2019s approach to other environmental issues in the interim, I suspect there\u2019s a high degree of suspicion, bordering on hostility, still, to new regulation based on sea level rise.\u201dInstead, she said, she expects the commission to concentrate on supplying information and working with county and local governments.Ms. Smith said her first meeting with the commission, scheduled for next week, had been canceled because of the storm.While North Carolina has come under criticism for the law, the state has also been home to some of the nation\u2019s most advanced coastal science. The leading scientific model used to forecast storm surge and its effect on coastal areas, known as Adcirc, was created in large part by Rick Luettich, director of the institute of marine sciences at the University of North Carolina.In a telephone interview during a break from boarding up the windows of his home in Morehead City, on the coast, Mr. Luettich noted that before 2012, the state pursued progressive policies that put it in the forefront of coastal management. When the legislature pushed back against the clear scientific evidence underlying climate change, he said, \u201cit came as a shock.\u201dThere is a lesson in that, he said.\u201cThe process of converting scientific research into policy is one that we take for granted at times,\u201d Mr. Luettich said. \u201cWhat we learned is that you can\u2019t take that for granted. We need to have a closer dialogue with policymakers, to make sure we\u2019re on the same page.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Doing so may provide financial security, but there\u2019s no way to prevent new owners from exerting more editorial control in the future. And if the outlets can\u2019t make money, benefactors could sell them or shut them down.American financial titans like the Blackstone Group\u2019s Steve Schwarzman often lobbied presidents to go easy on China. Their hope: winning business in China, from advising on mergers to lending money and selling financial services. But Wall Street\u2019s influence in Washington isn\u2019t helping to ease trade tensions.Even as they win tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, they appear to be able to do little to stop the trade war. \u201cWhat\u2019s really surprising is that the connections that used to work, the formula that used to work, just don\u2019t work at this point,\u201d said Marshall W.

At a shelf in the corner, behind a rack of discount paperbacks, her husband Wolfgang was working as quickly as he could.\u201cThey\u2019re like moths,\u201d said Mr. Fr\u00fchauf, genially, of his customers. \u201cAs soon as the lights go on, they come.\u201dWith that, he got back to work, stacking not books, but rows of freshly baked bread rolls sprinkled with poppy, pumpkin, flax, sesame or sunflower seeds that have brought townspeople flocking. Next to him stood a small refrigerator hung with \u201cahle wurst\u201d \u2014 a delicious air-dried, salami-like pork sausage that is one of the region\u2019s culinary specialties \u2014 while in the center aisle, organic tomatoes and cucumbers vied with crime novels for table space.With this unusual assortment, Mr. Fr\u00fchauf has bolstered sales and kept people coming in, no mean feat in a place like Bad Sooden-Allendorf, population 8,500. Here, in the wooded, castle-studded region where the Brothers Grimm gathered their fairy tales, the decline in readership seen in recent years across Germany as digital media competes with books for people\u2019s time and attention is compounded by a number of typically rural problems: an aging population, weak local economy, deteriorating infrastructure and the rise of big-box shopping centers and chain stores.\u201cIn 2013, we had something like a quarter less revenue,\u201d said the third generation bookseller, of how the idea of selling bread and sausage came about. \u201cThere had always been seasonal ups and downs; you sell less in the summer, then there\u2019s an uptick in the fall. But this wasn\u2019t like that.\u201dMr. Fr\u00fchauf\u2019s grandfather founded a bookbindery nearly a century ago, right here on the ground floor of the family house on the market square; Mr. Fr\u00fchauf grew up above the bookstore, which his parents and uncle ran together. Five years ago, when he saw the numbers, Mr. Fr\u00fchauf \u2014 who still lives upstairs, with his mother and his wife \u2014 said the situation was clear: \u201cWe had to do something.\u201dAt the same time, news came that the town\u2019s last two bakeries were closing. For residents like Mr. Fr\u00fchauf, who remember when half a dozen local bakers strove to make the town\u2019s best cream-covered plum cake, cumin roll or pumpernickel loaf, this blow was followed by hopeful news: Norbert Schill, who had lost his storefront lease, wanted to keep baking.\u201cI said, \u2018before there\u2019s no fresh bakery, I\u2019ll clear a shelf, and we can sell the bread here,\u2019\u201d Mr. Fr\u00fchauf said. Mr. Schill agreed to give it a try.The experiment was a success. Mr. Fr\u00fchauf began keeping baker\u2019s hours, and Mr. Schill\u2019s former customers started coming to the bookstore to buy their daily bread. Some, like Norbert Bergmann, a retired Catholic priest, got into the habit of picking up a book or TV guide, too.Some of Mr. Fr\u00fchauf\u2019s regular customers found the idea strange at first, but they came around quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to eat breakfast again,\u201d said Regina Kistner, who raised her family here, and had been making do with the processed rolls sold at the supermarket. \u201cThese taste good,\u201d she added, leaving the store with two rolls (one rye and one sesame), a tabloid paper (for her neighbor) and the British romance novel \u201cA Summer at Sea.\u201dMr. Schill, the baker, said he for one was very happy to have found such an open-minded partner in the bookseller. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying, I remember learning as a child, from the old people. \u2018Go with the times, or with time, you\u2019ll go.\u2019\u201dBefore long, customers asked Mr. Fr\u00fchauf if he could start selling the sausages Mr. Schill used to sell \u2014 like the bakeries, the town\u2019s once plentiful supply of butchers had dwindled, as shops went out of business or owners grew old and died. Customers, particularly older ones, were not always able to drive out of town to get their cumin or garlic fix. So Mr. Fr\u00fchauf cleared some more space and bought a small refrigerator.Now, these sausages are one of his best-selling products, with 50 to 80 changing hands each week. \u201cIt\u2019s a taste of home,\u201d said Frank Hildebrandt, who is in the military and stopped by to pick one up on his way to work. The sausages here, he added, are almost as good as the ones his grandfather used to make.Of course, these traditionally made products are more expensive than their mass-produced counterparts. But J\u00fcrgen Meyer, an electrician who comes to the bookstore for sausages and whole grain rolls, and might pick up a magazine now and then, said the extra money was worth it. \u201cIt has to taste good,\u201d he said. \u201cFood is important.\u201d\u201cGood products cost money,\u201d agreed Manuela Busch, one of the butchers who works with Mr. Fr\u00fchauf and likes to read Stephen King novels. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it works.\u201dReaders, said Mr. Fr\u00fchauf, tend to understand this. \u201cAs consumers, readers are very aware,\u201d he said. \u201cIt matters to them where things come from, what they are made of.\u201dNarrative, he added, is as important for food as for books: \u201cI know the story of every product I sell,\u201d he said. This includes the fact that his eggs come from chickens whose view is of not one, but two local castles. \u201cEven when supermarkets have regional products, no one there can tell you about them,\u201d said Mr. Fr\u00fchauf, who only sells things he personally thinks taste good.Timm Fuchs, who works for the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, said that sales models like Mr. Fr\u00fchauf\u2019s are emerging in rural centers, whose downtowns empty after big-box shopping centers open down the road. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is to have a central place, whether it\u2019s a bookstore or someplace else, to consolidate and sell these regional products,\u201d he said. \u201cThat also improves the quality of life in these towns and villages. Suddenly there is a meeting place, again.\u201dAndreas Hilme, a school principal, brings his children Anna, 7, who likes books about twin vampire sisters, and Alex, 9, who likes all books, every weekend for just this reason. \u201cWe want to support local businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a problem with young people leaving and going to Hamburg or Berlin. But this is a great place to live, and we don\u2019t want all the stores to disappear.\u201dOlder people in particular like to drop by for a roll, said Mr. Fr\u00fchauf, and stay for half an hour to chat. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s part of the job,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the countryside, everybody knows everybody. It\u2019s very personal. Someone might come in and say, \u2018what book should I get my mother-in-law?\u2019\u201dThe Fr\u00fchaufs hope to work another 15 years or more before retiring. But for now, they are glad to have not just shored up the business, but actually increased sales by some 20 percent. They\u2019re looking forward to the store\u2019s centennial, and, if all goes well, keeping it open until they reach retirement age.In the meantime, the bookstore continues to serve as a hub for town life, past and present: In addition to hosting regular card game evenings for young and old, this year Mr. Fr\u00fchauf published a book about the town\u2019s 800-year history, from its origins as a center for salt production to its less publicly memorialized Nazi history.Locking up after a long, warm morning, Mr. Fr\u00fchauf paused. He took a look around at the 17th century building that houses his eclectic store, and said he enjoys being at the center of a new network of butchers, bakers and beekeepers. \u201cIn Germany, I think there\u2019s a tendency now, to be very backward-looking, to say, \u2018everything used to be better,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Fr\u00fchauf. \u201cBut all you really need are some new ideas.\u201dSally McGrane, a journalist, is the author of \u201cMoscow at Midnight,\u201d a spy novel.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economy Needs More Workers. Last Month, It Got Fewer.", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe August jobs numbers suggest an economy that is starting to strain at its capacity, as the labor force shrank and wages rose.There\u2019s no doubt that this is the best economy in quite a long time for American workers, who by a wide range of measures can find a job more easily than they have in a decade.But when you pull apart the details, you also find hints that this is an economy running awfully close to its capacity. If that\u2019s the case \u2014 and one month\u2019s worth of numbers isn\u2019t enough to make the case definitively \u2014 it implies we should expect both slower growth and steeper Federal Reserve interest rate increases in the next couple of years.The economic output of the United States is ultimately limited by the number of people who want to work, the capabilities of the machines and other types of capital they can work with, and the skill of managers at putting those workers and machines to the best possible use.The new employment numbers don\u2019t tell us anything about the second two dimensions of economic potential, but give us some new information about the first, and it isn\u2019t good.The labor force participation rate \u2014 the share of the adult population either working or looking for a job\u00ad \u2014 fell by 0.2 percentage points to 62.7 percent. The share of the population working also fell by 0.2 percentage points.It\u2019s hard to discern any positive long-term trend in the share of the adult population that is looking to be part of the work force. In mid-2008, more than 66 percent of adults were in the labor force, which fell to 62.7 percent in early 2015. It has bounced around in the three and a half years since, but ended up at the exact same level. There is no obvious positive trend.A big part of that is demographic change, as the baby boom generation hits retirement age. The numbers are better if you narrow your focus to people in their prime working years, between ages 25 and 54. But there, too, there is reason to think that progress in putting more people to work has been nonexistent this year.The share of those 25 to 54 working, 79.3 percent in August, is the same as it was in February. A spike in that level in July wasn\u2019t sustained last month.Ultimately, if the economy is going to keep adding 200,000 jobs a month and grow at the kind of boom-time pace that was evident this past spring, it will need a growing work force to fill those jobs and make those goods and services. There\u2019s not too much evidence that there are in fact hordes of younger people currently on the sidelines of the labor market who might soon be coaxed back in.Which brings us to the wage numbers. It\u2019s good news that average hourly earnings are up 2.9 percent over the last year, a sign that employers are having to boost pay to keep good employees (or pay more to poach them from competitors).Wage gains would still need to accelerate further to get to the kinds of levels that are historically normal; in 2008, for example, the year the recession began, average hourly earnings rose 3.6 percent.But the fact that higher pay raises are finally showing up in the data is another piece of evidence that employers are coming up against the limits of the labor force. Just maybe, after years of trying every recruitment technique other than raising hourly pay, employers are starting to turn more to that option.In other words, the labor market could finally be so tight that employers just don\u2019t have a choice if they want to attract and retain workers.As always, it would be a mistake to read too much into a single month\u2019s report, and both the good and bad news in the August numbers could vanish as soon as the September data is on the books.But as the Federal Reserve tries to decide how much to raise interest rates this year and next, and as forecasters examine how much room to run this expansion has, it\u2019s worth taking the August numbers as a sign for the economy as a whole: Help Wanted.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Novelist Recasts King Lear as a Corporate Tycoon in Contemporary India", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionQuick, summarize \u201cKing Lear.\u201dYou can probably come up with the gist \u2014 aging monarch, three daughters, a fool, a storm. But there\u2019s more: political jostling, the threat of war, descent into madness, suicide. Writers crib from Shakespeare because the stories are lodged in our collective recall, but so full of subplot and nuance they can be remade.Revisiting \u201cLear,\u201d as Preti Taneja does in her debut, \u201cWe That Are Young,\u201d is a familiar trick (it won Jane Smiley a Pulitzer). Still, with Shakespeare, fresh interpretation is always welcome. If Smiley\u2019s \u201cA Thousand Acres\u201d was an act of transposition, \u201cWe That Are Young\u201d is an embodiment. The register is dramatic and the language poetic, but the novel (like the play, I think) tries the patience. By the fourth act, you\u2019re fidgeting, waiting for the characters to start dying.Taneja\u2019s Lear is Devraj, and the kingdom he\u2019s dividing is the Company, which is in the business of business: manufacturing, government contracting, hotels, real estate, you name it. His heirs are Gargi, Radha and the youngest, disowned Sita. Taneja also gives us Lear\u2019s hundred knights, his fool, his hangers-on (Kent, Gloucester and his bastard son), his subpar sons-in-law. The book shouldn\u2019t be evaluated on its fidelity to the source material, but Taneja\u2019s attentiveness deserves credit.Devraj is a magnate, not a monarch; that old but still salient point about the root of all evil. Gargi, on her first date with the man she\u2019ll marry, listens to his catalog of the things he loves and comes up with her own: \u201cThe beautiful horizon of the production possibility frontier. The maximum possible output combinations of two goods or services an economy can achieve, when all resources are fully and efficiently employed.\u201d Goneril is a monster; Gargi is a capitalist.Taneja\u2019s characters eat and drink a lot, fret over their hair and their clothes. It\u2019s sometimes more Bret Easton Ellis than the Bard. But Taneja also has fun toying with the exuberance of Indian English. Here\u2019s Radha, rhapsodizing over macarons: \u201cReally excellent, different-different flavors, licorice and lychee, masala chai even.\u201dRadha\u2019s appetites (including, crucially, for sex) are a symptom of the division in the family, as well as all of India. Devraj, furious with his heirs, becomes a populist hero. Addressing a crowd, he says: \u201cWe are living through a time of crooked despair. O! Our unfortunate country is being overrun by my daughters: A hundred-crore house is more important than your struggles. I understand that you want: everything you see.\u201d Whether he is insane, as Lear was, is open to interpretation.What their father comes to hate in ambitious Gargi, flighty Radha and the sanctimonious Sita, who is given less to do in these pages (understandably; Cordelia is a bore), is mostly their youth. Hence, presumably, the novel\u2019s opaque title.But it\u2019s also their womanhood. Kurosawa, toying with Lear for \u201cRan,\u201d made the three heirs sons. Taneja is faithful to Shakespeare because she gets to skewer not only capitalism (here, as ridiculous as monarchy) but also groping uncles, leering men and what Radha recalls as \u201cthe responsibility of her own beauty against violence in the streets.\u201d The author has a point to make, but Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies have inevitable conclusions.The novel has flaws. It is far too long, often repetitive and discursive, with a pitch that sometimes approaches the manic (some readers may find this appropriate).Still, it\u2019s marvelous to watch Taneja, a woman, play with a text in which the women are atrocious. She\u2019s no easier on these characters than Shakespeare was, redeeming none, so the last laugh is hers. And it\u2019s as gratifying to watch Preti Taneja take on William Shakespeare as it is to watch India trounce Britain at cricket. The Raj is long over; every kingdom falls.Rumaan Alam is the special projects editor for the Books desk at The Times. His most recent novel, \u201cThat Kind of Mother,\u201d was published in the spring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Mirrlees, Whose Tax Model Earned a Nobel, Dies at 82", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJames A. Mirrlees, who taught himself calculus as a teenager, became a college professor when he was 32 and received a Nobel award for solving one of government\u2019s greatest economic challenges \u2014 how to get taxpayers to pony up their fair share \u2014 died on Aug. 29 at his home in Cambridge, England. He was 82.His death, from a brain tumor, was confirmed by is wife, Patricia Wilson Mirrlees.Their specific focus was the role played by incentives and the impact on decision-making when the decision makers have access to different information.Professor Mirrlees was so surprised by the Nobel that he assumed a friend was faking a Swedish accent to perpetrate a hoax. He called Stockholm to verify the award, which cited his economic model for tax policies that would produce the maximum revenue while being applied most fairly.Professor Mirrlees suggested that too many progressive taxes imposed at the highest income levels could discourage the wealthy from earning even more, reducing the revenue available to pay for government services and assist lower-income households.\u201cI must confess that I had expected the rigorous analysis of income-taxation in the utilitarian manner to provide an argument for high tax rates,\u201d Professor Mirrlees wrote. \u201cIt has not done so.\u201dPolitically, he was regarded as a social democrat, but his economic model became a rationale, embraced by many conservatives, for flattening tax rates \u2014 leading him to reconcile the two positions by saying that his heart was on the left, but that his head was on the right.Professor Mirrlees also applied mathematical theory to so-called \u201cmoral hazard\u201d research, concluding, for example, that people who bought more insurance coverage might take extra risks, resulting in higher claims and lower profits for insurers.Much of his research, and his Nobel citation, revolved around what he described as \u201cinformation asymmetry.\u201d By that he meant that in every transaction one party knows more than the other, and that that imbalance affects the transaction. In a real estate purchase, for example, the seller almost always knows more than the buyer.James Alexander Mirrlees was born on July 5, 1936, in Minnigaff, a village in southwest Scotland. His father, George, was a bank manager. His mother was Nan (Brown) Mirrlees.Instead, he studied math and natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with a master\u2019s degree in 1957. He earned a doctorate in economics from Trinity College, Cambridge, where his thesis argued that \u201cuncertainty is a reason for saving more, not less.\u201dIn 1968, at 32, he was appointed to a professorial fellowship at Nuffield College, Oxford, where he was later a professor of economics. He left in 1995 to join Trinity as a professor of political economy. He retired in 2003.He married Patricia Wilson in 2001. His first wife, of 32 years, Gillian Hughes, died in 1993.In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Catriona and Fiona, from his first marriage; a stepson, Rory; and four grandchildren.Professor Mirrlees was a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale University and the University of California, Berkeley. He was also president of the Econometric Society and of the Royal Economic Society and was knighted in 1997.His research on \u201cOptimum Income Taxation,\u201d dating from the late 1960s, was peppered with arcane equations and graphs, but he maintained that much of economics is \u201cin a way quite simple.\u201d\u201cIt is simple to be wrong as well as to be right,\u201d he added, \u201cand it is none too easy to distinguish between the two.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Sardinian Weaving Nearly Became a Lost Art", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaterial CultureThere are some traditions that are universal. Here, we highlight a single craft \u2014 and how it\u2019s being adapted, rethought and remade for the 21st century.THE MODERN WORLD didn\u2019t arrive in Sardinia until after World War II, when it was as if the Middle Ages had turned a corner and collided with the 1950s. Recognizing the local treasure buried on the island\u2019s surface, advocates and organizations, often with government backing, sprang up to educate local craftspeople (weaving is just one of many traditions) and promote their work abroad.Susanna went to work for a wealthy woman in town who, recognizing that the local women\u2019s textiles could become a source of income for them, started a workshop. Suddenly, these women were being paid for work they had always done; it brought a measure of freedom and independence and a sense of self-worth. When their benefactor married and gave up her business, Susanna and another worker started a cooperative. When that partner also married and gave up work, Susanna created her own company.But the trajectory of booms is all too familiar, and by the \u201970s there was a glut of product, much of it mediocre, a flagging economy and competition from abroad as well as from more industrialized Italian cities. In 1996, Isabella, who trained as a teacher, took over the business. Today, the company, Laboratorio Tessile Artigiano Isabella Frongia, is just Isabella, her cousin Anna Maria and Susanna, working and living in the home where Isabella grew up. In Samugheo, there are only 12 other workshops left, the tradition all but destroyed by the very promise of expansion. Some of the shops are like ghosts of a better time. Marcella Flore, 38, works alone in a vast workshop of five hulking industrial looms acquired in the flush years by her parents, both now dead. Some are modern and innovative factories, like Mariantonia Urru\u2019s, now run by the 74-year-old Urru\u2019s four sons, who gracefully mix manual historical work with high-tech Jacquard machines and cutting-edge designs. Isabella Frongia\u2019s business is singular in its commitment to the skills and techniques of handcraft, and the time and passion that it requires.The bedcovers that once upon a time every girl made for her future life are today too valuable, and too labor intensive, to have a commercial market. Every so often, Isabella will get a commission for a linen bedcover of that kind, heavily embellished with pibiones, which takes her about three months of work. A business like hers can only be sustained by private clients who appreciate what she does and are willing to pay for it: They value the tradition and dedication to making a beautiful object entirely by hand, an effort one cannot always see.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Rejects Trump\u2019s Charges of Meddling in U.S. Elections", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China stoutly defended on Thursday its right to publish in an American newspaper a supplement that President Trump attacked as interfering in the United States elections, saying the publication was lawful and commonplace.But some liberal Chinese analysts said the four-page supplement, paid for by China Daily, an English language newspaper that adheres closely to the dictates of the Communist Party, showed a lack of judgment, and left China exposed to the president\u2019s criticism.The supplement, which appeared on Sunday in The Des Moines Register, was designed to resemble news articles looking at the economic costs of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China. Many farmers in Iowa are particularly dependent on global trade.Pointing to United States laws that allow foreign outlets to \u201ccooperate\u201d with American media organizations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stressed that many countries paid for supplements that portray a nation in flattering ways. Many of those supplements are designed to look like regular news articles that promote tourism or foreign investment.The supplement gave glowing accounts of China\u2019s prowess in building railroads, creating fashionable apparel and developing robots. The account of the trade war focused on Beijing\u2019s standard argument: The Chinese and American economies are now interdependent and should remain so.One piece read: \u201cTrump has always blamed China for the loss of U.S. jobs, but most economists believe that it is automation, rather than China or Mexico, that are responsible for U.S. job losses.\u201dAs Chinese officials have tried to figure out a strategy for dealing with the tariffs, some have suggested that China should stay quiet until after the elections, arguing that Mr. Trump would have less support in Congress once the Democrats control the House.Analysts in China said that Mr. Trump\u2019s troubles in Iowa were not a good enough reason for China Daily to publish the supplement and only left the impression the country is trying to influence the elections.\u201cSavvy public relations or crude propaganda, it should not be conducted by Chinese official media,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, a professor at Renmin University. \u201cChina\u2019s official media has a generally poor reputation among too many Western audiences.\u201dThe supplement reinforced the common perception that state-run outlets were a propaganda arm of the government, he said.Others said that the supplement\u2019s success in influencing Iowa readers to turn from the Republican Party was debatable, and that the risk of drawing the president\u2019s ire was too high.\u201cChina should not do this \u2014 it\u2019s legal but wrong to do it because politically it\u2019s not wise,\u201d said Zheng Yongnian of the National University of Singapore. \u201cThe most important thing is to stabilize the relationship. The influence is extremely limited, and Trump uses it as an excuse to emphasize a bad thing.\u201dThe supplement\u2019s appearance in Iowa\u2019s largest newspaper struck a sensitive chord at the United States Embassy in Beijing.The ambassador, Terry Branstad, served as Iowa\u2019s governor for a total of 22 years, and was an early supporter of Mr. Trump in the state, a crucial presidential battleground.Mr. Branstad has also spoken proudly of his warm relationship with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, a friendship he says developed when Mr. Xi first visited the United States in 1985 and toured Iowa.The ambassador often refers to Mr. Xi as an \u201cold friend.\u201d When the Chinese leadership was trying to figure out the seriousness of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade threats this spring, Mr. Branstad was granted a private dinner with Mr. Xi, his wife and daughter at a state guesthouse in Beijing.But on Thursday, after Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations about the China Daily supplement, the usually circumspect embassy released harsh remarks about China\u2019s intentions.\u201cChina is using all kinds of methods to try to get us to turn back our policies,\u201d a United States Embassy official said in written remarks that the embassy said could be used only on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic rules. \u201cThey are targeting tariffs and retaliation at farmers and workers in states and districts that voted for President Trump, and they are using other political economic commercial military and media tools to benefit the interests of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201dOn social media, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, won praise for his dismissive facial expression and the shrug he made at the United Nations as he listened to Mr. Trump on Wednesday.\u201cMinister Wang is the coolest man in China,\u201d said one person who posted on Weibo, the popular social media platform. \u201cCome and learn \u2018gazing revenge,\u2019\u201d said another.Others took aim at the United States\u2019 record of meddling in foreign elections.\u201cDo you know in the past 50 years how many countries\u2019 domestic affairs you have intervened in, how many governments you have thrown out, how many foreign leaders and normal citizens were prosecuted unlawfully by you?\u201d one user asked.Luz Ding contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Dominates as a Merchant and Platform. Europe Sees Reason to Worry.", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many independent merchants who sell their goods on Amazon, there has long been deep concern that if the e-commerce giant saw a particular product selling well, the company would duplicate it, but at a lower price.The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief said on Wednesday that there may be reason for worry.Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s competition commissioner, announced the start of an investigation into whether Amazon is unfairly using data collected about third-party sellers to make its own decisions about products to sell \u2014 information that would give it a potentially anticompetitive edge.Ms. Vestager, the world\u2019s most aggressive regulator of American technology giants, said that Amazon\u2019s dual position as host of the largest online platform for third-party sellers and as a retailer of goods deserved a closer look from European investigators. Her office has sent a number of questionnaires to market participants to learn more about Amazon\u2019s practices.\u201cThe question here is about the data,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at a news conference on Wednesday. She said that she wanted to know whether Amazon used data collected from merchants to make its own calculation about \u201cwhat is the new big thing, what it is that people want, what kind of offers do they like to receive, what makes them buy things?\u201dShe called the investigation \u201cpreliminary,\u201d and noted that a formal inquiry had not been started. European antitrust investigations can take years to complete.\u201cIt is very early days in this antitrust investigation into Amazon\u2019s business practices,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Amazon had no immediate comment.Most of the products sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers who use the platform to find customers. The practice has been mutually beneficial: Merchants get access to Amazon customers they would not otherwise be able to reach, while Amazon is able to offer a wider range of products and to collect a fee from any goods that are sold. Just over half of the company\u2019s unit sales globally come from third-party sellers.Amazon, she added, can use sales data about other merchants to improve its offerings.This is not the first time Amazon has been in Ms. Vestager\u2019s sights. Last year, her office ordered Luxembourg to collect 250 million euros, or about $290 million at current exchange rates, in back taxes from the online retail giant.An earlier version of this article, using information from an Amazon spokesman, referred incorrectly to the proportion of Amazon\u2019s sales that come from third-party sellers. It is just over half of unit sales globally, not revenue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rent vs. Buy: Suburban Edition", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThanks to an uncertain real estate market, more people in New York\u2019s suburbs are putting off buying a home and renting one instead.\u201cIt was a big move \u2014 neither of us had ever lived in Connecticut,\u201d said Ms. Raupp-Temple, 43, an author and acupuncturist. Renting, it turned out, gave them time to figure out that they loved Westport. And yet, when their lease was up earlier this year, they decided to rent again. Mr. Temple, 46, works in finance, and he was convinced that home prices, already dropping, would continue to decline. \u201cOur parents\u2019 mentality was, you bought your home and that was your major profit place. Now, I think people are a little more cautious,\u201d Ms. Raupp-Temple said. In a real estate market tinged with so much uncertainty, renting at more than $5,000, $8,000 or even $10,000 a month feels like a safer bet these days to a number of people who could well afford to buy in the suburban counties of Fairfield and Westchester, where median sale prices in many towns are above $1 million. Indeed, demand for high-end single-family rentals is up significantly, a trend that dovetails with a decline in sales in New York and across portions of the region. Many would-be buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward a market softened by uncertainty over the new federal tax law and general uneasiness about the economy, even as mortgage interest rates continue to rise. They are less concerned about shelling out so much money for monthly rent than about making a costly purchase they may later regret.When the Temples and their young son first moved to Westport, they rented a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home for just under $5,000 a month. The rent was no small sum, but in the city they had been paying more for less: $6,500 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. Now they are waiting out the market in a rambling older home just over the border in Wilton, at $5,100 a month. \u201cThere are so many other ways to invest and make money than real estate now,\u201d Ms. Raupp-Temple said. In Fairfield County, the volume of single-family rentals was up 13 percent in July compared to a year ago, according to data from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. In Westchester County, it was up 9.6 percent. Growth in single-family home rentals over the past few years has been most significant at the high end, agents said. The second-quarter market report from William Pitt/Julia B. Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty cited \u201can exploding rental market\u201d among high-end properties in the southern part of Fairfield County, in particular. Data provided by the firm showed that for the first half of 2018, the number of homes that rented for $5,000 or more a month in the county as a whole was up 33 percent, to 268, compared to 2015. That included 61 properties that rented for $10,000 or more, a 35 percent increase over 2015.Westchester also showed growth in high-end rentals, but at a slower pace of just over 12 percent, and almost exclusively in the southern end of the county. Nevertheless, Ms. Collins said she had been approached by more agents than usual this year asking whether properties she had listed for sale might instead be available to rent. In at least two cases where agents negotiated rental agreements with Ms. Collins, the clients were seeking rentals because they were relocating from abroad. To meet this growing demand, more high-end sellers seem to be willing to rent, especially if they can\u2019t get the sale price they want. The number of homes offered for rent at $5,000 and up in Fairfield County during the first half of the year was 25 percent higher than five years ago, according to data from William Pitt. In Westchester, inventory was up 18 percent.Homeowners are opting to rent their homes out not just to wait for a stronger market, but also as a way to cut potential losses, said Jaime Sneddon, an associate broker with the New Canaan, Conn., office of William Pitt. If a homeowner sells a primary residence for less than it was bought for, the loss does not qualify for a tax deduction. But if the homeowner rents the house for at least two years, it can be legally converted to an investment property for tax purposes, and any capital loss when it is sold can be written off against future income.\u201cNot everybody can afford to do that, but many of my clients have done it this year,\u201d Mr. Sneddon said.\u201cWe\u2019re going through this era of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAnd what do buyers do when the near-term seems uncertain? They pause.\u201d\u201cPeople are just nervous that values will continue to decline, and for that reason, more people are opting to rent, if they are not forced to buy,\u201d he said. The suburban rental market has always appealed to people moving to the area for a change of employment, but a hesitancy to buy seems more pronounced in the current uncertain market, with renters hedging their bets in case it turns out they don\u2019t stay in their jobs, said Helen R. Cusa, an agent with Halstead.She recently helped a family moving from Los Angeles rent a four-bedroom home, at $10,500 a month, in the Saugatuck section of Westport. Availability of rentals has been higher than usual this year in Westport because of an excess of homes for sale above $2.5 million, she said.Like the Temples, they didn\u2019t want to buy in Westport until they had tried it out. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re spending that much more on rent than you would on a mortgage,\u201d Ms. Fine said. \u201cBeing in a home you purchased that is not the right fit is a bigger challenge if you have to sell. You have to weigh out what\u2019s more important.\u201dRenting a house also gives longtime apartment dwellers time to figure out what they really want in single-family living. Since moving to Wilton, Ms. Raupp-Temple said, she has concluded that an older home is not for her \u2014 too much upkeep. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also getting a sense of how much space we need,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we would be fine with three bedrooms, two baths. You start to realize what your needs really are.\u201dInsecurity about the market is also turning more sellers into renters, at least in the short term. Todd David Miller, a vice president of sales at the Higgins Group, said that of the $57 million in sales his team has done so far this year, primarily in the towns of Westport and Fairfield, almost all of the sellers have either moved out of state or are renting in the area. Those who are staying in the area are gravitating toward home rentals near the beach.\u201cThese are mainly higher-end transactions, and the majority of them had to sell at a loss,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to put any more money into real estate right now.\u201d Leslie Razook, an agent with William Pitt, sees the same trend in the New Canaan and Greenwich markets. Baby boomers who have sold the family house are looking for rental homes in walkable neighborhoods near the center of New Canaan or a block off the Greenwich Avenue commercial district. \u201cPeople are more careful in making these transitional decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cParticularly for people who have just sold a house \u2014 they don\u2019t want to get tied down right away.\u201d \u201cI felt like, why force the issue of buying when you can rent?\u201d Mr. Ackerman said. They are now renting a four-bedroom home in Darien for $7,000 a month. And \u201chome prices seem to be coming our way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a good sale, and I think we\u2019re going to have an opportunity.\u201dYounger couples are also taking their time with those transitions. Harper and Scott Mates spent a year renting a seven-bedroom house in Rye, N.Y., before deciding to buy their own home there this summer. Coming from the city with three young children, they knew they wanted to stay within reasonable commuting distance of their jobs, but weren\u2019t certain Rye would be the best choice. Instead they fell for Rye, where the median sale price of a house was just under $2 million in July. As the end of their lease approached in August, they jumped on a five-bedroom house on an acre within a few days of its listing. Renting for a year didn\u2019t necessarily enable them to get a better deal on a house, said Mr. Mates, 39, who also works in finance, but it prevented them from making a costly mistake. \u201cSpending all this money on rent for a year is a heck of a lot cheaper than buying a place we don\u2019t like and having to sell it and move again,\u201d he said. And they know they are not alone in their thinking: At a recent play date with children in their oldest child\u2019s kindergarten class, the Mates met three other families who had done exactly the same thing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We Need to Fight the Next Financial Crisis", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress has taken away some of the tools that were crucial to us during the 2008 panic. It\u2019s time to bring them back.Mr. Bernanke is a former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Geithner and Mr. Paulson are former Treasury secretaries. The seeds of the panic were sown over decades, as the American financial system outgrew the protections against panics that were put in place after the Great Depression. Depression-era safeguards, like deposit insurance, were aimed at ensuring that the banking system remained stable, but by 2007 more than half of all credit flowed outside banks. Financial innovations, like subprime mortgages and automated credit scoring, helped millions to buy homes, but they also facilitated unwise risk-taking by lenders and investors. Although we and other financial regulators did not foresee the crisis, we moved aggressively to stop it. Acting in its traditional role as lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve provided massive quantities of short-term loans to financial institutions facing runs, while cutting interest rates nearly to zero. The Treasury Department stopped a run on money market funds by providing a backstop for investors. The Treasury also managed the takeover of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and worked with the Fed to try to prevent the collapse of large, systemically important financial firms. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guaranteed bank debt and protected depositors.But the powers of the regulators alone proved inadequate. Congressional action made it possible for two presidents, one Republican and one Democratic, working with regulators, to prevent the collapse of the financial system and avoid another Great Depression. Most importantly, Congress provided capital to the banking system, allowing for the normalization of credit flows. Congress also provided support for housing and mortgage markets and authorized a powerful fiscal stimulus. The economy began to grow again in mid-2009, and the funds deployed by Congress were recovered with substantial profit to the taxpayer. Policymakers certainly didn\u2019t get everything right. But compared to most other countries, America\u2019s post-2008 recovery started sooner, was completed faster and was built on healthier foundations. Are we ready for the next crisis? In some respects, yes. Reforms of financial regulation have helped make the system more resilient, making a crisis less likely to occur. Banks and other key financial institutions are financially stronger, and the gaps in regulatory oversight have largely been closed. Regulators are more attuned to systemwide risks. Our main concern is that these defenses will erode over time and risk-taking will emerge in corners of the financial system that are less constrained by regulation. Even if a financial crisis is now less likely, one will occur eventually. To contain the damage, the Treasury and financial regulators need adequate firefighting tools. After the crisis, Congress gave regulators some promising new authorities to help them manage the failure of an individual financial institution, tools we did not have in the fall of 2008 when we faced the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers. The so-called orderly liquidation authority, for example, which was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, could help regulators unwind a failing firm in a manner that could be less damaging to the system as a whole. But in its post-crisis reforms, Congress also took away some of the most powerful tools used by the FDIC, the Fed and the Treasury. Among these changes, the FDIC can no longer issue blanket guarantees of bank debt as it did in the crisis, the Fed\u2019s emergency lending powers have been constrained, and the Treasury would not be able to repeat its guarantee of the money market funds. These powers were critical in stopping the 2008 panic.From a political perspective, Congress\u2019s decision to limit these crisis-fighting tools was predictable. Many of the actions necessary to stem the crisis, including the provision of loans and capital to financial institutions, were controversial and unpopular. To us, as to the public, the responses often seemed unjust, helping some of the very people and firms who had caused the damage. Those reactions are completely understandable, particularly since the economic pain from the panic was devastating for many.The paradox of any financial crisis is that the policies necessary to stop it are always politically unpopular. But if that unpopularity delays or prevents a strong response, the costs to the economy become greater. We need to make sure that future generations of financial firefighters have the emergency powers they need to prevent the next fire from becoming a conflagration. We must also resist calls to eliminate safeguards as the memory of the crisis fades. For those working to keep our financial system resilient, the enemy is forgetting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tariffs to Raise Cost of Rebuilding After Hurricane Florence", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the floodwaters from Hurricane Florence recede and rebuilding kicks into high gear, homeowners and businesses will face an additional burden as tariffs imposed by the Trump administration drive up the cost of construction materials.Homebuilders and contractors say the administration\u2019s trade policy will add to the price increases that usually follow natural disasters. In addition to materials like lumber, steel and aluminum, the United States will impose tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports next week, including countertops, furniture and gypsum, a key ingredient in drywall. All told, some builders estimate that construction costs could be 20 to 30 percent higher than they would have been without these tariffs.\u201cWe\u2019re all going to pay the price for it in terms of higher construction costs,\u201d said Alan Banks, president of the North Carolina Home Builders Association.Perhaps the biggest impact will come from wood prices, which are up 40 percent from a year ago. The Trump administration imposed a 20 percent tariff on Canadian softwood lumber late last year, and supply shortages have also driven up prices.Builders are also hurting because of the 25 percent tariff on imported steel that went into effect earlier this year and a 10 percent levy on aluminum.Even before the storm, the tariffs forced Skip Greene, a contractor in Kinston, N.C., to suspend one major project, an apartment building for teachers, as costs surged. Now, with his crews putting up new roofs and cutting out wet Sheetrock this week, Mr. Greene anticipates further price increases as demand for building materials grows.\u201cIn the short term, it is definitely hurting us,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cI hope that going through all this pain is worth it in the end. We\u2019ve got a tariff war going on with China and Canada, and the result was that I couldn\u2019t move ahead with building affordable housing.\u201dWith 30 employees working between Raleigh and the North Carolina coast, Mr. Greene\u2019s firm, Group III Management, will be busy for a while. Mr. Greene has long overseen projects for the federal government as well as for homeowners and businesses.In Kinston, Mr. Greene said the Neuse River was supposed to crest Friday night but had already overflowed its banks. \u201cThere\u2019s maybe one road open,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re surviving, we\u2019re coping.\u201dIt will take months to repair the damage from the floods, he said. \u201cWe intend to pass on the price of rebuilding to insurers, but that will be reflected in higher premiums,\u201d he said. On government projects, he added, \u201cwe, as taxpayers, will pay.\u201d\u201cThe people that will get hurt the worst are the ones who are least able to afford rebuilding,\u201d Mr. Greene said. \u201cThey\u2019re blue collar, and they tend to live in lower-lying areas, and are less likely to have insurance. It breaks your heart.\u201dTrade tensions with Canada over lumber imports date back decades. American lumber businesses contend that Canada subsidizes the wood industry, keeping production artificially high and depressing prices in the United States.Given that domestic production supplies only about two-thirds of the country\u2019s needs, the home building industry argues that the tariffs make no sense. \u201cWith increased demand and the constraints on Canada, we have grave concern that prices could spike again,\u201d said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders.\u201cWe\u2019re impacted by all of the tariffs, but lumber is the main one,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a single-family home, lumber is the No. 1 component.\u201dIn a statement, Jason Brochu, co-chairman of the U.S. Lumber Coalition, played down the threat of higher prices.\u201cThere is ample capacity in the United States to supply wood to help rebuild American homes and business affected by these storms,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican lumber producers across the country stand ready to help Carolina cities and communities rebuild.\u201d\u201cIn a lot of these cases, American companies don\u2019t make these products anymore, so no domestic industry will benefit,\u201d said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThe tariffs compound the situation these struggling homeowners face after the hurricane.\u201dLike many Americans, contractors are divided on the wisdom of President Trump\u2019s trade policies, complaining about higher prices even as they echo his complaints that other countries have taken advantage of the United States and hurt its businesses and workers.Bob Morgan, the owner of Paragon Building in hard-hit Wilmington, N.C., said his price quotes were good for only two weeks because lumber costs had been rising so fast. Still, he supports the president\u2019s approach.\u201cI do know that China has been abusing us,\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \u201cI don\u2019t want everybody to pay more, but what Trump is trying to do is make us more competitive, so it\u2019s not automatically cheaper to make everything in China.\u201dHe added that the media wasn\u2019t giving the president the benefit of the doubt on trade. \u201cTrump could walk across the Potomac and the press would say Trump can\u2019t swim,\u201d he said.But other contractors say the president\u2019s confrontational posture on trade is harmful.The United States needs to address trade imbalances, but not by raising tariffs, said Charles T. Wilson III, a third-generation builder in Durham, N.C.\u201cNot only does it drive up costs,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it creates uncertainty.\u201dHe switched from quartz to granite countertops after the administration imposed tariffs this summer. But the latest duties on Chinese goods will include many granite products. \u201cWe\u2019re telling clients to factor in price increases of 7 to 10 percent a year,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.\u201cThe tariffs don\u2019t help anyone,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019re not the correct tool to negotiate trade policy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.A decade ago, that might have been the end of Gabo\u2019s story. While high-income countries like the United States have made tremendous strides against A.L.L. and a string of similar childhood cancers, those gains have not trickled down to low- and middle-income countries, many of which simply don\u2019t have the resources to treat complex diseases. In such places, the blood and fever of leukemia are often mistaken for malaria. And even when doctors do diagnose the disease properly, chemotherapy and radiation are in short supply, and bone marrow transplants nearly nonexistent.By the time Gabo got sick in 2014, doctors in San Salvador knew how to diagnose A.L.L., and pediatric oncologists were available to treat it. He received specialized care similar to what he\u2019d get in any high-income country. And he went into remission a month after his diagnosis.The collaboration marks a welcome opening of institutional borders.

{"Headline": "China Sees Hints of a Past Threat: Inflation", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Pork is up. Vegetables are up. Gasoline is up. Even the official numbers, usually tame, are up.Prices are rising in China \u2014 and that could complicate Beijing\u2019s efforts to prop up a slowing economy and navigate President Trump\u2019s trade war.Chinese officials said Monday that an index of consumer prices rose in August for the third consecutive month. The increases are not particularly sharp, and Chinese economists point to a number of temporary factors pushing up prices, like floods that have damaged crops and a swine flu epidemic that led farmers to cull pigs.Still, investors and the Chinese public alike are casting a wary eye on prices.Angus Tong, a 37-year-old Beijing resident, said his landlord wanted to nearly double the rent for his family\u2019s $1,200-a-month apartment. Rent already absorbs a third of his income and his wife\u2019s, while the family\u2019s monthly food bills have risen.To save money, \u201cwe try to cook every meal at home,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think most middle-income people feel the pressure from rising costs.\u201dHigher prices could cause problems for Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s leader. They would mean China\u2019s leaders would have to be careful as they sought ways to bolster slowing growth, lest their efforts drive up prices still further. The trade war with the United States could also lead to higher prices for Chinese consumers and companies with tariffs raising the cost of imported goods.\u201cDuring the coffee breaks and the conversations, the topic of inflation is coming up,\u201d said Tai Hui, the chief Asia markets strategist for J. P. Morgan Funds. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to hear a lot more from investors. It\u2019s just a question of the severity.\u201dFor now, Chinese economists generally say there is little cause for alarm. \u201cDisasters like the swine flu and disasters like the flood are not a very big impact on China as a whole, and are not a turning point,\u201d said Li Xuesong, the deputy director of the National Academy of Economic Strategy in Beijing.China has also invested heavily in education, so the productivity of workers has risen quickly along with their wages. As a result, labor costs for getting jobs done have changed fairly little, as higher-paid yet more-skilled workers complete tasks more quickly than lower-paid but less-skilled workers a decade ago.Wigram Capital Advisors, an economic research group, has long calculated an alternative price index for China by taking government data on specific consumer goods and services and assigning them weightings based on actual household spending patterns in big Chinese cities. It shows that the annual rate of inflation jumped to 3.7 percent in August, from under 2 percent most of last year.Check the Chinese term for \u201crising prices\u201d on Baidu, a Google-like online search engine, and the mentions quintupled in the second half of August. But the use of a more intellectual term for \u201cinflation\u201d has changed little in recent months \u2014 a possible sign that most of the complaints about rising prices may be from less-affluent Chinese citizens who are more affected by higher costs for basics.Officially, consumer prices were up 2.3 percent in August from a year before, the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. Although marginally higher than economists\u2019 expectations of 2.2 percent, that is still modest. But it represented a gradual acceleration from recent months.Some of the factors behind China\u2019s recent price increases look temporary. Wholesale prices for pork, the main meat in the Chinese diet, have climbed 17 percent since just mid-July, after an outbreak of swine flu, according to Agriculture Ministry data. Vegetable prices have climbed 21 percent since mid-July as flooding and a typhoon have damaged crops.Goldman Sachs said last week that because much of the increase in pork and vegetable prices did not occur until late August, these increases would show up only partly in that month\u2019s data, and then drive inflation higher in September.Other price increases may linger longer. World oil prices have climbed sharply in the past year, and China is the world\u2019s largest oil importer. China\u2019s currency has slid in value against the dollar this year, and that drives up the price of oil further for Chinese consumers because petroleum deals are done in dollars.Housing costs are also rising, for new homes and for rents. Rents were up an average of 17 percent in July from a year earlier in 50 large cities nationwide. While most Chinese people live in their own homes, renting had been a refuge for young people who could not afford high prices for new apartments.China has also continued to pump more money into its financial system to support growth, adding to potential inflationary pressure.Then there are the American tariffs, which could have a mixed impact. They raise prices for imported goods. But any economic slowdown in China that results from reduced exports to the United States could slow Chinese inflation, said Louis Kuijs, a China specialist at Oxford Economics.The big counterweight to a broader rise in prices is that the Chinese economy is gradually slowing. Despite stepped-up government spending on infrastructure, a tax cut that is about to take effect and further monetary stimulus, that may continue. A broad rise in prices is less likely as long as the economy is weak, said Brad Setser, a Council on Foreign Relations economist.If prices do rise more, however, then China may need to curb its local governments, which have shown an insatiable appetite for borrowing money to build ever more roads, bridges and industrial parks.\u201cReining that in,\u201d Mr. Setser said, \u201cprovides an obvious way of countering inflationary pressures.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the chief Asia markets strategist for J.P.

{"Headline": "On the Debt Non-Spiral", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySecular stagnation means even less reason to worryOpinion ColumnistSo can we just chalk this one up to communication problems, and let it go? And can we talk about more interesting implications of the economy\u2019s apparent need for low real interest rates on average?Another implication, which I don\u2019t think has gotten enough attention, is that there is even less reason than before to obsess over government debt.The usual scare story about debt warns about a debt spiral: deficits mean higher debt, which means higher interest payments, which means bigger deficits, which means faster growth in debt, and so on until confidence collapses. But this kind of debt spiral can only happen if the interest rate on the debt is higher than the economy\u2019s growth rate.And this hasn\u2019t been true for a while. Here\u2019s the average interest rate paid on federal debt:These days that rate is well below 3 percent even when the economy is near full employment. Meanwhile, we think the U.S. economy has an underlying growth rate of maybe 2 percent, plus 2 percent inflation \u2013 which means 4 percent nominal growth.What this means is that debt doesn\u2019t spiral. On the contrary, it tends to fall as a share of GDP unless the government runs large primary deficits.I\u2019m not saying that we shouldn\u2019t worry about debt at all, because there may be future contingencies when real interest rates rise and debt becomes an issue. But debt is way, way down on the list of things to worry about \u2013 absolutely trivial compared with, say, crumbling infrastructure, which should be fixed without worrying about paying as you go.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.N. Chief Warns of a Dangerous Tipping Point on Climate Change", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWarning of the risks of \u201crunaway\u201d global warming, the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, on Monday called on global leaders to rein in climate change faster. \u201cIf we do not change course by 2020, we risk missing the point where we can avoid runaway climate change,\u201d Mr. Guterres said at United Nations headquarters in New York. \u201cClimate change is the defining issue of our time, and we are at a defining moment,\u201d he said. \u201cScientists have been telling us for decades. Over and over again. Far too many leaders have refused to listen.\u201dHis remarks came with countries around the world far short of meeting the goals they set for themselves under the 2015 Paris accord to reduce the emissions that have warmed the planet over the last century. The next round of climate negotiations is scheduled for this year in Poland.One of the big tests at those talks, which start Dec. 3 in Katowice, will be whether countries, especially industrialized countries that produce a large share of global emissions, will set higher targets for reducing their emissions.Mr. Guterres\u2019s speech came days before a high-level climate meeting in San Francisco, spearheaded by Gov. Jerry Brown of California, meant to demonstrate what businesses and local leaders have done to tackle climate change.The United Nations chief seems to be taking a page from Mr. Brown\u2019s playbook. He, too, is looking beyond national leaders to make a difference. He has invited heads of industry and city government leaders to his September 2019 climate change forum in an apparent effort to increase pressure on national governments.Mr. Guterres sought to make the case that a shift away from fossil fuels like oil and coal would create jobs and bolster economies. Rebutting critics who argue that such a shift would be costly, he called that idea \u201chogwash.\u201dHe cited the steps private companies are taking to wean themselves away from polluting fossil fuels \u2014 including a hat tip to the insurance company Allianz, which has promised to stop insuring coal fired power plants \u2014 though he said such actions are plainly insufficient. \u201cThese are all important strides,\u201d Mr. Guterres said. \u201cBut they are not enough. The transition to a cleaner, greener future needs to speed up.\u201dHe warned that governments were not meeting their Paris Agreement commitments and goaded world leaders to step up.\u201cWhat we still lack, even after the Paris Agreement, is leadership and the ambition to do what is needed,\u201d he said.Mr. Guterres did not mention any countries or any heads of state by name. But looming large over his remarks was the leader of world\u2019s most powerful country: President Trump, who has dismissed climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord.An earlier version of this article included quotations from an advance copy of Mr. Guterres\u2019s speech that were ultimately not used in his address at United Nations headquarters. He did not use the phrase \u201cbreak the paralysis\u201d referring to global action on climate change, nor did he use the words \u201cgovernment backsliding.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Chairman, Jack Ma, Plans to Step Down", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group said on Monday that Jack Ma would resign as chairman, unveiling a leadership succession plan for the Chinese e-commerce giant as it faces a more uncertain environment at home.Mr. Ma, who co-founded Alibaba in his apartment 19 years ago and has led it ever since, will step down as chairman a year from Monday, the company said. He will be succeeded by Daniel Zhang, currently Alibaba\u2019s chief executive.Alibaba said the move was meant to foster long-term growth and reduce its dependence on any one person. At the same time, it took pains to stress that Mr. Ma would remain involved with the company. It said he will remain on its board until 2020 and would remain in the Alibaba Partnership, a group of senior longtime managers who exercise significant control over the business and its affiliates.\u201cThis transition demonstrates that Alibaba has stepped up to the next level of corporate governance from a company that relies on individuals, to one built on systems of organizational excellence and a culture of talent development,\u201d Mr. Ma said in a company statement.In an interview with The Times on Friday, Mr. Ma said his retirement would be \u201cthe beginning of an era\u201d and that he would focus on education. \u201cI love education,\u201d he said.In exchanges with The Times after the article was published, Mr. Ma said his decision had nothing to do with some of the issues it mentioned, such as the Chinese government\u2019s growing role in businesses or the weakening business environment.Some investors in New York and Hong Kong said over the weekend that they aren\u2019t overly concerned about Alibaba\u2019s business and its leadership transition. But the confidence in China\u2019s economic and political conditions is so low that the departure of an iconic figure like Mr. Ma has made them wonder how they should evaluate their investment portfolios.On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, Alibaba posted an image of Mr. Ma\u2019s new business card. It listed 12 titles, including teacher, Alibaba\u2019s No. 1 employee, founder of the Jack Ma Foundation and spokesman for village teachers. It did not list Alibaba executive chairman.An Alibaba spokeswoman said it was not a formal business card and was intended to highlight Mr. Ma\u2019s other roles.Under Mr. Ma, Alibaba became one of the world\u2019s largest and most powerful technology companies. It dominates e-commerce in China, the world\u2019s largest single market of internet users. Hundreds of millions of Chinese use Alibaba\u2019s electronic payment affiliate, Alipay, to buy clothing and gadgets, order out lunch and invest their money. In recent years, as China\u2019s internet use has surged, Alibaba\u2019s market capitalization has risen to levels that rival Facebook\u2019s.It hasn\u2019t stopped there. Alibaba\u2019s sprawling businesses also include brick-and-mortar stores, online video, movies and other enterprises, and it has sought to expand in promising new markets like Southeast Asia and India.But investors have begun to worry in recent months that Alibaba\u2019s road is getting tougher, and shares of Alibaba and some of its rivals have fallen significantly in recent months.Alibaba and Mr. Ma on Monday portrayed the succession plan as a sign that the company isn\u2019t dependent on one person. Mr. Ma\u2019s involvement in the company isn\u2019t likely to end with his resignation, however. He has a stake of more than 6 percent in the company\u2019s shares. Crucially, he will also have considerable sway in the company and its affiliates thanks to its complicated legal structure. Under Chinese law, crucial licenses to do business in certain industries must stay in control of Chinese nationals when a company lists its shares overseas, as Alibaba has done.\u201cI also want to return to education, which excites me with so much blessing because this is what I love to do,\u201d he said in the company statement. \u201cThe world is big, and I am still young, so I want to try new things \u2014 because what if new dreams can be realized?!\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Do They Work at Home?", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBetween parenting jokes and policy explanations, she called the $5 billion package of tax cuts and payments \u201cthe most significant change to the country\u2019s welfare system in decades.\u201d Of all her government\u2019s efforts, \u201cthis is the thing I\u2019m most proud of,\u201d she said, telling the audience that if she looked tired it was only because she was not wearing makeup.The video from July was just one example of Ms. Ardern testing the reach of what she describes as politics \u201cwith a bit of heart.\u201dIn many ways \u2014 temperament, style and policy, among them \u2014 Ms. Ardern is the polar opposite of President Trump and other brash male leaders.She has become a subject of global fascination for her progressive values, her youth and charisma, and her status as a new mother who has garnered more attention than any previous leader of this small Pacific country.This week, with her partner and daughter, now 3 months old, she is taking her pitch to New York. She will deliver New Zealand\u2019s national statement at the United Nations on Thursday.She is also doing interviews with the Today Show, Christiane Amanpour and Stephen Colbert. The international news media are fond of promoting her as a new kind of unconventional 21st-century leader \u2014 the unmarried mother and policy wonk who wore a traditional Maori cloak, while pregnant, to Buckingham Palace to meet the queen.But even as her star soars abroad, Ms. Ardern increasingly faces challenges at home. Corporate interests are lining up against her agenda after the country\u2019s business confidence rating dropped to a 10-year low in July; the confidence rating has since improved, according to new figures released this month, but it remains weak nonetheless.Important policies, including tax reform, are still being decided, and critics have cast doubts on Ms. Ardern\u2019s ability to maintain discipline within her governing coalition.Experts say New Zealand exemplifies the difficulty of enacting a progressive agenda at a time when politics are fractured and conservatives worldwide are emboldened. Ms. Ardern\u2019s supporters say she must push even harder for transformative change.Ms. Ardern, 38, grew up in small-town New Zealand, studied communications in college and joined the Labour Party at a young age.She has spent her whole career in politics, working as a staff member for former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and later for Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister, before entering Parliament in 2008.Ms. Clark has often described her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in glowing terms. In an interview last month, she predicted that Ms. Ardern\u2019s presence at the United Nations General Assembly would lead to a clamor from world leaders who want to be seen with her.This week, images of Ms. Ardern, the first head of government to take her baby to the United Nations, were published in newspapers and shared on social media around the world.She also made headlines for declining to sign a draft pledge on combating drugs that was introduced on Monday by Mr. Trump. Ms. Ardern said she preferred to view drug abuse not as a national security issue, but rather as a health matter with a focus on treatment for those in need.\u201cShe\u2019s definitely struck a chord with the comments about kindness, and she exhibits that herself; you don\u2019t hear a mean word come out of Jacinda\u2019s mouth,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cShe is genuinely a nice and decent and kind person. But we\u2019re also seeing as she develops into the office that she\u2019s firm.\u201dIt is that last point that remains an open question \u2014 at least for some.Ms. Ardern came to power last October. After nine years of center-right government in New Zealand, voters chose Ms. Ardern and her party because of their promise of a better deal for ordinary people, especially the marginalized and vulnerable.But her power is limited. In New Zealand, a party does not have to win an outright majority in Parliament to govern. Labour formed a governing coalition with minor parties and in recent weeks, disputes between Ms. Ardern\u2019s party and the party of Winston Peters, the deputy prime minister whose support was crucial to her victory, have become more frequent, leading critics to argue that Ms. Ardern is not in charge of her own government.Further undermining her standing, two of her cabinet ministers have been forced out in the past month: one was accused of an altercation with a staff member and another failed to disclose meetings with stakeholders tied to specific legislation.Ms. Ardern said that in both cases, she acted decisively, but opponents accused her of being weak and failing to manage her team.Opposition lawmakers have also criticized her tendency to appoint expert panels to explore dozens of topics, leaving the details vague on her plans for major issues like taxes.\u201cSupporters of the government have some expectations of quite big change happening, but I don\u2019t really know yet whether this is a transformative government or not,\u201d said Bryce Edwards, a New Zealand political analyst. With all the panels, he added: \u201cit does feel a bit like they\u2019re avoiding some of the hard issues, and giving them to the technocrats.\u201dStill, in its first year, her government has been busy. It approved a program of investment in New Zealand\u2019s rural regions; passed housing affordability measures and tax credits for new parents and vulnerable families; and halted new offshore oil and gas drilling.One of her most common refrains is: \u201cThis is the right thing to do.\u201d She used that line this month when announcing that New Zealand would accept 500 more refugees per year starting in 2020, raising the country\u2019s quota to 1,500. The phrase also appeared in her speeches announcing policies to freeze lawmakers\u2019 pay and increase paid parental leave.In an interview last month, she argued that values and government go together. \u201cYou can be pragmatic and grow an economy and improve well-being and do all of the things you have an expectation governments do, but do it with a bit of heart,\u201d she said.But some New Zealanders, including local journalists, also wonder if her moralism helps her avoid scrutiny.\u201cIt will wear thin if it is overused,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cIt can be used opportunistically, to justify something where you don\u2019t have to come up with any evidence or proof that this is a good decision.\u201dAfter Benazir Bhutto in 1990, Ms. Ardern is only the second world leader in modern times to give birth while in office.She was also recently chided by media commentators for the cost of her decision to fly to the Pacific Islands Forum for a single day, and then return home to nurse because her daughter had not yet been vaccinated.\u201cIt\u2019s funny how things have unfolded and as your life becomes more public,\u201d he said in an interview at the family\u2019s home last month. \u201cYou find yourself holding some of the things back just to create a bit of, it\u2019s not like protection \u2014 everything gets picked up and pulled apart.\u201dMs. Ardern sees her mission as global. She\u2019s a strong proponent of multilateralism, and while New Zealand is a small nation accustomed to not being \u201cthe most powerful voice in the room,\u201d she said, \u201cpower comes in many forms now.\u201dAnd, she added, it\u2019s not just New Zealand that could benefit from more inspiration and less fear.\u201cTo retain the strength of democracy people have to believe in it, and they have to believe in politicians,\u201d she said before she left for the General Assembly.\u201cThat idea that power cannot be accompanied by notions of compassion and kindness and empathy,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I refuse to accept.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Labor Board Moves Anew to Limit Employers\u2019 Workplace Liability", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe proposal, reversing an action taken during the Obama administration, would make it less likely that a company in such a situation would be deemed a joint employer liable for labor abuses like firing workers seeking to unionize.But the board has authority to change policy both by deciding cases and by putting forth rules. Having been stymied in its initial approach, it has decided to rely on another.Philip A. Miscimarra, who was chairman of the board when it issued the Hy-Brand decision, said that rulemaking was justified and that the task was urgent because the current policy had created uncertainty among employers, workers and unions. \u201cThe agency has to fix it,\u201d Mr. Miscimarra, who was elevated to chairman by President Trump, said in an interview this year. Mr. Miscimarra left the board when his term expired at the end of 2017.Critics accused the agency of seeking to bring about an essentially illegitimate policy.\u201cAfter getting caught violating ethics rules the first time, Republicans on the board are now ignoring these rules and barreling towards reaching the same anti-worker outcome another way,\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement.Ms. Warren and a fellow Democrat, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, played a crucial role in drawing attention to the apparent conflict of interest that undermined the board\u2019s first attempt to revise its joint employer standard.Before 2015, the law typically required a company to exert direct and immediate control over workers at a franchise or subcontractor to be considered a joint employer.But in a ruling that year, when the labor board had a Democratic majority, it altered the standard so that even employers that controlled other companies\u2019 workers indirectly \u2014 say, through software that locked franchisees into certain scheduling policies \u2014 could be considered joint employers. The board also said that a company could be considered a joint employer if it had a right to control working conditions at a franchisee\u2019s place of business, even if it didn\u2019t exercise that right.This more liberal standard, in addition to potentially exposing more companies to legal liability, made it easier for workers to unionize at fast-food restaurants and hotel chains. It may be illegal for a parent company to terminate a franchise agreement in response to a union campaign by employees of a franchisee if the parent company is considered a joint employer.The proposed rule could be even stricter than the pre-2015 standard because, according to the board\u2019s announcement, it adds the word \u201csubstantial\u201d to the words \u201cdirect and immediate\u201d in listing the criteria for whether a company exercises enough control to be considered a joint employer.Once the proposed rule is published on Friday, the public will have 60 days to submit comments, which the agency is supposed to consider in formulating its final rule.The rule could be challenged in court on procedural grounds, an outcome that Wilma B. Liebman, a Democratic former board member who served as chairwoman under Mr. Obama, said was likely.Ms. Liebman said groups representing workers would probably argue that the conflict-of-interest problems that undid the earlier attempt to change the joint-employer standard also doom the rule-making approach in light of Mr. Emanuel\u2019s significant role.Board custom holds that changing the law requires the support of three members, though this is not a formal requirement. Mr. Emanuel was one of three members to propose the new rule. (The board ordinarily has five members; there is currently one vacancy.)Depending on how the process plays out, the rule could also be vulnerable to arguments that the board did not sufficiently consider public views.Plaintiffs might argue that \u201cthe board majority went into it with their minds made up,\u201d Ms. Liebman said. \u201cYou have to invite public comment and seriously consider it, give reasons why you might reject certain ideas.\u201dIf the board does not go out of its way to do so, she said, a court might view the process skeptically, given the events that led up to the rulemaking.Perhaps anticipating this critique, the board\u2019s chairman, John F. Ring, said in the announcement that he looked forward \u201cto receiving the public\u2019s comments.\u201dBusiness groups were enthusiastic about the board\u2019s latest proposal.\u201cThe N.L.R.B.\u2019s announcement is good news for franchises and franchise employees across the country,\u201d Robert Cresanti, president and chief executive of the International Franchise Association, said in a statement. \u201cFranchise owners have been confused about the vague and uncertain legal minefield created by the N.L.R.B. joint-employer standard since it was expanded in 2015.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Banks, and in particular large international banks, have more capital and better quality capital. Liquidity and funding ratios have been introduced to address asset and liability mismatch. Regulators no longer rely only on banks\u2019 internal models to assess risks, but instead have introduced leverage ratios based on asset size to limit the size of a bank\u2019s balance sheet relative to its equity. New rules on derivatives have been introduced. And there has been an introduction of \u201cliving wills,\u201d in which banks must tell regulators how they would be unwound in the event of a failure.But these regulatory fixes, while necessary, are not a complete solution.The unintended consequences of some of these regulations is that risk has shifted away from banks to less transparent, unregulated entities. For example, the increase in capital requirements have helped feed the so-called shadow banking system. Because new rules limit banks from making leveraged loans, hedge funds and private equity firms have taken up this slack and provide direct financing. This is hardly the outcome intended by the regulators. This peer-to-peer lending is not regulated in the same way as banks are, and moving this lending to shadow banks reduces transparency to regulators.Also, the 2008 crisis was the consequence not of too little regulation, but of inconsistent and inconsistently enforced regulation. Entities doing similar trades were applying different rules and were supervised by different regulators depending on their location, and how they were incorporated or chartered. Without functional regulation, this problem persists.Third, no living will can solve the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem for a highly complex global financial institution. We still do not know how to address the failure of a large international financial firm with hundreds of legal entities across the globe. To do so would require harmonizing the bankruptcy legislation of all the world\u2019s major financial centers, something the European Union has not been able to achieve in 50 years. This is probably the most important lesson from the crisis and the most difficult to address.To me, the biggest risk of all has not been adequately addressed. What I learned from the Lehman experience is the importance of governance. Leadership is about doing the right thing, and no one should go unchallenged when they are about to make a questionable decision. This culture of checks and balances is still lacking in many organizations.While I do not think we will have a large credit-induced financial crisis in the near term, there is always the possibility that, in the next big financial crisis, taxpayers again will be forced to pay the bill \u2014 if not directly, through a bailout, then most certainly indirectly, through lost jobs and an economic downturn.The best one can hope for is to minimize the severity of the shock through better corporate governance and more consistent regulation.Madelyn Antoncic, an economist, is on the board of overseers of Weill Cornell Medicine.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Thumps Don\u2019t Cause Stock Slumps", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street is learning to live with President Trump\u2019s criticism of prominent companies.Mr. Trump has made a habit of attacking well-known public corporations, including Amazon, Harley-Davidson and Google. In some cases, his supporters have piled on with threats to boycott the companies\u2019 products or services. The stocks of those firms have come under pressure as investors worry that business will suffer.But a look back at months of critical presidential tweets, and their effect on stock prices, suggests that investors are shrugging off Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides. The stocks of targeted companies typically recover, and there is little, if any, discernible harm done to their business.Nike is the latest firm Mr. Trump has singled out. The sportswear company confirmed this week that it had entered into a new marketing deal with Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback. Mr. Kaepernick made headlines in 2016 for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, and has not played in the N.F.L. since the end of that season.Nike may yet suffer. The same people boycotting the N.F.L. because of player protests during the national anthem may shun its products. Companies selling a narrow range of items to consumers are most at risk to a buyers\u2019 strike. But Nike may also benefit. Mr. Trump\u2019s castigations, and Nike\u2019s support of Mr. Kaepernick, may generate higher sales.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms can at times seem to affect the shares of the companies he targets.Even so, the company\u2019s shares have recently rallied and now trade at more or less the same price they did just before the announcement of its production shift.This suggests that investors may have adopted a simple rule: Keep an eye on what the government does, not what the president says.And even if the Trump administration were to threaten more actions against companies, it may not succeed in doing much harm to the firms, or it may simply fail to follow through.Investors may hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets amount to little more than noise, and that the rule of law and other constraints will prevent him from taking actions that could harm corporate profits.Any tweets from the president on this battle could move markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Discussed Coup Plans With Rebel Venezuelan Officers", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration held secret meetings with rebellious military officers from Venezuela over the last year to discuss their plans to overthrow President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, according to American officials and a former Venezuelan military commander who participated in the talks.The White House, which declined to answer detailed questions about the talks, said in a statement that it was important to engage in \u201cdialogue with all Venezuelans who demonstrate a desire for democracy\u201d in order to \u201cbring positive change to a country that has suffered so much under Maduro.\u201dBut one of the Venezuelan military commanders involved in the secret talks was hardly an ideal figure to help restore democracy: He is on the American government\u2019s own sanctions list of corrupt officials in Venezuela.He and other members of the Venezuelan security apparatus have been accused by Washington of a wide range of serious crimes, including torturing critics, jailing hundreds of political prisoners, wounding thousands of civilians, trafficking drugs and collaborating with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which is considered a terrorist organization by the United States.American officials eventually decided not to help the plotters, and the coup plans stalled. But the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to meet several times with mutinous officers intent on toppling a president in the hemisphere could backfire politically.\u201cThis is going to land like a bomb\u201d in the region, said Mari Carmen Aponte, who served as the top diplomat overseeing Latin American affairs in the final months of the Obama administration.Venezuelan military officials sought direct access to the American government during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, only to be rebuffed, officials said.\u201cIt was the commander in chief saying this now,\u201d the former Venezuelan commander on the sanctions list said in an interview, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals by the Venezuelan government. \u201cI\u2019m not going to doubt it when this was the messenger.\u201dIn a series of covert meetings abroad, which began last fall and continued this year, the military officers told the American government that they represented a few hundred members of the armed forces who had soured on Mr. Maduro\u2019s authoritarianism.The officers asked the United States to supply them with encrypted radios, citing the need to communicate securely, as they developed a plan to install a transitional government to run the country until elections could be held.American officials did not provide material support, and the plans unraveled after a recent crackdown that led to the arrest of dozens of the plotters.Relations between the United States and Venezuela have been strained for years. The two have not exchanged ambassadors since 2010. After Mr. Trump took office, his administration increased sanctions against top Venezuelan officials, including Mr. Maduro himself, his vice president and other top officials in the government.The account of the clandestine meetings and the policy debates preceding them is drawn from interviews with 11 current and former American officials, as well as the former Venezuelan commander. He said at least three distinct groups within the Venezuelan military had been plotting against the Maduro government.One established contact with the American government by approaching the United States Embassy in a European capital. When this was reported back to Washington, officials at the White House were intrigued but apprehensive. They worried that the meeting request could be a ploy to surreptitiously record an American official appearing to conspire against the Venezuelan government, officials said.But as the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela worsened last year, American officials felt that having a clearer picture of the plans and the men who aspired to oust Mr. Maduro was worth the risk.\u201cAfter a lot of discussion, we agreed we should listen to what they had to say,\u201d said a senior administration official who was not authorized to speak about the secret talks.The administration initially considered dispatching Juan Cruz, a veteran Central Intelligence Agency official who recently stepped down as the White House\u2019s top Latin America policymaker. But White House lawyers said it would be more prudent to send a career diplomat instead.The American envoy was instructed to attend the meetings \u201cpurely on listening mode,\u201d and was not authorized to negotiate anything of substance on the spot, according to the senior administration official.After the first meeting, which took place in the fall of 2017, the diplomat reported that the Venezuelans didn\u2019t appear to have a detailed plan and had showed up at the encounter hoping the Americans would offer guidance or ideas, officials said.The former Venezuelan commander said that the rebellious officers never asked for an American military intervention. \u201cI never agreed, nor did they propose, to do a joint operation,\u201d he said.It is unclear how many of these details the coup planners shared with the Americans. But there is no indication that Mr. Maduro knew the mutinous officers were talking to the Americans at all.For any of the plots to have worked, the former commander said, he and his comrades believed they needed to detain Mr. Maduro and other top government figures simultaneously. To do that, he added, the rebel officers needed a way to communicate securely. They made their request during their second meeting with the American diplomat, which took place last year.The American diplomat relayed the request to Washington, where senior officials turned it down, American officials said.\u201cWe were frustrated,\u201d said the former Venezuelan commander. \u201cThere was a lack of follow-through. They left me waiting.\u201dThe American diplomat then met the coup plotters a third time early this year, but the discussions did not result in a promise of material aid or even a clear signal that Washington endorsed the rebels\u2019 plans, according to the Venezuelan commander and several American officials.Still, the Venezuelan plotters could view the meetings as tacit approval of their plans, argued Peter Kornbluh, a historian at the National Security Archive at George Washington University.\u201cThe United States always has an interest in gathering intelligence on potential changes of leadership in governments,\u201d Mr. Kornbluh said. \u201cBut the mere presence of a U.S. official at such a meeting would likely be perceived as encouragement.\u201dIn its statement, the White House called the situation in Venezuela \u201ca threat to regional security and democracy\u201d and said that the Trump administration would continue to strengthen a coalition of \u201clike-minded, and right-minded, partners from Europe to Asia to the Americas to pressure the Maduro regime to restore democracy in Venezuela.\u201dAmerican officials have openly discussed the possibility that Venezuela\u2019s military could take action.\u201cWhen things are so bad that the military leadership realizes that it just can\u2019t serve the citizens anymore, they will manage a peaceful transition,\u201d he said.Days later, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has sought to shape the Trump administration\u2019s approach toward Latin America, wrote a series of Twitter posts that encouraged dissident members of the Venezuelan armed forces to topple their commander in chief.As the crisis in Venezuela worsened in recent years, American officials debated the pros and cons of opening lines of dialogue with rebellious factions of the military.\u201cThere were differences of opinion,\u201d said Ms. Aponte, the former top Latin America diplomat under Mr. Obama. \u201cThere were people who had a lot of faith in the idea that they could bring about stability, help distribute food, work on practical stuff.\u201dBut others \u2014 including Ms. Aponte \u2014 saw considerable risk in building bridges with leaders of a military that, in Washington\u2019s assessment, has become a pillar of the cocaine trade and human rights abuses.Roberta Jacobson, a former ambassador to Mexico who preceded Ms. Aponte as the top State Department official for Latin America policy, said that while Washington has long regarded the Venezuelan military as \u201cwidely corrupt, deeply involved in narcotics trafficking and very unsavory,\u201d she saw merit in establishing a back channel with some of them.\u201cGiven the broader breakdown in institutions in Venezuela, there was a feeling that \u2014 while they were not necessarily the answer \u2014 any kind of democratic resolution would have had to have the military on board,\u201d said Ms. Jacobson, who retired from the State Department this year. \u201cThe idea of hearing from actors in those places, no matter how unsavory they may be, is integral to diplomacy.\u201dIn Venezuela, a coup in 2002 briefly deposed Mr. Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. The United States knew a plot was being hatched but warned against it, according to a classified document that was later made public. The coup took place anyway and the George W. Bush administration opened a channel to the new leader. Officials then backed away from the new government after popular anger rose against the coup and countries in the region loudly denounced it. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez was reinstated as president.In the latest coup plot, the number of military figures connected to the plan dwindled from a high of about 300 to 400 last year to about half that after a crackdown this year by Mr. Maduro\u2019s government.The former Venezuelan military officer worries that the 150 or so comrades who have been detained are probably being tortured. He lamented that the United States did not supply the mutineers with radios, which he believes could have changed the country\u2019s history.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m the least affected. I\u2019m not a prisoner.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a person in the photograph. It is an unidentified military officer, not President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Iron Town", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "Tenby, Wales, has quickly become a favorite stop on the global Ironman circuit. But the race has also changed the local population, which now claims to have more triathletes per capita than anywhere else on earth.Supported byTENBY, Wales \u2014 Ricky Hicks and Gary Evans scanned the list, searching for their names. Hicks spotted his first: No. 647. It took Evans awhile longer. No surprise, really: Evans is a much more common surname in Wales. He had to pick through 27 to find his number. But still, it might have been worse: There were 55 athletes called Jones.Hicks and Evans then walked toward the registration tent, where they would collect their race licenses and official numbers, and seal their fate. It was Friday, bright and warm. Evans was relaxed, confident. Hicks flickered with nervous energy, toying with a water bottle, shifting his weight from foot to foot, wondering if the weather would hold. Rain or shine, their Sunday was going to be hell.It was all Evans\u2019s fault. Last year, Hicks had made the short journey to Tenby from his home in St. Clears \u2014 10 minutes or so inland \u2014 to watch his friend compete in the Wales edition of the global Ironman series. He had seen Evans complete a 2.4-mile sea swim, a 112-mile cycle leg and a full 26.2-mile marathon in a little more than 12 hours.What had struck Hicks, though, was the power of the crowd. Tens of thousands had thronged the streets of Tenby to watch the race. The noise, the fervor and the enthusiasm had captured his imagination. When he congratulated Evans on finishing, he told him he \u201cwould love to do something like that.\u201dEvans took him at his word. Without telling Hicks, he signed up again for this year\u2019s contest, and added his friend\u2019s name, too. \u201cI thought he may as well jump in at the deep end,\u201d Evans said.Hicks\u2019s mood was not quite so buoyant as the race loomed, though. He has always been fit, playing rugby and soccer, and over the last year he had trained every day, running a marathon and a few half-distance events and going for a lot of long bike rides. He knew, though, that he had never done anything like this.On Sunday, he would wake up at 2:30 a.m., have some toast and jam for breakfast, then make his way to the start line on Tenby\u2019s North Beach just before 6. He had not set any ambitious targets; he would not be trying to beat Evans. Hicks\u2019s aim was just to finish, to survive.But still, he was nervous. \u201cDreading it,\u201d in fact. At that, Evans smiled, wickedly, the smile of someone who knew what was coming.It is that sort of place now, Tenby: a town where, sooner or later, there is a very good chance you will end up doing an Ironman, whether you want to or not.Thirty-six hours before the race, good-luck messages have been scrawled into the sand of North Beach, a perfect swath of gold overlooked by pastel-colored houses. In the center of town, hundreds of competitors wander past the ice cream parlors and old-fashioned candy stores.They are easily picked out: The vast majority carry an Ironman backpack, bright red, slung over a shoulder. Those who have completed a race often have a tattoo to showcase that fact: There are Ironman logos, a dotted capital M, drawn on arms and shoulders and countless calves, part badge of honor, part watermark. The visitors dawdle over coffee in the early September sunshine, gaze out at the waters of Carmarthen Bay and earnestly compare training injuries and equipment reviews.The shops are full of Ironman keepsakes and souvenirs; cafes and restaurants advertise that they will be opening early on Sunday morning, for athletes and spectators; the Blueberry Cafe is offering an all-you-can-eat pasta buffet on Saturday, perfect for \u201ccarbo-loading.\u201dThe Ironman arrived here, in this quiet seaside resort on the Pembrokeshire coast, in 2011. There was, at first, a degree of skepticism. The scale of the event is considerable. The swim takes place in the bay, before competitors race back on land and transfer onto bikes. The cycle route takes them north, to Narbeth, and then west, all the way to the village of Angle and back. When they return, the marathon course loops around Tenby four times.Not everyone was thrilled to see the race arrive. Tenby is a tourist haven, and its population of 5,000 swells tenfold in the summer months. Some here were content with the business it had traditionally attracted.The town, though, has taken the event to its heart. \u201cIt is a bit of a pain for the locals,\u201d said Mike Neil, 42, who had come from the Rhondda Valley \u2014 in the heart of Wales\u2019s old mining country \u2014 to compete. \u201cAll the roads for miles have to be closed for the day, but they really embrace it.\u201dTenby is a relatively young Ironman. The event started in Hawaii in 1978, and by the time Wales was awarded its race, there were 26 others scattered around the globe. Next year, there will be 42 full Ironman events worldwide, each of them offering the chance to qualify for the world championships in Hawaii.The Tenby race already has a reputation. \u201cThis is one of the hardest on the calendar,\u201d said Mirka Vahtera, who had traveled from Finland with her brother, Mikko Tepponen, to take part. Most say that the event on Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands \u2014 \u201cwhere you run up a volcano,\u201d according to Vahtera \u2014 is the toughest there is, but the rolling hills of the cycle section, the crosswinds and the unpredictable sea make Pembrokeshire a close second.\u201cBut the support is the best,\u201d Vahtera said. \u201cThere are always questionnaires on the Ironman website, asking people which event they have enjoyed the most, where the best atmosphere was. Everyone says Tenby.\u201dIn part, of course, that popularity can be traced to the event\u2019s economic effect: Tenby\u2019s town council estimates that this year\u2019s event, for example, brought 3.5 million pounds, or $4.6 million, into the local economy over race weekend.What makes Tenby \u2014 and Pembrokeshire as a whole \u2014 truly remarkable, though, is not just how much the locals want to support it, but by how many want to take part. The town is fond of claiming that thanks to Ironman, it now has more triathletes per capita than anywhere else in the world.\u201cWe think we have the largest percentage of local participation,\u201d Andrew Davies, the town clerk, said. \u201cIt is certainly not six degrees of separation: Most people would know four or five people who have done it at least once.\u201dDavies is not one of them. \u201cI would still be doing the swimming now,\u201d he said, a couple of days after the 17-hour time limit to complete the course had elapsed. But then this is Tenby: Iron Town. It is probably better to say that Davies is not one of them yet.The story of Britain\u2019s seaside resorts, over the last half-century, is one of inexorable decline.The statistics, across much of the country, are grim reading. Blackpool, on the Irish Sea, now has the highest rate of deaths from heroin and morphine in Britain; five more coastal towns are in the top 10.In 2013, a government study decreed Skegness, a resort on the North Sea coast, the most deprived in England. It was followed by Blackpool, Clacton, Hastings and Ramsgate: all resorts left behind by the rise of cheap air travel and a waning fishing industry.Clacton, in Essex, is the only place in Britain to have had a member of Parliament from the far-right United Kingdom Independence Party. When that party\u2019s on-again, off-again leader, Nigel Farage, mounted his most recent failed campaign to be elected, he stood in the coastal town Thanet, in Kent, another place ranked among the most deprived in the country.Tenby, though, avoided the worst of it, its popularity sustained by the beauty of this part of Wales: all hidden coves, sheer cliffs and golden sand. Barafundle Bay, 30 minutes down the coast, is regularly voted one of the world\u2019s best beaches, up there with Ipanema and Varadero. It remains a peaceful, neat sort of a place, attracting families, bus trips filled with retirees and increasingly \u2014 as Mark Sansum, 38, a regular visitor from Swansea, the nearest big city, put it \u2014 \u201cstags and hens.\u201dThose bachelor and bachelorette parties, though, were not entirely welcome. The town center was made a \u201ccontrolled drinking zone\u201d in 2014. The police have been running a campaign to crack down on unruly behavior for several years, in part because of the lewdness and crudeness of the memorabilia being taken onto trains by groups celebrating one last night of freedom.As the Ironman race has grown in popularity, that identity has started to shift.\u201cWe still get a lot of families,\u201d Davies, the town clerk, said. \u201cBut we see more and more people coming for fitness tourism.\u201d Sansum, who visited regularly to train for his second attempt at the Ironman, was more blunt: The event, he said, \u201csaved the town.\u201dIt is not just race weekend that brings people here. While he was training, Hicks \u2014 the 23-year-old embarking, a little unwittingly, on his first Ironman \u2014 said the \u201croads were full of people all the time.\u201d Martin Jones, 54, said there were hundreds of cyclists, swimmers and runners when he came for his final training session.Gareth Rees, a founder of the Tenby Aces cycling and triathlon club, said his group had mushroomed to some 170 members since the launch of the Ironman, many of them drawn from all over Britain. \u201cPeople come to train and want to ride or run or swim with us,\u201d he said.That effect has been noted across the region. \u201cThis event has been a huge catalyst for the popularity of multisport events,\u201d said Peter Munn, a member of the Pembrokeshire cycling club, based in Haverfordwest, the area\u2019s largest town. His group has doubled in size in recent years, to 175 members: The youngest is 8 and the oldest 77.Tenby, meanwhile, has become a different sort of place. It holds another multisport event during the year, as well as several smaller competitions. Iron Kids, a juniors event that runs on Ironman weekend, welcomed 1,000 entrants last year. That total doubled this year, such was the demand. Davies said the council had noted an increase in the number of people using its leisure facilities in recent years, and he said there had been a concomitant decrease in demands placed on its health services.The impact, though, may be broader still. In Swansea, Sansum said, there are \u201cfour or five\u201d triathlon clubs within a few miles\u2019 drive. In the Valleys, meanwhile, Wales\u2019s industrial heartland, the sport \u2014 and Ironman in particular \u2014 is booming.\u201cYou hear stories of five lads from the same village of just a few houses who are here to do it,\u201d said Ben Jones, who had come with Neil Williams from Rhondda to compete. Williams added: \u201cThere is a real fascination with it. It is a challenge. A chance to see what you\u2019re made of.\u201dSuccess can come at a price. Ironman organizers say they are committed to staying in Tenby until 2021, at which point the group\u2019s contract expires. There are rumors Ironman may look to take the event to a larger market: There are dark whispers among locals that they may move the race to Cardiff, the capital.Davies, at the town council, insisted he was hopeful the race would remain here, its continued place on the calendar secured by the positive reviews from the athletes and the clear passion of the crowds. \u201cWe think we had 25,000 on the streets of Tenby during the day itself, and record numbers at all of the major towns along the way,\u201d he said.Many here believe its magic would evaporate if it was moved. \u201cThere is something on every weekend in Cardiff,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt would become just another thing to go to. It would lose everything. Here, it\u2019s the main event of the year.\u201dIt is a symbiotic relationship, as it should be. The place has a transformative effect on the event, infusing it with a sense of occasion, a passion. The event, in turn, has a transformative effect on the place, turning Tenby from a pleasant seaside resort into a world-renowned destination for some of the world\u2019s toughest athletes, the sort of place where you can end up doing an Ironman, even if you do not really want to.Thirteen hours 15 minutes 45 seconds after he started, Ricky Hicks, No. 647, crossed the line and became one of them. He survived. He is now, at last, an Ironman: yet another Ironman, in a town full of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Triumphs and Troubles Are Written in Swiss Ice", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPollen frozen in ice in the Alps traces Europe\u2019s calamities, since the time Macbeth ruled Scotland. While tens of millions of people were dying, pollen from the plants, trees and crops growing in Western Europe were being swept up by the winds and carried toward the Alps. Centuries later, the crop pollens trapped in the ice reveal the collapse of agriculture associated with the pandemic, as bad weather led to poor harvests and fields lay fallow because there was no one left to work them. For more than 50 years, scientists have drilled ice cores in the Arctic and Antarctica to reconstruct uninterrupted records of climate change over hundreds of thousands of years. But these glaciers can be difficult to get to and they are far from where most people on Earth live. Pollen levels rise and fall during the century, but their most pronounced peaks and valleys coincide with notable events. Europe suffered through a spate of calamities during the 14th century. Before the Black Death, there was the Great European Famine. Historical accounts tell of the relentless rains that spoiled back-to-back harvests in parts of Europe from 1315 through 1317, and may have helped bolster the plague\u2019s grip. Few people have conducted detailed studies of pollen in ice cores before, said Raymond Bradley, a geoscientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and an expert in using lake-bed sediment cores to reconstruct past climates. \u201cMost ice cores are polar and they are a long way from major vegetation regimes. Those studies that were done were pretty boring, they didn\u2019t show much,\u201d he said. In the fall of 2015, a six-person crew flew by helicopter from Zermatt, Switzerland, to the saddle of the Colle Gnifetti glacier. They carried with them a ton of equipment, including tents, cookstoves, food and a solar-powered drill. Back in the lab, Dr. Schwikowski and her colleagues dated the different sections of the ice core using water, lead and carbon isotopes, and by identifying \u201cdating horizons\u201d such as well-known volcanic eruptions, Saharan dust transport and nuclear weapons tests. Once the timeline was in place, Ms. Br\u00fcgger began tracking pollen, spores and soot in the samples using a light microscope. In all, she counted more than 40,000 pollen grains in the ice core. Grass pollens were abundant in the segments that corresponded to the years 1100 to 1200. During the Medieval Warm Period, temperatures in Europe and the nearby North Atlantic were as warm or warmer than they are now, and crops and forests flourished. The spike in grass pollens corresponded to the expansion of open landscapes, a transition from forests to pastures. She also found the highest levels of a spore from a fungus called Sporormiella that grows only on dung. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that it\u2019s not only an open landscape, but that we also have a lot of cattle,\u201d she said. The record becomes more complex in 1750, which marks the expansion of the European economy and the start of the Industrial Revolution. Historical records tell us that Columbus introduced maize to Europe in 1493, but maize pollen doesn\u2019t show up in the ice core until the mid-1700s, a sign that its large-scale regional production didn\u2019t take off immediately. It was also around this time that European society started to become more industrial and urban. This is mirrored in the ice core with the first traces of small spherical carbon particles, evidence of a transition from wood to coal burning in Central Europe. Although poets, landowners, chroniclers and others noted these historical events, manual record-taking can be imperfect and limited in geography, and they don\u2019t quantify their scale over the whole region. Coupling ice-core data with historical records can yield new insights, said Alexander More, historian and climate scientist at Harvard University and the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine in Orono. \u201cThe combination provides a level of insight that is just not matched by either type on their own,\u201d he said. Many scientists, including Dr. Schwikowski, are concerned about the fate of these glaciers under climate change. Some glaciers are beginning to melt as temperatures rise. Meltwater from the upper layers of the glacier trickle through the airspaces between the snow granules, smearing the chemical signals and making the core unusable. Colle Gnifetti has, thus far, been spared, because of its high altitude. \u201cIt is becoming more and more difficult to find a glacier that is not melting and that can still be used for research,\u201d said Dr. Schwikowski. \u201cThe object for our research is melting away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Delaware\u2019s Heated Senate Race Threatens to Rip Apart Its Centrist Political Fabric", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWILMINGTON, Del. \u2014 Senator Tom Carper is 13 for 13 in statewide races here, a record of success that dates to his election as state treasurer in 1976. And Mr. Carper\u2019s formula for victory has largely remained constant: stay true to a centrist brand of politics that appeals to Delaware\u2019s mix of rural voters and suburbanites while retaining a ubiquitous presence at churches, firehouse fund-raisers and birthday parties to which he may or may not have been invited.After sweating his way through a steamy Labor Day parade in downtown Wilmington on Monday, Mr. Carper took even longer to walk back to his Town & Country minivan because he was so eager to discuss his efforts to clean up the city\u2019s waterfront when he was governor of this lightly populated \u201cstate of neighbors.\u201d And because he stopped to greet every passer-by, even startling one young couple with an offer to carry their groceries into their apartment.But as Mr. Carper seeks the Democratic nomination on Thursday for what would be his fourth Senate term, his well-honed strategy is being tested by Kerri Evelyn Harris, a political newcomer whose candidacy reflects the same urgent demands of other progressives in the Trump era. As with many of the generational, racial and ideological challenges rippling through her party, Ms. Harris\u2019s bid is premised on the idea that a platform of pork-barrel projects, congeniality and constituent services is no longer sufficient to the moment.\u201cA warm smile, a firm handshake and a witty comment isn\u2019t doing it,\u201d said Ms. Harris, who is biracial. \u201cNice isn\u2019t getting the job done.\u201dAn Air Force veteran, Ms. Harris, 38, is running to Mr. Carper\u2019s left, arguing that his penchant for conciliation and his willingness to accommodate Delaware\u2019s financial service and pharmaceutical industries is wildly out of step with the expectations of the restive left.\u201cThere\u2019s been a blurring of lines between parties, and it\u2019s time to bring the Democratic Party back to people,\u201d she said after the parade and before plunging into a park full of union workers featuring a truck offering free beer.Mr. Carper, 71, has sought to fend off Ms. Harris\u2019s challenge by sharpening his rhetoric against Mr. Trump. And he has tacked leftward on a handful of issues, conceding that there\u2019s \u201cno way in hell\u201d he would have voted Brett M. Kavanaugh into a circuit court judgeship if he had known then what he does today about the Supreme Court nominee.Yet even as Mr. Carper tries to accommodate his party base, he and other moderate Democrats here are plainly uneasy about the implications of Ms. Harris\u2019s candidacy. They fret out loud that if such primary threats grow routine in both parties, the demands for ideological purity will only worsen the gridlock in Washington.\u201cWhat we have now are a lot of forces from outside the state who don\u2019t think there\u2019s room for a centrist anymore,\u201d said Mr. Carper, a former naval aviator who wore his old flight suit to the parade in honor of his late Republican colleague, John McCain.\u201cThe question is,\u201d he added, \u201cis there room for us in the middle?\u201dFor decades in Delaware, there was plenty of room. Moderate figures in both parties like Mr. Carper, then-Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., and former Governors Jack Markell and Mike Castle dominated this state, embracing a politics of consensus and collegiality that is known as \u201cthe Delaware Way.\u201dBut Delaware was ahead of the curve nationally in the realignment of the suburbs from Republican to Democrat, and the state has not elected a Republican to Congress for a decade. Now a Democratic stronghold, it is seeing the sort of internecine competition that is often inevitable in one-party states.\u201cThis is relatively new to us and it means that a younger generation of candidates view themselves as not being willing to work their way up through elections and they want to go straight for primarying our most senior elected official,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, who took Mr. Biden\u2019s seat after serving on the county council.But Ms. Harris wears her outsider status proudly, deeming Mr. Carper one of the state\u2019s \u201cpipeline politicians.\u201d\u201cYes, he has 40 years of elected official experience,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we need a diversity of experience.\u201dMs. Harris, the daughter of a black father and a white mother, is a lesbian who has largely worked in male-dominated fields, she notes. \u201cI\u2019m a whole lot of otherness.\u201dBut she is most eager to talk about her class identity, recalling her time in the military as well as her experience since then frying chicken in a gas station and working as an auto mechanic.\u201cI\u2019m a working-class person figuring out how to make it in this economy like the rest of us,\u201d she said, arguing that the Senate needs more members with such blue-collar credentials.She is running on universal health care, a $15 minimum wage and what she calls a \u201cWall Street speculation tax,\u201d which is not often heard in a state where the insignia for Chase Bank is stripped across one of Wilmington\u2019s largest buildings.But Ms. Harris\u2019s candidacy has been obscured nationally by some other left-wing candidates and she has only raised about $140,000. Mr. Carper has more than $1 million on hand.Her broader challenge, however, is Delaware\u2019s demographics. The state is only 23 percent black and, unlike New York and Boston, it has no population center full of young, progressive millennials. Interviews with a range of voters marching in, and taking in, the Labor Day parade made clear that some voters were not fully aware of Ms. Harris.\u201cCarper will get some votes based on just name recognition,\u201d said Sandra Smithers, a retiree who is active with the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists and is backing Ms. Harris. \u201cBut this is at least causing some Democrats to get a little steel in their spines.\u201dMr. Coons, who is up for re-election in 2020, said the rise of the hard right \u201chas slowed or stopped a whole range of possible bipartisan initiatives\u201d because Republican lawmakers fear their primaries, and \u201cnot the general election.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Carper suggests this will be his last term \u2014 he offers the Rolling Stones lyrics \u201cThis may be the last time\u201d \u2014 and brushes off ferocious attacks from left-wing websites, such as The Intercept. \u201cI wear it with honor,\u201d he said.But after serving as treasurer, congressman, governor and now senator, Mr. Carper appears somewhat perplexed by Delaware\u2019s diverging voices, what he calls \u201ccountervailing messages.\u201d\u201cI go around the state and I hear two messages,\u201d he said. \u201cNo. 1 is, \u2018Why can\u2019t you guys in Washington find a way to work together like we do here in Delaware?\u2019 But the other message is, \u2018This guy Trump is no good, and you should oppose him with everything you can.\u2019\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018I know this may not be pleasant for you to talk about, but what can I learn from what happened to you,\u2019\u201d Mr. Carper recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018We just didn\u2019t take it seriously.\u2019\u201dUnlike Mr. Castle, and the man he beat in 2000 to claim his seat \u2014 the 79-year-old William Roth, who would only occasionally return to the state to campaign with his St. Bernard \u2014 Mr. Carper is working aggressively to stay in office. And he is cognizant of how Mr. Trump has inflamed the Democratic Party.\u201cThere\u2019s a law in physics,\u201d he said, \u201cfor every reaction there is an equal reaction.\u201dWhen it comes to movement, he is an authority. Returning to his parking spot, Mr. Carper noted he had put 485,000 miles on his 2001 minivan.Advertisement"}

With a strong economy, low unemployment and the stock market near record highs, executives are striking back at rules they believe hamper their ability to make profits \u2014 even as they make more than ever. The common complaint is that disclosure requirements force companies to focus on the short term at the expense of making investments that may pay off years later.The tweet raises a number of questions. Is less disclosure better for corporate America? If so, are six months the right interval? Could information be released annually, or perhaps just left to the best judgment of corporate managers about what should be disclosed? That is how most private companies, like Uber and Airbnb, are allowed to operate, because they have chosen not to tap the public markets for capital.Jay Clayton, the S.E.C.\u2019s chairman, has asserted that protecting the \u201cMain Street investor\u201d is a key mission for the agency. But the recent thrust of the S.E.C. appears to be moving away from disclosure and toward allowing companies to put out less information to the investing public.In a recent meeting about entrepreneurship, Mr. Clayton said he wanted to make it easier for retail investors to buy shares in private companies, noting that these can be \u201cpretty risky\u201d but that \u201cpeople want that.\u201d Private companies have minimal disclosure obligations, which was one reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, floated the idea of taking his intensely scrutinized company private.Lawsuits against management and directors for failing to fulfill their fiduciary duties, or against a company for making faulty or incomplete disclosures, are the best way for shareholders to police companies. These lawsuits are the bane of corporate management.Does that mean the idea is dead, or is the S.E.C. just waiting for the right company to request dispensation to limit shareholder access to the courts for challenging management? Once the S.E.C. permits arbitration of claims, companies can be expected to jump on board quickly.What is the best protection for shareholders? The S.E.C. does not review whether an investment is a good one, only whether enough information is available to judge the potential risks and rewards. Less disclosure would make that assessment more difficult, and leave investors guessing whether an opportunity is a good one \u2014 or a sinkhole for their money.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Gina Raimondo, Rhode Island Governor, Turns Back Liberal Challenge in Primary", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island defeated a liberal challenger in a Democratic primary election on Wednesday, according to The Associated Press, reasserting herself as the party\u2019s leader in a state where she has battled criticism from activists on the left and intransigence from old-guard lawmakers in her own camp.Ms. Raimondo, 47, is expected to face a serious fight for re-election in November despite Rhode Island\u2019s Democratic lean and the difficult political climate for Republicans nationwide. Polls have consistently shown her vulnerable to defeat, though she and her allies believe it will be difficult for any Republican to escape the shadow of President Trump, who is fairly unpopular in the state.She will face Allan Fung, the Republican mayor of Cranston who also ran against her four years ago in November.Complicating matters for both parties, Joe Trillo, a former Republican state legislator who chaired Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign in Rhode Island, is also running for governor as an independent.Ms. Raimondo\u2019s primary challenger, Matt Brown, attempted to channel the energy of the populist left, portraying her as overly close to powerful financial interests. Mr. Brown, a former Rhode Island secretary of state, collected endorsements from activist groups on the left, such as Justice Democrats and Our Revolution, a committee aligned with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.But Mr. Brown\u2019s populist message failed to deliver an upset against a well-funded incumbent who is one of just two female Democratic governors in the country. (Kate Brown of Oregon is the other.)A former venture-capital executive, Ms. Raimondo won her first term in 2014 with support from just 41 percent of Rhode Island voters, after a third-party candidate drew support away from both the Democratic and Republican standard-bearers. She has struggled at times to navigate the insular political culture of the Rhode Island State Legislature, where Democrats hold majorities but powerful party bosses and entrenched local interests limit the governor\u2019s influence.Rhode Island struggled longer than most states to shake off the effects of the last recession, at times recording the highest employment rate in the nation. Ms. Raimondo had a good run where Fortune 500 companies and other firms announced plans to locate or expand in Rhode Island. The unemployment rate has declined fairly steadily during her term, now standing at 4.1 percent, slightly above the national average. But some Democrats and Republicans have argued that she should have done more to improve the economy and the wages of state residents.Ms. Raimondo has also been haunted by her overhaul of the pension system. The stringent measures she took years ago as state treasurer, including eliminating cost-of-living increases and moving workers into different retirement accounts, earned her the enduring enmity of many of the state\u2019s powerful unions, and some are still angry about it.And she oversaw the bungled start of a new $364-million computer system that failed in its goal of helping residents sign up for food stamps and health benefits.\u201cThere is a percentage of people who are in families affected by pension reform who won\u2019t forgive her, and a segment of the Rhode Island population that doesn\u2019t like a woman at the helm,\u201d said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University.Despite her travails at home, Ms. Raimondo has been held in high regard by national Democratic Party leaders, earning admiration for her muscular fund-raising network and crisp views on how Democrats should talk about jobs and economic growth. She is the vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, the party\u2019s national committee focused on electing state executives.The Republican nominee, Mr. Fung, came close to achieving an upset victory in the governor\u2019s race four years ago, running less than 5 percentage points behind Ms. Raimondo in a year when his party made broad gains nationally. He has criticized Ms. Raimondo this year for her approach to economic development and has called for a tougher approach to immigration enforcement at the local level.But Mr. Fung has responded unsteadily to national controversies involving the White House, and has taken positions on a number of issues, including gun control, that may limit his support in a deep-blue state where Hillary Clinton ran nearly 16 points ahead of Mr. Trump.The presence of Mr. Trillo in the race adds a strong element of unpredictability in a state where third-party candidates have routinely drawn significant support, and where the previous governor, Lincoln Chafee, a former Republican senator who left the party, was elected in 2010 as an independent.Mr. Chafee, now a Democrat, endorsed Mr. Brown\u2019s primary campaign in a rebuke to Ms. Raimondo, but failed to push him over the top.Alexander Burns reported from New York, and Katharine Q.

Qamar Javed Bajwa, began months before Pakistan\u2019s national elections. Pakistan offered to resume on-and-off talks with India over their border dispute in the Kashmir region, which stalled in 2015 as violence flared up there.A key objective for Pakistan in reaching out to India is to open barriers to trade between the countries, which would give Pakistan more access to regional markets. Any eventual peace talks over Kashmir are likely to involve an increase in bilateral trade as a confidence-building measure.\u201cWe want to move forward and we are trying our best to have good ties with all our neighbors, including India,\u201d Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said. \u201cAs General Bajwa says, regions prosper, countries don\u2019t. India cannot prosper by weakening Pakistan.\u201dDiplomats say General Bajwa has tried to reach out to General Rawat to initiate talks. But the effort has been stymied by what one diplomat called a \u201csystem mismatch.\u201dThe army is Pakistan\u2019s most powerful institution, but India\u2019s military is much weaker and could not agree to a peace deal without the civilian government\u2019s approval. Diplomats in New Delhi say Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is preoccupied with elections expected early next year and does not want talks before then, fearing that if talks collapse \u2014 as they have many times before \u2014 it could cost them at the polls.\u201cTill the Indian elections, there cannot be an immediate betterment in bilateral relations,\u201d Mr. Chaudhry said. India\u2019s military and its foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.With Mr. Khan in office, talks may have a better chance because he is seen as the army\u2019s man, diplomats in both Islamabad and New Delhi say. India sees Mr. Khan\u2019s outreach as sanctioned by the military and believes he will clearly present General Bajwa\u2019s demands and red lines.The plan would give Beijing more direct access to important Western markets by building a series of highways through Pakistan, connecting China\u2019s western border to Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea. If Pakistani troops are freed up along the border with India, the thinking goes, they could be diverted to secure the country\u2019s western flank, where China\u2019s trade routes would be.Pakistan may also be realizing that it can no longer withstand its growing international isolation and its worsening ties with the United States, which was once its closest Western ally. The United States cut more than $1 billion of aid to Pakistan in January for not doing enough to curb terror groups, which it accuses the army of supporting.Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}

And true patriotism demanded that we say so, without equivocation, and unrelentingly.Trump had become the president by a complex web of occurrences: white racial anxiety, reaction to the first black president, unease about the possibility of the first female president, voter suppression and voter apathy, and an attack on our elections by the Russians.This presidency has been haunted by the specter of illegitimacy from its inception.And yet, the markets didn\u2019t crash.

We entered no new major foreign conflicts, although we have cozied up to people who should be enemies and spat in the faces of people who used to be friends.The Trump presidency was not the cataclysm that many had feared, but the possibility of damage hovers over us.

Amazing!\u201dMost of that energy is coming from people opposed to Trump and his corrupt administration, thereby benefiting Democrats.This is the worst possible scenario for the president and his party less than two months from Election Day.\u201cThe president\u2019s party almost always suffers a net loss of U.S. House seats in midterm elections. However, losses tend to be much steeper when the president is unpopular. In Gallup\u2019s polling history, presidents with job approval ratings below 50 percent have seen their party lose 37 House seats, on average, in midterm elections. That compares with an average loss of 14 seats when presidents had approval ratings above 50 percent.\u201dTrump\u2019s approval rating is at 40 percent, and unlike his predecessors, he is not a normal president. He is a divisive lightning rod.Democrats are not only likely to win control of the House of Representatives; they also have a long-shot chance of taking control of the Senate, although the map is working against them.Resistance up to this point has largely been a statement of principle, but when we vote in November it will be an expression of power. We\u2019re not deranged; we\u2019re determined!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Young, Liberal and Russian", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZhanna Nemtsova is the founder of the Boris Nemtsov Foundation for Freedom, which was named after her father, Boris Y. Nemtsov, a critic of the Russian government who was killed in 2015. She is also a reporter for the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle.Being young and liberal in today\u2019s Russia is no easy feat. With a government bent on curbing freedoms and an economy in decline, options for the country\u2019s democratically-oriented youths are limited. Yet while many young Russians are fleeing a nation that has left them with little hope, some are determined to stay and fight.On March 26, 2017, thousands of people took to the streets in Moscow and other Russian cities to protest corruption in what turned out to be the country\u2019s largest rallies in recent years. One thing that stood out was how young many of the protesters were. Some had just started college, some were still in school. Born after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this new generation of political activists is devoted to liberal values and committed to rescuing Russia\u2019s democracy. They get their news online, they refuse to swallow the propaganda fed to them by state-controlled media and they resent President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s authoritarian regime.The ruling elite was swift to suppress the demonstrations. The authorities in Moscow said they detained around 500 people, though other reports had the number closer to 1,000. Many of the arrested protesters were under 18. According to Human Rights Watch, the police harassed and intimidated several children who took part. In the end, Russia\u2019s politically engaged youths got their first taste of the repressive tactics the government regularly uses to silence dissent.In recent years, the growth of political engagement among Russia\u2019s youth fueled hopes that Mr. Putin\u2019s monopoly on power could be challenged. The rise to prominence of the opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny, who in December 2016 announced that he intended to run for president, partly drove this new outlook. His campaign team created a countrywide network of offices, staffed with coordinators in their early 20s.Still, this political awakening has turned young activists into a target for the authorities. Since the unrest in 2017, they have been persecuted, detained and threatened with expulsion from school.Of course, young political activists are not the only Russians who are leaving the country. The number of people emigrating from Russia to places beyond the territories of the former Soviet Union rose in 2016 to 56,730, up from just 14,206 in 2011, according to Russia\u2019s state statistics service.We know how disastrous a so-called brain drain can be. Development is heavily based on human capital, and a skilled and highly educated work force is the foundation of a competitive nation. This is especially important in a country like Russia, which faces significant economic stagnation and inflation.In addition, as liberal-minded Russians leave the country, more radical views are taking hold among the population that stays \u2014 and this subtle shift could have catastrophic consequences.Neo-Nazis, Bolsheviks, Cossacks, monarchists and Russian Orthodox groups, despite their diverse ideological orientations, all seem to share a repulsion for democratic values, a frustration with the current order and a desire to restore Russia\u2019s imperial past and glory. Meanwhile, Mr. Putin has repeatedly flirted with this same imperialistic rhetoric in order to stoke nationalistic fervor. If anger and discontentment grow, however, such groups\u2019 unpredictability and belligerent posturing could make them harder for the Kremlin to control.Hidden in their rhetoric is the potential for violence and chaos. We saw hints of this back in 2006, when mobs of young men ravaged the town of Kondopoga in clashes fueled by ethnic animosity toward immigrants from the Caucasus, and four years later, when the killing of a Spartak Moscow soccer fan led to violent anti-immigrant protests in the city.Human rights, democracy, the government\u2019s grip on power \u2014 everything is in danger if extremist views take root. As the Kremlin concentrates its energies on targeting Russia\u2019s peaceful young protesters and dimming their spark, perhaps it should remember that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lawmakers Dismiss White House Push to Fight Election Interference as Too Weak", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Lawmakers pushing to more aggressively counteract Russian election interference dismissed a new White House effort to punish foreign election meddling as inadequate on Wednesday, pledging to try to secure a vote on more punitive legislation.At least one senior Republican, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, held out the possibility that the chamber could still advance its own alternative but said it would be difficult to do so before November\u2019s midterm elections.\u201cIt certainly does not foreclose congressional action,\u201d he told reporters, praising Mr. Trump\u2019s action. \u201cBut as you know, it is harder to pass legislation than it is for the president to sign an executive order.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s order gave the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, the power to investigate allegations of foreign interference and prompt sanctions against countries, organizations and people who illegally tried to influence the midterms.Mr. Coats said the order would mandate a 45-day close review of the midterms to determine whether foreigners had penetrated voting systems or launched a disinformation campaign. If intelligence officials conclude that a foreign power interfered in the election, Mr. Coats said, automatic sanctions will go into effect and the administration will review whether to further punish the offender.White House officials said the executive order does not single out Russia, but applies to any country that could embark on disinformation campaigns intended to sow chaos and upend the election. In addition to Russia, officials said China, North Korea and Iran were capable of meddling in American elections.Mr. Coats said the new order installed a process to ensure the intelligence community was doing all it could to track interference before the election and comprehensively review it afterward.\u201cAnd if we see something has happened, then there\u2019s going to be an automatic response to that,\u201d Mr. Coats said.But Senate Democrats and Republicans who have taken a harder line on Russian interference said the executive order fell short and that only legislation could force tough action against Moscow. A sanctions bill passed last year forced the administration to enact two rounds of sanctions this year.\u201cSomething is better than nothing, but I doubt it will be a substitute for legislation,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, one of the leading Republican sanctions proponents.Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, have written a bill, the Deter Act, to impose mandatory sanctions on anyone who attacks the American election.While the executive order would primarily target the people and entities that attack the election system, lawmakers said, the Senate legislation would have wider economic sanctions targeting financial institutions, oligarchs and others.In an interview, Mr. Van Hollen said the executive order was merely a version of his legislation \u201cwithout the teeth.\u201d\u201cThe Russians need to know the response will be certain and severe, and the executive order provides neither of those key elements,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I look at this, it seems aimed more at deterring congressional action on the Deter Act than deterring Putin\u2019s interference in our elections.\u201dMr. Van Hollen predicted that if the measure got a vote on the Senate floor, it would pass with a comfortable bipartisan majority. But the challenge will be getting the bill to the floor.Another bipartisan group of senators \u2014 led by Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Mr. Graham \u2014 have pushed for an even more aggressive sanctions package designed to impose devastating sanctions across the Russian economy pre-emptively. But it is less likely to receive serious consideration by Republican leaders in the Senate or the House.The fate of either measure ultimately rests with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. He has not promised action but previously said it might be possible to vote on consensus legislation in October. Mr. McConnell assigned two committees to study sanctions and develop a single proposal for consideration. One of those, the Senate Banking Committee, convened a panel of experts on Wednesday to evaluate Mr. Trump\u2019s executive action and the potential effect of targeting sectors of the Russian economy through new sanctions authorities.Mr. Graham fretted that time was running short for lawmakers to help safeguard November\u2019s voting.\u201cWe\u2019re running out of days up here, and I can\u2019t think of a more worthy thing to be doing in a bipartisan fashion,\u201d he said.Still, the White House measure probably lessened the pressure on Mr. McConnell to allow a vote. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the head of the Intelligence Committee, praised the executive order and said it would \u201cstrengthen our ability to quickly and appropriately hold responsible anyone who interferes in our election.\u201d He had nothing to add about separate legislation.Democrats, mistrustful of Mr. Trump\u2019s intentions toward Russia, were clearly frustrated and warned that left to his own discretion, the president might not actually punish Russia.\u201cAn order which effectively permits, but does not automatically require, sanctions for continued illegal Russian attacks on our democracy won\u2019t substitute for mandatory sanctions required by law, and shouldn\u2019t be used to pre-empt or slow building congressional momentum on new legislated Russia sanctions,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the Banking Committee\u2019s top Democrat, said during the hearing.Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, said to truly deter Russia, the United States must make clear that election interference will have \u201cpainful consequences.\u201d\u201cWe still need bipartisan legislation because I don\u2019t think any of us believe you can trust this president to ever stand up to Russia,\u201d Mr. Warner said in an interview.But John R. Bolton, the White House national security adviser, told reporters that the new order showed Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to take a hard line on foreign meddling in the election.\u201cWe felt it was important to demonstrate the president has taken command of this issue, that it\u2019s something he cares deeply about, that the integrity of our elections and our constitutional process are a high priority to him,\u201d Mr. Bolton said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Growth Has Lifted Counties That Voted for Trump. Mostly, It\u2019s the Wealthy Ones.", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s economy has left the most distressed swaths of the country waiting for their share of the good times.ST. CHARLES, Mo. \u2014 The prosperity is apparent on the way into town: the 21-floor casino resort and spa on one side of the interstate, and on the other a freshly built retail quarter of boutiques, a brand-new Hilton hotel and a P.F. Chang\u2019s. It unfolds from there along the highways heading west with more gleaming office parks and multiplying subdivisions.This is not the Trump country of the popular imagination, the land of shuttered plants and the economically left behind. St. Charles County, in the suburbs northwest of St. Louis, has had the highest median household income in Missouri for several years.But in 2016, Donald J. Trump won the county by 26 points, and he is still popular among people like Tom Hughes, a homebuilder whose business was rebounding from the recession before Mr. Trump took office. But, Mr. Hughes said, \u201cNow there\u2019s an optimism that I haven\u2019t seen, maybe ever.\u201dMr. Trump rode to office in part by promising economic revival to sputtering towns across America. Economic growth has accelerated since he took office, from the final year of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, and Mr. Trump frequently claims credit for it.But the growth under Mr. Trump has not helped everywhere. It has lifted wealthy areas, like St. Charles County, which were already growing before he took office. And it has left the most economically troubled swaths of the country, the ones that Mr. Trump promised to revitalize, waiting for their share of the good times.The divide is pronounced between the high- and low-income counties that helped deliver Mr. Trump the White House.St. Charles County, which sits in the most prosperous slice of American counties, saw job growth of nearly 2 percent last year, and business growth of 6 percent. By contrast, about 200 miles north in Illinois, Knox County ranks in the bottom fifth of prosperity nationwide, according to the Economic Innovation Group\u2019s rankings. It flipped in 2016 from supporting Mr. Obama, a Democrat, to Mr. Trump, a Republican.In Mr. Obama\u2019s final year in office, according to data from the Labor Department, Knox County lost 1 percent of its jobs and businesses. In Mr. Trump\u2019s first year, it lost more than 5 percent of its jobs \u2014 and nearly 7 percent of businesses. Knox County also continues to see higher unemployment than the nation as a whole. Its unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in July, down only slight from its rate of 5 percent in July 2017. The people in Knox County, at least those who have stayed, have seen factories close up and move to Mexico or Mississippi. They have seen wages stagnate and young people leave. And in 2016 the residents, or enough of them at least, thought Mr. Trump might be able to turn things around.\u201cThere\u2019s always that hope,\u201d said Johnny Holland, 40, on his way to work at Target in Galesburg, the Knox County seat. \u201cIt\u2019s a gamble,\u201d he said of his vote. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed yet.\u201dBut there may be a more complicated dynamic: a difference between places like St. Charles, which mainly want government to get out of the way, and places like Knox County, which are looking for rescue. While many in St. Charles give Mr. Trump only partial credit for a boom that preceded his arrival in office \u2014 and most of that for simply not messing it up \u2014 Trump supporters in hard-hit Knox are still holding out hope that he can turn things around.St. Charles has prime geography, with available space near railroads and highways, and close to a major city at the center of the country. Local leaders have been zealous recruiters of business. The county has landed aerospace contractors, IT companies, small manufacturers and operations centers for corporations, including Mastercard. A huge Amazon distribution center is coming next year.Like suburban counties everywhere, St. Charles was gut-punched by the recession \u2014 Mr. Hughes\u2019s business went from 173 employees to five. But growth picked up again around 2012, and in the last few years started into overdrive.\u201cInvestors held off for a long period of time, and eventually they just decided that the economy was going to be solid for a while,\u201d said Greg Prestemon, president of the Economic Development Center of St. Charles. \u201cThat certainly has happened under the Trump year-and-half. But also before that.\u201dMr. Trump came to St. Charles last November to rally supporters for his signature tax law as it was speeding through Congress. He boasted that it would be great for construction workers and other middle-class Americans, and that his wealthy friends hated the plan.Mr. Prestemon said the tax cuts were broadly welcomed here, though they did not appear to be driving major business decisions. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anybody say, \u2018Now, that this has happened, I\u2019m going to make a $5 million investment,\u2019\u201d he said.St. Charles is a stalwartly Republican county in any year. Federal bailouts saved two of the biggest employers, Citigroup and General Motors, in the teeth of the recession, and stimulus funds paid for most of a critical highway project. But when Washington\u2019s involvement regards regulations, conservatives in the county have bristled.Tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed on certain imports \u2014 and retaliatory tariffs levied by countries such as China on farm goods and a wide variety of American exports \u2014 have been somewhat disquieting, given the county\u2019s significant agriculture business.But many local Trump supporters said they trusted the president had a worthy long-term goal, even if it involved some short-term pain. And they appreciated his efforts to roll back regulations.\u201cIt\u2019s truly his economy, I don\u2019t care what anybody says,\u201d said John Haake, an Ayn Rand-quoting conservative sitting in the conference room of his laser technology shop. After the 2016 election, \u201ca whole euphoria was going through the business community.\u201dIn Knox County, a three-and-a-half-hour drive up the Mississippi River, that confidence is harder to come by. Once a redoubt of solid union manufacturing careers, the county was pummeled by plant closings from the 1980s until the early 2000s. Most brutal was the shuttering of a Maytag factory in 2004 that employed around 5,000 people, leaving a giant warehouse that still sits \u201cAvailable,\u201d as a banner pleads to passing drivers.\u201cThis town\u2019s really gone downhill,\u201d said Brian Ledbetter, 45, who works at the state prison across from the old Maytag factory. That trajectory is why he, along with nearly 60 percent of the county, voted in 2008 for Barack Obama. Mr. Obama visited Galesburg multiple times in his political career; he spoke of its struggles in his star-making 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention and mentioned it again in his 2010 State of the Union address.But nothing happened. And in 2016 Mr. Ledbetter, along with a narrow plurality of voters in Knox, voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cThe one thing he kept keying on was bringing jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jobs going away is what tore this county apart. Jobs might bring it back.\u201dHad anything changed here since 2016? No, he said. Not yet. But it would take time, he said, and the fact that the economy elsewhere, in wealthier places, is doing so well means the benefits would eventually trickle down to here. \u201cThey can only build so much,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019ll be a group of people always that want to go back to the good old days of the 1920s or the 1880s or whatever,\u201d said John Pritchard, the mayor of Galesburg, who insists that the Labor Department figures about Knox County are simply wrong. \u201cBut the reality is I think most people are feeling better about how things are moving. It\u2019s just a challenge to keep people here.\u201dMarisa Miller, 23, who plans to be a physician assistant, was sitting in her car in the vast parking lot of the old mall, where the last department store was having an out-of-business sale. Her parents worked at Maytag and her grandparents worked at the Butler factory that closed down in 2005.\u201cHonestly we\u2019re bringing new places here,\u201d she said of the stores opening in the other parts of town. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing other places leave.\u201dMs. Miller said she was not surprised that economic revival had not yet washed over her town. She hadn\u2019t expected Mr. Trump to bring one in the first place, she said. The only thing that had changed since the election seemed to be that certain people around town were angrier. As soon as she can, Ms. Miller said, she plans to leave town herself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.T.C. Hearings Add to Efforts That Threaten Tech Industry", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have fought regulators in Europe on privacy, antitrust and taxes. In the United States, the tech titans were on friendly terrain.But on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission kicked off a series of hearings to discuss whether the agency\u2019s competition and consumer protection policies should change to better reflect new technologies and companies.Joseph J. Simons, the agency\u2019s chairman, expressed openness to a new approach.\u201cThe broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cI approach all these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what we see and hear at these hearings.\u201dThe F.T.C. hearings, the first of 15 to 20 over the next several months, are one of several efforts underway on the federal and state level that threaten to limit the expansion and power of tech companies. Later this month, Congress will bring executives from top tech companies to testify on proposals for privacy laws. The Justice Department has warned it may start investigations into whether Google and other social media sites are biased against conservative voices.The spotlight on the giants of Silicon Valley is a major shift for regulators in the United States. For years, they held up the growth of these firms as an emblem of American business leadership and ingenuity. But after a string of crises over privacy and misinformation on social media, a growing chorus of regulators from both political parties is casting a more skeptical eye on the industry.New regulations in the United States are unlikely to arrive anytime soon, and any new federal policies will probably be weaker than those in Europe and states like California. Tech companies have lobbied the Trump administration for voluntary rules and government officials have indicated their desire for light-touch regulation that would pre-empt some state laws.\u201cIt will be a slow-moving ship, faster on privacy than on antitrust, but it\u2019s an important moment,\u201d said Blair Levin, a senior adviser at the research firm New Street and a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission.Reaching an agreement on changes to antitrust policy will be particularly difficult.The field of antitrust law has focused for 30 years on whether prices increase when there is limited competition. Some academics and consumer groups have called for regulators to rethink that gauge. Amazon and Google, they say, defy that metric of antitrust law because the companies are gaining power even as they offer cheap or free goods.\u201cThe issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It\u2019s about the \u2018new economy\u2019 and the degradation of the human spirit \u2014 breaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies,\u201d Mr. Sanders said last week in a Twitter post.Amazon has disputed Mr. Sanders\u2019s accusations, saying the company offers stable pay and benefits for its employees. It has also disputed concerns the company has violated antitrust laws, saying it does not have a dominant market share of the retail market.Some Republicans have also voiced concerns about the industry, and a growing number of economists are studying whether technology\u2019s leading companies are increasing wage inequality. The economists are focused on whether the concentration of workforces at companies like Amazon have a disproportionate effect on wages, inflation and growth.\u201cThese concerns raise a challenge to antitrust agency leadership, the courts and legislators,\u201d Mr. Simons said on Thursday.Companies have argued against broad changes. Google, for instance, says that it offers free search services and that consumers can easily switch to rival search engines online. Companies argue that the tech market is fast changing and regulations could quickly become outdated.The F.T.C. hearing, held at the Georgetown University School of Law, was filled with antitrust lawyers, some of whom had ties to the tech companies. Many warned that changes could make decisions on mergers and antitrust enforcement vulnerable to politics.Janet L. McDavid, a panelist at the F.T.C. hearing and a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, said simply going after companies because they were big was dangerous.The \u201camorphous\u201d concepts of big and fair in antitrust law could lend itself to political decisions, Ms. McDavid said.\u201cWhich we certainly should eschew, especially now in the current political environment,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Elkhart, Ind., Goes, So Goes the Nation, and Elkhart Is Nervous", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byELKHART, Ind. \u2014 The tables were filled at the Chubby Trout restaurant and the local craft beer flowed. The Flippin\u2019 Cow was packed too, with diners overlooking Simonton Lake. Small manufacturing companies were advertising for workers, offering health insurance and retirement accounts.But Elkhart, with about 55,000 residents and a 2.3 percent unemployment rate, is also a bit nervous.This city near the Michigan border has long been used as a political prop \u2014 first by President Barack Obama, then by President Trump \u2014 to express concern for the downtrodden and to make a claim on newfound prosperity.Now, Elkhart may be sending a message that no politician wants to hear.The city calls itself the \u201cRV Capital of the World\u201d \u2014 more than 80 percent of the vehicles sold in the United States are made in Elkhart and the surrounding area, according to the RV Industry Association \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum are increasing costs, diminishing demand and causing concern that a 10-year boom cycle could be waning.Shipments of motor homes were down 18.7 percent in June compared with a year ago, and shipments of smaller trailers and campers were down 10.5 percent, according to the RV Industry Association. Motor home shipments were down 6.5 percent in July, but overall shipments were up 10 percent compared with the same month last year. Some companies have cut back to four-day workweeks. Amid strong job gains nationally, hints of rising wages and solid overall economic growth, Elkhart\u2019s health is decidedly ambiguous.\u201cI think it\u2019s a yellow light,\u201d said Richard Curtin, a University of Michigan economist who is a consultant to the R.V. industry. \u201cDepending on how things evolve in six months, it could be a red light, getting to the end of the expansion.\u201dIt could also be temporary if, as some in the industry think, the problem is related to excess inventory, he said. Still, the health of the industry, which has a track record as an economic bellwether, bears watching. \u201cR.V.s have always preceded the rest of the economy in a downturn and in an upturn,\u201d Mr. Curtin said.Frank Hugelmeyer, the R.V. association\u2019s president, declined to comment.The impact of the president\u2019s tariffs on everything from steel to soybeans is playing out against the backdrop of the midterm elections, with some Republicans trying to make a robust economy central to their case for maintaining control of Congress. In Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota and other states, the president\u2019s policies are starting to be felt, especially in industries that have large trading relationships with China.\u201cI think there\u2019s serious concern about the effects of tariffs on the R.V. industry,\u201d said Senator Joe Donnelly, Democrat of Indiana and one of the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents this year. His home is nearby. \u201cSo many of the components that go into R.V.s are directly affected by these tariffs.\u201d\u201cIt is something that we watch very, very closely having gone through the other side of this when unemployment was 22 percent,\u201d Mr. Donnelly said, referring to the unemployment rate in Elkhart at the peak of the Great Recession.In Elkhart, a field of R.V.s is as common as corn. An RV Hall of Fame lionizes the industry and its progress from small aluminum trailers to luxury vehicles with the amenities of expensive condominiums. \u201cWe like to say we build fun in Elkhart County,\u201d said Mike Yoder, a Republican and an Elkhart County commissioner.But Mr. Yoder is among those who think the fun could be ebbing. \u201cEverybody in the industry is aware of the negative significance of that,\u201d he said of the tariffs. \u201cWe are experiencing a bit of a slowdown in R.V. production, and a number of companies are working four days instead of five to clean up inventory.\u201d\u201cMy personal opinion is this is horrific for the community,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is a really big deal for us. We export a lot of product and import a lot of product. If this whole trade dispute expands much more, it has serious implications, and we will once again lead the country into a recession, without a doubt.\u201dMr. Donnelly said he had objected to China\u2019s dumping of steel into the United States, but that the issue should have been resolved by the administration without a broader trade war. The tariffs, he said, had caused uncertainty and \u201cextraordinary upheaval.\u201dNow the fretting has returned.\u201cI think a good term is \u2018concern,\u2019\u201d said Mark Dobson, head of the Economic Development Corporation of Elkhart County. \u201cNobody\u2019s in a panic; they are just concerned.\u201dNick Kieffer, chief executive and president of the Goshen Chamber of Commerce, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s the uncertainty as well, not knowing where the playing field is going to be,\u201d he said.The R.V. industry is forecasting sales of about 500,000 vehicles this year, about the same as in 2017 after several years of strong, sometimes double-digit, growth. The tariffs are adding as much as 50 percent to the price of some materials, and the companies in turn are raising prices.\u201cAre they having an effect?\u201d said Dave Schutz, an executive at Dometic, a large parts supplier. \u201cIn the long term that remains to be seen. It depends on how deep and how much farther they go.\u201d\u201cThe first sign of us as an industry is usually the Fourth of July shutdown,\u201d Mr. Shutz said, referring to local manufacturers. \u201cLast year, we shut down one week.

Among them is Dan Holtz, who owns Troyer Products, a small manufacturing company that makes accessories for recreational vehicles.He is also the county Republican chairman and was onstage with Mr. Trump when the president spoke here to an enthusiastic crowd of more than 6,000 people in May. \u201cIt was hard for him to not get a warm welcome here,\u201d Mr. Holtz said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the zeitgeist of the community.\u201d\u201cI almost welcome a slowdown,\u201d Mr. Holtz said in a small conference room at his company. \u201cI can\u2019t find enough workers.\u201dIndeed, companies like his have had to raise pay and increase benefits to attract and retain workers. He said that the drop in shipments is likely an \u201cexpected correction\u201d in the market.Blaming the drop-off on tariffs, he said, was \u201cmyopically political.\u201d He believes Mr. Trump is using the tariffs as a negotiating tactic.Mr. Yoder said that was far too charitable. \u201cMy perspective is our folks in Washington are not being honest,\u201d Mr. Yoder said. \u201cThere is no plan. This is a very dangerous way to negotiate a trade deal.

{"Headline": "Several Reported Killed in Libya as Gunmen Storm National Oil Company", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGunmen stormed the headquarters of Libya\u2019s national oil company in Tripoli on Monday, setting off explosions, taking hostages and spraying gunfire, leaving several people dead or wounded before forces aligned with the government took control of the building. The identity and motives of the assailants were not clear.The oil company said two of its employees had been killed, and there were reports of two gunmen killed, putting the total number of dead at four. But an employee who escaped the assault said he believed that as many as six people had been killed, including three of the assailants.The attack follows a month of escalating violence among rival militias competing for control of Tripoli, the capital, where a United Nations-backed government has its headquarters but remains largely powerless. Last week, clashes killed more than 60 people.Any attack on the national oil company is significant because petroleum is the lifeblood of the Libyan economy, and competition for control of the country\u2019s vast oil reserves is at the heart of the often violent struggle for power there. Cuts in oil revenue because of the fighting have driven Libya into a severe financial crisis, with the government failing to meet the public payrolls, long lines forming at banks, and inflation soaring.The employee who escaped, Baha Elddin, said in an interview that six men armed with \u201cmachine guns\u201d had fought their way into the building. Three had blown themselves up, he said, and three others had climbed the stairs to the upper floors.Mr. Elddin said that local militia fighters had responded to the incursion by besieging the building and that their gunfire may have caused the most casualties. \u201cThey started shooting at the assailants inside while the assailants threw grenades down on them from the second floor,\u201d Mr. Elddin said. \u201cI think that most injuries happened because the respondents were shooting in.\u201dSpeaking in the early afternoon in Tripoli, Mr. Elddin said that the battle had ended with as many as 10 employees injured, and that it was unclear whether the three assailants who had climbed the stairs had escaped.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.The chairman of the state oil company, Mustafa Sanallah, escaped unharmed, and experts said it was unlikely that the attack would directly affect Libya\u2019s oil production. But the events demonstrated that the country\u2019s oil infrastructure remains vulnerable.\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that the country remains at risk,\u201d said Riccardo Fabiani, a geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm. \u201cThere is still a backdrop of violence and instability that could again cut production at anytime in the future.\u201dLibya has descended into chaos in the seven years since the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The United Nations and Western powers have tried to set up a government based in Tripoli that might be able to unify the country.But so far, power in Tripoli and Western Libya remains divided among rival local or Islamist militias. A would-be strongman, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, dominates the Eastern area around Benghazi, thanks in part to the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had controlled its own beachhead around the coastal city of Sirte until it was driven out by Western airstrikes and local militias in 2016. Many of its fighters have fled into the sparsely populated desert regions. They occasionally stage terrorist attacks on institutions of the rival governments backed by the United Nations and General Hifter, including a similar assault last spring on an election commission.Analysts say the National Oil Corporation has managed to remain neutral amid the turmoil. It has increased production \u2014 which fell to almost nothing after war broke out in 2011 \u2014 to around one million barrels a day.That is still significantly below prewar output, but analysts say that under current circumstances, it is probably close to the maximum Libya can produce. Oil producing centers, pipelines and export terminals around the country are vulnerable to attack.Monday\u2019s assault comes at a time of growing concerns about global oil supplies. As the Trump administration tries to cut off Iranian exports, they have declined to around two million a day in August from about 2.7 million barrels a day in May, and they are expected to drop to 1.5 million a day in September, according to Energy Aspects. Venezuela\u2019s output continues to decline amid political chaos and economic collapse.\u201cToo many market participants are way too complacent about Libya,\u201d said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York.\u201cWe are one major supply outage away from a super spike,\u201d she added, referring to much higher prices.Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Gavin Newsom, a Stealth Run for California Governor", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. \u2014 He may seem hesitant to say it, but Gavin Newsom wants your vote for governor of California. Really.Mr. Newsom took the stage to cheers in the hot afternoon sun in Orange County the other day. For 20 minutes, he talked about the Democratic candidates for Congress and the California Legislature. He talked about President Trump. He talked about poverty, homelessness, immigration and global warming.But there was one topic that Mr. Newsom, the lieutenant governor, barely mentioned: the fact that he is the Democratic candidate for governor of California.But with the threat of an economic downturn, escalating hostility with the Trump White House, and looming decisions about how to respond to entrenched poverty, climate change and a dysfunctional state tax system, California may be entering turbulent waters. And Mr. Newsom\u2019s low-risk campaign, along with a widespread sense that the outcome of the contest is almost a foregone conclusion, suggests voters may learn little between now and Election Day about Mr. Newsom\u2019s qualifications and what he intends to do should he take over as the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state.\u201cI don\u2019t think this campaign will test him,\u201d said Jim Newton, a lecturer on public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cAnd that\u2019s too bad. He\u2019s a quality candidate. It\u2019s too bad we are not given a chance to see more of him and learn what he would do. I think he plays defense through Election Day.\u201dMr. Newsom asserted that California voters had plenty of opportunities to learn about him during a career in public service that included a turn as mayor of San Francisco and as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\u201cI\u2019ve been on the trail for three years,\u201d he said, as his four young children scampered up and down his campaign bus.\u201cThe question of being challenged, of what kind of governor are you going to be: We\u2019ve had that vetting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been as scrutinized as much as any candidate for political office in some time, in terms of my tenure as mayor, my tenure as county supervisor.\u201dMr. Newsom said that voters were most interested in talking about the president. \u201cMy town halls, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care, Trump. Environment, Trump. Jobs, economy, Trump. Anxiety, fear, Trump.\u201dThat said, Mr. Newsom has spent more than seven years as Mr. Brown\u2019s lieutenant governor, a low-profile position that has little authority or assigned duties. It has proved to be a particularly obscure role under the shadow of a governor like Mr. Brown.Mr. Newsom won widespread attention as mayor of San Francisco \u2014 where, among other things, he championed same-sex marriage at a time when it was a contentious issue even in his own party. Still, being mayor of a city of 871,000 people does not present the same challenges that come with being the leader of a state like California, with a population of 39.4 million people, an increasingly assertive State Legislature and an ever-expanding catalog of problems.And Mr. Newsom so far has offered often vague responses on some of the biggest issues he would face: global warming, the over-budget high-speed rail train between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the state\u2019s volatile tax code, which Mr. Newsom has said needs an overhaul, while saying it was too early to say how.Mr. Newsom signaled during the primary that he would support a California-financed single-payer health care program, over the objections of opponents who said it was unaffordable. Since his primary victory, Mr. Newsom has said it was unlikely to be accomplished during his first term as governor.\u201cSomeone said, \u2018you are backtracking on single-payer,\u2019\u201d he said, when pressed on the question. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually expressing an outline. I\u2019m architecting the conversation over the next few years. It\u2019s not an act that is going to occur by a signature of a governor.\u201dAnd Mr. Newsom, an opponent of the death penalty, said he had not decided what to do if he is forced to preside over the first execution in more than a decade in a state that has more inmates on death row \u2014 over 700 \u2014 than any other. In 2016, California passed a proposition forcing the state to resume executions, although there are legal challenges outstanding.Would Mr. Newsom sign a death warrant? \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to answer the question,\u201d he said, clearly struggling with the issue. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not prepared to answer the question. But I am preparing myself to answer the question. And in that preparation comes a lot of soul searching.\u201dRaphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, said a central question is how Mr. Newsom might reconcile his liberal appeal from the primary with running a state. \u201cSince he positioned himself in the primary in the progressive wing of the party, what will he do when presented with legislation that, while popular in the party, will be difficult to implement in government?\u201d he said.Mr. Newsom has had an uneasy relationship with Mr. Brown from his first days as lieutenant governor. Mr. Newsom recounted how shortly after he took office, he put out his own economic plan for California \u2014 and was quickly reminded who was in charge by Mr. Brown\u2019s office.Now, he faces the challenge of trying to at once align himself with the popular Mr. Brown while acknowledging criticisms that Mr. Cox and others have offered on the governor and what has taken place under his watch in California, from housing costs to homelessness to growing poverty.\u201cWhat happened to our state?\u201d he said in Seal Beach. In Torrance, he called homelessness \u201cthe ultimate manifestation of our failure. It happened on our watch. We own that.\u201d\u201cUnless we deal with the affordability crisis, the California Dream will no longer exist,\u201d he said after he got back on his bus.Mr. Newsom said he would expect pressure from lawmakers to restore spending that Mr. Brown had cut. He said he would mostly continue Mr. Brown\u2019s frugal ways, but signaled he was ready to spend money in areas where Mr. Brown had not \u2014 in particular, early childhood education and higher education.\u201cI get why people worry about it, because if immediately you connote me with San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi, everything \u2014 I get where that anxiety comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will soon learn that I am going to be very stubborn as it relates to the budget and fiscal discipline. At the same time less stubborn on some investments that Jerry has understandably danced around.\u201dMr. Newsom said the outgoing governor had left the state \u201cin better shape than probably any governor in modern times.\u201d But he said that Mr. Brown had given him a somewhat mordant warning as they discussed what was around the corner.\u201c\u2018Good luck,\u2019\u201d he quoted Mr. Brown as saying. \u201c\u2019Cause he sees the headwinds, he sees the fixed costs, he sees the hockey stick of health care and pensions. He sees all this building pressure, he knows what the Legislature is revving up to do and all these interest groups that are a deeper part of that appetite than the Legislature. They are all expecting the next governor to solve their problems.\u201dAt 50, Mr. Newsom retains the aura of glamour from his days as a young mayor, with a full head of slicked-back hair. When he showed up to speak for an assembly candidate running in the South Bay of Los Angeles, Democrats clamored outside his bus, waiting to catch a view or a photograph. He emerged carrying boxes of pizza.\u201cHe\u2019s so photogenic,\u201d said Carol Pike-Bauer, 92, a retired chemical engineer. She said she had been following his career since he was San Francisco mayor and admired his willingness to go against the federal government on gay marriage. \u201cHe did what he thought was right and fair,\u201d she said.As mayor, Mr. Newsom\u2019s personal life was also terrain for the gossip columns. He was a fixture on the city\u2019s party circuit, and later admitted to an affair with the wife of his campaign manager. He got a divorce and underwent treatment for alcohol abuse.These days, Mr. Newsom travels the state with his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary filmmaker, and their children. His son Hunter, 7, kept tugging at the back of his pants, clamoring for attention as Mr. Newsom tried to speak at the rally here.Californians who turned up for his events said they were pleased to hear him talk about issues like global warming and immigration, even in Republican parts of the state.\u201cWe do have a strong Republican base here \u2014 some issues he\u2019s talking about people will disapprove of,\u201d said John Henry Lopez, 47, a plumber who came to hear him speak in Fresno. \u201cBut he will be helped by the cost of health care. That\u2019s a strong message that can get people to vote.\u201dBrock Neeley, 53, who drove from Tulare to see Mr. Newsom in Fresno, said the area is \u201cturning blue, believe it or not.\u201d\u201cPeople are finally getting fed up,\u201d he said. \u201cFarmers who voted for Trump are seeing their crops in the field. Global warming affects us big time.\u201dIn his speeches, delivered without notes and in shirt sleeves, Mr. Newsom plucked quotes from Aristotle, Plutarch, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Oliver Wendell Holmes as he presented himself as the next face of the Democratic opposition in California.\u201cMy opponent has doubled down on all things Trump,\u201d Mr. Newsom said, in one of the few times he mentioned his opponent by name. \u201cThat\u2019s a very challenging place for Cox to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Takes Emergency Steps to Shore Up Peso", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina\u2019s president announced emergency measures on Monday to stem concerns from investors about the country\u2019s solvency as it seeks to tap an international credit line.It was the latest move to ease a growing crisis over a plunging currency, just days after the central bank intervened with a drastic increase in interest rates.In a televised address Monday morning, President Mauricio Macri said he would seek to reduce the government\u2019s budget deficit by imposing a new tax on exports. He also said he would reorganize his cabinet, eliminating around half of the ministries.\u201cWhat we have to face is a basic problem, which is we cannot spend more than we have,\u201d Mr. Macri said. \u201cThis is not just another crisis. It has to be the last.\u201dDespite the announcement, the Argentine peso continued its fall, losing 3 percent against the dollar in thin trading that analysts attributed to the Labor Day holiday in the United States. Stocks in Buenos Aires also fell.\u201cApparently there are still some doubts,\u201d said Sabrina Corujo, head of Portfolio Personal, a local brokerage. \u201cBut it may be a bit early to say outright that the reaction was negative.\u201dMr. Macri acted as officials prepared to head to Washington for negotiations Tuesday with the International Monetary Fund. Argentina is seeking a faster disbursement from a $50 billion standby credit agreement sealed this year.The tax on exports will be crucial in allowing a country to eliminate the fiscal deficit next year with the goal of achieving a surplus in 2020, Economy Minister Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne said.The tax, which will be in effect through 2020, will charge 4 pesos per dollar of exports in primary goods and services and 3 pesos per dollar for all other exports.\u201cThis will reduce the uncertainty surrounding the government\u2019s financing capability,\u201d said Marcos Buscaglia, a founding partner at Alberdi Partners, a local consulting firm. \u201cThe problem is that the additional austerity comes from the side of revenues and not spending.\u201dFausto Spotorno, chief economist at Orlando J. Ferreres & Associates, another consulting firm, said the export taxes \u201conly solve the short-term financial problems\u201d and do not amount to \u201ca replacement for the structural reforms that have not been carried out.\u201dIn addition, export taxes, which had long been criticized by Mr. Macri\u2019s allies, \u201care a bad tax because it alters the productivity of the economy\u201d and involves \u201csacrificing the long term for the short term,\u201d Mr. Spotorno said.Mr. Macri decreased export taxes on agriculture as one of his first measures when he entered office in December 2015 vowing to carry out market-friendly measures that he said would help the country reinsert itself into markets. It was a reversal of more than a decade of heavy state intervention in the economy by former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her husband and predecessor, N\u00e9stor Kirchner.Analysts said the government\u2019s credibility was still in question, particularly after a weekend filled with rumors about possible changes in the president\u2019s cabinet.\u201cThere is still a big question about whether the government will be able to implement a plan of social austerity and whether it will be able to obtain political consensus during an economy that is in a recession,\u201d said Federico Furiase, an economist with Eco Go, a consulting firm. \u201cAs time goes on, the government has fewer and fewer instruments to recover that credibility.\u201dAmong analysts there is still a feeling that the government \u201cis running to catch up\u201d after consistently trying to minimize any sort of economic problems, said Rodrigo \u00c1lvarez, the head of Analytica, another local consulting firm.It is a remarkable change in fortune for a government that was once a darling of the international markets and had won a big vote of confidence from voters in last year\u2019s midterm elections.\u201cAfter two years and a few months, the situation changed, and in large part because of circumstances that were outside our control,\u201d Mr. Macri said, largely blaming the global economy and a severe drought for the country\u2019s troubles.With the prospect of a potentially long recession, there is widespread concern among investors about the political future of Mr. Macri, who acknowledged Monday that the economic turmoil would lead to an increase in poverty.The political consequences of the move are difficult to predict.\u201cArgentina has never carried out an austerity plan of this magnitude before,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst.Advertisement"}

Is China\u2019s Economy Losing Steam?", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Huang teaches international management at M.I.T.Maybe Mr. Ma, 54, knows something that Mr. Putin does not. Two of the three forces, globalization and marketization, that have propelled Alibaba to its current $500 billion valuation are dissipating. The third force, technology, is mired in the trade war between China and the United States, and its prospects in China are now uncertain.Alibaba didn\u2019t just transform e-commerce in China; it transformed the entire economy by helping build up the private sector. Mr. Ma\u2019s departure from the company now \u2014 though he claims to have been planning it for a while \u2014 adds to a gathering sense that China\u2019s private sector, the engine of the economy, is losing steam \u2014 and faith.But today globalization is under assault. The Chinese government is enforcing more strictly regulations over V.I.E.s that it had long ignored, creating uncertainty for foreign investors. And the trade war between the United States and China is disrupting Chinese exports, threatening the supply chains of which Alibaba is an integral component.Under increasingly tight financial and regulatory pressures, China\u2019s private sector today arguably is facing the most challenging environment since the early 1990s.In conversations I had in Guangdong, business leaders from various sectors \u2014 product design, investment, technology \u2014 called the current situation \u201cdire.\u201d They said they were making far fewer deals, as much as 50 percent less, now than during the same period last year and complained about the toll of increasing taxes.These are not the conditions that allowed Alibaba to succeed. The company was a pioneer in adopting Western technology and business models \u2014 using online commerce, data analytics, website tools \u2014 to the Chinese context. Although it is often called China\u2019s Amazon, the comparison vastly understates its true significance. Alibaba started out as a business-to-business operation but, really, it gave market opportunities to private entrepreneurs in a statist system heavily stacked against them.So why is the Chinese government clamping down on the private sector when liberalizing it has served the economy so well? The reasons are varied and complex: rising authoritarianism at home, statism, the trade war. But the effects already are clear, with ominous implications for the entire economy. Could there even be a new Alibaba today?Yasheng Huang is a professor of international management at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Auto Industry\u2019s VHS-or-Betamax Moment", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe auto industry has a choice to make: Which language will cars speak when they talk to one another?Until a couple of years ago, automakers agreed on one vehicle-to-vehicle communications platform, called dedicated short-range communications, or DSRC, based on the technology used for Wi-Fi. But some car companies have begun to favor a competing protocol, known as Cellular V2X, which is based on a next-generation version of the technology used by your mobile phone.So far, the federal government has held back on enforcing a standard. A proposed rule mandating deployment of DSRC equipment in new vehicles has languished for nearly two years, and critics say the delay is making motorists less safe. But supporters of the competing standard say something better has come along.\u201cYou\u2019ve got public agencies who want to deploy, but we don\u2019t have a standard, so what do I buy?\u201d asked Kirk Steudle, director of Michigan\u2019s Department of Transportation and a supporter of the DSRC standard. \u201cBetamax, or a VHS?\u201dThe auto industry is divided over the standards.General Motors has embraced DSRC, and it\u2019s already a standard safety feature on Cadillac CTS sedans. Toyota and Volkswagen have also committed to make DSRC systems standard equipment on new cars beginning next year. On the other side are brands, including Ford, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, that have joined the chip maker Qualcomm, cellular providers and others to form the 5G Automotive Association, which is pushing the C-V2X standard.Regardless of the standard that\u2019s settled on, vehicles will be able to directly communicate with one another, allowing them to warn of collisions even when drivers cannot see each other. And such systems will allow valuable safety information to be shared from other sources: Instead of a sign warning that \u201cbridge ices before road,\u201d the bridge can warn drivers when ice has actually formed, and traffic lights will be able to manage traffic to minimize delays and clear the way for emergency vehicles.But there are important differences.John Kenney, director of the Toyota InfoTechnology Center, said his company was ready to move ahead with the DSRC standard. \u201cG.M. is online, too,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a potential risk that maybe it\u2019s not going to be DSRC. That just impedes deployment.\u201dSupporters of the C-V2X standard contend that DSRC is nearly two decades old, from a time when companies didn\u2019t imagine streaming video to children in the back seat of a crossover, or updating vehicle operating systems from the cloud. C-V2X\u2019s advocates say it would allow for more features, be more flexible and could use cellular infrastructure.\u201cPeople assume that just because something is here now and they\u2019ve been working on it for 15 or 20 years, it will be here 15 years from now,\u201d said Jovan Zagajac, technology manager in Ford\u2019s Connected Vehicle and Services group and a member of the 5G group\u2019s board. \u201cWell, the world has changed.\u201dBMW\u2019s engineers, for example, see safety advantages if cars can communicate directly with personal devices like mobile phones.\u201cThis will make it much easier to retrofit vehicles and also give the benefits of C-V2X to other vulnerable road users, such as cyclists and pedestrians,\u201d said Joachim Goethel, the leader of BMW\u2019s 5G connectivity initiatives.Despite the Obama-era proposal, which would require all new vehicles to include DSRC by 2023, the federal government hasn\u2019t moved to enforce a standard.Heidi King, deputy administrator at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the Department of Transportation was \u201ctechnology neutral\u201d on communication protocols.\u201cWhile our past research has centered around DSRC \u2014 because that was the only technology available \u2014 we are also exploring other technologies, including Cellular V2X,\u201d she said in an email.The federal government also has authority over a crucial element of any system: the radio frequency on which it operates. Two members of the Federal Communications Commission recently informed Toyota that the agency was looking at \u201cnewer technology\u201d \u2014 such as C-V2X \u2014 for the 5.9-gigahertz band that has been allocated to DSRC.\u201cBy taking a modern look at the possibilities for wireless services in the 5.9 GHz band, we can support automobile safety, increase spectrum for Wi-Fi and grow the wireless economy,\u201d they wrote in a letter to the carmaker.Car and equipment makers have conducted trials of C-V2X, but even its proponents acknowledge that it will take time to roll out, while DSRC is market ready. It\u2019s not just automakers that now have to wrestle with the choice: State transportation departments and many local authorities have been installing DSRC-compatible roadside infrastructure for almost a decade.In January, 12 state and regional transportation officials, including Mr. Steudle of Michigan, formed the Coalition for Safety Sooner to advocate the protection of the 5.9 GHz band for DSRC and the acceleration of efforts to deploy it.\u201cWaiting for the next technology solution to be developed, tested and proven misses a huge opportunity to potentially save tens of thousands of lives throughout the United States each year,\u201d they wrote.The institute helped with one of the first and largest tests of DSRC technology in Ann Arbor, Mich., involving some 3,000 vehicles. Based in part on that experience, Michigan officials require DSRC-compatible hardware in every new traffic signal in the state.Mr. Steudle, the Michigan transportation director, said the federal government ought to get involved.\u201cThey should take a direction, as opposed to saying they\u2019re agnostic to technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we got into this mess we have today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon.If competitors tremble at Amazon\u2019s ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon\u2019s customers, it is safe to say, spend much time thinking they need to be protected from it.Amazon has more revenue than Facebook, Google and Twitter put together, but it has largely escaped sustained examination.

Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, she presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the economy.Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share.

That popularity has rocked the antitrust establishment, and is making an unlikely celebrity of Ms. Khan in the corridors of Washington.She has her own critics now: Several leading scholars have found fault with Ms. Khan\u2019s proposals to revive and expand antitrust, and some have tried to dismiss her paper with the mocking label \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201d Unwilling or perhaps unable to accept that a woman wrote a breakthrough legal text, they keep talking about bearded dudes.\u201cAs consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.\u201dAt the S.M.U. library in Dallas, Ms. Khan was finding that vocabulary. These dead books, many from an era that predated the price-based era of monopoly law, were an influence and an inspiration. She was planning to expand her essay into a book, she said in an interview here in June.Then her life shifted, and she abruptly went from an outsider proposing reform to an insider formulating policy. Rohit Chopra, a new Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, pulled her in as a temporary adviser in July, at a time when urgent questions about privacy, data, competition and antitrust were suddenly in the air. The F.T.C. is holding a series of hearings this fall, the first of their type since 1995, on whether a changing economy requires changing enforcement attitudes.\u201cIdeas and assumptions that it was heretical to question are now openly being contested,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it.\u201dGenuinely original voices are rare in Washington policy circles, and Mr. Chopra is pleased to have Ms. Khan in his camp. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to come across a legal prodigy like Lina Khan,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing about her career is typical. You don\u2019t see many law students publish groundbreaking legal research, or research that had such a deep impact so quickly.\u201d\u201cIt takes time to crush men who are pursuing legitimate trade. But one of Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s most impressive characteristics is patience. \u2026 He was like a general who, besieging a city surrounded by fortified hills, views from a balloon the whole great field, and sees how, this point taken, that must fall; this hill reached, that fort is commanded. And nothing was too small: the corner grocery in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipeline. Nothing, for little things grow.\u201dWhen Ms. Khan read that, she thought: Jeff Bezos.Her Yale Law Journal paper argued that monopoly regulators who focus on consumer prices are thinking too short-term. In Ms. Khan\u2019s view, a company like Amazon \u2014 one that sells things, competes against others selling things, and owns the platform where the deals are done \u2014 has an inherent advantage that undermines fair competition.\u201cThe long-term interests of consumers include product quality, variety and innovation \u2014 factors best promoted through both a robust competitive process and open markets,\u201d she wrote.The issue Ms. Khan\u2019s article really brought to the fore is this: Do we trust Amazon, or any large company, to create our future? In think tanks and universities, the battle has been joined.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that antitrust enforcement has gotten far too weak,\u201d said Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan scholar who doesn\u2019t agree with Ms. Khan but credits her with opening up a much-needed debate. \u201cIt\u2019s a bridge much further to say we should go back to the populist goal of leveling playing fields and checking \u2018bigness.\u2019 \u201dThe analogies with Amazon are explicit. Don\u2019t let the government pursue Amazon the way it pursued A.&P., Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein warned.\u201cAmazon has added hundreds of billions of dollars of value to the U.S. economy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is a brilliant innovator\u201d whose \u201cbreakthroughs have in turn helped launch new waves of innovation across retail and technology sectors, to the great benefit of consumers.\u201dAmazon itself could not have made the argument any better. Which isn\u2019t surprising, because in a footnote on the first page, the authors noted: \u201cWe approached Amazon Inc. for funding to tell the story\u201d of A.&P., \u201cand we gratefully acknowledge its support.\u201d They added at the end of footnote 85: \u201cThe authors have advised Amazon on a variety of antitrust issues.\u201dAmazon declined to say how much its support came to in dollars. It also declined to comment on Ms. Khan or her paper directly, but issued a statement.\u201cWe operate in a diverse range of businesses, from retail and entertainment to consumer electronics and technology services, and we have intense and well-established competition in each of these areas,\u201d the company said. \u201cRetail is our largest business today and we represent less than 1 percent of global retail.\u201dHer father was a management consultant; her mother an executive in information services. Ms. Khan went to Williams College, where she wrote a thesis on the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. She was the editor of the student paper but worked hard at everything.\u201cWe were routinely emailing each other on separate floors of the library as it was closing at 2 a.m.,\u201d said Amanda Korman, a classmate.Like many a wonkish youth, Ms. Khan headed to Washington after graduating in 2010, applying for a position at the left-leaning New America Foundation. Barry Lynn, who headed the organization\u2019s Open Markets antimonopoly initiative, seized on her application. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to teach public policy to people who already know how to write than teach writing to public policy experts,\u201d said Mr. Lynn, a former journalist.Ms. Khan wrote about industry consolidation and monopolistic practices for Washington publications that specialize in policy, went to Yale Law School, published her Amazon paper and then came back to Washington last year, just as interest was starting to swell in her work.\u201cPolls show huge concerns about concentrated power, corporate power, but if people are asked, \u2018Do we have a monopoly problem?\u2019 they answer, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Lynn. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the language for it.\u201d\u201cThe whole country has been struggling to understand why the economy is not operating in the right way,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said. \u201cWages have remained stagnant. Workers have less and less power. All we\u2019re trying to do is create a level playing field, and that\u2019s harder when you have megacompanies that make it virtually impossible for small competitors.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning of solutions to this.\u201dSomewhere in the midst of all this, Ms. Khan found the time to marry Shah Ali, a doctor now doing a cardiology fellowship in Dallas, which explains why she was camping out at the S.M.U. law library. The honeymoon was in Hawaii. Dr. Ali took Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPersuasion,\u201d because he hadn\u2019t reread it in a while. Ms. Khan brought a book on corporations and American democracy.The battle for intellectual supremacy takes place less these days in learned journals and more on social media, where tongues are sharp and branding is all. This is not Ms. Khan\u2019s strong suit. She is always polite, even on Twitter. One consequence is that she didn\u2019t give much thought about what to call the movement to reboot antitrust. Neither did anyone else.\u201cAntitrust Hipsterism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything old is cool again.\u201dMr. Medvedovsky, who calls Ms. Khan\u2019s article \u201cthe face of this movement,\u201d said the term was designed to be \u201cplayful rather than pejorative.\u201dAdmirers of Ms. Khan and her fellow reformers have sometimes called them the New Brandeis School or the New Brandeisians, after Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era foe of big business. As brands go, these are somewhat less catchy than \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201dThe Hipster issue was sponsored by Facebook, another sign that Big Tech is striving to shape the monopoly-law debate. The company declined to comment.Things are moving fast, so there is a lot to write papers about.Contemporary antitrust regulation, the commissioner wrote, is conducted in the courts, which makes it numbingly slow and dependent on high-paid expert witnesses. He called for the agency to use its authority to issue rules that would \u201cadvance clarity and certainty\u201d about what is, and what is not, an unfair method of competition.These rules would not be \u201csome inflexible prescription\u201d but standards, guidelines, pointers or presumptions, he wrote. Since everyone affected by a proposed rule would have the opportunity to weigh in on it, the process would be more democratic.There is more than an echo here of Ms. Khan\u2019s notion that the past can help rescue the future.\u201cThese are new technologies and new business models,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cThe remedy is new thinking that is informed by traditional principles.\u201dMs. Khan was not the first to criticize Amazon, and she said the company was not really her target anyway. \u201cAmazon is not the problem \u2014 the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon depicts that in an elegant way,\u201d she said.From Amazon\u2019s point of view, however, it is a problem indeed that Ms. Khan concludes in the Yale paper that regulating parts of the company like a utility \u201ccould make sense.\u201d She also said it \u201ccould make sense\u201d to treat Amazon\u2019s e-commerce operation like a bridge, highway, port, power grid or telephone network \u2014 all of which are required to allow access to their infrastructure on a nondiscriminatory basis.Ms. Khan put those ideas out there, which is how Rachel Tsuna found them.Last fall, the Barnard College senior was casting about for a subject for her senior thesis. \u201cWhat is really interesting to you?\u201d her adviser asked. Ms. Tsuna, now 22, had worked for a chewing gum start-up \u2014 yes, there are such things \u2014 that sold through Amazon, and knew firsthand the retailer\u2019s tight grip. \u201cAmazon is scary!\u201d she exclaimed.This impulsive declaration suggested a topic: Did the F.T.C. have the grounds to move against Amazon? Ms. Tsuna made little progress until she came across Ms. Khan\u2019s paper.\u201cI finally felt like I was pursuing something valid,\u201d Ms. Tsuna said. \u201cLina Khan gave me the confidence I needed.\u201d The thesis, which is quite fair to Amazon, got an A minus.That\u2019s the way movements begin. Little things grow.\u201cThis is a moment in time that invites a movement,\u201d said Ms. Khan. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than antitrust, bigger than Big Tech. It\u2019s about whether the laws serve democratic ends.\u201dIt was late at night in late July, and she was eating a burrata concoction at a popular restaurant near the Washington apartment she uses when not in Texas with her husband. After the death of Judge Reinhardt, her options opened up. She had the Columbia fellowship. Maybe she would also write the book. Or go back to the F.T.C. full time. Or somehow do it all.\u201cAmazon is a monopoly, and I worry that it monopolizes Lina,\u201d said her husband, Dr. Ali. \u201cI learn about what she is doing from looking at her Twitter feed.\u201d\u201cI throw myself into things,\u201d Ms. Khan agreed. \u201cMy life is spread out now.\u201dWith some cajoling, she revealed her Amazon account. There were just three purchases in 18 months. An altimeter for her father, who has taken up hiking, is the only one she will agree to have mentioned, although the other two are incredibly benign. One attribute Ms. Khan shares with Amazon is a strong desire to control the flow of information.Balancing the attention and the achievement, the expectations and the demands, is difficult, perhaps impossible.\u201cI don\u2019t think of my work in grandiose terms. I feel an urgency but I\u2019m also wary of hubris,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cNobody has been expecting this to succeed. I\u2019m awed by the challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Opposing Trump on Trade Face Election Quandary", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany party leaders in Washington like tax cuts but dislike tariffs. Few Americans share that combination of views.Top Republicans in Congress love Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, but they do not love the tariffs that have become the centerpiece of his trade policy. This combination is a classic conservative position that favors low taxes, whether on income or on imports. Few Americans outside Washington share that view.Not even one in 10 American voters in the survey expressed support for the tax cuts while opposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 the stated preference of Republican leaders including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.That leaves Republican congressional hopefuls with few safe options. Candidates who embrace Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies risk turning off independent voters, as well as the business leaders who are a key part of the Republican donor base. But bucking Mr. Trump could alienate many Republicans.The results could help explain why congressional Republicans have done little to block Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, beyond condemning them in news releases and interviews. They suggest that trade has become a proxy question for support of Mr. Trump, like so many other policy issues.\u201cIt\u2019s a significant problem for elected Republicans, since they are almost universally free traders,\u201d said Tony Fratto, a former Bush administration official who is now a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies, a public affairs consulting firm in Washington. \u201cTrump\u2019s protectionism is putting Republican members out of step with both their president and their base. That\u2019s a tough place to be.\u201dThe awkwardness starts at the top for congressional Republicans. Mr. Ryan, for example, has been one of the loudest cheerleaders for the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that Republicans sped through Congress late last year, and has frequently praised Mr. Trump for them. He criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs when they were announced. \u201cThere are better ways to help American workers and consumers,\u201d Mr. Ryan said in May, after Mr. Trump allowed the tariffs to hit imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union. \u201cI intend to keep working with the president on those better options.\u201d But to the chagrin of some Washington conservatives, Republican voters nationwide support Mr. Trump just as strongly on trade as they do on taxes \u2014 and they say trade will be a bigger factor in their midterm vote. Among registered voters, 80 percent of Republicans support Mr. Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, compared with 84 percent who support the tax cuts. Nearly two-thirds of them say that the North American Free Trade Agreement has been bad for the American economy.Those numbers might not be a sign of a philosophical shift against trade, said Mattie Duppler, senior fellow for fiscal policy for the conservative National Taxpayers Union. \u201cIn some sense, Republicans have broadly accepted that we\u2019re taking a new, unorthodox approach on trade,\u201d she said. \u201cNot because we\u2019ve abandoned traditional conservatives, but because what we were doing in the past wasn\u2019t working.\u201dStill, traditional pro-trade Republicans in swing congressional districts appear to be walking a difficult line with the base supporters whose turnout in November is essential to Republican efforts to hold the House and the Senate. Republicans don\u2019t want candidates to ignore economic policy: A plurality \u2014 33 percent \u2014 rate the economy as the most important issue this year.At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s policies are galvanizing Democrats in opposition. Eighty-five percent of them oppose the tax law, with more than half of them opposing it strongly. Eighty percent oppose the steel and aluminum tariffs, and 84 percent say Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies make them less likely to vote Republican. Nearly three-quarters say that Nafta has been good for the economy. Perhaps most concerning for Republicans, Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies are even less popular among independents who live in competitive congressional districts, the polling shows. But as Ms. Duppler notes, it could be difficult for more populist Democrats to court those voters on trade grounds. \u201cDemocrats,\u201d she said, \u201csounded for a long time on trade like President Trump sounds now.\u201dMany Republican leaders have tried to paper over trade issues and focus on economic performance, including faster growth and low unemployment, in hopes that voters will give them credit for an improving economy. There, too, the polling suggests difficulty ahead. Unlike Republicans, independents don\u2019t feel great about the economy. Only 29 percent of independents say they\u2019re better off financially than they were a year ago. Looking ahead, 35 percent say they\u2019ll be better off a year from now.And independents who are following the election closely feel worse about the economy, on average, than those who are paying less attention.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Trump\u2019s Name Could Be Hurting His N.Y.C. Golf Course and Other City Concessions", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Central Park Tours leads groups to the ice skating rink on the south side of Central Park, they reach a point where big red letters spell out the name of the facility\u2019s operator: \u201cTrump.\u201d\u201cWe say, \u2018Hey guys, you want to stop for pictures?\u2019 And they are like, \u2018No, no, no, let\u2019s keep going,\u2019\u201d said Teodor Panterov, the tour company\u2019s president.The number of visitors to New York City has broken records every year since 2010, and the economy is steaming ahead. But business is not thriving at the four concessions in New York City operated by the Trump Organization: a golf course, a carousel and two ice skating rinks.At each, sales have dropped or been flat since President Trump\u2019s political rise, according to interviews and an analysis of city records.The Trump Organization attributed any dips suffered by these outdoor attractions to bad weather. And it emphasized that it had invested many millions of dollars in improving the facilities, which are owned by the city.\u201cThere is no connection to politics and usership at our facilities here in N.Y.C,\u201d said Ronald C. Lieberman, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization.But tour operators and others involved with the concessions suggested that Mr. Trump\u2019s deep unpopularity in his native city was having an impact.Christopher Brown, a golfer who works at the Golf Club at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, won\u2019t set foot at Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, the city-owned golf course the Trump Organization runs in the Bronx.\u201cHe being who he is, why would you give your money to him?\u201d Mr. Brown asked.From roughly April to June of 2018, the Trump course grossed just under $2.3 million, according to the most recent city data available. Three years ago, the course grossed over $1 million more for the same period.The course looks out over the Whitestone Bridge, which spans the East River between the Bronx and Queens.How the city\u2019s concession agreements are structured depends on the facility. For some, the Trump Organization pays rent; for others, there is a revenue-sharing agreement.Attendance at the golf course might also have been affected because the Trump Organization has not yet made good on its promises to complete the clubhouse there. Nearly three months ago, the president\u2019s sons Donald Jr. and Eric Trump presided over a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the $13 million building. They were joined by golf greats who touched down in a Trump-branded helicopter.But the clubhouse hasn\u2019t opened yet, the interior still raw in places.The Trump Organization said that while overall attendance was down, so-called resident rounds \u2014 rounds of golf booked by people who reside in the five boroughs \u2014 were up this year.Those resident rounds rose less than 2 percent.The Trump Organization\u2019s two city skating rinks \u2014 Wollman Rink and Lasker Rink, both in Central Park \u2014 seemed to be prospering in the winter of 2015-2016.But the following year, revenue dropped 5 percent, following Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign for the presidency and election victory.Matt Falber of Central Park Sunset Tours said a fight once broke out between two visitors over Mr. Trump. As a result, he has sometimes added a warning before bringing groups to the Wollman Rink, as well as to the carousel, which is also run by the Trump Organization.\u201cPeople would laugh and I would say, \u2018You think I am joking?\u2019\u201d Mr. Falber said.The carousel in Central Park has been operated by the Trump Organization since 2011, when the \u201cTrump Organization implemented significant changes and received tremendous praise for returning the famed carousel to its original grandeur,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s website.For the year beginning May 1, 2017, the Trump Organization turned a profit of just over $30,000 on the carousel, a sharp decline from over $188,000 profit two years earlier, according to city data.Although the antique attraction is technically called the Michael Friedsam Memorial Carousel, for a time the name \u201cTrump Carousel\u201d was on at least one sign.Last May, the sign was taken down and replaced, the word \u201cTrump\u201d swapped with a tiny picture of a horse.Following Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea in federal court, Mayor de Blasio has asked city lawyers to determine whether the case could allow the city to void the Trump Organization\u2019s licenses to run the four city-owned facilities.\u201cWe are monitoring these events to determine whether or not they provide grounds to take action,\u201d said Natalie Grybauskas, a spokeswoman for the mayor.This is the second time that the mayor has asked whether the agreements with the Trump Organization could be severed.In 2015, after Mr. Trump made derogatory comments about Latinos, Mr. de Blasio tried to terminate the licenses. But city lawyers said that was not possible because of First Amendment protections for Mr. Trump\u2019s speech.But the renewed push comes on the heels of new information. Contained within the city contract documents is a name that has suddenly garnered attention: Allen Weisselberg, the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization.\u201cThe fact that his C.F.O., the guy named on the contracts, has taken immunity, is a big red flag for doing business with the city,\u201d said Adrian Benepe, who was the city\u2019s parks commissioner when the Trump Organization became the operator for the Bronx golf course.The Trump Organization criticized the de Blasio administration\u2019s approach.\u201cWe are and have been in complete compliance with all our contracts with New York City, in fact we view that as rather absurd,\u201d said Mr. Lieberman, the Trump Organization executive, about the mayor\u2019s new push.\u201cWe have been a terrific partner for New York City, we have been very proud to be associated with these incredible, iconic properties, and we look forward to continuing our relationship,\u201d he said.But some legal experts said the city was unlikely to be successful.\u201cThe city does have rules about allowing the city to decide not to contract with people who don\u2019t pay their taxes or who are convicted of bid-rigging or things of that kind,\u201d said Ross Sandler, director of the Center for New York City Law at New York Law School. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s really related to anything other than \u2018We don\u2019t like Donald Trump.\u2019\u201dThough there are clauses in the license agreements that entitle the city to terminate at will, they also contain language that forbids \u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201ccapricious\u201d reasons for cancellation.\u201c\u2018We don\u2019t like the person or their politics,\u2019 would be arbitrary and capricious,\u201d Mr. Sandler said.In an earlier version of this article, a picture caption misidentified the location of Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point. It is in the Bronx, not Queens.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade War Escalates. Stock Markets Shrug. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors tuned out the latest escalation in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, with markets around the world climbing slightly as President Trump announced new tariffs on China and Beijing responded in kind.Stock markets in Japan, Germany and South Korea \u2014 where many companies\u2019 fortunes hinge on international trade \u2014 were all up. Even in China, where major equities markets had been down about 20 percent this year, the benchmark index in Shanghai closed almost 2 percent higher.In the United States, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose more than 0.5 percent, as American investors continued to see few signs that companies would be hurt by Chinese attempts to retaliate against Mr. Trump\u2019s confrontational stance on trade. In the latest tit-for-tat, the president said Monday that the United States was imposing tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports, and China responded by saying it was adding tariffs on $60 billion in American goods.Why are markets so sanguine about a trade war that could affect hundreds of billions of dollars in international commerce?One reason is that corporate profits in the United States have been booming \u2014 they were up more than 20 percent in the first two quarters of the year, compared to last year \u2014 thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts and a strong domestic economy. That makes an intensifying trade war much less scary.\u201cI think the bottom line is that the earnings have continued to accelerate,\u201d said Marc Pouey, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cIf the trade tension were to dissipate, it would help sentiment, but this market is being held up by fundamentals, which are very good.\u201dStock markets in the United States are beating their foreign counterparts. The Nasdaq index is up more than 15 percent this year. The S. & P. 500 is up 8.6 percent, even though the companies in the index generate about 38 percent of their sales outside the United States, according to the market data company FactSet.By contrast, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 is up only about 2.9 percent for the year, and France\u2019s CAC-40 \u2014 one of the best-performing large European stock markets \u2014 had eked out a gain of less than 1 percent.Some sectors of corporate America have lagged. Industrial companies in the S. & P. 500 \u2014 Boeing, Honeywell and 3M among them \u2014 are up only 4.7 percent for the year.Such companies are especially vulnerable to trade disputes. They consume large amounts of products like steel and aluminum, whose prices have jumped because of the administration\u2019s import tariffs. Some of these companies also do lots of business in China, where they may be subject to that country\u2019s tariffs, a general economic slowdown because of the trade war or both.\u201cChina, for sure, is impacting some of these stocks,\u201d said Anik Sen, global head of equities at asset manager PineBridge Investments. \u201cThese are the ones that have actually borne the brunt of this uncertainty.\u201dTariffs could knock 0.7 of a percentage point off China\u2019s annual economic growth, said Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China\u2019s securities regulator. But, he added, the Chinese government has the tools to cushion any impact. Mr. Fang was speaking on Tuesday at a World Economic Forum conference.Some analysts worry that Beijing may retaliate against the United States by weakening the value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, relative to the dollar. That would make Chinese products cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers, potentially blunting the higher costs that American tariffs would impose.The renminbi has weakened by more than 5 percent against the dollar this year, an unusual slide for a currency that does not trade freely and is carefully managed by Beijing. The daily exchange rate is set by the Chinese central bank and trades in a narrow band against the dollar.On Tuesday, the renminbi had lost a little more ground against the dollar.One big question hovering over the markets is whether the trade war has reached a plateau or will escalate further.Mr. Trump has long railed against what he says are China\u2019s unfair trading practices, and even as he announced the latest round of tariffs on Monday, he said he was willing to quickly add levies on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese imports if Beijing retaliated.Advertisement"}

Danske Bank said it suspected that some of its employees in Estonia may have helped those customers. At least eight bank employees have been reported to the police.

The Russian authorities also said they suspected \u201ccriminal activity in its pure form, including money laundering\u201d estimated at \u201cbillions of rubles monthly.\u201dAccording to the lawyer\u2019s report, however, \u201cDanske Bank missed this opportunity.\u201dIn 2013, JPMorgan, the Estonian branch\u2019s correspondent bank for clearing dollar transactions, ended the relationship because of the American lender\u2019s concerns with the nonresident portfolio. That prompted Danske Bank to start a review of its clients, but the review was never concluded.It was only when a whistle-blower raised concerns with executives in Copenhagen in December 2013 that the bank\u2019s board was warned. But it would take almost two years for the bank to get rid of suspicious clients, and a full inquiry did not begin until 2017. By then, the Estonian branch had become the hub of one of Europe\u2019s biggest money-laundering operations.In the meantime, the bank conducted what Bruun & Hjejle said were \u201cinsufficient\u201d investigations, whose findings were improperly reported or challenged by top management.Danske Bank said it did not know exactly how much money laundering had taken place. But Ole Spiermann, a partner at Bruun & Hjejle, said the firm expected \u201ca large proportion\u201d of about \u20ac200 billion that passed through the Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015 to be suspicious.\u201cIt\u2019s perhaps difficult for us in this room to understand,\u201d Mr. Spiermann said at the news conference, \u201cbut there was an understanding in the bank that they had this under control.\u201dThe fallout for Danske Bank has been considerable. Thomas F. Borgen, the lender\u2019s chief executive since 2013, said on Wednesday that he would resign, though he will stay in place until a replacement is hired. The authorities in Denmark, Estonia and the United States are investigating the misconduct. The bank\u2019s stock price has fallen about 30 percent this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will Saudi Arabia Cease to Be the Center of Islam?", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi Arabia, or the Arabian Peninsula before the formation of the modern kingdom, has been and remains a place both central and marginal to Muslims around the world.Mr. Devji teaches history at the University of Oxford.An Urdu novel published in 1869 by Nazir Ahmad, a writer in Delhi, portrays two young Muslim girls at their geography lesson. As they identify various countries on a map, the girls come across the Arabian Peninsula. Their teacher describes it as an empty space infested by marauding Bedouin, one whose only significance lay in its historical role as the site of Islam\u2019s birth. The monuments and institutions of Mecca and Medina, the birthplaces of Islam, had always been minor in architectural quality and financial endowment compared with the splendid mosques, tombs and seminaries found at the centers of Muslim power in Baghdad and Cairo, Istanbul and Isfahan, Delhi and Samarkand. Muslim kings rarely visited Mecca and Medina. Instead, those cities served as places of exile for their enemies.Saudi Arabia, or the Arabian Peninsula before the formation of the modern kingdom, has been and remains a place both central and marginal to Muslims around the world. Even as Mecca and Medina represent the most important sites of Muslim pilgrimage, the vision of the holy cities as remote and perilous is still reinforced by the occasional stampede of pilgrims during the Hajj.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has been moving fast to make his country a political and military power for the first time since its founding. He has engaged in a pitiless war with Yemen, imposed a blockade on Qatar and embraced increasingly aggressive positions toward Iran and other rivals. Whether or not Prince Mohammed\u2019s strategy succeeds, it will transform Saudi Arabia\u2019s religious status in the Muslim world. In the late 19th century, for the first time since the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s day, the Arabian Peninsula was placed at the center of Islam\u2019s modern geography as Ottoman power waned over the Middle East and British influence extended outward from its economic and military base in India.Mr. Blunt was among the first to make an argument that eventually redefined the geography of Islam by placing Arabia at its center. He argued that Istanbul and its Turkish emperor could never be true Muslim leaders, a role he saw as reserved for Arabs and their homeland. Istanbul, the capital of the only remaining Muslim power, had to be divested of its claim to the caliphate, and Islamic authority had to return to an Arabian Peninsula defended by the Royal Navy. And the British writer saw British India as crucial in the making of this new Muslim world centered on the Arabian Peninsula. Apart from India\u2019s large Muslim population, the country\u2019s armed forces, traders, laborers and pilgrims had become crucial to the security, economy and demography of Arabia even in Ottoman times. During this period Arabia was witnessing a consolidation of power through an alliance between the Wahhabi movement and the family of Ibn Saud, which led to the establishment of modern Saudi Arabia in 1932.But attitudes changed over time, and the Wahhabis came to be viewed more favorably in Muslim societies with weak or colonized elites well beyond Arabia. By the 20th century, the British themselves had got into the habit of admiring the Wahhabis and those who appeared to be their Indian followers, whom they saw as the Protestants of Islam out to destroy the decadence and superstition of their corrupt and Catholic coreligionists. The movement\u2019s Muslim admirers included both extreme conservatives and liberal modernizers who, like the English, saw Wahhabis as rationalists willing to break with the \u201cpopish\u201d authority of traditional religious authorities as well as of Muslim kings and return to the pure Islam of its Arab origins. When Britain decided to support Ibn Saud and his Wahhabi troops in the 1930s, Indian Muslims were prepared to welcome the creation of Saudi Arabia. The ground for this welcome had been laid once Istanbul, or for that matter Cairo or Baghdad, was replaced by Mecca and Medina not only at the geographical center of Islam but also as the historical models for an ideal Muslim society. The new geography of Islam was also a Protestant one, with Rome\u2019s decadence mirrored in Istanbul and forsaken for Geneva\u2019s austerities as found in Arabia\u2019s holy cities. At its birth, Saudi Arabia looked very much like Mr. Blunt\u2019s vision of it, the center of Islam protected by the Royal Navy and placed firmly in the camp of Christian powers. After World War I, the American Navy replaced the British, and oil turned the kingdom into a crucial resource for Western capitalism. But its religious and economic centrality was contradicted by Saudi Arabia's continuing political marginality, with Britain, the United States and even the Pakistani Army responsible for its internal stability and defense from external threats.Today, Saudi Arabia is ostensibly countering Iran, but its claims to dominance are also made possible by the decline of Egypt and the decimation of Iraq and Syria. Turkey remains its only and as yet ambiguous rival apart from Iran.What will the subordination of religious to secular if despotic authority mean for the geography of Islam? In the aftermath of World War I, when the Ottoman defeat placed Islam\u2019s sacred cities under indirect European control, Muslim thinkers debated the idea of neutralizing Mecca and Medina politically on the model of the Vatican or internationalizing them in the name of the world\u2019s Muslims. Iran still refers to the latter option when trying to prise the holy cities from the grasp of the Saudis. The project to make Saudi Arabia a politically rather than religiously defined state is likely to demolish the century-old vision of an Islamic geography, which has always been premised upon Arabia constituting its depoliticized center. Mecca and Medina will still receive their pilgrims, but Islam may finally assume a truly global form and dispense with a colonial cartography in which the Middle East enjoys pride of place despite containing a small minority of the world\u2019s Muslims. Islam would inevitably find itself at home in Asia, where by far the largest number of its followers live, and toward which global wealth and power are increasingly shifting.

Several hours later, firefighters were still working to put out the enormous fire.\u201cThe loss of the National Museum collection is incalculable for Brazil,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTwo hundred years of work, research and knowledge have been lost.\u201dThe museum, in a public park and now tied to the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, turned 200 years old in June. It is the oldest scientific institution in Brazil and has large natural history and anthropology collections.Luiz Fernando Dias, the museum\u2019s deputy director, told GloboNews in an interview on Sunday that the fire completely destroyed the compound.He said the museum had struggled to stay afloat financially for several years. The museum was due to get funding for a renovation from the Brazilian Development Bank, but part of the money would be made available only after a national election to replace the president in October.\u201cAll of this results in the destruction of the careers of about 90 researchers who dedicated their professional lives to that space,\u201d Mr. Dias said.Gaud\u00eancio Fidelis, a prominent Brazilian art curator, chided the government for what he called \u201cnegligence.\u201d\u201cThis is a crime that must be punished,\u201d he said in a statement posted on Facebook. \u201cSadness, consternation and indignation are feelings that I believe I share with many people who understand the significance of the knowledge that future generations will be deprived of.\u201dRoberto Bobadey, the general commander of the city\u2019s fire department, said firefighters managed to recover some items from the flames, but added that it was unclear how much may have been spared.\u201cMuseum officials will have to do an assessment later,\u201d he told Globo News in an interview.Ernesto Londo\u00f1o reported from Rio de Janeiro and Shasta Darlington from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

{"Headline": "U.K. Economy Needs Stronger Unions and Higher Taxes on Rich, Report Says", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBritain needs sweeping changes to redress its economic failings, rising inequality and the corrosive legacy of the financial crisis, according to a report from a committee that included the Most Rev. Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.The group outlined a 10-year plan for the sort of transformation experienced twice in Britain in the last century: once after the Second World War, when the state expanded its influence, and then in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher unleashed the free market to jolt the economy.Commissioned by the Institute for Public Policy Research, a British public policy institute, the report, \u201cProsperity & Justice: A Plan for the New Economy,\u201d landed just as Britain is grappling with its looming exit from the European Union, or Brexit, a move that has already slowed investment and dampened economic growth.Instead of focusing on Brexit itself, the document tried to tackle some of the factors that prompted the 2016 referendum and the resulting decision to quit the European Union. That vote, the report said, \u201cwas a stark repudiation of the status quo and crystallized profound feelings of economic injustice.\u201dSeveral of the report\u2019s conclusions are eye-catching, including calls for stronger trade unions and worker representation on company boards, for higher taxes on the wealthy and on large inheritances, and for greater regulation of giant social media companies.\u201cFor decades the U.K. economy has not worked as it should, with millions of people and many parts of the country receiving less than their fair share,\u201d said Archbishop Welby in a statement.\u201cThe widening gulf between rich and poor, and fears about the future among young people and their parents, have damaged our nation\u2019s sense of itself,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cachieving prosperity and justice together is not only a moral imperative \u2014 it is an economic one.\u201dThe committee included academics, business executives and a trade union leader as well as Archbishop Welby. He has spoken publicly on policy issues before, but his comments may rankle those who feel the church should stay away from the political arena.Over all, the report painted a bleak picture of the country\u2019s economic performance, arguing that \u201cit is impossible to escape a palpable feeling that the economy is not working for most people.\u201dThe report found that \u201cearnings that have been stagnant for a decade are combined with greater insecurity at work.\u201dIt added: \u201cYoung people have been hit particularly hard \u2014 many unable to afford a home of their own and on course to be poorer than their parents. Whole communities feel left behind. Many people feel powerless and fatalistic.\u201dMany of the proposals are likely to be welcomed by the opposition Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, which is calling for an increase in government spending, greater investment in industry and the nationalization of the railways and some other utilities.But Conservative Party politicians have also worried for years about low British productivity. When Prime Minister Theresa May came into power in 2016, she said she wanted to help families who were \u201cjust about managing,\u201d and to increase the representation of workers on company boards.Much of that agenda faded, however, after Mrs. May lost her parliamentary majority in last year\u2019s general election, and as she fights a bitter internal battle over her plans for Brexit.The report also called for a rebalancing of economic power from corporations to trade unions, greater devolution of political power away from London, moves to create more affordable housing and to combat house price inflation, higher taxes on the very wealthy and efforts to incentivize long-term investment over short-term profit.It urged greater use of robotics and automation alongside retraining for those whose jobs are lost.Among more than 70 recommendations are an increase in the minimum wage, higher pay for those on employment contracts that do not guarantee work and the inclusion of workers on boards of companies with 250 or more employees.Tax on corporations should be raised, and work and wealth should be taxed on an equal basis, the document suggested. It also proposed that the inheritance tax should be replaced with a lifetime gift tax, levied on recipients rather than estates.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Recovery Eludes Many Living Below Poverty Level, Census Suggests", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In July, President Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers declared that the country\u2019s five-decade war on poverty was largely over and called it a success.The supplemental poverty measure for 2017, widely regarded by economists as more accurate, was even higher, 13.9 percent in 2017, essentially unchanged from the year before. That is an improvement from the recent high of 16 percent recorded in 2013. But economists and advocates for poor people say the relatively modest gains over the last few years are fragile, endangered by the Trump administration\u2019s policies and vulnerable to a long-overdue economic downturn.\u201cIf this is the best we can do, it isn\u2019t good,\u201d said Timothy Smeeding, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies poverty and economic mobility.\u201cThings really tapered off this year, after a serious drop in previous years,\u201d he said. \u201cIn terms of the boom, the party has lasted a long time, a lot longer than we thought, but not everybody is getting invited \u2014 people who are working several jobs, taking jobs without benefits, kids who are growing up in poverty. The fruits of the recovery are not being spread around evenly.\u201dThe report comes as the Trump administration seeks to curtail safety net programs, in part by playing down the severity of poverty in the country. The White House, bolstering its case for program cuts and new work requirements for recipients of federal aid, has gone so far as to question the validity of the government\u2019s traditional calculations for poverty.In both of his budget blueprints, Mr. Trump has trimmed domestic spending on housing, education and food assistance. Such cuts have been restored by the Senate, but advocates say there is an overall bias in Washington against helping those in need that is hampering the recovery among low-income Americans.\u201cThere\u2019s a precariousness to the recovery and a fragility in the lives of poor people right now,\u201d said Olivia Golden, the executive director of the Center for Law and Social Policy, an advocacy organization based in Washington that opposed budget cuts.While Wednesday\u2019s report showed no statistically significant reduction in poverty during Mr. Trump\u2019s first year in office, the strengthening economy could usher in bigger improvements next year. The economy grew at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018, according to the Commerce Department, and average hourly wages in August increased 2.9 percent.Unemployment, now at 3.9 percent, has decreased significantly for all age, gender, racial and ethnic groups, and 1.7 million workers saw wage increases last year, according to the Census Bureau.But warning signs persist. Poverty rates among African-Americans and Hispanics have declined in recent years, but both remain above 20 percent, far outpacing the poverty rate of 9.8 percent for the white, non-Hispanic population.\u201cThe level of poverty for people with the lowest incomes seems to be on the uptick,\u201d said Jennifer Jones Austin, the chief executive of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, an anti-poverty advocacy group that represents 170 agencies operating in New York City. \u201cThe Trump administration says the war on poverty is over. That\u2019s not reality.\u201dThe Census Bureau\u2019s official poverty measure, calculated at 12.3 percent last year, is widely viewed as an outdated formula.Most economists consider the poverty number published concurrently in the supplemental report, which is 1.6 percentage points higher, to be a more precise measure because it factors in the cost of expenses like housing, child care and transportation, while estimating the positive effect of government benefits like Social Security, Medicaid and the earned-income tax credit.\u201cThere are problems, especially in the supplemental report, where a lot of income is underreported,\u201d said Bruce D. Meyer, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago who wrote the alternative study with James X. Sullivan, an economics professor at the University of Notre Dame.\u201cIt misses a lot of income,\u201d he said, including food stamps and tax credits, \u201cand doesn\u2019t capture things like the improvement in the quality of housing.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress and it\u2019s not reflected in those numbers,\u201d he added.David Brady, who runs a poverty research center at the University of California, Riverside, said the report on Wednesday undermined a chief contention of conservatives: that the wide availability of work would, by itself, eradicate poverty.Wages for low-income workers have not kept pace with the cost of living in high-expense states, including California, where rising housing costs have contributed to a 20 percent poverty rate that ranks the highest in the nation, Mr. Brody said. That has increased the need for safety net programs, especially housing assistance.The report illustrated the role of government support in keeping the rate from rising higher, citing income data showing that 27 million people \u201cwere taken out of poverty\u201d by Social Security benefits, with another 3.4 million Americans pushed above the threshold by federal food aid.\u201cThe stagnation in the poverty rate is bad news,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cIt means that a low unemployment rate alone hasn\u2019t solved the problem.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Why is the world standing by?Ms. Al-Shami is a writer and activist. The Syrian regime is determined to reconquer all of the territory it has lost. Aided by Russian bombers and Iranian troops, and emboldened by its success in terrorizing the populations of Ghouta and Daraa into submission, President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government is now preparing to attack Idlib, the last remaining province outside of his control. Idlib is home to some three million people, about half of them displaced, or forcibly evacuated, to the province from elsewhere. Many are crowded into unsanitary camps or sleeping in the open.The reconquest of Idlib would doubtless lead to the same consequences. The civil activism that operates in the light would be crushed, and promising democratic experiments would be eradicated, leaving extremists to flourish in the dark.The people of Idlib are aware that they will probably be abandoned to a fate similar to their countrymen in Daraa and Ghouta. Anger at their betrayal by the supposed democratic powers, already deeply rooted, is growing.

{"Headline": "The World Needs a Stronger E.U.", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGeorge J. Mitchell was a United States senator from Maine from 1980 to 1995 and served as Senate majority leader from 1989 to 1995.The horrific carnage of the wars that ravaged Europe in the 75 years before World War II is fast fading into ancient history. But the relative peace that has reigned since is not luck \u2014 it is the product of institutions and alliances painstakingly created in the aftermath of the great wars. These institutions, and in particular the formal bonds of friendship between the United States and Europe, remain as vital to global safety and stability today as they were six decades ago.After World War II, the Western democracies, led by the United States, helped Germany, Italy and Japan rebuild and become durable democracies. They created international institutions whose goals were peace, stability and prosperity: the United Nations, NATO, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and, crucially, the European Union. They sought to prevent a repeat of the past by promoting increased trade and collective security. They have been largely successful.The European Union\u2019s critics point to its deficiencies, some of which are serious and must be addressed. But the drawbacks are decisively outweighed by the expansion of individual freedom, stability, trade and prosperity that Europeans have enjoyed.It is in the interest of the European Union member states to confront and correct the union\u2019s shortcomings, not to end it. They must find a way to rein in its excesses and address the now-obvious gap created by entering into a monetary union without the necessary political underpinning. It won\u2019t be easy. But surely it is not beyond the grasp of a continent so rich in history, talent, material and moral resources.One of the first \u2014 and perhaps most important \u2014 steps in ensuring the continuance of the union is a smooth and successful Brexit. Despite their anger and frustration, union leaders should extend themselves in negotiations with Britain. A hard Brexit is in no one\u2019s interest, especially with respect to the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The union and British government have publicly promised that there will not be a hard border, and they must keep their promise. I believe that Brexit eventually will negatively impact the British economy, but the initial fallout could be to encourage other unhappy European nations to leave the union. A weakened and divided Europe would mean the loss of a valuable democratic ally for the United States in its dealings with large hostile powers and the massive upheaval that is likely to continue in Africa and Asia.Second, while I strongly support the continuation of the European Union, I also recognize that there is room for improvement. A central issue confronting the union remains one of identity.In 2013, the Dutch government came up with an alternative to the phrase \u201cever closer union,\u201d which is found in European Union treaties. It said the new standard should be \u201cEuropean where necessary, national where possible.\u201d That standard has to some extent taken hold, with the European Commission initiating a process of reviewing European Union legislation and repealing those laws that no longer serve a purpose.But this notion is difficult to apply when confronting the conflicts arising over monetary union and immigration. The massive challenge of dealing with millions of migrants from Asia and Africa has tested the very concept of unity. In the absence of a common policy, geography is decisive, and the burden falls heavily on the union members least able to bear it. Fears over immigration contributed to the Brexit vote and have led to continuing unease among other member states. At the same time, however, free movement of labor is important to economic growth in Europe, as it is in the United States.The fiscal crisis in Greece and the flood of migrants into Italy and other European Union countries have thrust this debate on the Europeans, and they must continue the debate, even intensify it. They must decide on their objective and then adjust their organization and its institutions and powers to that goal. A continuing mismatch between ends and means will complicate the union\u2019s future, and may even threaten its existence.The United States has a huge stake in the outcome. In little more than a year in office, President Trump unwisely has stalled a trade agreement with the European nations and has withdrawn from the Paris climate accord, the agreement with Iran on its nuclear program and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In addition, the president has sought to resolve trade disputes with China and European countries through tariffs, rather than through the trade-dispute mechanisms of the World Trade Organization.His recent trip to Europe was confusing, contentious and counterproductive, as he continued to criticize our friends and praise President Vladimir Putin of Russia. I respectfully but strongly disagree with Mr. Trump. Cooperative efforts with our historic allies are not harmful to American interests. To the contrary, these recent agreements and the post-World War II institutions have been beneficial to those who participated in them, including and especially the United States. Any American who thinks the world is unsafe now should contemplate a world in which there is no NATO, no European Union, no World Trade Organization, no U.N. In that world, constant trade wars could lead to real wars, and the United States, as the dominant power, invariably would be called upon to lead alone.Our ties with Europe predate the establishment of our country. We gained our independence from England by revolution, but we retained England\u2019s language, the spirit of its laws and many of its customs. Although our early relations were hostile, over time the two countries formed what remains a \u201cspecial relationship.\u201dAs our nation grew to settle a vast continent, we welcomed millions of immigrants from England, Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Poland, Scandinavia and many more. As a result, we share deep bonds of blood with Europe, not just legal relationships.While we compete in many ways, we should not think of Europeans primarily as adversaries. They also are our partners and our allies. Although they do not always agree with us, or even among themselves, for the most part they admire our country and share our values and interests. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that we do all we can \u2014 politically, economically, militarily and otherwise \u2014 to help the people of Europe remain democratic, united, free and prosperous.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Minimum Wage in U.S., $19, Approved for New York\u2019s Airport Workers", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor years, the three main airports that serve New York City have been the site of one of the country\u2019s biggest fights over the minimum wage. A Republican governor and airline companies were pitted against Democratic officials and labor leaders over how much to pay workers who clean planes, load luggage and perform many other duties.On Thursday, the campaign ended in victory for as many as 40,000 airport workers who are now on a path to earning at least $19 an hour, the highest minimum wage target set by any public agency in the country. The pay increase, which was approved unanimously by the commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, will raise the wages of tens of thousands of workers over the next five years.It will go well beyond the $15 minimum hourly wage that several cities have enacted and that New York State will adopt as the base wage for many workers at the end of the year. And it may add impetus to union-led campaigns to reverse the widening gap in incomes between rich and poor Americans even amid a robust economy.The vote by the Port Authority board came after several months of deliberation and years of pleading and pressure from unionized airport workers. The airlines that contract with the companies that employ many of the workers also complained about raising wages, arguing that such a move could ultimately force them to pass along the costs to travelers.The Port Authority operates three of the busiest airports in the country: La Guardia Airport and Kennedy International Airport in New York City and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. The staggered wage increase will apply to most workers at those airports, including baggage handlers, cabin cleaners and caterers.\u201cThis is going to be the highest targeted minimum wage anywhere in the country,\u201d said Hector J. Figueroa, president of 32BJ Service Employees International Union, which represents many of the workers. \u201cThat\u2019s a significant breakthrough.\u201dThe biggest beneficiaries will be workers at Newark Liberty Airport, some of whom have been earning significantly less than their counterparts at the New York airports, a remnant of a political divide between the two states.New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, endorsed the union-backed campaign for a higher minimum wage that has become known as the Fight for 15. But he ran into opposition from Chris Christie, the former Republican governor of New Jersey, with whom he shared control of the Port Authority.Mr. Christie\u2019s appointees to the agency\u2019s board blocked a proposal to set a higher base wage for the airlines and companies they hire to perform various services at the airports. That left the minimum wage at the airports at $10.45 an hour, well above New Jersey\u2019s statewide minimum wage of $8.60 an hour, but below the fast-rising minimum that Mr. Cuomo had pressed lawmakers in Albany to adopt.Under New York law, the workers at La Guardia and Kennedy Airports, like many other workers in the state, already earn at least $13 an hour. That floor will rise to $15 on Dec. 31, making New York one of the leaders in the movement toward much higher minimum wages. California and several cities around the country have adopted plans to gradually raise their minimums to $15 an hour. The federal minimum is $7.25 an hour.In what Port Authority officials said was a first for a New York governor, Mr. Cuomo traveled to Jersey City, N.J., where the agency\u2019s board was meeting, to urge the commissioners to approve the measure. \u201cIt\u2019s smart, it\u2019s right, it\u2019s fair and you will reap the benefits in dividends,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cuomo said.The opposition at the Port Authority began to dissolve this year after New Jersey voters elected Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, to succeed Mr. Christie, who campaigned on a promise to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage. But a vote on the proposal to raise the minimum for airport workers was postponed for several months after airlines challenged the Port Authority\u2019s power to mandate pay for private companies.In response, the agency produced a comprehensive \u201canalysis and justification\u201d that argued that the airports were plagued by high turnover that threatened to make the airports less safe and degrade the services provided to travelers. It cited the benefits other airports had realized after raising their minimum wages.\u201cLifting airport-workers\u2019 wages is now a tried and tested tool, widely used for responding to a recurring set of serious problems at airports around the United States \u2014 problems that now beset the Port Authority\u2019s airports, too,\u201d the document stated.Airlines for America, a trade group in Washington, countered that the agency\u2019s arguments for the wage increase were a \u201cgloss for social welfare policies\u201d and that it would amount to \u201csimply another cost to be borne by the passengers.\u201d After the vote, a spokesman for the group, declined to say whether it would mount a legal challenge to the decision.The Port Authority\u2019s chairman, Kevin O\u2019Toole, and its executive director, Rick Cotton, said they were comfortable that their action could withstand any legal challenges. \u201cIt is our anticipation that within 35 days, there\u2019ll be a minimum-wage increase,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Toole said.They noted that other airports have sustained wage increases in recent years. Indeed, airports have become a common battleground for unions. Seattle-Tacoma International adopted a $15 minimum wage five years ago. At Los Angeles International, workers must receive at least $13.75 an hour in cash and at least an additional $5.24 an hour in benefits or cash. Airport workers in Orlando and Denver also are pressing for $15 minimum wages.Mr. O\u2019Toole, a Republican who was appointed by Mr. Christie, has steadily supported the increase. But his predecessor, John J. Degnan, another appointee of Mr. Christie, was adamantly opposed to having the Port Authority dictate how private companies should pay their workers. Mr. Christie also opposed a statewide increase in the minimum wage, the opposite position Mr. Murphy has taken.The Port Authority resolution calls for its first step toward $19 an hour to occur on Nov. 1, followed by annual increases for the next four years. On Nov. 1, the minimum will rise to $13.60 an hour for workers at the two New York airports and to $12.45 an hour for workers at Newark Liberty.That impending bump of $2 an hour would be the biggest raise Yasmeen H. Holmes has received since she started working at Newark Liberty in 2004. Back then she was paid slightly more than $7 an hour and now she earns $10.45 an hour for managing the lines at security checkpoints in Terminal C, she said.Ms. Holmes, 37, said she often works two shifts a day, up to 16 hours in all, to help support her five children, aged 15 to 21, and one grandchild. \u201cI\u2019m getting tired,\u201d she said, adding that she hopes the raise will allow her to work a little less and spend more time with her family.\u201cI would love to have a vacation,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Trump\u2019s Trade War Mounts, China\u2019s Wall Street Allies Lose Clout", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew trade talks between the two governments are tentatively scheduled between Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Liu He, a Chinese vice premier, later this month in Washington. Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone\u2019s chief, has been playing a critical role in organizing them, say people familiar with the talks, who asked for anonymity because the process is sensitive.\u201cWhat\u2019s really surprising is that the connections that used to work, the formula that used to work, just don\u2019t work at this point,\u201d said Marshall W. Meyer, an emeritus professor of management at the Wharton School of Business.A worsening trade war could stymie that progress, and it hurt other foreign businesses as well. Lou Jiwei, China\u2019s former finance minister, said in a speech on Sunday that China could block exports of crucial components for Western supply chains if the trade war continued. Such a move would disrupt American businesses but would likely accelerate corporate efforts to shift factories away from China, and current Chinese officials haven\u2019t publicly discussed such a dramatic step.The financial sector\u2019s arguments have often found a sympathetic ear in Washington. Over the past two decades, China has emerged as a major global economic growth driver and as an important customer for many American companies, including Apple, Qualcomm and General Motors.But the Trump administration\u2019s trade hawks have so far prevailed against Wall Street-friendly voices of trade moderation, such as Mr. Mnuchin, a onetime Goldman Sachs executive. That is partly because the trade war hasn\u2019t shown President Trump much downside. His stance has won support from both parties. The United States economy shows few signs of trade-war damage, and markets continue to rise.Even if Republicans lose Congress in November\u2019s elections, the trade war will probably continue, said Robert B. Zoellick, a former United States trade representative. Only a slump in the markets might make him reconsider, Mr. Zoellick said.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to affect Trump,\u201d Mr. Zoellick said about November\u2019s elections. \u201cMarkets could.\u201dJPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, a onetime informal adviser to Mr. Trump, said last Wednesday in a speech that \u201cI\u2019m smarter than he is\u201d and that unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s, his personal wealth \u201cwasn\u2019t a gift from Daddy.\u201d Mr. Trump the next day called Mr. Dimon a \u201cnervous mess,\u201d and Mr. Dimon has since said he shouldn\u2019t have made the remarks. Others, like Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief, James Gorman, and the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, opposed Trump policies like his original travel and immigration ban.The Wall Street influence ran deep. Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street veteran, served as Treasury secretary under President Clinton and helped forge the consensus within the Clinton administration on how to bring China into the World Trade Organization. Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former Goldman Sachs executive with a high profile in China, served as President Bush\u2019s Treasury secretary.Mr. Schwarzman is working behind the scenes to get China and the United States talking again. He urged American officials to invite their Chinese counterparts to resume talks, according to the people familiar with the discussions.Last week, Mr. Mnuchin issued an invitation, which Chinese officials publicly greeted warmly. But Larry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser and another Wall Street veteran, suggested afterward that China had sought the invitation.The meeting in Beijing on Sunday \u2014 organized by Zhou Xiaochuan, China\u2019s former central banker, and John Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president \u2014 gave Wall Street a chance to press for more business from China. The bankers were planning to present Wall Street\u2019s wish list for more market access, including creating a more transparent process for financial firms to get operating licenses and expanding the services that American bank branches can offer.Because the meeting was called on short notice, top Wall Street executives didn\u2019t attend. Most sent a senior executive, like Franck Petitgas, head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s international business; John Waldron, president of Goldman Sachs; and Jon Gray, the No. 2 executive at Blackstone. Officials will pass suggestions to Mr. Liu, Mr. Xi\u2019s top economic adviser.Prospects are good that this type of outreach will help, said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator.\u201cTraditionally there have been these back channels, and one of the reasons why Beijing has put people like Liu He in these senior positions has been because they have such good relationships with Wall Street,\u201d said Ms. Cutler, who is vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.\u201cTo date, these back channels don\u2019t seem to be working in moving this administration towards a negotiated solution.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong, Kate Kelly from New York and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Nafta\u2019s Fate Hinges on a Four-Letter Word: Milk", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOTTAWA \u2014 For the seasonal salad at the popular Oz Kafe here, the shavings of Gouda cheese are a salty and delicious culinary accompaniment. To the United States, they are an element of an increasingly bitter trade dispute over dairy products, one that threatens to undermine its decades-long agreement with Canada.Canada\u2019s longstanding policy of managing its dairy supply with production quotas and high levies on imports has become a sticking point in negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement, one that risks scuttling a 25-year-old pact that has stitched together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States.President Trump has seized on the practice as unfair and insisted that he is willing to jettison Canada by the end of the week if it does not drop its dairy tariffs of 270 percent. On Tuesday, the chief trade negotiator for the United States, Robert E. Lighthizer, said Canada was \u201cnot making concessions in areas we think are essential\u201d including \u201cissues of dairy.\u201dBut the melee over milk is puzzling to many trade experts. The United States supports its dairy farmers with a complex price support system that is economically similar to Canada\u2019s system of supply management.And while American dairy farmers may want to sell more milk into Canada, trade observers say access to a relatively small sector of the agricultural economy is not worth jeopardizing a trade relationship that has become critical to industries across North America.\u201cOpening up Canada\u2019s very tiny dairy industry is a pretty tiny gain to risk blowing up the most advantageous trade agreement in history,\u201d said Tony Fratto, founder of Hamilton Place Strategies, a public affairs firm that advocates free trade. \u201cBut it won\u2019t make more than a dime\u2019s worth of difference to jobs and standards of living in either country. Try to fix these things? Sure. Blow up Nafta over them? That\u2019s crazy.\u201dCanada counters that the American government has its own price supports for dairy farmers that play to the United States\u2019 advantage.The United States, even with the high tariff structure on Canadian dairy products, still benefits from its trading relationship. It imports about $137 million worth of Canadian dairy products, compared with the $470 million it exports annually to Canada, according to Canadian officials.The United States is the top foreign supplier of cheese to Canada, with 25 percent market share in 2017. Canada was the 10th-largest cheese supplier to the United States that same year, with a market share of 2.9 percent.Other nondairy matters continue to impede the chances for a trilateral deal, including a disagreement over a culture exemption to Nafta that makes it hard for American media companies to buy Canadian ones, and issues around potential future tariffs on cars and car parts. Canada and the United States also continue to disagree over a mechanism that allows Nafta countries to challenge one another\u2019s antidumping and countervailing duty decisions outside the court system.Yet negotiators in Washington have latched on to dairy.Larry Kudlow, who leads the National Economic Council, told Fox Business Network last week that \u201cone of the big problems with Canada is a four-letter word, M-I-L-K, milk, O.K. That\u2019s all.\u201dFor Canada, the support for dairy producers, cheese makers, chicken ranchers and the like goes beyond simply economics. Dairy is to Quebec \u2014 the largest dairy-producing province in Canada \u2014 as ethanol is to Iowa: If you want to play in national politics, you don\u2019t go against the industry. This is especially true for liberals in the country who can struggle in prairie provinces; politicians cannot win nationwide without the support of the voters of Quebec.With provincial elections in Quebec on Monday, many trade analysts say Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada has little to gain from conceding on dairy beforehand.Cheese is also a matter of national pride. Menus like the one at Oz Kafe include the Canadian provenance of their cheese offerings, which have gained some international attention and led to a consensus among major parties in Canada that the current system must be preserved.\u201cCanada\u2019s supply management system has been in place for over 50 years,\u201d said Oliver Anderson, a spokesman for the Canadian agriculture minister. \u201cIt is designed to balance domestic dairy supply with consumer demand to prevent overproduction and help Canadian dairy producers weather difficult trends in the global market. The government of Canada will continue to defend Canada\u2019s dairy farmers and supply management system.\u201dLawmakers from dairy-producing states, including New York, have been pushing for more concessions from Canada. But many trade experts remain more concerned with keeping dairy relations smooth with Mexico, given that it is a bigger American customer.\u201cIn our membership, Priority No. 1 is to retain the Mexican market, because it is the largest in the world for U.S. dairy exports,\u201d said John Murphy, the senior vice president for international policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAnd Task 2 is to improve access to Canadian markets.\u201dTrade experts expect that the impasse over dairy products will eventually be worked out, but dairy producers in the United States are watching carefully and say a new Nafta deal must not come at the expense of their industry.\u201cBoth countries are digging in, but we are not the ones who have supply management,\u201d said Jaime Castaneda, senior vice president for trade policy at the National Milk Producers Federation and the U.S. Dairy Export Council. \u201cThe concessions have to come from Canada. They want to balance their market, but they cannot do it on the backs of American dairy farmers.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hits China With Tariffs on $200 Billion in Goods, Escalating Trade War", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, emboldened by America\u2019s economic strength and China\u2019s economic slowdown, escalated his trade war with Beijing on Monday, saying the United States would impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods and was prepared to tax all imports.Mr. Trump, in a statement released late Monday, showed no sign of backing down from the type of full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies that has rattled financial markets, saying he was prepared to \u201cimmediately\u201d place tariffs on another $267 billion worth of imports \u201cif China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries.\u201dThe tariffs on $200 billion worth of products comes on top of the $50 billion worth already taxed earlier this year, meaning nearly half of all Chinese imports into the United States will soon face levies. The next wave of tariffs, which are scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 24, will start at 10 percent before climbing to 25 percent on Jan. 1. The timing of the staggered increase will partially reduce the toll of price increases for holiday shoppers buying Chinese imports in the coming months.\u201cFor months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices, and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.\u201dWhite House officials said on Monday that China could win relief from the tariffs by acceding to the administration\u2019s trade demands, including allowing American companies greater access to the China market and dropping its requirement that American companies hand over valuable technology to Chinese partners. Officials said the United States would only continue trade negotiations if the Chinese were \u201cserious\u201d about giving ground on those issues.Economists warn the tariffs could chip away at economic growth in the United States. Morgan Stanley researchers estimate that the latest round could reduce economic growth in the United States this year by 0.1 percentage points, adding to another 0.1 percentage-point drag from tariffs currently in place. And the effects are likely to grow if China retaliates again, as it has threatened to do.The administration did remove roughly 300 product lines \u2014 and some individual products \u2014 from the list after companies objected. Among the items dropped are smart watches, Bluetooth devices, bike helmets, plastic gloves, high chairs, play pens and certain chemicals. But, in some cases, partial product lines will be taxed while other parts are not. For example, high tech network routers and smart watches share a product line, but under the United States trade representative plan, the routers would be subject to tariffs while watches are not.\u201cIt will be a lot of money coming into the coffers of the United States of America. A lot of money coming in,\u201d Mr. Trump said during remarks at the White House on Monday. He added that the United States cannot tolerate the trade gap between what it exports to China and what it imports from that country.\u201cWe can\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision is a significant escalation of an already serious trade dispute \u2014 one with seemingly no end in sight. After months of failed trade talks, top officials from China and the United States were tentatively scheduled to talk later this month in Washington. But it is unclear whether Beijing will agree to come to Washington with the new tariffs set to go into effect.\u201cWe are open to talk if there are serious talks,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview on Monday.Mr. Trump also indicated he was willing to end the trade war \u2014 if China agreed to his demands. \u201cChina has had many opportunities to fully address our concerns,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese are livid and drafting their own battle plan \u2014 they won\u2019t take this sitting down,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a longtime lawyer in Beijing and the former four-time chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce there.Trade analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s approach risked further confrontation with the Chinese.\u201cWashington\u2019s view seems to be that tariffs and threats of more tariffs will soften up the Chinese and make them more amenable to negotiations,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell economist who specializes in trade issues. \u201cThe evidence that, in response to U.S. bullying tactics, China just stiffens its spine and strikes back with proportionate tariffs against U.S. imports has had no discernible effect on the Trump administration\u2019s take-no-prisoners approach to this rapidly escalating trade war.\u201dChina is expected to further retaliate against the United States, and top officials have warned that could include penalizing American companies that rely on Chinese components for phones, cars, televisions and other products. China\u2019s commerce ministry has said that it is ready to put similar tariffs on $60 billion a year of American goods in response to the threat from the United States. China has matched previous tariff moves dollar for dollar, but the number of American goods to tax is dwindling because, for many years, it has only imported about a quarter as much as it exports to the United States.Lou Jiwei, China\u2019s finance minister until his recent retirement and now a senior Communist Party adviser, delivered an unexpectedly strong threat to the United States in a lunch speech at the forum, which is organized by a government agency reporting directly to the cabinet. Mr. Lou said that, if necessary in the trade war, China could halt exports to the United States of components that are crucial to American companies\u2019 supply chains.Mr. Lou said that it would take years for American companies to find alternatives to China. \u201cTo take a step back, the United States can establish an alternative supply chain in a third country, but it takes time \u2014 what about the pain of three to five years? This is enough to cross a political cycle,\u201d he said.The battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.American businesses \u2014 which have warned that tariffs could hurt profits, force job cuts and, in some cases, destroy companies, said the taxes were going to hurt the United States more than the administration realized. The National Association of Chemical Distributors released a study this month that predicted nearly 28,000 chemical distributor and supplier jobs would be eliminated because of higher prices from the $200 billion round of tariffs.The tech industry, while spared on certain products, called the administration\u2019s approach \u201cmisguided\u201d and said it would hurt American consumers while doing little to change China\u2019s trade practices.\u201cToday\u2019s retaliatory tariffs are not an effective trade policy and may violate U.S. law,\u201d Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the administration to reconsider its misguided approach of increasing tariffs, as they are directly paid for by American companies and consumers.\u201dThe total wave of tariffs thus far has not been large enough to meaningfully affect consumer prices broadly across the economy \u2014 only narrowly, for certain products. Economists warn that the effects could grow noticeably larger if Mr. Trump follows through with his threat to subject nearly all Chinese imports to tariffs.Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets in the morning, regarding the lack of an impact on prices across the economy from tariffs, Mr. Kudlow stuck with the president. \u201cWith respect to the impact of tariffs, we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re following it. We don\u2019t see any problems so far.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to believe at the present time that the president\u2019s trade reforms are going to damage the economy.\u201dThe Trump administration has demanded steep cuts in Chinese tariffs and investment restrictions but has particularly focused on stopping the Chinese industrial policy initiative known as Made in China 2025.Chinese policymakers have long said that they are willing to cut tariffs in particular, but want concessions from the United States, such as curbs on the Commerce Department\u2019s ability to impose steep tariffs on imported goods that are government subsidized or are dumped below the cost of producing them. The United States has long refused, under the Obama administration and now under the Trump administration, contending that the American market is already so open that further concessions are not needed.As for Made in China 2025, Chinese officials dismiss its importance. \u201cWe do not think this is such an important strategy for us or our industries,\u201d said Wang Yiming, a vice president of the Chinese cabinet\u2019s Development Research Center.Chinese officials have expressed a willingness to get rid of the Made in China 2025 name, but they have been much more cautious about accepting limits on some of the key features of Chinese industrial policy, like enormous loans from state-owned banks at very low interest rates to favored industries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea Stages Huge Military Parade \u2014 Without Its ICBMs", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Columns of goose-stepping soldiers and artillery vehicles rolled through a main plaza in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, on Sunday, as the country celebrated the 70th anniversary of its founding with a large military parade notable for one conspicuous absence: its long-range ballistic missiles.For weeks, outside analysts had been scrutinizing satellite imagery of North Korea\u2019s preparations for Sunday\u2019s festivities. If the North decided not to showcase its ICBMs, they said, it could be counted as a sign that North Korea was serious about its negotiations with Washington.President Trump praised the absence of the ICBMs in a Twitter post on Sunday morning. \u201cNorth Korea has just staged their parade, celebrating 70th anniversary of founding, without the customary display of nuclear missiles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a big and very positive statement from North Korea. Thank you To Chairman Kim.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere is nothing like good dialogue from two people that like each other!\u201dThe missiles on display were fewer in number and short in range. Nearly half the parade was composed of civilian groups, like nurses and construction workers, marching with colorful floats that swore loyalty to Mr. Kim and to his new policy aim of economic growth. Largely gone were explicit anti-American slogans (though some tanks still bore old ones that called for the \u201cextermination of American imperialist invaders\u201d). Replacing them were exhortations for building \u201ca strong socialist economy.\u201d\u201cBy keeping ICBMs out, Kim Jong-un showed that he did not want to antagonize President Trump,\u201d said Kim Yong-hyun, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea. \u201cThe composition of the parade appears to reflect Kim Jong-un\u2019s focus on dialogue and economic development.\u201dMr. Trump has repeatedly urged China to help rein in its Communist neighbor\u2019s nuclear weapons program. If North Korea had paraded its ICBMs this time, it could have created a major embarrassment for Beijing and fueled Mr. Trump\u2019s charge that China is not doing enough to apply pressure.The North\u2019s ICBMs have been a leading source of tension with Washington, as Mr. Kim has accelerated their development and testing.The parade on Sunday reflected the new stance.Mr. Kim did not speak on Sunday, as he did in some of the past parades. Speaking in his stead, Kim Yong-nam, the head of the North Korean Parliament, emphasized the government\u2019s economic goals.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible how North Korea stays \u2018on brand\u2019 \u2014 last year\u2019s parade was all about nukes and this year it\u2019s all about the economy,\u201d Will Ripley, a CNN reporter, tweeted from Pyongyang.Mr. Ripley said that two North Koreans who participated in the parade had both told him that their country did not need to display ICBMs in the parade because it had achieved its nuclear goals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Say Trump Is Hurting Business by Limiting Legal Immigration", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration is using the country\u2019s vast and nearly opaque immigration bureaucracy to constrict the flow of foreign workers into the United States by throwing up new roadblocks to limit legal arrivals.The government is denying more work visas, asking applicants to provide additional information and delaying approvals more frequently than just a year earlier. Hospitals, hotels, technology companies and other businesses say they are now struggling to fill jobs with the foreign workers they need.With foreign hires missing, the employees who remain are being forced to pick up the slack. Seasonal industries like hotels and landscaping are having to turn down customers or provide fewer services. Corporate executives worry about the long-term impact of losing talented engineers and programmers to countries like Canada that are laying out the welcome mat for skilled foreigners.At Northwell Health\u2019s pathology lab on Long Island, a new doctor\u2019s cubicle stands empty, her computer and microscope untouched. Other residents started on July 1, but she is stuck in India\u2019s Punjab State, held up by unexplained delays in her visa.\u201cThere have been delays in processing that we have not felt before,\u201d said Dr. Andrew C. Yacht, chief academic officer at Northwell, which includes Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.Some lawmakers say Mr. Trump is using administrative means to reshape immigration policy because those changes have stalled on Capitol Hill.\u201cIf they want to have a proposal on immigration, they should send it to Congress,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Silicon Valley. \u201cThe administration should engage in that conversation. To unilaterally and without any accountability change what Congress has authorized is not democratic.\u201dIn practice, businesses say the increased red tape has made it harder to secure employment-based visas. That has added to the difficulty of finding qualified workers with the unemployment rate falling to 3.9 percent.A recent analysis of government data by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, found that the denial rate for H-1B visa petitions for skilled foreign workers had increased 41 percent in the last three months of the 2017 fiscal year, compared with the third quarter. Government requests for additional information for applications doubled in the fourth quarter, a few months after Mr. Trump issued his order.Experts say a sustained reduction in immigration could dampen growth over time as more baby boomers retire, leaving big gaps in the job market.That goes for high-skilled immigrants and low-skilled workers, said Francine D. Blau, an economist at Cornell. The latter will be vital in fields like elder care and child care, as well as construction and cleaning.\u201cA lot of our labor-force growth comes from immigrants and their children,\u201d Ms. Blau said. \u201cWithout them, we\u2019d suffer the problems associated with countries with an aging population, like Japan.\u201dThe Business Roundtable, a group of corporate leaders, recently challenged the Trump administration over changes that it says threaten the livelihoods of thousands of skilled foreign workers, and economic growth and competitiveness.In a statement, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services said the administration was \u201crelentlessly pursuing necessary immigration reforms that move toward a merit-based system.\u201d It added that all petitions and applications were handled \u201cfairly, efficiently, and effectively on a case-by-case basis.\u201dThe H-1B program, which was created to bring in foreigners with skills that business leaders argued would strengthen the economy, has long been a target for some politicians. The visa program has been criticized because corporations have exploited it to replace American workers.\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no research that supports the idea that cutting legal immigration is good for the economy,\u201d said Ethan Lewis, a Dartmouth economist.Hospitals in particular argue that they need foreign doctors who are more willing than native-born Americans to take jobs in less glamorous and lower-paying fields, like internal and family medicine. Of Northwell\u2019s 1,826 resident doctors, 165 came in under H1-B or J-1 student visas.Nearly one-third of pathology residents come from other countries, according to the National Resident Matching Program. But the number of overseas applicants in all specialties has dropped for two years in a row.\u201cThe administration\u2019s policies are having a chilling effect on the interest of international medical graduates coming to the United States to train,\u201d said Mona M. Signer, chief executive of the matching program.The missing Indian pathologist\u2019s workload at Northwell has been spread among 11 residents, lengthening the time they are on call.\u201cOur nation\u2019s ability to care for patients is dependent on international medical graduates,\u201d Dr. Yacht said.The effect of lower-skilled immigrants is more debatable. George J. Borjas, a Harvard economist, has found that an influx of such workers reduced the incomes of people without a high school degree between 3 and 5 percent.Giovanni Peri, an economist at the University of California, Davis, agrees that individual workers can be hurt by competition from lower-paid foreigners. But he said the overall effect on wages was modest. Immigration also tends to bolster the incomes of college-educated Americans.Mr. Peri points to what happened when the government deported between 400,000 and 500,000 Mexicans between 1929 and 1934, most of whom worked in agriculture and construction. With fewer people to work the fields, farm owners and agricultural businesses cut administrative, sales and clerical jobs because there was not enough to do.\u201cOut of eight or 10 positions held by Mexicans, maybe one or two were taken by Americans,\u201d Mr. Peri said. \u201cThe rest disappeared.\u201dRob Hurst is not concerned with the macroeconomics of immigration. He is just struggling to keep bathrooms clean.This summer, he has found himself on his hands and knees scrubbing toilets and tubs at Edgartown Commons, a hotel he manages on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Five Jamaican workers who had long worked at the property failed to get H2-B seasonal-work visas.\u201cI\u2019m 65 years old, but you got to do what you got to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did hire contract workers, but it\u2019s never going to be as good as people with years of experience.\u201dForeign workers are also growing frustrated about the clampdown on visas and rising anti-immigrant sentiment.Uday Verma is leaving after 12 years in Iowa, time he spent earning a graduate degree in computer science and working for a technology company.Mr. Verma, 37, who emigrated from India, has repeatedly renewed his H-1B visa while waiting fruitlessly for permanent resident status \u2014 also known as a green card. Had he been successful, he could have easily switched employers or started his own business.\u201cI can\u2019t make a plan here,\u201d Mr. Verma said. \u201cYou\u2019re perpetually in this state of limbo. It just doesn\u2019t make sense anymore to stay here and keep pursuing this American dream.\u201dMr. Verma, his wife and their 9-year-old son plan to be living in Toronto by the time their American visas expire in the second week of September.With experience with A.I. programming tools, Mr. Verma got a visa in two weeks, and could become a permanent resident in six months or so.His employer, Kira Systems, makes software that reads and analyzes legal contracts. The company has more than doubled its employment in the past year, to 115 people. Noah Waisberg, a co-founder and the chief executive, said half of Kira\u2019s technical staff was from China, India, Russia and other countries.Canada has long welcomed immigrants. \u201cBut that is even more so relative to the United States, given the climate in America now,\u201d Mr. Waisberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly helped us recruit.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s \u201chire American\u201d push is helping some domestic businesses. One of those is Nexient, which provides software services and competes with firms in India and elsewhere. Fearful of becoming too dependent on offshore firms, corporate customers are increasingly interested in having domestic partners, said Mark Orttung, Nexient\u2019s chief executive.\u201cYou still have to win the business, but it has been an accelerator for us,\u201d he said.Nexient is based in Newark, Calif., but its programmers are mainly in Michigan and Indiana. The start-up employs more than 500 people, up from 400 last year.About 10 percent of Nexient\u2019s employees have H-1B visas, typically engineers who have mastered old software systems and other niche technologies in corporate data centers.Those foreign workers are fielding more government requests for information and waiting longer for visa renewals, Mr. Orttung said. \u201cIt adds a great deal of uncertainty to the lives of some of our employees.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "8 Ways to Make Your Flight Better", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom scoring the best seat assignment to zipping past security lines: how to make air travel more tolerable.Whether traveling with a spouse or partner, children or solo, the most frequent of fliers know how to ease the pain points and maximize the joys. Below, a primer on how to make air travel more affordable, fun and comfortable so you can once again marvel at being able to soar. As many travelers know, one of the smartest ways to rack up miles is with a credit card that earns you points for the things you spend money on every day.Members can also use their card, points, or both, to book trips \u2014 airfare, hotels, rental cars \u2014 through Chase\u2019s Ultimate Rewards online portal. In August, Chase said it was improving Ultimate Rewards by partnering with Expedia, allowing card holders to use Expedia\u2019s inventory of flights, hotels and vacation rentals, car rentals, and experiences and activities. The new Ultimate Rewards has been rolled out to members of some Chase cards and will be available to Chase Sapphire users in the coming months.When it comes to using points you accrue, some of the biggest wins can be had by booking business or first class award tickets, often through international rather than United States carriers. You will need to find out which international airlines have relationships with your domestic carrier, sign up for the international carriers\u2019 frequent flier programs, and then get your ticket through whichever partner charges the fewest miles.Traveling internationally with an infant? Flying with a \u201clap infant\u201d (usually defined as under 2 years old), can still cost hundreds of dollars, even if you don\u2019t buy a seat for your baby, Ms. Hull said, because you are typically required to pay 10 to 25 percent of the adult fare. But some loyalty programs allow you to use miles for your infant\u2019s fare if the adult is also using miles for the trip. British Airways, for example, charges 10 percent of the miles that the adult award ticket costs, she said. Many credit cards with annual fees come with trip delay coverage \u2014 reimbursement for hotel rooms, meals and misplaced bags \u2014 that people often don\u2019t realize they have. If your flight is delayed a certain number of hours, or overnight, the issuers of these cards will provide several hundred dollars in expenses (for things like lodging and toiletries) for each purchased ticket. Such cards typically pay you for lost baggage as well.Airlines will rarely put you up in a hotel room, and even if they do, Mr. Leff said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay in the hotels they\u2019re offering.\u201d He goes online and books himself a hotel room instead, then sends the receipt, along with receipts for meals, taxis or ride-sharing, to his credit card company. A number of things are excluded from coverage, though, so read the fine print. In order to be reimbursed, you typically have to provide proof of your delay, along with receipts for related expenses. The process isn\u2019t always smooth. In some ways, it\u2019s \u201cno different than dealing with the cable company,\u201d said Mr. Leff. \u201cSo often people feel powerless in travel,\u201d Mr. Leff said. \u201cHaving a few of these tactics just changes that mind-set.\u201dHungry, but short on time before your flight? At some airports, food apps allow you to order a meal, snack or coffee and have it delivered to your departure gate, or elsewhere in the terminal. \u201cIf you travel with a family and don\u2019t yet have PreCheck,\u201d said Ms. Hull, \u201cyou just like being miserable.\u201d A number of rewards cards \u2014 Chase Sapphire Reserve, Citi Prestige and certain American Express cards, among them \u2014 offer statement credits to customers who charge the application fee ($100 for Global Entry; $85 for PreCheck, each for five years). Yet even if your card doesn\u2019t cover such fees, Ms. Hull said, it\u2019s less than $20 a year to avoid a longer, slower, domestic security line. \u201cKids 12 and under can piggyback with approved adults in the PreCheck line,\u201d she said (though they do need to get approved for Global Entry if traveling internationally).Flight delays and cancellations build up throughout the day, and as things get pushed back there\u2019s a risk flight crews will run out of allowable work hours. Want the best chance of taking off? Leave early.Given that some airports are outfitting their common spaces with pretty eateries, power outlets, table top tablets and children\u2019s play areas, hanging out in communal spaces can be more relaxing than a crowded domestic lounge with busted power outlets. Still, what you often get with an airline\u2019s domestic lounge is slightly better customer service, roomier bathrooms and free snacks.

They imposed obedience to corporate capitalism and globalization within academia and the press.\u201dHedges\u2019 indictment names names: \u201cSelf-identified liberals such as Bill and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama mouthed the words of liberal democratic values while making war on these values in the service of corporate power.\u201d Even liberal nonprofit organizations like MoveOn.org and the Sierra Club \u201care feeble appendages to a corporatized Democratic Party.\u201dHedges is a Harvard Divinity School graduate and an ordained Presbyterian minister. His ecclesiastical immersion shows. This passage is long but revealing of his mind-set:\u201cThe violence and commodification of human beings for profit are the quintessential expressions of global capitalism. Our corporate masters are pimps. We are all being debased and degraded, rendered impoverished and powerless, to service the cruel and lascivious demands of the corporate elite. And when they tire of us, or when we are no longer of use, we are discarded. If the United States accepts prostitution as legal and permissible in a civil society, as Germany has done, we will take one more collective step toward the global plantation being built by the powerful. The fight against prostitution is the fight against a dehumanizing corporate capitalism that begins, but will not end, with the subjugation of impoverished girls and women.\u201dInsofar as Hedges holds out any hope, it is through local community organizing and groups like Black Lives Matter. For the most part, however, the prospects for the country are bleak: \u201cThis moment in history marks the end of a long, sad tale of greed and murder by the white races. It is inevitable that for the final show we vomited up a figure like Trump.\u201dBoth righteous and self-righteous, Hedges is addicted to fire and brimstone. A Jeremiah preaching eternal damnation, he is adding to the already crowded shelf of American narratives of decline. His call springs not only from Jonathan Edwards and Cotton Mather but also from spoiled preachers like Jimmy Swaggart and James Bakker, and now from Donald Trump. It\u2019s a call that has echoed down through the ages: \u201cDrain the Swamp.\u201dThomas B. Edsall covered national politics for The Washington Post for 25 years and since 2011 has been a contributing Op-Ed writer for The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Germany, a Social Democrat Who Welcomes Trump\u2019s Bluster", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBERLIN \u2014 Olaf Scholz took over as Germany\u2019s finance minister in March. Since then, President Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on German cars, called Europe a \u201cfoe\u201d and dispatched an ambassador to Berlin who takes selfies with far-right politicians eager to bring down the German government.But in an interview in his sparsely decorated fourth-floor office in the finance ministry, once the headquarters of the Nazi Luftwaffe, Mr. Scholz professed to be \u201crelaxed.\u201dThere is nothing like a bit of venom from the White House to unite Europe\u2019s \u201cprogressive liberal center,\u201d says the man who is Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s No. 2.\u201cEurope won\u2019t be pushed around,\u201d Mr. Scholz said, smiling serenely. \u201cThe present U.S. administration, if you will, has become a catalyst for an ever-closer European integration process.\u201dShort, balding and poker-faced, Mr. Scholz is by default the leading voice of social democracy in Europe, a movement in crisis trying to prove its relevance in the age of populism. He was a fiery young socialist in the 1970s who gradually mellowed into a post-ideological centrist. First defending workers as a labor lawyer, then defending labor-market reforms to workers and now co-governing with a conservative Chancellor, Mr. Scholz has traveled a journey that in many ways tracks that of his ailing Social Democratic Party.But while support for the Social Democrats is at a postwar low, Mr. Scholz has quietly risen to become one of Germany\u2019s most popular politicians. \u201cLiberal, but not stupid,\u201d is how he once described himself.To his fans, Mr. Scholz is a voice of calm and confidence, a pragmatist from Germany\u2019s taciturn north who represents the elusive silent majority.To his critics, he is overly relaxed about the challenges facing Europe and Germany in 2018 and lacks bold ideas to match his optimism.Last year, he published a book about Germany entitled \u201cLand of Hope.\u201d Six months later, the far-right Alternative for Germany had become the largest opposition party in the German Parliament. But Mr. Scholz\u2019s mantra is unchanged: Stick to social democratic principles and moderation instead of trying to beat the populists at their own game.\u201cWe have this problem with right-wing populism in Europe and in other parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we mustn\u2019t act as if that was the biggest problem we have. In fact, we are growing closer together.\u201dThe answer was typical for a man Germans have long known as the \u201cScholz-o-mat,\u201d a technocrat and veteran politician who can seem not just utterly unflappable but almost robotically on message.Italy\u2019s populist wobbles?\u201cNew governments come and go, we mustn\u2019t lose our cool.\u201dBrexit?\u201cVery regrettable,\u201d but \u201cFrankfurt will gain as a financial hub.\u201dA possible trade war with the United States?\u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll find a solution.\u201dWhat about Alternative for Germany snapping at the heels of his own shrinking party and in some polls overtaking it?\u201cI believe the Social Democrats can be the strongest party at the next election,\u201d Mr. Scholz insisted, though at this point his smile looked a little more forced.On Europe, too, he is adamant that the answer to growing public disenchantment with Europe\u2019s institutions is not less Europe, but more. He has scheduled a series of \u201ccitizens\u2019 office hours\u201d in coming months, to discuss ordinary Germans\u2019 concerns about the European Union.Mr. Scholz\u2019 first trip after taking office in March was to Paris \u2014 he was there so fast he beat even his boss, Ms. Merkel. He supports French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s ambition to revamp Europe with a joint strike force, common rules on migration and asylum, strong external borders and a European foreign policy unencumbered by the need for unanimous decision-making by its 28 member states. Mr. Scholz wants to introduce simple majority voting so Europe can play a more decisive role on the geopolitical stage.\u201cEurope has been too apolitical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always focused on economics and trade. Citizens want more politics, they want a Europe that shows what it can do, whether that\u2019s on economics or on foreign policy.\u201dBut when it comes to Mr. Macron\u2019s most ambitious proposals \u2014 a European finance minister and budget \u2014 Mr. Scholz toes the traditional German line that, for now at least, budgetary prudence takes precedence over lofty political goals.\u201cA European finance minister is more of a long-term goal,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we should not get caught up in this,\u201d he said, and instead should focus on \u201creforming the banking and finance sector and securing the future stability of the eurozone in order to be prepared for coming financial crises.\u201dBut so far there is scant evidence that Mr. Scholz represents a stark break from Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s stance. As Mr. Scholz has put it: \u201cA German finance minister is a German finance minister.\u201dAt home, despite a booming economy and record-low unemployment, many Germans are angry about stagnant salaries and a feeling that a tiny elite has profited the most from economic growth. Mr. Scholz, the middle-class son of a businessman and married to another politician, knows that he is part of that perceived elite.Populism is a problem, he conceded. In Germany, the resentments that most recently fed far-right protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz have not been fully understood.\u201cThere is something going on, and not just here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the wealthy nations, people are in a bad mood, despite the good economic numbers.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere used to be a promise that if you worked hard and your employer was doing well you would get a share. That promise is in danger.\u201dRestoring it, he said, \u201cis the social democratic project.\u201dOne direct way to address the sense of insecurity and the fear of the future that are relentlessly fueled and exploited by populists, he said, is to increase pensions and ensure decent wages.In person, Mr. Scholz oozes a distinctly northern German temperament, betraying few emotions and only occasionally allowing himself a quiet chuckle. He spent most of his life in Hamburg, Germany\u2019s second city, where he liked to go rowing in the mornings and served as mayor until March this year.As mayor, Mr. Scholz made a point of writing a personal letter to every migrant who had lived in the city for eight years, encouraging them to apply for German citizenship and offering to meet them in person. Six times a year, he would attend the citizenship ceremonies in city hall, which he called \u201ca very moving experience.\u201dIt is that experience, too, that makes him more sanguine about Germany\u2019s ability to weather the challenges brought on by the arrival of more than a million migrants since 2015, and the populist backlash that has followed.\u201cGerman democracy is stable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has grown over many decades and is now deeply rooted.\u201dAs for populism elsewhere, governments come and go, Mr. Scholz says, but Germany\u2019s links to the United States \u2014 based on what he called \u201ca shared democratic tradition of civil rights and liberal democracy\u201d \u2014 run deeper.But, he said, his cryptic smile back in full force, \u201cEurope is sizable.\u201d And as if to remind those paying attention on the other side of the Atlantic, he added: \u201cEurope\u2019s G.D.P. is bigger than that of the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "These Sites No Longer Make Goods. Now They\u2019ll Get Them to You Faster.", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetAs the United States economy continues its shift away from manufacturing, locations that once housed industries such as automobiles or chemicals are being remade as distribution hubs for the millions of items bought by consumers online.Developers are trying to meet growing demand by modifying industrial buildings to meet the requirements of the logistics business or, more likely, demolishing them to make way for facilities built for the distribution industry. These sites offer many benefits ideal for distribution, including easy access to highways, ports and rail links and a proximity to major markets.\u201cLogistics and fulfillment is really the segment of the industrial world that has backfilled the void that manufacturing has left in terms of employment and economic activity,\u201d said Thomas J. Hanna, president of Harvey Hanna & Associates, which plans to tear down a former General Motors assembly plant at Newport, Del., to create a three-million-square-foot complex for distribution companies.Plans are in place to redevelop other former manufacturing sites across the nation, including a former plastics factory in Piscataway, N.J., and an old Ford plant in Lorain, Ohio.In coming weeks, crews in Delaware will begin to raze G.M.\u2019s giant Boxwood Road factory, which was built in 1945 and once employed as many as 8,000 people but has been empty since the automaker\u2019s bankruptcy in 2009. A $250 million project will replace it with four dividable buildings designed for the logistics industry, including a 40-foot-high ceiling and 600 feet between truck entry and exit points.Fisker Automotive had planned to revive the plant by making luxury cars there before it went bankrupt in 2013, and demolition was not the first option for Mr. Hanna, a Newport native with ties to the 142-acre site. His father worked there as a plant engineer, and his uncle, who is now his business partner, had summer jobs mowing lawns as a teenager.Mr. Hanna wanted to reconfigure the factory for today\u2019s manufacturers, but after a year of trying, he was unable to generate enough interest. He concluded that the costs of manufacturing in the United States, especially the Northeast, were too high to find enough tenants to fill the plant\u2019s 1.1 million square feet.\u201cManufacturing is not entirely dead, but it\u2019s nowhere near as robust as it once was in terms of our economy,\u201d Mr. Hanna said during a tour of the building.Within an eight-hour drive of some 50 million inhabitants in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, and close to highways, rail and the soon-to-be upgraded Port of Wilmington, the site is well situated for the logistics industry.\u201cThis plant has sat dormant for almost a decade, and it is time for it to be put back into a higher and better use,\u201d Mr. Hanna said.Developers of older industrial sites face risks, including the cost of demolition or refurbishment, environmental cleanup and the need to retain a local work force that can transfer its skills to logistics, said Robert J. Vodinelic, the national practice leader for industrial and logistics real estate at Newmark Knight Frank.But many are willing to take them on because of the strong demand from the logistics industry, Mr. Vodinelic said.\u201cIf they are able to buy these properties for a fraction of the replacement cost, then they can make the numbers work,\u201d he said. \u201cEven with the huge cost of building a manufacturing facility, new construction may end up being the best route.\u201dOlder sites such as Boxwood Road are desirable because newly developed land is more likely to be farther from major consumer markets, Mr. Vodinelic said.\u201cIn many markets, there is a lack of adequate development sites that have the proximity to employment base and highway access that a lot of these former manufacturing plants have,\u201d he said.The large size of older manufacturing sites also draws logistics companies, which now demand 600,000 to one million square feet, about twice the area they typically occupied 10 years ago, Mr. Vodinelic said.In Piscataway, the Rockefeller Group, a commercial real estate developer, is remaking a 228-acre site once occupied by a Dow Chemical plastics factory, and building five structures totaling 2.1 million square feet primarily for the distribution industry.The site, close to New York, the New Jersey Turnpike and Interstate 287, offers a rare opportunity, said Brandi Hanback, executive vice president for industrial development at Rockefeller. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual that a site of that size is available in New Jersey,\u201d she said.The first tenant, Best Buy, has set up a distribution center there, and interest from other companies has been strong enough to accelerate the construction schedule to three years from five, Ms. Hanback said.In addition to the scarcity of land in northern and central New Jersey, she attributed the demand to the proximity of ports and the availability of labor for logistics companies.\u201cIt\u2019s a good microcosm of what\u2019s happening in the industrial real estate market in general and especially in these gateway markets like northern New Jersey,\u201d she said.In Lorain, the site of the former Ford plant, which closed in 2006, is being used by distribution companies including Trademark Global and Comprehensive Logistics. Trademark Global receives, packs and ships consumer goods for internet retailers, and Comprehensive Logistics is a third-party provider for a Ford truck plant in Avon, Ohio.The Industrial Realty Group, which specializes in the adaptive reuse of commercial real estate, demolished part of the 3.8-million-square-foot plant and improved facilities for future tenants in the remaining structure.In Pontiac, Mich., Industrial Realty converted a former G.M. plant into a center for industrial and logistics companies including Fanuc America, a Japanese robotics company that uses 400,000 square feet of former office space for light assembly, warehousing and distribution.In reusing such sites, logistics companies are positioning themselves geographically to serve a surging demand for same-day delivery of online purchases.\u201cLogistics is the fastest-growing segment within the real estate industry,\u201d Mr. Hanna said. \u201cEveryone is trying to figure out how to get their product to the consumer the fastest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sweden Was Long Seen as a \u2018Moral Superpower.\u2019 That May Be Changing.", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKHOLM \u2014 In a civic center in Rinkeby, a heavily immigrant district of northwest Stockholm, several hundred people gathered recently for a forum on Sweden\u2019s coming election and the future of the country.The conversation, about the nature of Sweden\u2019s democracy and the importance of voting, was sophisticated and passionate. But it was frustrating for one participant, Ahmed Ali, a Somali immigrant, who thought people were dancing around the main issue.\u201cThe stakes are really high in this election,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThere are more extremists in the country, and they have more influence. They don\u2019t have a real political agenda. They just hate immigrants. And this xenophobia is happening all over Europe.\u201dAs an angry and divided Sweden prepares to vote on Sunday, the shape of the next Swedish government is utterly unclear, because of the rapid rise of the anti-immigration, anti-Europe Sweden Democrats, a populist nationalist party that is expected to win a fifth of the vote.\u201cThis election is very important to us,\u201d said Kahin Ahmed, 48, who is running for a local seat, but complains that none of the Swedish parties put immigrants or black people high enough on their party lists to get elected in proportionate numbers, even in areas like this one. \u201cThere is a racist party moving forward fast, and we have to stop them.\u201dSweden \u201cis joining the rest of Europe,\u201d Carl Bildt, a former prime minister from the center-right Moderate Party, said with evident sadness. \u201cAnd the myth of the Sweden model is melting away.\u201dThe melting was in evidence recently in Sergels Square in central Stockholm, where Martin Westmont, a candidate for the Stockholm regional council, made the Sweden Democrats\u2019 case to the voters.\u201cWe\u2019re the new wave,\u201d he said. The election \u201cwill be a revolution.\u201d He predicted that the Social Democrats, the party who built the famous Swedish welfare state, would collapse, \u201ceven if not this time,\u201d and \u201cwe will become the largest party.\u201d Many voters were still reluctant to tell pollsters that they would vote for the Sweden Democrats, Mr. Westmont suggested.Populism has shifted the political discourse to the right and raised the temperature, even among the traditionally phlegmatic Swedes. Political support is fragmenting, with the long-dominant Social Democrats heading for their worst showing in a century.The migrant wave of 2015 flowed mostly to Germany and Sweden, regarded as Europe\u2019s most welcoming nations. Germany took in more than one million, while 163,000 arrived in Sweden seeking asylum, a large number in a country of 10.1 million. If the panic in Sweden has been less than in Germany, the political impact has been similar: the rise of a far-right, anti-immigrant, nationalist party \u2014 Alternative for Germany in one case, and the Sweden Democrats in the other \u2014 that is upending old certainties.Political elites here as elsewhere \u201cunderestimated how much people still live in national democracies,\u201d not some global stew, said Professor Tragardh, who teaches at Ersta Skondal Bracke University College.As in Germany, stiffer border controls were quickly introduced in Sweden and the numbers of new immigrants fell steeply, to about 23,000 this year. But the political damage had been done, and despite a thriving economy and low unemployment, the Sweden Democrats argue that immigration should stop and that resources should go to refurbishing the welfare state strained by an aging population, gang violence and the challenge of taking on migrants.Integration of newcomers takes up to seven years, because of tough labor market requirements, insisted upon by Sweden\u2019s trade unions, and the challenges of the country\u2019s language and of its culture, which is more comfortable opening its borders than its homes.\u201cThis election really matters, and it is pretty much up in the air,\u201d said Jonas Hinnfors, a professor of political science at the University of Gothenburg. Welfare, health and taxes are, as ever, top issues, as is climate change, he said, but \u201cto an unprecedented extent, you have immigration and crime, and also unprecedented is the way the Social Democrats are campaigning on these issues and proposing more police and tougher border controls.\u201dThe rise of the Sweden Democrats masks the decline of the Social Democrats, who are synonymous with social democracy in Europe and have come first in nearly every Swedish election since 1917. But while they got over 50 percent of the vote in 1968 and more than 45 percent in 1994, their support has dwindled steadily to about 25 percent, reflecting declines in support for socialist and left-center parties elsewhere in Europe.If the Sweden Democrats, as expected, get around 20 percent of the vote, that will make it impossible for either the center-left or center-right bloc to form a majority government. The other parties insist that they will not do any deals with the Sweden Democrats, but the question has already cost the Moderates one leader and is bound to come up again in the days after the election, no matter which bloc ends up larger.The surge of the Sweden Democrats, with their roots in Swedish fascism and neo-Nazism, has astounded many. Under a young leader, Jimmie Akesson, the party has moved to expel its most extreme members and soften its message, symbolized by the switch of its logo from a flaming torch to a floppy version of the blue anemone, one of Sweden\u2019s favorite flowers and a harbinger of spring.The strategy seems to be working. The party crossed the 4 percent threshold for parliamentary seats in 2010, getting 5.7 percent of the vote; in 2014, it won 12.9 percent. It could now become Sweden\u2019s second-largest party, with all the complications that could bring.The Sweden Democrats have not abandoned their traditional slogan, \u201cKeep Sweden Swedish,\u201d but have downplayed it in favor of \u201cSecurity and Tradition.\u201d What they are selling, most people agree, is nostalgia for a mythic Sweden of the 1950s \u2014 safe, prosperous and white.They vow to protect the civil religion of the welfare state and restore the \u201cFolkhemmet,\u201d or the \u201cpeople\u2019s home,\u201d the idea of the nation as a family where everyone contributes and cares for one another. That concept was created by the Social Democrats, but many consider it threatened by immigration, Islam and crime.Mr. Westmont, 39, the Sweden Democrats\u2019 candidate for the Stockholm regional council, said his experiences growing up were typical of many in his generation who have soured on immigration.He said he was a youth member of the center-right Moderates, \u201cbut they were becoming too liberal for me.\u201d Growing up in a Stockholm suburb, \u201chalf the kids\u201d were immigrants. \u201cSo I saw the problem from an early age, and I also saw that what the other parties say was not true.\u201dWhen he joined the Sweden Democrats in 2010, his parents were so embarrassed that he decided to change his name, he said. \u201cBut a lot of Moderates have come to us, and now my father supports the party, and I hope my mother will, too.\u201d Then he smiled and said, \u201cBut who knows about mothers?\u201dKimia Khodabandeh sees a more sinister side. Age 18 and a first-time voter, she was born in Sweden to Iranian parents who fled the revolution there. \u201cI do feel targeted,\u201d she said. \u201cI was raised Swedish and feel Swedish, but I don\u2019t look Swedish, and they wouldn\u2019t accept us as Swedish.\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m concerned,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe live in a society where everyone is accepted and helps one another, but we\u2019re heading in the wrong direction. I just don\u2019t understand why some people want to ruin everything.\u201dIn the end, the Social Democrats and the center left may yet cling to power, and the Sweden Democrats may do well but again be kept out of the government. But the question of whether to make some deal with them, as mainstream parties in Finland, Denmark and Norway have done with their far-right rivals, or to continue to isolate them, is unlikely to go away.\u201cThis election is a struggle about values and Swedish identity,\u201d said Ulf Bjereld, a professor of political science at the University of Gothenburg and an active member of the Social Democrats. \u201cThe question is how to keep Sweden in the forefront of liberalism and social democracy versus stronger support for the nation state and borders. Who will Sweden be in this struggle? We\u2019re just at the beginning of this debate.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a man at a gathering for voters in Stockholm.

Seeking refuge from the scorching heat is a familiar exercise for voters in California\u2019s 25th Congressional District, a bone-dry territory that rolls over three valleys north of Los Angeles.A lifelong Republican, Ms. Rust shows why the party is vulnerable in districts like this one \u2014 a diverse, densely packed suburb outside a major coastal city. Ms. Rust said she was \u201cashamed\u201d to associate with the Republican Party because of President Trump; like many voters here, she voted for Hillary Clinton.There are 14 of these districts up for grabs, making up what may be the most important stretch of territory for Democrats: districts outside of major cities like Denver, Houston and Miami, defined by their diversity and relatively high levels of educational attainment. They look like many districts Democrats already hold.Big stretches of the 25th remain welcoming to Republicans: Simi Valley, home to backyard horse trails and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, remains largely white and conservative. Representative Steve Knight, a former police officer from a local political family, has held the district for Republicans since 2015.But roughly 40 percent of the district is now Hispanic, and even the white population is changing as younger families come seeking affordable housing.

Like other Republicans in the near suburbs of big cities, he is working to brand his opponent as wildly liberal, and to persuade voters to judge him separately from Mr. Trump.Ms. Rust is a case study for how that strategy might work. At the mall in Valencia, she said she was still leaning toward supporting Mr. Knight in November, despite her unhappiness with the Republican Party over all.\u201cI know more of him,\u201d she said of her congressman, adding in a note of absolution: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been like he\u2019s done anything bad.\u201dSydney Ember, reporting from Valencia, Calif.Profile: Illinois\u2019s Sixth DistrictThe suburbs of Chicago were a base of the Republican Party before Mr. Trump. One need only visit a shopping mall in Burr Ridge or a youth baseball game in Barrington Hills to see throngs of the white, highly educated voters who are the electoral backbone of the area, and once voted solidly for presidential candidates like Mitt Romney.But if these voters have leaned right in the past, drawn to promises of lower taxes and smaller government, Mr. Trump has pitched many of them back in the other direction. In Illinois\u2019s Sixth Congressional District, the president\u2019s combustible persona and administration have put Republican candidates in dire peril.Jane Melvin, 55, said she has typically voted Republican in the past and still yearned for a version of the party that has been fading away.\u201cIf John Kasich was running in my district, I would vote for him,\u201d said Ms. Melvin, referring to the right-of-center Ohio governor who routinely chides Mr. Trump.Ms. Melvin said she had long supported her congressman, Peter Roskam, but was reconsidering this year because Republicans had failed to check the president. \u201cIt\u2019s a character question and a silence question,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause they won\u2019t stand up to Trump and say this is wrong.\u201dMr. Roskam, a former member of the House Republican leadership team, represents one of 21 seats where college-educated white suburbanites could upend the Republican majority in the House. Most of these seats, in relatively homogenous communities around cities like Minneapolis and Philadelphia, are seen as electoral toss-ups.In 2016, Mr. Roskam easily secured re-election by nearly 20 percentage points, but Mrs. Clinton carried the area in the presidential race by about seven points.6th District Results for the 2016 Presidential ElectionIllinois\u2019s 6thChicagoPalatineThe district skirts more liberal Chicago suburbs to the east.WheatonBut upscale suburbantowns throughout the area went blue in 2016.Downers GroveNapervillePalatineThe district skirts more liberal Chicago suburbs to the east.Illinois\u2019s 6thChicagoBut upscale suburban townsthroughout the area went blue in 2016.WheatonDowners GroveNapervillePalatineThe district skirts more liberal Chicago suburbs to the east.Illinois\u2019s 6thChicagoBut upscale suburban townsthroughout the area went blue in 2016.WheatonDowners GroveNapervilleMr. Casten has closed in on Mr. Roskam with help from voters like Karrie Sullivan, a former Roskam supporter who said she now favors divided government \u2014 both in Washington, where Republicans are in charge, and in Illinois, where Democrats may take full control of government in November.\u201cIt seems like the best situation is when neither party has complete control,\u201d Ms. Sullivan said.Mr. Roskam, like other Republican candidates in similar wealthy suburbs, has tried to make the Republican tax overhaul an asset to his campaign. But many suburban voters have bristled at changes to federal deductions for state and local taxes.Highlighting the gulf between the Republican white-collar base and Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line following, candidates like Mr. Roskam have broken with Mr. Trump on critical issues like tariffs.Pursuing both wavering moderates and hard-core conservatives, Mr. Roskam said at a recent debate that he considered Mr. Trump\u2019s performance \u201cmiddling.\u201d\u201cGood on the economy, jumbling on other issues,\u201d he said.Astead W.

But with anger swelling at the president, these 23 districts are in play, including in Kansas, Kentucky and Washington State.Almost all the districts were won by Mr. Trump in 2016. And the president retains considerable support in these majority-white districts, especially within the business community and among voters with conservative social views.

Ms. Spanberger, 39, worked for the C.I.A. abroad recruiting spies.Mr. Brat, 54, a former economics professor, is attempting to link Ms. Spanberger to left-wing ideas like \u201copen borders\u201d and Medicare for all, which he says will tank the economy. Ms. Spanberger supports neither of these policies and has pledged not to support Nancy Pelosi for House speaker.Trip Gabriel, reporting from Wingmead, Va.Profile: New Mexico\u2019s Second DistrictThe candidates seeking an open House seat in New Mexico agree on little, but describe their district in identical language: It is hugely diverse. And it is vast.Most important races this fall are unfolding elsewhere in areas chopped into housing developments and strip malls, veined with congested highways and polished residential streets.New Mexico\u2019s Second District, by contrast, is an area larger than Florida. Sweeping along the Mexican border and up to Albuquerque, it embraces mountain ranges and military bases, booming oil wells and elaborately irrigated fields of chiles and corn.It is one of seven contested districts with a distinctly Western profile: sparsely populated and ethnically varied, with an underlying strain of cultural conservatism. Republicans appear favored in most of these seats in states like New Mexico and Texas, but Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line policies, including on immigration and trade, have rattled their traditional Western coalition.2nd District Results for the 2016 Presidential ElectionAlbuquerqueNew Mexico\u2019s 2ndMost of the district\u2019s huge rural expanse is solidly Republican.RoswellTruth orConsequencesAlamogordoLas CrucesBut the district\u2019s population center, also the state\u2019s second-largest city, leans Democratic.Most of the district\u2019s huge rural expanse is solidly Republican.AlbuquerqueNew Mexico\u2019s 2ndRoswellTruth orConsequencesAlamogordoLas CrucesBut the district\u2019s population center, also the state\u2019s second-largest city, leans Democratic.AlbuquerqueN.M. 2ndMost of the district\u2019s huge rural expanse is solidly Republican.RoswellTruth orConsequencesAlamogordoLas CrucesBut the district\u2019s population center, also the state\u2019s second-largest city, leans Democratic.AlbuquerqueN.M. 2ndMost of the district\u2019s huge rural expanse is solidly Republican.RoswellTruth orConsequencesAlamogordoLas CrucesBut the district\u2019s population center, also the state\u2019s second-largest city, leans Democratic.Audrey Boone, 48, a Republican in Sierra County, north of the district\u2019s population center in Las Cruces, is an undecided voter.

{"Headline": "Why Tariff and Trade Disputes Are More Than a Money Problem", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThat may sound hyperbolic. But two Yale law professors, Oona A. Hathaway and Scott J. Shapiro, make a persuasive case that the world could become a far more dangerous place if the Trump administration seriously disrupts the global consensus that has been in place for decades.\u201cImperfect as it may be, the world operates under the understanding that war is illegal and trade sanctions are a legal method of punishing aggressive behavior,\u201d Professor Shapiro said. \u201cBut sanctions only work with a healthy regime of international trade, and under the rule of international law. That is all coming into question now.\u201dThe Chinese authorities quickly retaliated with new levies on $60 billion in American products. And the United States also has trade disputes brewing with several allies. The costs for consumers, businesses and the world economy are being closely tallied.But the two scholars say the administration\u2019s aggressive approach could have a much higher cost: It could unravel a complex series of rules and agreements that have served to moderate the behavior of great powers like the United States, China, the Soviet Union and, now, Russia.In a provocative book, \u201cThe Internationalists: How a Radical Plan to Outlaw War Remade the World\u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2017), they provide a history of international law. They say the relative prosperity and peace of the post-World War II world owes a great deal to a now-obscure international treaty \u2014 the Kellogg-Briand Pact.At stake are even bigger issues, the professors say.Consider, Professor Hathaway said, what kind of a world we could be re-entering, if the Trump administration\u2019s escalation of its conflicts with other nations were to shred the current international consensus.\u201cSome pivotal principles are at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cRecall that punishing aggressive behavior through trade sanctions was illegal before the treaty in 1928, and acquiring territory through war was legal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in 1928, and with the rules that gradually developed, that was reversed.\u201dShe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that if you disrupt the world trading system \u2014 and the consensus outlawing war that is in place today \u2014 you are disrupting the financial means of punishing violations of war. In the end, you may be left with nothing but reliance on force.\u201dWithout robust trade, she said, geopolitical disputes over such issues as dominion over the South China Sea could flare more easily into military confrontations between great powers. Mutually beneficial commerce \u2014 and the need to abide by the international rules that make it possible \u2014 have successfully moderated the behavior of sovereign states.That has been the explicit aim of a succession of United States presidents, starting with Richard M. Nixon, who sought to give China \u2014 formerly an isolated Communist giant \u2014 a stake in the world economy and in the American-dominated global economic and political system put in place in the aftermath of World War II.This has never been entirely smooth. Disagreements over the terms of trade and the structure of the Chinese economy have rankled Americans since the early 1980s, when China entered the modern world economy. But given their political and economic differences, China and the United States have had a remarkably calm relationship until now.Strong, respectful negotiating to improve the relative standing of the United States is entirely appropriate, Professor Shapiro said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would defend the current system as being perfect. Far from it. But there\u2019s a difference between trying to reform the system from within, and blowing it up, which is what seems to be happening.\u201dFor example, he said, the day-to-day rules and arbitration procedures of the World Trade Organization don\u2019t usually attract much attention, but they are crucial if trade is to proceed smoothly \u2014 and peacefully \u2014 around the world.In a remarkable turnabout, he threatened to use economic sanctions \u2014 which became a prime tool for enforcing international law as a result of the Kellogg-Briand Pact \u2014 as weapons to deter the court\u2019s judges from enforcing international law, Professor Hathaway said.Furthermore, Mr. Bolton has in the past condemned the W.T.O. as well, generally advocating a unilateral approach by the United States and an end to the decision-making process enshrined in the organization.Under the circumstances, boring, negotiated resolutions to the current trade disputes would be a happy ending, Professor Hathaway said. What the world may face instead, is the dismal prospect of conflict without the rules or means for resolving it peacefully. The United States would remain a powerful player in that world, but it would be playing a much more dangerous game.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: LeBron James Knows the Lakers Have \u2018a Long Way to Go\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The next great Los Angeles Laker is always en route.Yet I suspect even the most die-hard denizens of Lakerland were starting to worry that the magic was gone. Their beloved team entered N.B.A. free agency in July having missed out on the playoffs for a franchise-record five consecutive seasons. Worse yet, L.A. had been outright shunned in recent summers by the league\u2019s top free agents.The Lakers\u2019 struggles to connect with the biggest names in the game, especially in the wake of Kobe Bryant\u2019s retirement in April 2016, are a big reason the club\u2019s controlling owner, Jeanie Buss, appointed Magic Johnson as president of basketball operations without warning in February 2017.Then, at 5:05 p.m. California time on July 1, it happened: LeBron James announced via his agent Rich Paul\u2019s Twitter feed that he had decided to leave his home-state Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 for the second time \u2014 to sign the four-year contract Buss and Johnson offered him.Just like that, the Lakers became the Lakers again.Or so they hope.That was arguably the last time one of James\u2019s teams, in the eyes of preseason prognosticators, was seen as a better bet to miss the playoffs entirely rather than to win the N.B.A. championship.James\u2019s demeanor would suggest he already recognizes how much work and meshing it will take for this group \u2014 without a clearly established second superstar \u2014 to get anywhere near the Western Conference elite as currently constituted.\u201cWe got a long way to go to get to Golden State,\u201d James told reporters, referring to the two-time defending champion Warriors.Perhaps seeking to play down expectations, James also insisted that the 2018-19 Lakers should not be judged solely on whether they win the championship. \u201cThere\u2019s only one champ,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not successful.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Henry Wessel was a New Jersey native, but California enthralled him from the moment he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969.\u201cI walked out of the airport into one of those clear, sharp-edged January days,\u201d he said. \u201cThe light had such physical presence; it looked as though you could lean against it.\u201dThat light became a fixture of many of his photographs, which offer black-and-white glimpses of vernacular scenes in the American West. One of his most well-known images, \u201cSanta Barbara, Calif., 1977,\u201d draws the viewer in with the axial light of the early morning sun.Mr. Wessel was never without his Leica and became a cornerstone of the photography program at the San Francisco Art Institute. He died last week at his home in Point Richmond at 76.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C. Berkeley.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After the Battle: A Warning From Mosul ", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOrganized combat in Iraq\u2019s second city ended more than a year ago, but the city remains crippled by deadly munitions that still lie hidden beneath huge mounds of rubble.Mr. Lodhammar leads the United Nations mine-clearing effort in Iraq.Here, more than a year after the formal end of fighting that drove out the Islamic State\u2019s fighters, the path to recovery runs literally through a three-dimensional minefield with the dangers of war still present everywhere. Explosive hazards implanted by the Islamic State, too dangerous and numerous to deactivate, still strew destruction, allowing the terrorist group to continue fighting in absentia and on the cheap. Their strategy has been, in a word, shrewd: Retreat from Mosul only after making life unlivable by making infrastructure all but impossible to fix.  I.E.D.s are everywhere \u2014 lethal needles placed in haystacks of uncleared rubble, some triggered by infrared sensors, some by tripwires.Teams like ours from the United Nations Mine Action Service (Unmas) find the needles, but the going is slow: They can never be sure how many still lie there as they assess the risk, probe, and render safe the armaments that they find.The work takes a practiced eye and a delicate touch. Tools range from hook-and-line kits used to disarm I.E.D.s to armored heavy equipment that can help dispose of 500-pound bombs buried under several feet of debris. Both tasks take time, lots of it. At the present pace, clearing just Mosul is expected to take teams like ours at least 10 more years.Sometimes the I.E.D.s provide sad and grisly evidence of Islamic State tactics. More than once, our teams in Mosul have found suicide belts among the corpses of unwilling human shields, deployed by the terrorists to cover their retreat. The victims included children, some not more than 10 years old. After each new discovery, heavy equipment on the scene to clear the site of explosive hazards would stop work to allow the government to recover, identify and return the remains for proper burial.Is another $5 billion spent over 10 years enough to free Iraq of explosive hazards? Perhaps, but nobody can be sure. Working at our current pace, Unmas in Iraq can expect an unfunded shortfall of $170 million for 2018 alone, despite generous support from 11 countries that make voluntary contributions to the United Nations, our sole source of funding. For the international community at large, one reason to step up efforts to accomplish more, and quicken the pace, should be clear: Delaying stabilization works to the Islamic State\u2019s advantage and against Iraq\u2019s people and efforts to pacify the region. Stabilization can ultimately deprive terrorists of a safe haven, but it can\u2019t begin without the clearance of deadly hazards.As soon as areas are cleared, work crews from other agencies \u2014 notably the United Nations Development Program \u2014 can seamlessly move in to make stabilization a bricks-and-motor proposition, even here in parts of devastated Mosul. The repaired Al Qasoor Water Treatment Plant now supplies clean and safe water to more than 300,000 people. In Nineveh Province, clearance work has allowed the High Court to access deeds that validate land claims of residents seeking return.Hanging in the balance is the future of Iraq, already a middle-income country and primed for recovery. Each of the 1.9 million displaced persons still waiting to return safely home to resume a normal life in a normal community bolsters Iraq\u2019s own chances for a turnaround. But not before their homes are free of hazards, the roads are safe to travel, the power works, and basic services are restored.  After open combat in Idlib ends, the recovery needed to achieve true pacification among bitter enemies and terrorist renegades will begin. As in Mosul, we expect I.E.D.s and unexploded munitions to complicate and challenge a recovery that is long, difficult and contested by enemies of reconciliation operating as they do here \u2014 hide in plain sight and, when they choose, fight from shadows.Without a restoration of normalcy, the terrorists can still \u201cwin from home\u201d if we let them.Pehr Lodhammar is the senior program manager of the United Nations Mine Action Service in Iraq.

The policies of their party aren\u2019t just extreme; frankly, they\u2019re dangerous and they\u2019re crazy.\u201dMr. Trump, seldom one to drop a personal grudge, even put aside his sour history with Mr. Heller \u2014 who vehemently opposed him during the 2016 campaign \u2014 and asked Nevada voters to do the same for a man the president said had been a loyal voter for his agenda in the Senate.\u201cNow, I have to say this,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t friends \u2014 I didn\u2019t like him, he didn\u2019t like me, and as we fought and fought and fought, believe it or not, we started to respect each other, then we started to like each other, then we started to love each other, and the fact is, he has been a tremendous supporter.\u201d\u201cWe have to keep him,\u201d the president said of Mr. Heller.Mr. Heller, the only Senate Republican running in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 election, badly needs the help. He is facing a costly and highly competitive race against Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democratic nominee in a state where recent polls indicate that about half the voters do not approve of Mr. Trump.At the rally on Thursday, Mr. Heller waxed ecstatic about Mr. Trump, praising him for enacting legislation to help veterans, to steer more money to the military and to cut taxes.\u201cMr. President, it\u2019s an honor to work with you in putting Nevada back to work,\u201d Mr. Heller said.Only hours before the event here, the Trump campaign endorsed Mr. Heller, handing the senator what has become a potent tool for Republicans seeking to rally the party\u2019s core supporters. What is less clear, however, is how it will affect other voters in Nevada, where Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating is around 40 percent, usually grim territory for members of the president\u2019s party who are seeking re-election.Ms. Rosen has worked to link Mr. Heller to Mr. Trump, pointing out that the senator has voted with the president 96 percent of the time and arguing that he would be a rubber stamp for Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda should voters return him to Washington.The president said he was confident about Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s chances, even as he refrained from criticizing his accuser.\u201cBrett Kavanaugh \u2014 and I\u2019m not saying anything about anybody else \u2014 but I want to say that Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will ever have the privilege of knowing, a great intellect, a great gentleman, an impeccable reputation,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll let it play out, and I think everything\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201dMr. Trump was sharper, though, when it came Mrs. Clinton, the news media and his own Justice Department. When the crowd began to chant, \u201cLock her up!\u201d in reference to Mrs. Clinton, the president, who has savaged his attorney general and suggested that the department was biased against him, asked the crowd, \u201cHow is our Justice Department doing?\u201d As if on cue, the crowd booed fervently.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Housing Market Slows, as Rising Prices Outpace Wages", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 By nearly any measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate is below 3 percent. There is so much construction that a local newspaper started a \u201ccrane watch\u201d feature. Seemingly every week brings headlines about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the area.Yet, Denver\u2019s once-soaring housing market has run into turbulence. Sales and construction activity have slowed in recent months. Houses that would once have drawn a frenzy of offers are sitting on the market for days or weeks. Selling prices are rising more slowly, and asking prices are being slashed to attract buyers.Similar slowdowns have hit New York, Seattle and even San Francisco, cities that until recently ranked among the nation\u2019s hottest housing markets. The specifics vary, but economists, real estate agents and home builders say the core issue is the same: Home buyers are reaching a breaking point after years of breakneck price increases that far exceeded income gains.\u201cThe local economy is still fantastic, all the fundamentals are there, but obviously wages are not keeping pace,\u201d said Steve Danyliw, a Denver realtor. \u201cAs the market continues to move up, buyers are being pushed out.\u201dRachel Sandoval is one of them. An elementary schoolteacher in the Denver Public Schools, Ms. Sandoval earns about $50,000 a year, enough to afford a condominium or a modest house in most markets. But not in Denver, where the median sales price for all homes was $410,000 in August, and where even condos routinely top $300,000 \u2014 a price Ms. Sandoval calls \u201cnot even close to feasible.\u201d She said she was scoping out jobs in Texas, where houses are cheaper and pay is higher, and considering leaving teaching in search of a higher salary.For now, Ms. Sandoval, 41, is sharing a one-bathroom rental house with two roommates, a nurse and an adjunct professor. The three stick to a strict schedule to make sure they can all get to work on time.\u201cWe are professionals, we have degrees,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cThis was not the plan.\u201dThe recent slowdown, however, is unlikely to give would-be buyers like Ms. Sandoval much relief. Prices in Denver are still up 8 percent over the past year, according to the S&P Case-Shiller index. That\u2019s cool compared to the double-digit gains of a couple years ago, but well ahead of the 6 percent increase in average hourly earnings over the same period. Rising interest rates have also made buying homes more expensive.Few analysts expect an outright decline in home prices anytime soon. That\u2019s because, unlike the speculative bubble of the mid-2000s, the recent run-up in prices has been driven primarily by economic fundamentals: People are moving to Denver faster than developers can build places to live. The Denver region has added more than 300,000 residents since 2010, making it one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing areas.Over all, however, the housing market is not behaving as the textbooks say it should. Inventories remain low despite the recent increases, and new construction is slowing, not picking up.Part of the problem, local real estate agents say, is that the furious pace of price growth has essentially gummed up the market, making homeowners reluctant to sell for fear of being unable to find a new home.Rising interest rates are compounding the problem because would-be sellers do not want to give up their low interest rates, a phenomenon economists call the lock-in effect.Brant and Annie Wiedel spent more than a year trying to get a foothold in Denver\u2019s housing market \u2014 and they are reluctant to give it up. The couple estimate that they looked at 160 houses before finally closing on a three-bedroom ranch house in Lakewood, a suburb, three years ago.With two children and a third due in January, the Wiedels would like to trade up. With the rise in home prices some renovations, the house they bought for $350,000 could be worth more than $500,000.But the family borrowed at about 3.5 percent three years ago. Today, they would pay closer to 5 percent. \u201cEven if we just saw houses at the same price, we\u2019d have to pay more\u201d every month, he said.Ultimately, the key to breaking the logjam is to build more homes. Downtown Denver is crawling with cranes, many of them erecting amenity-filled apartment complexes aimed at young professionals. A drive in almost any direction from downtown reveals freshly built subdivisions with names like Tallgrass, The Enclave and Green Gables Reserve.Most of those new homes, however, will list for more than $400,000. And hardly any builders are selling properties for under $300,000 without government subsidies. Even many home builders worry they are pricing themselves out of the market.\u201cI see the biggest threat to our business as the affordability challenge, that we are building houses that people can\u2019t afford,\u201d said Gene Myers, chief executive of Thrive Home Builders.The problem, Mr. Myers and other local builders say, is cost. The price of land, building permits and other fees can run close to $150,000 for a single-family lot \u2014 before construction.Some of the challenges are specific to Colorado. Quirks in state law, for example, make it easy for condominium buyers to collectively sue builders over construction defects, making developers reluctant to build condos.But other issues are common to many cities. Building materials have become more expensive, in part because of tariffs on lumber and other products that President Trump imposed this year. Labor costs are rising, too, especially for skilled trade workers. Restrictive zoning makes it hard to build denser developments that make cheaper homes profitable for builders.\u201cThey\u2019re producing what they can produce,\u201d said Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government housing-finance company. \u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s uneconomic for them to produce affordable.\u201dThis big-city conundrum is spreading. People priced out of San Francisco moved to Seattle and Portland, driving up prices and displacing people who moved to Denver and Austin. Next on the list: Boise, Nashville and other cities offering some of the same attractions at lower prices.\u201cCity after city is going to face this,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, Redfin\u2019s chief executive. \u201cAt some point, the buyers step back and say, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019\u201dMore people are moving to Denver than leaving it, but migration has tapered off in recent years. J. J. Ament, chief executive of Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, said he had seen no sign that rising home prices were making the region less attractive. Last month, VF Corporation, an apparel maker that owns brands like The North Face and Vans, announced it would move its headquarters to Denver from North Carolina, partly because of the area\u2019s reputation for outdoor activities. The state also offered $27 million in incentives.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018crisis,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ament said. \u201cThe work force is still willing to move here.\u201dThat shortfall could threaten Denver\u2019s growth, said Phyllis Resnick, a Colorado State University economist and one of the report\u2019s authors. The skilled workers moving to the area, who have been so important to attracting companies and jobs, want to be able to eat out at restaurants, drop off their dry cleaning and send their children to school, all of which require lower and middle income workers. If they cannot afford to live in the area, Ms. Resnick said, Denver will not retain its allure \u2014 and the economy will not keep growing.\u201cMy concern is, at some point it sort of breaks because we can\u2019t house the folks that we need to fill out all the economic activity in the region,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that in the near term it will correct itself just through market forces, unless that\u2019s through people moving out.\u201dTo have a big impact, economists say Denver and other cities have to build more homes affordable to middle-class families. That will require persuading communities accustomed to single-family homes to accept condos and townhomes.\u201cThe only way to solve the riddle is through density,\u201d said Dave Lemnah, co-owner of Lokal Homes, a Denver builder.That\u2019s why he is building projects like the Villas at Wheatlands, a 94-unit development in Aurora, east of Denver. Each lot has three attached units arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Lokal sells the homes for less than $400,000; some go for close to $300,000.One buyer, Angela Kirkland-Vandecar, an aesthetician and a single mother, has spent two years searching for a home she could afford on her roughly $50,000 income.When Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar began her search, she did not want to move to Aurora or to a condo.\u201cI\u2019ve now done everything that in the beginning I said I was not going to do,\u201d she said.But Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar feels good about her decision. Her monthly mortgage payment will be less than her $1,900 monthly rent, and she is happy not to have a lawn to mow. Her daughters, 11 and 13, will have their own rooms, and she will no longer have to store food in the laundry room, as she did in the cramped apartment she had been renting.Walking through her nearly ready house recently, looking for defects, Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar opened a door in the kitchen and paused. A Lokal Homes worker asked if she had found a problem. She shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m just enjoying my pantry,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But Mr. Erdogan, who is widely seen as trying to influence the independent central bank, has signaled an unwillingness to allow even modest rate increases or curb government spending that has fueled a popular growth boom \u2014 as well as runaway prices.Hours before the central bank made its announcement, Mr. Erdogan said he valued the bank\u2019s independence, before immediately taking another swipe at it. Speaking to the Confederation of Turkish Tradesmen in Ankara, he slammed interest rates as a \u201ctool of exploitation,\u201d adding: \u201cI say, let\u2019s drop these high interest rates. Interest is the cause, inflation is the result.\u201dMr. Erdogan also signed a decree Thursday effectively imposing a ban on conducting business in Turkey using euros or dollars.In a statement announcing its move, the Turkish central bank said there were \u201cupside risks\u201d to inflation, despite \u201cweaker domestic demand conditions.\u201d It added that, as a result, it had \u201cdecided to implement a strong monetary tightening to support price stability.\u201dFor nearly two decades, Turkey had uninterrupted growth that helped reduce poverty, increase the ranks of the middle class and, until recently, turned the nation into a darling of international investors.But the growth was built chiefly on a construction boom fed by cheap credit and an avalanche of government spending that Mr. Erdogan poured into the economy to stimulate even more activity. That success story has become increasingly unsustainable.On the ground, the plunge in the lira has had an impact on daily life in a litany of ways, affecting even the availability of pharmaceutical supplies. Major drug wholesalers in Turkey are running low on stocks, and soon many antibiotics, as well as drugs for oncology, as well as cardiovascular and neurological ailments, will fall out of date, according to Vedat Bulut, the president of the Ankara Chamber of Pharmacists.\u201cHundreds of thousands of people will be affected,\u201d Mr. Bulut said. \u201cEspecially for cancer patients, a delay of even a few days in treatment may cause metastasis.\u201dThe lira has since recovered many of its losses. At its weakest, in mid-August, 7.2 lira were required to buy one dollar, but at one point on Thursday the Turkish currency had strengthened to 6 against the dollar.While Turkey remains a relatively minor economy in the global context \u2014 its annual output is about the same as that of a country like the Netherlands \u2014 several European banks have investments or subsidiaries there. That exposes the region to risks emanating from Turkey, even as the European Union grapples with its own challenges, including a trade dispute with the United States and concerns over slowing economic growth.Matt Phillips and Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "White House Says Wages Are Growing When Measured Differently", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A mystery of the current economic recovery is why wages are stuck in neutral while economic growth revs faster. On Wednesday, the Trump administration tried to solve the puzzle by producing its own measure that shows wages are, in fact, growing.That same measure, however, showed that wage growth has slowed under President Trump, compared with the end of the Obama administration.The report comes as Democrats have escalated their criticism over the sluggish pace of wage growth at a time of low unemployment and an accelerating economy. Its publication underlines the challenge that administration officials have faced in selling the benefits of the $1.5 trillion tax cut package Mr. Trump signed last year, which Republicans promised would bolster wage growth for Americans across the income spectrum.\u201cMuch of the commentary about wage growth that we see is influenced by confusion we find about proper measurement,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said on Wednesday. \u201cThe headlines have missed the real wage growth.\u201dMr. Hassett also acknowledged that, by the council\u2019s own preferred measure, compensation growth had not accelerated under Mr. Trump, despite a drop in the unemployment rate, which had fallen below 4 percent for the first time since 2000.Periods of low unemployment are typically associated with rapid wage growth, as companies are forced to compete for workers with offers of higher pay. While wages have shown modest growth in some professions like construction, they have not experienced the kind of surge that would typically accompany such a strong recovery. Fed officials have continued to watch the phenomenon, but have said they expect wage growth to soon accelerate.On Wednesday, the Council of Economic Advisers posted on Twitter data that showed pretax compensation growth \u2014 adjusted in the administration\u2019s preferred way \u2014 neared 3 percent in 2015 and 2 percent in 2016, the last two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. It slowed to about 1.5 percent by the end of 2017, and has slowed again in 2018, despite the passage of the tax cuts. The council said it expected those wage numbers to grow \u201cas the benefits of tax reform are fully realized.\u201dCritics of the tax bill said Wednesday that the new White House report confirming those promised gains had yet to appear. \u201cThere likely has been no significant effect of the tax legislation on pretax wage rates to this point,\u201d said Greg Leiserson, a former senior economist on the council who is now director of tax policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. \u201cThis is not a surprise, but it is a problem for proponents who overstated the case for the legislation.\u201dMr. Hassett said on Wednesday that the wage gains from corporate cuts, spurred by increased investments that would in turn drive faster productivity growth and higher worker pay, would take \u201cthree to five years\u201d to fully appear. He also said recent investment data suggested those gains were \u201con track.\u201d\u201cWe expect that the wages \u2014 as people get their annual increases and as the capital stock goes online \u2014 will accelerate from here,\u201d Mr. Hassett said. \u201cBut that\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to wait and see what the data say in the second half of the year.\u201dThus far, the economists wrote, the tax cuts \u201chave been associated with a dramatic increase in share buybacks; evidence of an increase in investment is less clear at this stage, as it is likely too early to detect given that the effects may take time to materialize.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s about two women \u2014 the significant others of Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive \u2014 and questions surrounding those women\u2019s personal finances.It is a curious take on the year of the woman, with accusations and invective lacing both men\u2019s campaigns at a time when female voters and candidates have proven to be a potent force in the electorate.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign has suggested that Ms. Adams\u2019s employment at the company was questionable, citing about $70,000 in county contracts and hundreds of thousands of dollars in other subsidies that Tinkelman received from a Dutchess County development agency.That ad blurred out the word \u201cwife,\u201d in reference to Ms. Adams, though it was still visible. An earlier video advertisement was more explicit, suggesting that in return for \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks,\u201d Tinkelman \u201chired Molinaro\u2019s wife.\u201dThat video, released on the same day that Mr. Molinaro unveiled a revitalization plan for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, led to Mr. Molinaro\u2019s \u201cyou want to pick a fight\u201d post on Twitter \u2014 which effectively overshadowed his own transportation plan.\u201cDo you know anything about the house that he lives in, the place that he calls home, or the individual that he lives with?\u201d Mr. Molinaro said last week in Albany, adding, \u201cIf he wants to go down that road, God bless him, but at the end of the day, I think New Yorkers expect better.\u201dGet messages from our politics correspondent Alex Burns as he covers the biggest races this election season. Along the way, he\u2019ll take your questions and help you understand what\u2019s at stake on Nov. 6.Mr. Molinaro\u2019s family is in a much lower tax bracket: He earns about $140,000 as county executive, and says that his wife\u2019s total income at Tinkelman, for doing public relations and social media work for the firm, was about $80,000 over three years.\u201cShe had no role in the company\u2019s administration, and no role in advocating for government contracts,\u201d he said, adding that she left on good terms earlier this year to focus on her pregnancy and the couple\u2019s other child, a toddler.That\u2019s roughly the time Ms. Adams was hired, though the firm\u2019s managing member, Steven Tinkelman, says that the subsidies had been in the works long before that, calling them standard development incentives, an argument echoed by Mr. Molinaro.\u201cHow this has gotten twisted around really makes us sad,\u201d he said.For his part, Mr. Molinaro says the county development agency wasn\u2019t under his direct purview, though its members are approved by the county executive. He added that Tinkelman\u2019s contracts with the county were competitively bid, and \u201cminuscule\u201d in terms of the millions in design and architectural spending by the Dutchess County government.Mr. Molinaro has seized on the conviction of Mr. Percoco as emblematic of the administration\u2019s problems. After Mr. Percoco was sentenced, Mr. Molinaro released a statement saying, \u201cAndrew Cuomo was sentenced today. He just doesn\u2019t have to do the time.\u201dThe Cuomo campaign noted that the governor was not accused of any wrongdoing in the Percoco case, and that its political ads targeting Mr. Molinaro were meant to highlight his own potential pay-to-play issues, and were not meant as ad hominem attacks.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, did not address Mr. Molinaro\u2019s call for more disclosure about Ms. Lee\u2019s finances, but reiterated that the alleged connections between the Tinkelman job for Ms. Adams and county contracts were \u201csurely unethical and possibly criminal.\u201d\u201cMolinaro should worry about his illegal conduct under the current law before proposing a new law,\u201d Ms. Lever said. \u201cThe real question is why Marc Molinaro violated the public officers law.\u201dMr. Molinaro and Ms. Adams are expecting their second child this November, not long after Election Day, at which point the political attacks should end.And not a moment too soon, said Mr. Molinaro, who said that his wife hadn\u2019t really appreciated his bringing Ms. Lee into the skirmish, either.\u201cI went home and my wife said, \u2018Don\u2019t attack her,\u2019\u201d Mr. Molinaro said, adding that his wife was educated, competent and intent on not being a political pawn. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be dragged into any of this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capital of Laos Seeks Stronger Ties to China", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetVIENTIANE, Laos \u2014 Two decades ago, this sleepy city on the Mekong River was just starting to pave its streets.Today, Vientiane, the Laotian capital, is abuzz with change. Cars choke the paved city streets, and the downtown area is brimming with cafes, restaurants and bars catering to the small but growing middle class.In recent years, Chinese investment in resource-rich Laos has strengthened the country\u2019s economy, which is projected to grow by 7 percent this year. Vientiane\u2019s hot property market reflects this trend. Hoping that China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative will improve connectivity with its neighbor, Laos is preparing for a new wave of Chinese investment in its property sector.Crucial to these hopes is a 260-mile, $5 billion rail line that Beijing seeks to extend through Laos to Thailand, a much larger market.The completion of the rail line will bring a major change to the city, connecting landlocked Laos to China\u2019s extensive rail network, which will bring tourism and property investment, said Tony Saiyalath, managing director at RentsBuy, a property company based in Vientiane.\u201cThat will bring the property market alive,\u201d he said. \u201cEven right now, people are starting to buy \u2014 they already know the locations of where the stations are.\u201dThe increase in Chinese investment is due in part to a new policy of \u201ctransforming assets into capital,\u201d which Laos\u2019s communist government introduced five years ago. Under the policy, state-owned property can be privatized to attract foreign investment. The plan was especially appealing to Chinese investors, who acquired most of the high-end property in Vientiane. Prices went up sharply in 2014, but have stabilized, while rents have dropped by 20 to 30 percent since 2016, partly because Chinese mining companies have reduced their Laos operations after concessions expired.Chinese businessmen are the dominant property investors in Vientiane, along with a mix of Laotian, Vietnamese and Thai investors, Mr. Saiyalath said. Chinese companies are also players in the largest property developments in the city. This is apparent on the east end of downtown Vientiane\u2019s riverside, where the Laotian and French colonial architecture yields to a mile-long stretch of prime real estate developed by the Camce Investment (Lao) Company, a joint venture between China CAMC Engineering and the Laotian construction company Krittaphong Group. With its investment, Camce is aiming to draw wealthy locals and foreigners.The Landmark compound on the east end of the Camce development combines high-end residential, hotel, restaurant and event spaces to create an exclusive, gated community. Landmark Diplomatic Residence offers luxury apartments for rent only, from $1,000 to $2,200 a month, said Neo Liang, a Chinese manager at Camce\u2019s marketing office. Next door, offering unobstructed views of the Mekong River and Thailand on the other side, is the five-star Landmark Mekong Riverside Hotel, where President Barack Obama stayed in the presidential suite during his visit to Laos in 2016.Farther upstream, ASEM Villa features 50 fully furnished and decorated \u201cmansion villas\u201d for rent, starting at $4,500 a month. Mr. Liang said the gated community was more than 90 percent occupied, with a variety of tenants.\u201cThey\u2019re from all over \u2014 Koreans, Japanese, Chinese, Singaporeans,\u201d he said.A visit to ASEM Villa showed a strong presence by Chinese state-owned companies, including China Railway Group, which is building the rail line to Vientiane, and PowerChina, which has numerous projects of its own and via subsidiaries throughout Laos. Other offices with Chinese tenants included a Belt and Road information center and a Chinese culture center. The Singaporean ambassador\u2019s residence and the European Union\u2019s office for Laos are also there.The area includes another five-star hotel, the Don Chan Palace. At 14 floors, it is the country\u2019s tallest. Like the Landmark compound, Don Chan Palace has a large banquet hall and convention center. On a recent visit, the lobbies of both hotels were populated primarily by Chinese businessmen.Vientiane New World, an outdoor mall on the development\u2019s west end, is Camce\u2019s most public-facing development. It features a small office building for the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei \u2014 whose advertisements flutter on lampposts downtown \u2014 and a \u201cwalking street\u201d with restaurants, cafes, shops and a beer garden.Chinese businesses are featured prominently at Vientiane New World, with regional Chinese restaurants offering cuisine from Liaoning and Shandong Provinces, as well as Old Chengdu, a high-end Sichuanese restaurant where several dishes cost upward of $100 \u2014 a month\u2019s rent for the average Vientiane resident.Chinese expatriates and tourists are not the only diners to be found at these restaurants. For middle-class and wealthier Laotians, dining at a Chinese restaurant is a sign of sophistication and worldliness.On weekend nights, Vientiane New World\u2019s beer garden is filled with young Laotians eating and drinking at dozens of tiny open-air bars and restaurants, typically constructed with corrugated metal. Offering a relatively upscale alternative to the night markets farther down the riverside, each establishment\u2019s music competes with that of the neighbors.Camce\u2019s riverside investment is but one Chinese project transforming the city. Shanghai Wanfeng has invested $300 million of a projected $5 billion total in That Luang Lake, which has just begun its second of four phases that are scheduled for completion in 2032. Of the 11 buildings already built, four condominiums are selling units, Mr. Saiyalath said. Two more buildings \u2014 a hotel and serviced apartments \u2014 are preparing to open.The project is in an economic zone, where foreign investors can buy condominiums. Mr. Saiyalath said he hoped the government would adopt a new law to allow foreigners to own condominiums outside economic zones. In Cambodia, which has such a law, foreign money, especially Chinese, has flooded the property market.\u201cOnce this law is in place, foreigners will be more confident to invest here,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at Cambodia. Our country needs to be developed quickly.\u201dChina is prioritizing Laos in its Belt and Road investment push. Last November, President Xi Jinping of China and Bounnhang Vorachith, his counterpart in Laos, oversaw the signing of a memorandum of understanding to deepen cooperation through a new Laos-China economic corridor.\u201cChina sees Laos as providing a pathway for rail and road connectivity into Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia,\u201d said Brian Eyler, director of the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan policy research center in Washington. Thailand\u2019s military leaders have dragged their feet on the rail line between Bangkok and Vientiane that they originally said would be completed in March. Thailand\u2019s Transport Ministry now projects the line will be completed by 2023, at the earliest.\u201cThe fate of the rail connection from Vientiane to Bangkok is uncertain,\u201d Mr. Eyler said, \u201cwhich means China\u2019s big Belt and Rail push into Southeast Asia could end inside of landlocked Laos.\u201dThailand is wary of getting too close to China, while the Laotian government has been keen to tap into easy Chinese money, said George McLeod, a consultant based in Bangkok.\u201cThailand\u2019s low-end manufacturing sector has already been gutted by Chinese competition, and the leadership is acutely aware that closer ties would take a further toll on their economy,\u201d Mr. McLeod said. \u201cLaos is even more susceptible to becoming an unequal partner: It has a tiny population of under seven million and lies directly on China\u2019s southern border with no buffer in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hit Iran With Oil Sanctions. So Far, They\u2019re Working.", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Mr. Trump\u2019s approach worked too well, oil prices would spike and hurt the American economy. If it failed, international companies would continue trading with Iran, leaving the Islamic Republic unscathed, defiant and free to restart its nuclear program.But the policy has been effective without either of those nasty consequences, at least so far.Nearly two months before American oil sanctions go into effect, Iran\u2019s crude exports are plummeting. International oil companies, including those from countries that are still committed to the nuclear agreement, are bailing out of deals with Tehran.And remarkably, the price of oil in the United States has risen only modestly while gasoline prices have essentially remained flat. The current global oil price hovers around $80 a barrel, $60 below the highs of a decade ago.\u201cThe president is doing the opposite of what the experts said, and it seems to be working out,\u201d said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a research and consulting firm.Initial signs of a foreign-policy success could benefit Mr. Trump politically as Republicans try to hold on to control of Congress. The president and lawmakers allied with him could point to the administration\u2019s aggressive stand toward Iran as evidence that his unconventional approach to diplomacy has been much more fruitful and far less costly than Democrats have been willing to acknowledge.The administration\u2019s tactical advantage could be fleeting, of course, if Iran retaliates with cyberattacks or militarily, incites more militia violence in Iraq, or revives its nuclear program.The most important reason that predictions of higher oil prices have been wrong is that there is plenty of oil sloshing around the world. The United States has become a huge exporter of oil in the last several years and is now shipping roughly the same amount \u2014 more than two million barrels a day \u2014 that Iran did earlier this year.Trade tensions and economic problems in developing countries like Turkey and Argentina might also be slowing the growth of energy demand.Another thing in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor is that while governments in Europe and Asia have publicly opposed his decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement, many businesses in those places have made a different calculation. They have concluded that it makes little financial sense to risk investments in and trade with the United States by doing business with Iran.Until Mr. Trump\u2019s May announcement, Western allies considered the nuclear deal with Iran a success. In exchange for agreeing to strict limits on its nuclear program and international monitoring, Iran was allowed to re-enter the global oil market. The deal lifted restrictions on foreign companies doing business in Iran and gave the country access to frozen assets overseas.After Nov. 4, companies that buy, ship or insure shipments of Iranian oil can be excluded from the American market and banking system unless they obtain waivers from the administration.Trump administration officials say its sanctions are designed to punish Iran for its interventions in Syria, Yemen and other countries.For Iran, the timing could not be worse. The country has lost influence over oil prices as other producers have eclipsed its energy industry, which has not kept up with technological advances.At the beginning of the century, Iranian officials could shake the oil markets by staging military maneuvers or merely hinting that they would reduce supplies. Back then, American oil production was falling and global demand for crude was surging.But those days are long gone. Like the United States, countries including Canada and Brazil are also exporting more oil. Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have also increased production, helping to keep oil prices in check. Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies are only too happy to support the sanctions against their chief rival, Iran, by expanding exports.$150a barrelPrice of crude oil100$70500West-Texas intermediate\u201900\u201905\u201910\u201915\u2019182.5million barrels a day2.2 mil.U.S. oil exports2.01.51.00.50\u201900\u201905\u201910\u201915\u201918$150a barrel2.5million barrels a day2.2 mil.Price of crude oilU.S. oil exports2.01001.5$701.0500.50West-Texas intermediate0\u201900\u201905\u201910\u201915\u201918\u201900\u201905\u201910\u201915\u201918Sources: Thomson Retuers; Energy Information AdministrationBy The New York TimesThat has provided a buffer for the global oil market as Iranian exports dropped by more than 25 percent, or around 600,000 barrels a day, between June and the start of September. Exports are expected to drop by an additional half-million barrels when American sanctions go into effect. All told, exports could drop from a high of 2.7 million barrels this year to fewer than a million in 2019 \u2014 lowering the country\u2019s exports to less than 1 percent of the global market, from about 3 percent earlier this year.That would further squeeze the Iranian government, which had $50 billion in oil revenue last year; oil and petroleum products make up about 70 percent of the country\u2019s exports by value.\u201cFor Iran, it shows the leverage that they have had through oil has not only diminished but may never return,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, a senior fellow specializing in energy at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t care if they are going to lose business in Iran. People don\u2019t feel desperate for supply.\u2019\u2019The sanctions are so onerous that even companies from countries opposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s approach are withdrawing from Iran.South Korea, Iran\u2019s third-biggest oil market last year, halted purchases in August after buying 194,000 barrels a day in July. Shipments to France and Japan, two other major markets, are also dropping.OMV, the Austrian oil company, recently backed out of an agreement with the National Iranian Oil Company to evaluate oil fields. Hellenic Petroleum of Greece, Spain\u2019s Repsol and Italy\u2019s Eni are winding down oil purchases.\u201cBig international companies have to ask themselves what risks are they willing to take on,\u201d said David Adesnik, the foundation\u2019s director of research. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have a business in the U.S. you can be cut off from our financial system, and that\u2019s not something a truly global firm can afford.\u201dThe next big shoe to drop appears to be India, Iran\u2019s second-biggest oil market after China. Reliance Industries, the nation\u2019s leading refiner, has said it will stop buying Iranian crude when American sanctions kick in. And the State Bank of India, the country\u2019s largest lender, has told refiners that it will block payments for Iranian crude.American officials are waging a public and private campaign to persuade foreign leaders to cut economic ties with Iran \u2014 and to buy more American oil.\u201cPurchases of Iranian crude will go to zero from every country or sanctions will be imposed,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said.The sanctions could allow Russian and Chinese companies to replace Western businesses in Iran. After Washington denied it a waiver, the French oil giant Total pulled out of a contract to develop the South Pars gas field, leaving a potential opening to China\u2019s CNPC to increase its investment in the field.China, which imports a half-million barrels of Iranian crude a day, can more easily resist American policy than other countries. That\u2019s because its smallest refiners and domestic banks have little or no exposure to the United States.Russia is another obstacle.Gazprom and Rosneft, two state-controlled Russian oil and gas giants, are negotiating oil development deals worth roughly $10 billion with the Iranian oil ministry.For its part, Iran is not sitting still. The state-run Iranian tanker company is storing oil on its fleet of supertankers rather than shut down production, which can damage wells. Iran could smuggle oil over land through Pakistan and Afghanistan, and barter with trading companies to get around sanctions.International transactions are largely denominated in dollars, which strengthens American sanctions. Over time, Iran\u2019s oil trade could shift to other currencies, particularly the Chinese renminbi.\u201cWe will continue by all means to both produce and export,\u201d President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said recently on state TV. \u201cOil is in the front line of confrontation and resistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hacking of America", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "OpinionPolitical and technological disruption have fed off each other since the nation\u2019s founding. Now they are dangerously out of whack. Supported byMs. Lepore is a historian at Harvard and a staff writer at The New Yorker.Every government is a machine, and every machine has its tinkerers \u2014 and its jams. From the start, machines have driven American democracy and, just as often, crippled it. The printing press, the telegraph, the radio, the television, the mainframe, cable TV, the internet: Each had wild-eyed boosters who promised that a machine could hold the republic together, or make it more efficient, or repair the damage caused by the last machine. Each time, this assertion would be both right and terribly wrong. But lately, it\u2019s mainly wrong, chiefly because the rules that prevail on the internet were devised by people who fundamentally don\u2019t believe in government.The Constitution itself was understood by its framers as a machine, a precisely constructed instrument whose measures \u2014 its separation of powers, its checks and balances \u2014 were mechanical devices, as intricate as the gears of a clock, designed to thwart tyrants, mobs and demagogues, and to prevent the forming of factions. Once those factions began to appear, it became clear that other machines would be needed to establish stable parties. \u201cThe engine is the press,\u201d Thomas Jefferson, an inveterate inventor, wrote in 1799.The United States was founded as a political experiment; it seemed natural that it should advance and grow through technological experiment. Different technologies have offered different fixes. Equality was the promise of the penny press, newspapers so cheap that anyone could afford them. The New York Sun was first published in 1833. \u201cIt shines for all\u201d was its common-man motto. Union was the promise of the telegraph. \u201cThe greatest revolution of modern times, and indeed of all time, for the amelioration of society, has been effected by the magnetic telegraph,\u201d The Sun announced, proclaiming \u201cthe annihilation of space.\u201dTime was being annihilated too. As The New York Herald pointed out, the telegraph appeared to make it possible for \u201cthe whole nation\u201d to have \u201cthe same idea at the same moment.\u201d Frederick Douglass was convinced that the great machines of the age were ushering in an era of worldwide political revolution. \u201cThanks to steam navigation and electric wires,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca revolution cannot be confined to the place or the people where it may commence but flashes with lightning speed from heart to heart.\u201d Henry David Thoreau raised an eyebrow: \u201cWe are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.\u201dEven that savage war didn\u2019t diminish Americans\u2019 faith that technology could solve the problem of political division. In the 1920s, Herbert Hoover, as secretary of commerce, rightly anticipated that radio, the nation\u2019s next great mechanical experiment, would make it possible for political candidates and officeholders to speak to voters without the bother and expense of traveling to meet them. NBC began radio broadcasting in 1926, CBS in 1928. By the end of the decade, nearly every household would have a wireless. Hoover promised that radio would make Americans \u201cliterally one people.\u201dThat radio fulfilled this promise for as long as it did is the result of decisions made by Mr. Hoover, a Republican who believed that the government had a role to play in overseeing the airwaves by issuing licenses for frequencies to broadcasting companies and regulating their use. \u201cThe ether is a public medium,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand its use must be for the public benefit.\u201d He pressed for passage of the Radio Act of 1927, one of the most consequential and underappreciated acts of Progressive reform \u2014 insisting that programmers had to answer to the public interest. That commitment was extended to television in 1949 when the Federal Communications Commission, the successor to the Federal Radio Commission, established the Fairness Doctrine, a standard for television news that required a \u201creasonably balanced presentation\u201d of different political views.After the war, computers that had been built by the military split the electorate into so many atoms. Univac, one of the first commercial computers, was completed in 1951 for the Census Bureau, to count and sort its data. The next year, CBS used the Univac on election night. \u201cA Univac is a fabulous electronic machine, which we have borrowed to help us predict this election from the basis of early returns as they come in,\u201d Charles Collingwood told his audience as the evening\u2019s coverage began. Walter Cronkite read the early, East Coast returns; Edward R. Murrow provided the commentary. Around 9:30 p.m., when the Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, was ahead in the popular vote and the Democrat, Adlai E. Stevenson, was winning the electoral vote, Cronkite said, \u201cAnd now to find out perhaps what this all means, at least in the electronic age, let\u2019s turn to that electronic miracle, the electronic brain, Univac.\u201dBut when the camera turned to Collingwood, he could get no answer from Univac. Murrow ventured that perhaps the computer was cautious. At 10:30 p.m., Cronkite turned again to Collingwood. Univac was having \u201ca little bit of trouble,\u201d Collingwood said. Murrow called the election for Eisenhower. Fifteen minutes later, Univac made the same call. Cronkite smiled and said, \u201cI might note that Univac is running a few moments behind Ed Murrow.\u201d The next day, Murrow, speaking on CBS Radio, celebrated the triumph of man over machine: \u201cWe are in a measure released from the petty tyranny of those who assert that they can tell us what we think, what we believe, what we will do, what we hope and what we fear, without consulting us \u2014 all of us.\u201dThat release proved short-lived. By 1959, a team of Democratic strategists was developing a secret plan known as Project Macroscope. They wanted to build a machine that could predict voter responses to any conceivable issue or candidate, a Univac for politics. Newton Minow, an Adlai Stevenson campaign adviser who would soon become chairman of the F.C.C., wrote to the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., \u201cMy own opinion is that such a thing (a) cannot work, (b) is immoral, (c) should be declared illegal.\u201d Project Macroscope went ahead anyway. We live, each minute of every day, within its clockwork, and under its giant, all-seeing eye.All of this history was forgotten or ignored by the people who wrote the rules of the internet and who peer out upon the world from their offices in Silicon Valley and boast of their disdain for the past. But the building of a new machinery of communications began even before the opening of the internet. In the 1980s, conservatives campaigned to end the Fairness Doctrine in favor of a public-interest-based rule for broadcasters, a market-based rule: If people liked it, broadcasters could broadcast it.Wired began publishing the same year that the Newt Gingrich-affiliated Progress and Freedom Foundation was founded. Its key thinker was the irrepressible George Gilder, who in the 1970s had achieved celebrity as an anti-feminist and in the 1980s as a supply-sider. At a 1994 Progress and Freedom Foundation meeting in Aspen, Colo., Mr. Gilder, along with the futurists Alvin Toffler, Esther Dyson and George Keyworth, wrote a \u201cMagna Carta for the Knowledge Age,\u201d which called for \u201cremoving barriers to competition and massively deregulating the fast-growing telecommunications and computing industries.\u201dThe machine is no longer precisely constructed, its every action no longer measured. The machine is fix upon fix, hack after hack, its safety mechanisms sawed off. It has no brake, no fail-safe, no checks, no balances. It clatters. It thunders. It crushes the Constitution in its gears. The smell of smoke wafts out of the engine room. The machine is on fire.Jill Lepore is a professor of American history at Harvard, a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of \u201cThese Truths: A History of the United States,\u201d from which parts of this essay are adapted.Advertisement"}

There are mobsters and corrupt cops on one end, prostitutes on the other end, and people like Vinnie and Candy somewhere between, exerting power and control where they can but beholden to men who can snuff out their ambitions \u2014 or possibly their lives.\u201cDo you know what are the two biggest crime fighters we have in this city? Sheet rock and cranes.\u201dThe great novelist and screenwriter Richard Price, who scripted this episode, plants this little detonation as an ironic counterpoint to trajectories that are mostly going up, up, up for our cast of characters. The big-money legitimacy of the adult film business on the West Coast has started to trickle over to the East, where crude peep show loops are starting to give way to higher production values, greater artistic ambition, legitimate representation and even a few awards nominations. For Lori, that means hope that she can parlay her supporting actress bid into a trip to Los Angeles and an honest-to-goodness agent \u2014 though C.C. will surely have something to say about both. For Candy, that means accelerated lessons in stagecraft from Genevieve Fury (Dagmara Dominczyk), an Eastern European director she idolizes, and a stronger case that Harvey should invest in more in her celluloid dreams.Elsewhere, Vinnie whisks Abby away from the filth and stress of the neighborhood and gives her a tour of his past in Coney Island and a vision of their domesticated future. Paul also eyes a new, classier joint than the thriving gay bar he currently operates, and also maybe a way out from under Rudy Pipilo\u2019s protection \u2014 which lately hasn\u2019t been much protection at all. The pimps may be feeling marginalized, but otherwise, everyone is making money: the bars, the parlors, the peeps and the studio, not to mention the mobsters backing them and the cops paid to look the other way. For this illegal, violent, exploitative and viciously patriarchal business, this is as good as it gets.Not everyone is a winner, however. The witty cold open stations Larry Brown at the bus depot, waiting for the next beautiful turnip to fall off the truck. He seems to have found the perfect mark in Brenda Peterson (Kyra Adams), exactly the type of a doe-eyed country girl he\u2019s turned out in the past. He thinks she\u2019s looking for direction when in fact she\u2019s looking for directions, past him and into the audition space of an adult film producer. She\u2019s cutting out the middle man. Price gives him a fine punch line (\u201cYou know they\u2019re going to exploit you, right?\u201d) and an even better topper later, when Larry asks Candy if he can take his performing talents to the silver screen. If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em.There are also faint tremors of a reckoning to come. Success breeds imitation and competition, an open market for other lowlifes to stake their claim. Pipilo may be swimming in Lincolns now, but his complacency has created opportunities for rivals, who have brazenly placed a new parlor between two of his and who have started making overtures to Paul, offering better protection for his clientele. In many ways, this shadow economy works a lot like the legitimate one: It is constantly evolving, and it forces its participants to adapt or die. The main difference is, that last part is more literal.Outtakes\u2022 \u201cEvolving\u201d isn\u2019t quite the word to describe what\u2019s happening in the peep show business, with the plexiglass removed and clients now able to get a grope before the window closes. It\u2019s a terrible idea on its face \u2014 in a desperate field, it says something that a couple of women walk away immediately \u2014 but poor hydraulics does even the score a little.\u2022 Harvey\u2019s joke about the blind guy at the Seder is funny enough on its own, but David Krumholtz\u2019s inability to complete the punch line without cracking up is funnier still.\u2022 From \u201cFreaks and Geeks\u201d onward, James Franco has proved particularly adept at facile charm, using his good looks and easy charisma to sell women an idea of himself that reality can never match. When Vinnie tells Abby, \u201cStick with me, kid, I\u2019ll show you the world,\u201d he may be sincere, but he\u2019s not the type of guy to deliver.\u2022 Harvey frequently blasts Candy for her artier touches, but the posters on his wall tell another story: \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d \u201cJules and Jim,\u201d \u201cBring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.\u201d There\u2019s a secret cinephile wish here that the graceless practicalities of the skin trade are repressing.\u2022 Genevieve Fury\u2019s real name is Agnieszka, which may be David Simon\u2019s homage to Agnieszka Holland, the great Polish filmmaker who directed episodes of Simon\u2019s \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cTreme.\u201d Long before moving into television, Holland earned an Oscar nomination for the screenplay to her 1990 film \u201cEuropa, Europa,\u201d about a German Jewish boy who tries to escape the Holocaust by posing as a non-Jew. For all the acclaim that film received, it is out of print on DVD and hasn\u2019t surfaced on digital platforms. It would be a shame if it slipped through the cracks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Typhoon Mangkhut Wreaks Havoc in Philippines, Leaving at Least 25 Dead", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCLAVERIA, Philippines \u2014 Typhoon Mangkhut, which meteorologists called the most powerful storm in the world this year, swept through the northern end of the Philippine island of Luzon, leaving at least 25 people dead and wreaking havoc. It uprooted trees, ripped off roofs, set off landslides and flooded farms and roads.Yet amid the suffering, there was also relief that the situation was not much worse. The initial casualty toll was far lower than officials had feared in the days before the storm made landfall early Saturday on the Philippines\u2019 largest and most populous island.But it could be days or weeks before the storm\u2019s true human toll is known. It will also take time to assess how much damage was done to the country\u2019s prime agricultural region and to the economy. Damage to farms could be extensive \u2014 and costly for the nation. The region is the country\u2019s largest food producer, and the destruction of crops could lead to food shortages, higher costs and inflation.From the road above Robert Tumaneng\u2019s fish ponds on Saturday, the floodwaters extended as far as the eye could see, with the tips of palm trees and the thatched roofs of wooden shacks barely visible beneath the caramel-colored water.\u201cIt was shaking like an earthquake,\u201d said Mr. Tumaneng, 55, a fish farmer in the town of Claveria on Luzon\u2019s north coast. \u201cThis storm was different because the wind was low to the ground like it was crawling and destroying everything,\u201d he said after the storm hit.The number of confirmed fatalities is almost certain to rise as people begin assessing damage from the typhoon. But if the numbers are limited, it will be, at least in part, a testament to the preparedness of authorities following disastrous storms in recent years.Communications in the disaster zone were hampered by power and cell service outages, and access was difficult in many places because of flooding and road closures, making it hard to evaluate the storm\u2019s full effect.Trees and coconuts were strewn across the roads, which were deserted except for volunteer crews removing debris and the occasional emergency vehicle.In one community after another, emergency workers reported downed trees and badly damaged buildings. Signs, tin roofs and gates that had been torn free flew about.\u201cAt this stage, it is still too early to understand the full impact of the typhoon,\u201d said Gina Maramag, spokeswoman in the Philippines for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \u201cEarly indications suggest that the prompt evacuations made by local authorities have mitigated the impact on civilians.\u201dAmong the casualties was a family of four killed when a landslide struck their home in the Cordillera Mountains, south of Claveria, according to a top government official, Francis Tolentino. He spoke in a television interview from the disaster zone on Saturday evening.A CARE Philippines Emergency Response Team that reached the town of Aparri on the north coast reported that some structures were damaged by the storm, including an evacuation center. But much of the surrounding area had yet to be assessed.\u201cThe northernmost towns of Cagayan are believed to be badly hit and it is still difficult to access these areas as of the moment,\u201d said Madel Montejo, a member of that emergency response team. \u201cThe people say they need food, water, dry clothes and shelter repair materials.\u201dThe typhoon, with wind speeds reaching 170 miles an hour before reaching land, could have caused far more damage if it had hit Luzon farther south and closer to Manila \u2014 a megacity of more than 12 million people. The capital was hit by heavy rain and strong winds, with trees uprooted and flooding in some areas.More than 1,600 families were evacuated after the Marikina River, which runs through part of the city, began rising quickly because of runoff from nearby mountains. The police said the body of a child, about 10 years old, was found floating in the river.The area of Luzon that the typhoon hit hardest is primarily agricultural and, with more than four million people, is less densely populated than other parts of the country.\u201cThe country has learned a lot from the Haiyan tragedy, which explains more effective mandatory evacuation and coping measures in place,\u201d said Richard Heydarian, a political analyst in Manila. \u201cBut the economic costs could be severe.\u201dIn Claveria, a town of about 30,000 in Cagayan Province, the Antonio family was one that did not evacuate \u2014 at first. But at about 1 a.m., when strong winds made them fear for their safety, they moved to the shelter of their of their in-laws\u2019 sturdier home.Marck James Antonio, 24, stayed behind and was struck in the right temple by part of the roof that flew off, leaving a big gash.\u201cThis was the strongest and the worst storm that I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life,\u201d said his mother, Teresita Antonio, 54. \u201cI was crying because I don\u2019t know how I will be able to afford to fix my house.\u201dNo rescuers have reached the area yet.In the town of Sanchez-Mira, a dozen miles east, local officials said they had ensured people\u2019s safety by pushing them to take shelter at the community hall. Eventually, 271 people complied. Some had to be rounded up by police car.\u201cSome people didn\u2019t want to evacuate their homes but I forced them,\u201d said Rewin Valenzuela, 48, a community leader. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t make them evacuate, they could have lost their lives. We evacuated everyone to prevent loss of life.\u201dLeaving the Philippines behind on Saturday evening, Typhoon Mangkhut took aim at Hong Kong and southern China, where it was expected to make landfall on Sunday.While winds had weakened, forecasts indicated that it would still pack the power of a Category 2 storm when it came ashore, possibly near Maoming, a big petrochemicals center.The area forecast to be affected has relatively few low-lying towns that would be vulnerable to the rising sea levels of a storm surge, and Guangdong, China\u2019s most populous province, has extensive experience with typhoons and is well prepared.If Mangkhut shifts slightly to the north, though, it could hit Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta area, one of the world\u2019s most important manufacturing hubs and home to more than 60 million people.Hong Kong itself is quite resilient to typhoons and although heavy rain could trigger landslides, the former British colony is not especially vulnerable to flooding with few low-lying areas.The sprawling river delta around it, however, is barely above sea level and has struggled with flooding despite years of investment in drainage systems.Hannah Beech reported from Claveria, Philippines, and Richard C. Paddock from Manila. Kimberly dela Cruz contributed reporting from Claveria, Sol Vanzi from Manila, Felipe Villamor from Angeles City, and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Botching the Great Recession", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy the slump went on so much longer than it should have.Opinion ColumnistIt has been ten years since the failure of Lehman sent the global financial system into freefall. Why is this date different from any other date? No particular reason. But round-number anniversaries do have the virtue of giving people a reason to look back at experience, and maybe even learn from it.So how does the crisis response look 10 years later? Well, it could have been worse. But it could and should have been much better.Let\u2019s start with what went kind of right. Faced with an imminent financial meltdown, policymakers by and large did what needed to be done to limit the damage. Their actions included bank bailouts, which should have been fairer \u2014 too many bankers got bailed out along with their banks \u2014 but were effective. There were also many emergency provisions of credit, including little-known but crucial things like maintaining dollar credit lines to non-U.S. central banks.The result was that the acute phase of the financial crisis \u2014 what I still think of as the \u201cOh God we\u2019re all gonna die\u201d phase \u2014 was relatively brief. It was scary and did immense damage \u2014 America lost 6 \u00bd million jobs in the year after Lehman fell. But as you can see in Figure 1, measures of financial stress fell off rapidly in 2009, and were more or less back to normal by the summer.Rapid financial recovery did not, however, produce rapid recovery for the economy as a whole. As the same figure shows, unemployment stayed high for many years; we didn\u2019t return to anything that felt remotely like full employment (leaving aside the question of whether we\u2019re there even now) until late in Obama\u2019s second term.Why didn\u2019t financial stability bring a rapid bounceback? Because financial disruption wasn\u2019t at the heart of the slump. The really big factor was the bursting of the housing bubble \u2014 of which the banking crisis was a symptom. As Figure 2 shows, the housing bust led directly to a dramatic drop in residential investment, enough in itself to produce a deep recession, and recovery was both slow and incomplete.The plunge in home prices also destroyed a lot of household wealth, depressing consumer spending in general.So what should we have done to produce a faster recovery? Private spending was depressed; monetary policy was ineffective because we were at the zero lower bound on interest rates. So we needed fiscal expansion, some combination of spending and tax cuts.And we did, of course, get the ARRA \u2014 the Obama stimulus. But it was too small and, even more important, faded out much too quickly; see Figure 3.Why, then, didn\u2019t we get the fiscal policy we should have had? There were, I\u2019d say, multiple villains in the story.Second, Very Serious People pivoted very early from concern about the unemployed \u2014 hey, they probably lacked the necessary skills \u2014 to hysteria over deficits. By 2011, unemployment was still over 9 percent, but all the Beltway crowd wanted to talk about was the menace of the debt.Finally, Republicans blocked attempts to rescue the economy and tried to strangle government spending every step of the way. They claimed that this was because they cared about fiscal responsibility \u2014 but it was obvious to anyone paying attention (which unfortunately didn\u2019t include almost anyone in the news media) that this was an insincere, bad-faith argument. As we\u2019ve now seen, they don\u2019t care at all about deficits as long as a Republican is in the White House and the deficits are the counterpart of tax cuts for the rich.The end result was that policy moved quickly and fairly effectively to rescue banks, then turned its back on mass unemployment. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s both sad and nasty. And there\u2019s every reason to believe that if we have another crisis, it will happen all over again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Federal Workers Brace for New Push on Trump Anti-Labor Goals", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration seemed to suffer a major setback recently when a judge rebuffed its efforts to impose tighter labor rules in federal agencies.As a result, the administration may yet achieve the same goals. And according to workers and union officials, the effort has already created a climate of anxiety across much of the government.Agencies have considerable leeway in their negotiations with unions, which the judge\u2019s ruling generally did not question. The judge simply ruled that management is required to bargain in good faith, and that the president cannot bias the process from the outset or take certain issues off the table. Legal experts say that within those broad parameters, the agencies may be free to tack in the president\u2019s preferred direction, as long as they do so on their own.Few agencies epitomize this approach better than the Social Security Administration. Union officials say that while management has generally taken a more confrontational posture since the George W. Bush administration, the atmosphere has been poisonous at times under President Trump.In carrying out the executive orders, which took effect in July, managers scrapped several established union practices. Union officials could no longer use agency equipment like computers for work on behalf of colleagues; they could not use agency office space to meet with workers and store documents; and they could not use the agency\u2019s email system to communicate with colleagues about workplace issues.Because the executive orders also called for reining in job protections, like the timetable for correcting underperformance and the options for appeals, some managers made clear to workers that their jobs were in greater jeopardy, union officials say.William Price, president of a union representing Social Security workers in Indiana, said that not long after Mr. Trump signed the orders, a supervisor at an office in Vincennes, Ind., made an ominous comment to a subordinate, saying he supposed that employees could be fired for anything now.Mr. Price said the comment, which was attested to by an employee who heard it firsthand but who asked to remain anonymous, inspired fear in the office and reflected an increasingly hostile stand by management as the new rules took effect. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the agency implement any initiative with this kind of fervor,\u201d he said.On Wednesday, four days after the judge\u2019s ruling, the administration rescinded the provisions that had been ruled illegal. It says it is contemplating its next legal moves.In the meantime, union leaders worry that the Social Security Administration will seek to enact the same provisions through a short-circuited bargaining process. Under that approach, the agency could declare an impasse, opening the door for an outside panel \u2014 a body composed of presidential appointees \u2014 simply to impose most of what management had sought.John Gage, the chief negotiator for workers at the Social Security Administration, said that he had asked his administration counterparts to affirm that they would not base their contract offers on the provisions of the executive orders when negotiations resume in September, and that they had refused. At the moment, he said, \u201ctheir proposals exactly reflect the executive orders.\u201dMark Hinkle, a Social Security Administration spokesman, said only that the agency and the unions \u201care currently engaged in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement.\u201d The agency declined to comment further on any assertions by workers or union leaders.The rules that applied before the executive orders gave underperforming workers up to 120 days to improve under a structured plan or face termination, depending on the agency. After that, they could appeal their firing to an arbitrator or a government appeals board, a process that typically took several months.The recent executive orders directed government agencies to try to cap the performance improvement period at 30 days and scale back the avenues for appeals, eliminating the arbitration option. While bringing a case to the appeals board, known as the Merit Systems Protection Board, would still be possible, that can be a more daunting prospect given a backlog built up amid Trump-era vacancies.Because of the discretion involved in carrying out the orders, different agencies approached the task in vastly different ways. Union officials representing workers at the Defense Department say the agency largely refrained from making or seeking changes laid out in the executive orders.At Social Security, the agency essentially rammed through many of the provisions laid out in the executive orders in July, before undoing them in response to the judge\u2019s ruling last week.Union officials say that during the intervening weeks, managers in some parts of the agency began to scrutinize employees more aggressively.\u201cI have noticed a difference in the overall morale of the employees,\u201d said Sonia Saldivar, the president of a union representing Social Security workers in New Mexico. \u201cEmployees are scared now. They\u2019re scared they\u2019re going to lose their job.\u201dRalph de Juliis, the president of a union that represents Social Security workers in Oklahoma and Arkansas, said that the agency had begun trying to make changes unilaterally to employees\u2019 jobs and working conditions \u2014 like specific assignments \u2014 that the union previously would have been consulted on.Even as the pressure on workers increased, unions were at a new disadvantage in defending them. One of the executive orders instructed agencies to sharply reduce so-called official time \u2014 that is, the allotment of time for union officials to handle labor issues during work hours. At the Social Security Administration, roughly two dozen officials previously drew a full-time salary while spending most or all of their time on labor issues. The agency left them with no more than a few hours per week to devote to these responsibilities.Jeremy Maske, the president of a 300-member local in Des Moines, was one of those union officials. After returning to agency work full time in July, he typically woke up about 5 a.m. and spent two hours responding to email about union-related business, then worked on labor matters for several hours in the evening. He went to bed around midnight or 1 a.m. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in college again,\u201d Mr. Maske said in an interview last month.Some union officials reported that because grievance or arbitration proceedings typically take place during work hours, they chewed up scarce official time, sometimes making it impossible for union officials to attend. By contrast, the labor relations officials on the management side have no similar limits on the time they can devote to handling workers\u2019 cases.On Thursday, after the administration complied with the judge\u2019s order, union officials were told that they would be allowed back into their offices on agency property and that their access to email and their official time would be restored.But even with the reprieve for the union \u2014 and even if the judge\u2019s ruling is sustained on appeal \u2014 experts said the agency could negotiate on its own to achieve most of Mr. Trump\u2019s goals, in a process in which it ultimately holds the upper hand.From a judge\u2019s perspective, it may be nearly impossible to distinguish between an agency that takes a hard line with unions and workers at the behest of the president, and an agency that does so on its own initiative. And the latter may not be illegal.\u201cIt\u2019s not clear how they\u2019re required to change their actual behavior,\u201d said Jonathan Siegel, an expert on administrative law at George Washington University. \u201cThe legality of the action comes down to the motive with which the action is taken, and it\u2019s difficult to know what the motive is.\u201dErica Green contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economic Future Isn\u2019t What It Used to Be (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong run economic prospects fell sharply after the Great RecessionOpinion ColumnistLehman failed ten years and two weeks ago; this coming Wednesday will be the 10th anniversary of the enactment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, aka the bailout. In honor of the anniversary, there have been approximately 1,000,000,000 pieces reflecting on the 2008 financial crisis and its effects. Many have suggested, rightly, that the political fallout continues to shape our world today. But as far as I can tell, surprisingly few have focused on the long-run economic effects.What\u2019s odd about this relative neglect is that even a cursory look at the data suggests that these effects were huge. It\u2019s true that U.S. unemployment is back below what it was before the crisis; although it\u2019s not widely realized, euro area unemployment is also way down, not quite to eve-of-crisis levels but well below its pre-crisis average. But in both cases we\u2019ve returned to sort-of full employment at a much lower level of real GDP than informed people projected we\u2019d reach before the crisis struck.Economists use the term \u201cpotential output\u201d to refer to the maximum amount an economy can produce without inflationary overheating. This concept plays a central role in monetary policy, and some role in fiscal policy too. As I\u2019ll explain in a bit, the theoretical underpinnings of the concept look weaker now, in the light of post-crisis experience, than they used to. But for now, let\u2019s just note that a number of agencies, from the U.S. Congressional Budget Office to the International Monetary Fund, routinely produce estimates of current potential output and projections of future potential output.To be clear, these are model-based estimates, not actual data. And one possible story is that the models are all wrong, that we\u2019re looking at a construct that has nothing to do with reality. But as I said, these models matter for policy. So what do we find if we compare pre-crisis projections of potential output over the decade ahead to current estimates? The answer is, a huge downgrading of estimates of economic capacity on both sides of the Atlantic.This massive decline in GDP from what we used to expect, a full decade after the financial crisis, is a huge story \u2013 call it the Great Shortfall \u2014 that gets overlooked in the usual focus on short-term growth rates. What might explain it?This story is in effect, though not explicitly, the narrative underlying actual economic policy: the Fed and other central banks, which are the real actors in macroeconomic policy under current conditions, don\u2019t act as if they\u2019re very worried that a future recession might depress the economy not just in the short run but permanently. Fiscal authorities, to the extent that they think coherently about these issues at all \u2013 i.e., outside the current U.S. administration \u2013 also take the path of future economic potential mostly as a given.To be fair, CBO\u2019s projections try to take the incentive effects of tax policy and the effects of deficits on investment into account, but these are small change compared with what you would need to link the Great Recession to the massive downgrading of long-run growth projections.What\u2019s the evidence against this view? The most compelling evidence, cited by both Fat\u00e1s/Summers and Ball, is that the size of the Great Shortfall varies a lot between countries \u2013 and the countries whose estimated economic potential has taken the biggest hit are precisely the countries that had the biggest slumps in the economic crisis. Indeed, the relationship between output decline in the crisis and the fall in long-run potential GDP is pretty much one-for-one.Figure 3 shows the most extreme case, Greece, comparing actual and potential GDP as estimated by the IMF. As everyone knows, Greece has suffered a huge, Depression-level slump. According to the IMF, however, around half that slump is a decline in capacity rather than reduced utilization of capacity.What\u2019s going on? The IMF\u2019s method for calculating potential GDP basically reads any sustained slump as a decline in potential output relative to previous expectations, and this interpretation of decline affects both its projections of the future and its interpretation of the past: if it concludes that potential output in 2010 was really low, the IMF marks down its estimates of potential in previous years too.Which brings me to a second possible explanation of the Great Shortfall: maybe it exists only in the minds and models of policymakers (or, actually, their technical experts), and isn\u2019t a real thing at all. That is, the belief that our economic potential has fallen far below previous expectations doesn\u2019t represent an actual economic ailment, but instead reflects policymakers\u2019 hypochondria.After all, how is potential output calculated? The details are complex, but basically such calculations rely on one or both of two theories: that slumps and booms are always short-lived, and/or that inflation is an \u201caccelerationist\u201d process.Suppose, first, that you start from the assumption that deviations of actual GDP from potential GDP tend to be eliminated over the course of a few years at most, with the economy surging after slumps and stagnating or shrinking after booms. In that case, you believe that the average difference between actual and potential GDP will be roughly zero over any extended period, which means that you can get an estimate of potential GDP by taking actual GDP and applying some kind of statistical method that smooths out the fluctuations.Suppose, alternatively, that you believe \u2013 as most mainstream economists did not long ago \u2013 in some version of Milton Friedman\u2019s \u201cnatural rate\u201d hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, an economy running above potential output will experience not just inflation but accelerating inflation, while an economy with persistent slack will experience ongoing disinflation, with the inflation rate falling continuously and eventually turning into accelerating deflation. If this hypothesis is true, you can in effect infer where we are relative to potential by asking what\u2019s happening to inflation: if it\u2019s stable, the economy is producing roughly at potential.In the light of post-2008 experience, however, it\u2019s clear that both of these theories are wrong. When interest rates hit zero, it\u2019s far from clear why or how the economy will quickly recover, since the usual way we bounce back from a slump \u2013 the central bank cuts interest rates, boosting spending \u2013 can\u2019t happen. Meanwhile, thanks in part to the reluctance of employers to cut wages even in the face of high unemployment, even obviously depressed economies seem at worst to experience low inflation, not an ongoing slide into accelerating deflation.Given these realities, consider how estimates of potential output will respond if an economy suffers a big decline in overall demand that persists for a number of years. Because the economy remains depressed for a long time, statistical methods that don\u2019t allow for this possibility will falsely interpret a sustained slump as a fall in potential GDP. Because inflation, while it may decline a bit at first in a slump, typically remains stable thereafter, models that try to infer potential output from changes in inflation will also conclude wrongly that the economy is operating near potential.So is the Great Shortfall something that exists only in policymakers\u2019 minds, when the real story is that there\u2019s still a huge amount of excess capacity? It\u2019s certainly a possibility worth considering. And I\u2019m reasonably sure that when it comes to Greece in particular, the huge decline in estimated potential output is exaggerated. I simply don\u2019t believe that after a 25 percent decline in real GDP, almost none of it made up by recent growth, and with 20 percent unemployment even now, Greece is only 2 percent below potential \u2013 which is the IMF\u2019s estimate.But this is a harder story to tell for the U.S. or the euro area as a whole. The simple version of the hypochondria hypothesis would be that officials misinterpret high unemployment as a structural problem when it\u2019s actually a demand problem. But at this point neither the U.S. nor the euro area has high unemployment by historical standards. Everyone knows the U.S. story; Figure 4 shows the euro area unemployment rate, which while higher than the U.S. rate is also now low compared with pre-crisis norms.It\u2019s true that many people argue that the unemployment rate has become a misleading measure of labor market slack, that the job market isn\u2019t as good as the standard measure indicates. But as Figure 5 shows, even broader measures like labor-force participation of prime-age adults aren\u2019t down all that much, and they were on a declining trend even before the crisis. So even a \u201chidden unemployment\u201d story won\u2019t explain the hugeness of the Great Shortfall \u2013 that is, it\u2019s not enough to make what we see consistent with a story that claims that it\u2019s all, still, about massively inadequate demand.Which brings us to the third story, which is that the Great Recession itself damaged potential output, largely by reducing productivity.If that sounds a little vague, that\u2019s because it is. Fat\u00e1s, Summers, and others argue that there has been a lot of hysteresis, and my instinct is to agree with them; but I\u2019m not aware of work that pins down the channels through which this is supposed to have happened with any precision. We really need people to do this work, because if hysteresis is the real story, if the Great Recession caused the Great Shortfall, it has huge implications for the future.Nobody wants to go through a repeat of the Great Recession, which is a reason to pursue policies that both reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis and increase our ability to respond if one happens. Hence financial regulation, expanded ability to seize troubled financial institutions (so as to be able prop them up without bailing out stockholders and executives), and so on. Some of us have also argued for a higher inflation target, which would leave more room to cut real interest rates when the next slump comes.If the Great Recession really did cause the Great Shortfall, the urgency of such measures is much greater. Using conventional measures, the Great Recession and the depressed economy that lingered for years thereafter cost the U.S. something like 15 percent of a year\u2019s GDP. If the decline in long-term economic prospects was also caused by the slump, this cost rises to something much bigger \u2013 possibly more than 70 percent of a year\u2019s GDP so far, and much more to come.In fact, as Fat\u00e1s says, an austerity mindset risks creating a \u201cdoom loop,\u201d in which fiscal contraction leads to a decline in economic prospects, worsening the budget outlook, leading to even more contraction. Greece has slashed spending, at huge social cost, but been rewarded \u2013 at least according to the official estimates \u2013 with a drastic decline in future prospects, so that its debt outlook looks barely better than it did before the cuts.So the Great Shortfall \u2013 the long-term shadow on the economy apparently cast by the Great Recession \u2013 is a huge issue. It deserves more attention, with maybe less focus on the few months of credit crunch after Lehman fell.Advertisement"}

His appraisal: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m an optimist. I\u2019m a realist.\u201dSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It was a big act, one of the last in the final days of a long political career, and it was about one of his life\u2019s passions: safeguarding the environment.Governor Brown has been pummeled from different sides. From the nation\u2019s capital have come attacks on California\u2019s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. From the activist street have come blistering protests demanding that he halt oil drilling in the state.Friends say he is anything but optimistic. For a man who has devoted his life to politics, they say, he has also come to understand that incremental political change may not be enough to meet the climate change challenge.\u201cHe has a gloomy instinct about the ability of politics to save us, but he can\u2019t help but try,\u201d said Orville Schell, a journalist and a biographer of Governor Brown who has known him for more than 40 years. \u201cHe has doubts about whether politics is the salvation.\u201dGovernor Brown trained to be a Jesuit priest. But he ultimately followed the footsteps of his father, Pat Brown, becoming, like him, a governor of California, first in 1975 for two consecutive terms, and then again in 2011 for another two terms.Environmental protection has long been a signature issue. He was known for being spartan in his personal life, embodying a 1970s ethos of \u201csmall is beautiful.\u201d In his early days as governor, futurists were invited to give talks at the statehouse. Air quality was a campaign pitch in the mid-1970s. He was an early proponent of solar power.Once, in 1980, in one of his three presidential bids, he told a student journalist that, one day, people would be making phone calls from their wristwatches.That student journalist was Bill McKibben, who went on to become an environmental writer and, later, the founder of an activist group called 350.org. \u201cHe is a visionary guy,\u201d Mr. McKibben said.\u201cHe\u2019s done a good job addressing the demand side,\u201d Mr. McKibben said over the din of drumbeats, adding that now, at the end of his fourth term, is Governor Brown\u2019s best chance to curtail the supply side by stopping oil production in the state. \u201cThe governor is in an unparalleled position to do something about it, and he never has to run for re-election again. There are very few moments in American politics when you get a free shot.\u201dGovernor Brown has sought to use state law to curtail demand for oil and gas, but he also tasked his administration to look into how to tackle oil production in the state, the chairwoman of the state\u2019s air resources board, Mary D. Nichols, said. \u201cWe either do nothing and smoke marijuana because it\u2019s legalized, or we put our shoulder to the plow and do everything we can,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m an optimist. I\u2019m a realist.\u201dGovernor Brown sat at the head of a long table in a dark room, lit only by the afternoon light mottled by trees out front. He didn\u2019t much look at the pile of notes in front of him. His interview with me was one of 23 scheduled back-to-back that afternoon. His own age was very much on his mind. \u201cI feel the pressure of being 80.

Ms. Nichols, who has worked with him for decades, said she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he used his influence to work with those working on the front lines of climate solutions. \u201cHe is not resting on his laurels or being the guardian of his own history, though he is a history-minded individual,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Economy Is Humming, but Trump Is Tweeting. Republicans Are Worried.", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As Democrats enter the fall midterm campaign with palpable confidence about reclaiming the House and perhaps even the Senate, tensions are rising between the White House and congressional Republicans over who is to blame for political difficulties facing the party, with President Trump\u2019s advisers pointing to the high number of G.O.P. retirements and lawmakers placing the blame squarely on the president\u2019s divisive style.Yet Republican leaders do agree on one surprising element in the battle for Congress: They cannot rely on the booming economy to win over undecided voters.To the dismay of party leaders, the healthy economy and Mr. Trump have become countervailing forces. The decline in unemployment and soaring gross domestic product, along with the tax overhaul Republicans argue is fueling the growth, have been obscured by the president\u2019s inflammatory moves on immigration, Vladimir V. Putin and other fronts, party leaders say.These self-inflicted wounds since early summer have helped push Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings below 40 percent and the fortunes of his party down with them.\u201cThis is very much a referendum on the president,\u201d Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, said of the November election. \u201cIf we had to fight this campaign on what we accomplished in Congress and on the state of the economy, I think we\u2019d almost certainly keep our majority.\u201dGlen Bolger, a leading Republican pollster working on several top races this year, was even blunter: \u201cPeople think the economy is doing well, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re voting on \u2014 they\u2019re voting on the chaos of the guy in the White House.\u201dDemocrats still face challenges of their own, namely the unpopularity of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, and the party\u2019s tilt left on issues like immigration, both of which could chill support from some otherwise persuadable voters. And the threat of a Democratic majority impeaching the president, which Mr. Trump is eager to raise, could rouse some of his supporters who otherwise may not show up in a year when he\u2019s not on the ballot.Even so, Mr. Bolger and many other prominent Republicans now believe they are likely to lose the House, where they have a 23-seat majority and as many as 60 seats are being fiercely contested by Democrats. The party is preparing to shift advertising money away from some of their most beleaguered incumbents toward a set of races in somewhat more favorable territory. In the narrowly divided Senate, both parties see eight or nine seats, most of them held by Democrats, on a knife\u2019s edge.And instead of attempting to highlight positive economic news like the 3.9 percent unemployment rate, Republicans have turned to a scorched-earth campaign against the Democrats in a bid to save their House majority and salvage their one-seat edge in the Senate.Republican electioneering groups, including the Congressional Leadership Fund \u201csuper PAC\u201d and the National Republican Congressional Committee, have spent millions in recent weeks attacking Democratic candidates in intensely personal terms. The committees, along with some Republican candidates, have blasted one Democratic hopeful in New York for rap lyrics he once wrote; branded another, in Pennsylvania, as a \u201ctrust fund baby\u201d and \u201ctax dodger\u201d; and aired commercials featuring veterans in wheelchairs to sow doubts about the patriotism of some Democratic nominees.The Republican lurch away from economic issues amounts to a bet on the politics of Trump-style cultural division as a means of driving up conservative turnout and disqualifying some Democratic candidates among more moderate voters.Party leaders say the individual attacks are only the first step in a broader campaign to shift the midterms away from the Trump focus and toward the implications of Democratic majorities in Congress.Laying out the strategy in an interview this week in his Capitol office, Representative Kevin McCarthy, the would-be successor to Speaker Paul D. Ryan, warned that if Democrats took power they would swiftly impeach the president, stymie immigration enforcement and seek to enact universal health care.\u201cIt\u2019s just going to be chaos,\u201d said Mr. McCarthy, trying to repurpose the sense of tumult that voters do not like about Mr. Trump\u2019s administration.Mr. McCarthy acknowledged House Republicans would suffer losses but predicted they would keep a narrow majority so long as Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating rebounded. He even settled on a specific threshold, saying Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating had to be above 43 percent to hold on to the House \u2014 even though, historically, the party out of power usually dominates midterm elections when a president\u2019s approval rating is markedly under 50 percent.\u201cIt\u2019s week by week of where the weather is at \u2014 and it\u2019s ever changing,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said of the political environment. \u201cLet\u2019s just hope it\u2019s a sunny day on Election Day.\u201dYet there are already clouds forming over the Republican-controlled capital, visible in the growing anger between the Trump White House and those in the party aligned with congressional Republicans.After a summer in which the administration implemented a policy of separating migrant children from their parents, the president sided with Mr. Putin over American intelligence services, and then he showed little sympathy following the death of Senator John McCain, Republican strategists say Mr. Trump is alienating a sizable bloc of moderate and Republican-leaning voters who favor right-of-center economic policies but recoil from the president.\u201cThere\u2019s 15 percent of the electorate that\u2019s happy with the direction of the country but angry with the president,\u201d said Corry Bliss, who runs the Congressional Leadership Fund.But this sort of talk infuriates Mr. Trump\u2019s aides, and one senior White House official swiped back at Mr. Bliss, accusing him of attempting to lay the groundwork for deflecting blame for the loss of the House majority. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to be candid about the party\u2019s predicament, said the Republicans were facing deep losses because of the 40 House Republicans who chose not to run again \u2014 a list, the official pointedly noted, that includes Mr. Ryan himself.Yet the intraparty finger-pointing goes beyond the skirmishing between the White House and Congress.Republican strategists affiliated with the Congressional Leadership Fund, the House super PAC, are privately voicing exasperation with the National Republican Congressional Committee for not raising more money, and for being unwilling so far to begin a triage that would transfer resources toward their most viable incumbents. For example, the committee still has $8 million committed to two lawmakers, Representative Barbara Comstock of Virginia and Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania, who many in the party do not think can win.And still other party officials have grown frustrated with the Congressional Leadership Fund for what they describe as a tepid effort to defend open seats where incumbent Republicans are retiring. The group is currently spending advertising money in less than a third of the 15 most heavily contested open seats, these Republicans said, putting pressure on other G.O.P. committees to make up the difference in about 10 others.Republican officials say privately that the performance of the economy under Mr. Trump has not been a major motivating factor for pro-Trump voters. For some Americans on the right, it may even be contributing to the mood of political apathy that has so alarmed G.O.P. leaders, since voters who are optimistic rarely vote with the intensity of those who are angry or afraid.America First Action, a political committee aligned with Mr. Trump, conducted a series of focus groups over the summer and concluded the party had a severe voter-turnout problem, brought on in part by contentment about the economy and a refusal by Republicans to believe that Democrats could actually win the midterm elections.Conservative-leaning voters in the study routinely dismissed the possibility of a Democratic wave election, with some describing the prospect as \u201cfake news,\u201d said an official familiar with the research, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the data was not intended to be disclosed. Breaking that attitude of complacency is now the Republicans\u2019 top priority, far more than wooing moderates with gentler messaging about economic growth.So Republicans are turning toward more hard-edge tactics. Incumbents who were widely seen as holding safe seats have ordered up opposition research to try to hurt their Democratic rivals. America Rising, a Republican firm that specializes in finding damaging information on Democrats, is working on three times as many House races as it did in 2016, according to an official with the group.At a meeting of House Republicans on Thursday, Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the N.R.C.C. chair, sought to scare incumbents by running a slide show featuring the excuses losing candidates typically offer up before they lose. (Included in the litany: \u201cI don\u2019t need to run negative ads; my constituents know me; my district is different.\u201d)A party official said lawmakers had chipped in $1.2 million for the House campaign committee after the appeal.Among top Democrats, optimism has soared since Labor Day. Mr. Trump has handed them fodder via his Twitter provocations, and reports of deep internal divisions in his administration have added to a sense of a chaotic presidency \u2014 hijacking the news cycle.Party leaders have closely tracked their leads in several public polls: During a meeting of congressional Democratic leaders on Wednesday evening, a top aide to Ms. Pelosi walked the group through a list of five recent polls that found voters nationally favoring Democratic congressional candidates over Republicans by double-digit margins.In the Senate, a mood of highly guarded hopefulness has spread among Democrats, who see a path to a majority that runs through a mix of right-leaning and solidly conservative states. By this point in the cycle, some in the party had feared that several incumbents would be headed to certain defeat, and once-inviting takeover opportunities would have slipped off the map, including in Tennessee and Texas. But both of those states remain competitive and a group of rust belt Senate Democrats, like Sherrod Brown of Ohio, seem secure.\u201cDespite the difficulty of the map\u2019s geography, if there\u2019s a big wave I think our odds are very, very good,\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said in an interview, adding that when \u201cyou\u2019re feeling the wave in September it rarely changes much by November.\u201dAnd the main reason Democrats are sensing a wave is obvious to party veterans.\u201cHe won\u2019t allow himself to get credit for the economy,\u201d said James Carville, the Democratic strategist, referring to President Trump. Mr. Carville, who fashioned Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d mantra in 1992, continued: \u201cHe\u2019s made himself bigger than the economy. Every conversation starts and ends with Trump.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 99.His death, at Lower Keys Medical Center in Key West, was confirmed by the photographer Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, a nephew.Mr. Wolkowsky was known locally as Mr. Key West for his role as a catalyst in the island\u2019s revival. In recasting it as not only a vacation haven but also an artists\u2019 colony, he befriended literary figures like Tennessee Williams, Gore Vidal and Judy Blume and rented his bamboo-topped two-bedroom trailer to Truman Capote, who wrote his unfinished final novel, \u201cAnswered Prayers,\u201d there.By 1993, Islands magazine credited Mr. Wolkowsky, a native of the island, with \u201calmost single-handedly converting Key West into America\u2019s most distinctive tropical resort.\u201dMr. Wolkowsky\u2019s goal was to \u201cpreserve the past by making it work for the present at a profit,\u201d he told The Miami Herald in 1969.In 1974, Mr. Wolkowsky bought Ballast Key, an uninhabited 24-acre outcropping eight miles off Key West, for $160,000 and there built the southernmost private home in the contiguous (more or less) United States.In August, the Monroe County Commission voted to rename the island David Wolkowsky Key after he died.David William Wolkowsky was born on Aug. 25, 1919, a grandson of Jewish immigrants from Russia who had moved from New York to Jacksonville, Fla., and then to Key West, the southernmost Florida key, in the late 1880s. There they opened a men\u2019s clothing store on bustling Duval Street.His father, Isaac, ran the family store. His mother, Freda (Yubas) Wolkowsky, was a homemaker. When David was 4 and the local economy was failing, the family moved to Miami, where he grew up.His closest immediate survivor is his sister, Ruth Greenfield.Mr. Wolkowsky was on a pre-med track at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia when he became interested in architecture and decided against medicine as a career.After graduating in 1943, Mr. Wolkowsky served in the merchant marine; moved to New York, where he had a $25-a-week job as a floor walker at the Lord & Taylor department store (\u201cI wasn\u2019t very good at my job,\u201d he recalled); and then returned to Philadelphia. There he began a modest restoration business under the name of David Williams. His projects near Society Hill and Rittenhouse Square in Center City won accolades from Town & Country magazine in 1955.After inheriting property in Key West\u2019s Old Town when his father died in 1962, Mr. Wolkowsky harbored visions of a life of leisure. But he was only in his 40s and failed miserably at retirement.\u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to sit around and collect baseball cards,\u201d he told The Herald in 2012. \u201cIf you\u2019re not involved and enjoying what\u2019s around you, you might as well get back in the book, like a leaf, and close it.\u201dWhere others saw an economically depressed and hurricane-ravaged six-square-mile island with subpar beaches strung with barbed wire to guard against invading Communists from Cuba, Mr. Wolkowsky envisioned something entirely different: the renaissance of a community.The keys to unlocking its potential were its tropical weather, Hemingway mystique, charming architecture and kooky locals, who assembled daily at dusk to salute the sunset.Mr. Wolkowsky would tool around town in one of his flashy cars, including a cream-colored Excalibur; serve guests turkey hot dogs and chips; and practice the adage that giving is better than receiving. (At his birthday party in August, he presented several dozen women with black pearl necklaces.)\u201cI was lucky to have an uncle with a world-class wit, a private island and a 1926 Rolls-Royce, on which I learned to drive,\u201d his nephew Mr. Greenfield-Sanders said by email. \u201cThe other side of him gave annually to local teachers and was the greatest visionary that Key West will ever know.\u201dFor a time Mr. Wolkowsky lived atop the old Kress Building on Duval Street, above the Margaritaville cafe, where he said he felt safer than he ever had because he had rented the upper floors to the Key West Parole Board. Nonetheless, someone stole a prized possession: handwritten drafts of \u201cAnswered Prayers\u201d that Capote had rejected and given to him in lieu of rent.Another keepsake survived: his portrait, drawn by Tennessee Williams, who had moved to Key West. Scrawled across it, in French, is an inscription suggesting Mr. Wolkowsky\u2019s standing as a visionary. Williams wrote, \u201cThe unknown: It\u2019s the eyes.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated Mr. Wolkowsky\u2019s age. He was 99, not 98. (As the obituary correctly states, he was born on Aug. 25, 1919.) The error was repeated in the headline.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the name of the unfinished novel Truman Capote wrote in Mr. Wolkowsky\u2019s trailer. It is \u201cAnswered Prayers,\u201d not \u201cUnanswered Prayers\u201d or \u201cUnfinished Prayers.\u201d The earlier version also erroneously included Ernest Hemingway on the list of literary figures Mr. Wolkowsky befriended.Advertisement"}

At least eight million Yemenis are at risk of starvation from an approaching famine caused not by crop failures but by our actions and those of our allies. The United Nations has called it the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, and we own it.An American bomb made by Lockheed Martin struck a Yemen school bus last month, killing 51 people. Earlier, American bombs killed 155 mourners at a funeral and 97 people at a market.Many global security issues involve complex trade-offs, but this is different: Our behavior is just unconscionable.\u201cYemen\u2019s current crisis is man-made,\u201d said David Miliband, the former British foreign secretary and current president of the International Rescue Committee, who recently returned from Yemen. \u201cThis is not a case where humanitarian suffering is the price of winning a war. No one is winning, except the extremist groups who thrive on chaos.\u201d\u201cThe Trump administration has made itself complicit in systematic war crimes,\u201d said Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch.Let\u2019s be clear, too: This is a bipartisan moral catastrophe. The policy started under President Barack Obama, with safeguards, and then Trump doubled down and removed the safeguards.The carnage in Yemen hasn\u2019t stirred more outrage because the Saudis use their blockade to keep out journalists. I\u2019ve been trying for two years to go, but the Saudis bar aid groups from taking me on relief flights.Both sides in this civil war have at times behaved brutally, and the only way out is diplomacy. But Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince seems to prefer famine and a failed state in Yemen to compromise, and the more we provide him weapons the longer we extend the suffering. We should be using our influence to rein the Saudis in, not cheer them on.World leaders are gathered for the United Nations General Assembly, making pious statements about global goals for a better world, but the Assembly is infused with hypocrisy. Russia is up to its elbows in crimes against humanity in Syria, China is detaining perhaps one million Uighurs while also shielding Myanmar from accountability for probable genocide, and the United States and Britain are helping Saudi Arabia commit war crimes in Yemen.That\u2019s pathetic: Four of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are complicit in crimes against humanity.Many Americans erupt in fury every time Trump lies, or tweets some inexcusable comment. Please do, but also save outrage for something even more monstrous \u2014 the way we are contributing to starvation of children and exacerbating the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Takeover of Shazam Is Cleared by European Regulators", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 European authorities on Thursday cleared Apple\u2019s acquisition of the popular song-recognition app Shazam, after months of study into whether the deal would give the iPhone maker an unfair advantage over rival streaming music services like Spotify.Apple said in December that it had agreed to buy Shazam, prompting European regulators to scrutinize the proposed takeover as part of a broader effort to examine the value of data when evaluating mergers.In the case of Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam, regulators questioned whether the app held important information on Apple competitors. The focus on data transfer is a departure from typical antitrust enforcement, which tends to zero in on how a deal may affect customers in terms of a product\u2019s cost.The Apple deal, Ms. Vestager said, would not impede competition.The case was a rare instance in which European antitrust authorities have passed on an opportunity to act against an American technology giant. The region has gained a reputation as the world\u2019s strictest overseer of the technology industry.When starting their investigation of the Apple-Shazam deal in February, regulators said they were concerned that Apple would block Shazam from referring customers to rival services, or that it would use the app to poach customers.On Thursday, the European Commission said that after a six-month review, it had concluded that the app did not give Apple an unfair advantage that merited government intervention.\u201cAccess to Shazam\u2019s data would not materially increase Apple\u2019s ability to target music enthusiasts and any conduct aimed at making customers switch would only have a negligible impact,\u201d the commission said in a statement.Spotify, a major rival to Apple\u2019s own music-streaming service, declined to comment.Shazam was an early hit in Apple\u2019s App Store thanks to its novel ability to quickly identify a track after using a smartphone\u2019s microphone to \u201clisten\u201d for only a few seconds. The two companies established closer ties in 2014, when Shazam was integrated into Apple\u2019s voice-powered digital assistant Siri, allowing users to ask, \u201cHey Siri, what song is playing?\u201dThe app mainly makes money by selling advertisements and collecting fees when it refers users to a music service like Apple and Spotify. Shazam is also a valuable source of data, giving music companies insight into what songs and artists are performing well, and in which regions.Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam has been seen as a possible test case for Ms. Vestager, who has said antitrust enforcement must evolve to consider the value of data.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers effectively pay with their data, and that they are not always getting a fair deal.Broadening the interpretation of antitrust law would have consequences for future acquisitions. But whether such an argument would hold up in a courtroom has not yet been well established, making it harder for authorities to step in.Working in Apple\u2019s favor was the fact the European Commission had previously approved acquisitions between several data-rich companies, including Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of LinkedIn.Advertisement"}

President Trump had a summit meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore in June, and since then has tried to reduce tensions with North Korea.Mr. Trump is expected to discuss his administration\u2019s negotiations during his work at the United Nations this week.Ms. Haspel was careful to say the dialogue begun by Mr. Trump had improved the situation with North Korea. She said Mr. Kim wants to better the economic situation in his country, and that the C.I.A. is working to support Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Ms. Haspel\u2019s predecessor as head of the agency.\u201cI do think sitting here today in 2018 that we are in a better place than we were in 2017 because of the dialogue we have established between our leaders, the President and Chairman Kim Jong-un,\u201d Ms. Haspel said during remarks at the University of Louisville\u2019s McConnell Center.Unsurprisingly, Ms. Haspel was careful with her remarks about the president, keeping her comments apolitical but supportive of the administration\u2019s stated priorities.Former C.I.A. officers have said Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on former intelligence officials, including John O. Brennan, the former agency director, have threatened to politicize the apolitical work of collection and analysis.Ms. Haspel was not asked directly about Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks, but did field a question about morale at the agency. She said morale at the agency was constant.\u201cC.I.A. is a resilient work force, and we tend to be very mission focused,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tend not to pay attention to the political fray in the capital. We are very focused on events overseas.\u201dMs. Haspel used her remarks to outline her priorities at the agency, including improving diversity among the ranks of C.I.A. officers, investing more in filling intelligence gaps \u2014 especially for potential nation-state adversaries by stationing more officers overseas and investing more in language training.She also said the C.I.A. was trying to do more on overseas counternarcotics efforts, adding that drugs have killed more people than terrorists have.In a question-and-answer session, Ms. Haspel fielded questions about recent movies she had seen (\u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d about a Russian intelligence agent and the C.I.A.), favorite books (\u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d), preferred Johnny Cash songs (\u201cRing of Fire\u201d and \u201cI Walk the Line\u201d) and Kentucky whiskey. (She dodged that one, but said that she had recently given a bottle of Woodford Reserve to a C.I.A. visitor.)On more serious topics, she discussed China\u2019s efforts to spread influence outside of Asia and the state of the Iranian economy. But her North Korea remarks were likely most revealing, as she recounted the efforts Mr. Kim had undertaken to build his nuclear arsenal.Ms. Haspel\u2019s remarks reflect the strong belief within C.I.A.\u2019s Langley headquarters that it will be difficult to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.Both current and former intelligence analysts are skeptical of claims of a dramatic shift in North Korean policy or diplomatic breakthroughs.Bruce Klingner, a Korea analyst at the Heritage Foundation and former C.I.A. officer, said that intelligence analysts are constantly on the lookout for any new data that would entail a revision to the analysis.But the skepticism among analysts comes from the failure of previous diplomatic attempts to solve the North Korean problem, Mr. Klingner said.\u201cKorea watchers tend to be a cynical and skeptical group after decades of watching previous efforts fail,\u201d he said. \u201cThe North Koreans have been very clearly articulating their longstanding positions. Some say it is negotiating tactics. But look at what Kim Jong-un has said: \u2018We will never abandon the sword of nuclear arms.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

Others appeared to have been freshly killed, partly covered by bushes in an attempt to hide them from view.The tusks of 87 animals, which were counted during aerial surveys over the past few months in Botswana, had been chopped off \u2014 evidence of what conservationists are calling one of the biggest slaughters in recent years.Michael Chase, director of the charity Elephants Without Borders, which conducted the surveys, said he had never seen so many dead elephants in one go. After counting 48 during a single flight in August, Mr. Chase wrote in a report that the tally was \u201cindicative of a poaching frenzy which has been ongoing in the same area for a long time.\u201dThe numbers were expected to climb as the survey continues. But the results so far already signal a major escalation in elephant poaching, said Tom Milliken, a program manager at Traffic, a nonprofit organization that monitors wildlife smuggling.The slaughter shows that despite all the time, money and energy poured into anti-poaching operations in recent years, organized poaching gangs can still wipe out large herds with impunity.Botswana was until recently considered a haven for the animals, with militarized patrols in protected areas and a contentious shoot-to-kill policy intended to deter poachers. This tough stance on poaching had made Botswana \u201cthe darling of the conservation world,\u201d said Annette H\u00fcbschle, a researcher at the Center of Criminology at the University of Cape Town.But the policies did not address the underlying drivers of the illegal ivory trade.\u201cThe fortress conservation paradigm, or separating local people from wildlife and conservation, creates pathways to illegal economies,\u201d Ms. H\u00fcbschle said. \u201cRural communities are likely to support poachers and poaching economies because there are no benefits to these conservation areas for them.\u201dIf local communities experienced no direct benefit from conservation areas, \u201cthey may not turn to poaching, but they won\u2019t support policing either,\u201d Ms. H\u00fcbschle said. \u201cYou need to reach out to communities for conservation to work.\u201dDespite bans on legal sales, demand for ivory remains sufficiently high to sustain underground markets. In many African countries, the money on offer has continued drawing poachers.\u201cRather than shooting poachers to kill them, we should be focusing on who\u2019s controlling the trade,\u201d Ms. H\u00fcbschle said. \u201cFollow the money and target the intermediaries, and the organizers behind them.\u201dBotswana\u2019s new government, which took power in April, demilitarized the anti-poaching unit soon after taking office without explaining why.The \u201cgovernment has decided to withdraw military weapons and equipment from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks,\u201d Carter Morupisi, permanent secretary to President Mokgweetsi Masisi, told reporters in May.Botswana\u2019s government disputed the findings of the aerial surveys, calling them \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201dThe ministry of environment, natural resources, conservation and tourism said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cAt no point in the last months or recently were 87 or 90 elephants killed in one incident in any place in Botswana.\u201dElephants Without Borders, however, did not say the elephants were killed in one incident, only that they had been detected in aerial surveys since July.Kelly Landen, a program manager with the group, said Elephants Without Borders had reported fresh carcasses to the government after the first week of surveys, but received no response. Since then, the organization had sent two further reports to local authorities, Ms. Landen added.The ministry said that a \u201cverification mission\u201d between July and August had found that a majority of the animals had not been poached, but rather died from natural causes and \u201cretaliatory killings as a result of human and wildlife conflicts.\u201dElephants Without Borders responded that the poached animals had their faces cut off for their ivory, and that poachers appeared to have been \u201cspecifically targeting large old bulls.\u201dThe elephants were killed near the Okavango Delta wildlife sanctuary, a well-known wilderness area.\u201cThe region has a strong military presence with two airfields,\u201d the Elephants Without Borders report said, adding: \u201cThe Botswana government can\u2019t be expected to stop this poaching alone.\u201d\u201cAnything newly born is being offset by poaching,\u201d Mr. Milliken said.\u201cThe policy moves on the demand side are much like one hand clapping if you\u2019re not dealing with the Chinese threats to elephants in Africa,\u201d Mr. Milliken said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the manner in which Botswana\u2019s new government came into power in April.

The discrepancy is even more stark for female founders: They own 39 cents for every dollar owned by a male founder.Carried out by the equity advisory firm Carta, the survey is based on data from 6,000 U.S. companies across a range of industries.After the financial crisis, private equity giants like Blackstone and K.K.R. began to de-emphasize the kind of leveraged buyouts that created their empires in favor of a different kind of service: lending money.Many analysts think that this poses fewer risks to the financial system than the banks that nearly cratered the economy a decade ago. But there is a danger that private equity lending is getting too risky.

We need to make our voices heard.\u201dIn the past, the idea of participating in anything that resembled a political movement had repelled Berg. \u201cI would say, \u2018Don\u2019t talk to me about politics,\u2019\u2009\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2009\u2018I think it\u2019s a waste of time.\u2019\u2009\u201d A 46-year-old lifelong Republican, she called herself a \u201csleepy voter,\u201d as if she sleepwalked through the voting booth every four years. \u201cI was just voting for the person with an R by their name or not voting.\u201dThis was true even though the Legislature and governor \u2014 unified under Republican control since 2009 \u2014 cut education spending more than any other state in the wake of the Great Recession. Berg suffered doubly because her husband, a web developer, lost his state job, and now the entire family of six \u2014 they have four sons, ages 7 to 13 \u2014 was on her health plan, with the premiums cutting her previous take-home pay almost in half. She was working three extra jobs to keep the family afloat, arriving home most nights barely in time to check her kids\u2019 homework and kiss them good night. Across the state, teachers were taking in roommates, working second and third jobs and leaving the profession in such waves that substitutes without standard certifications were leading more than 3,400 classrooms statewide. Two thousand more couldn\u2019t be staffed at all.In December 2016, the day before Christmas break, Berg heard that her son Mark\u2019s sixth-grade teacher had quit to take a private-sector job for more money, and suddenly she felt that she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She needed to understand why Arizona\u2019s schools were so poorly funded and who was responsible. She turned for help to her best friend, Tiffany Bunstein, who followed state politics closely and, like Berg, had been teaching for more than 20 years at Dobson High School in Mesa, a sprawling, demographically diverse suburb east of Phoenix. \u201cI went to Tiffany and said, \u2018I want to know what you know,\u2019\u2009\u201d Berg said.It was on this Facebook page that Berg learned of the March 14 hearing in the House Ways and Means Committee on a bill related to Arizona\u2019s tuition tax credit program, which awards dollar-for-dollar state tax credits to individuals and corporations for donations for private school scholarships. In the previous school year, donors had given more than $157 million, and over the last 20 years $1 billion, avoiding the same amount in taxes \u2014 money that never reached the state general fund or public schools. The bill would increase the size of individual scholarships, at a predicted annual cost of $2 million in 2020, a pittance in a more than $10 billion overall state budget. But for Berg and many other teachers emboldened by the March 7 show of solidarity, that was $2 million too much. \u201cOnce again we\u2019re undercutting public education, and it needs to stop,\u201d she recalled thinking. It was spring break, and teachers urged one another on Facebook to attend the hearing.Berg drove downtown, her heart pounding. \u201cThis is totally so uncharacteristic of anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she kept telling herself. Arriving at the Capitol, she found hundreds of other teachers, all wearing red, and was surprised by how comfortable she felt. Before she could stop herself, she volunteered to testify about the bill. She stood at the microphone with rows of red-shirted teachers behind her and read from notes, her head down, nervously smoothing her brown hair and adjusting her glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about politics, but I do know about math,\u201d she began, introducing a lesson on how teachers\u2019 salaries had stagnated. Other teachers told stories of financial crises in their schools, pleading for every available dollar to go to public, not private, education. When one teacher\u2019s voice broke as she described a colleague covering two kindergarten classes at once because of a shortage of substitutes, the others applauded in encouragement. When a Democratic lawmaker called the private scholarships inequitable \u2014 exceeding the state\u2019s spending per public school student by $9,000 in some cases \u2014 the teachers stood up in silent assent. The committee chairwoman, Michelle Ugenti-Rita, instructed them to sit. \u201cAnd when they sit, you can answer,\u201d she said to the bill\u2019s sponsor, the Senate president Steve Yarbrough, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to all show each other respect.\u201d Despite the entreaties of the teachers, the bill passed the committee on a party-line vote \u2014 six Republicans to three Democrats.Berg went home, signed onto the Facebook page, which by now had tens of thousands of followers, and poured out her rage. \u201cWe were told to sit down when we stood in agreement. ... We were told to remain quiet when applauding when a teacher, who was in tears, was pleading for support for our classes and our students,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe were disrespected. We were mocked. We were listened to, but not heard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what radicalized me,\u201d Berg said later. \u201cAs the kids would say, \u2018I\u2019m woke.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Great Recession devastated education funding in every region of the country. With tax revenues plummeting, legislators and governors desperate to slash spending turned inexorably to public schools. Anticipating sweeping teacher layoffs, the Obama administration in 2009 sent states a federal stimulus package of $100 billion specifically for education, but the recession outlasted it. In half the states, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, teacher pay adjusted for inflation was lower in 2016 than in 2000.Few states were hit as hard as Arizona, where the sun, low taxes and wide-open spaces had drawn transplants from around the country, fueling an economy heavily based on real estate development. All that came to a painful halt when the housing bubble burst in 2008. State revenue had grown so feverishly in the years before the crash that in 2006, Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, and the Republican Legislature were able to cut income taxes 10 percent even as they significantly increased education spending, including an expansion of kindergarten from half a day to a full day statewide.The recession, coupled with the tax cuts, wiped out billions of dollars in state revenues. Napolitano left to join the Obama administration as secretary of homeland security in January 2009, and her Republican successor, Jan Brewer, and the Republican Legislature cut funds that districts relied on to pay teachers, maintain buildings, update curriculum and technology and much more. Salaries were frozen, funding for all-day kindergarten was eliminated and class sizes climbed year by year as teachers left for higher-paying jobs and principals were forced to combine orphaned classes. By last year, Shannon Connors, a sixth-grade teacher at a high-poverty, 98 percent Latino school in Phoenix, ended up teaching two classes at once \u2014 50 students \u2014 when a succession of long-term substitutes failed to teach one of the classes effectively.Similar situations had unfolded in every state where teachers walked off the job last spring. A 2017 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona \u2014 scenes of the largest teacher walkouts \u2014 were among the six states that cut the most aid to local school districts in the last decade. All are solidly Republican and have embraced small government and income-tax cuts. They are also right-to-work states where union membership is optional and unions are weak. Fewer than half of Arizona teachers belong to the union.In Arizona, state funding per pupil has been below the national average since 1975, falling particularly after the mid-1990s, when lawmakers embarked on an almost unbroken streak of annual cuts in personal and corporate income taxes. Tom Rex, an Arizona State University researcher, calculated that if not for the cumulative effect of those tax cuts, the state general fund in 2016 would have totaled $13.6 billion instead of $9.5 billion, or more than 40 percent higher. Even in the depths of the recession, Brewer and the Legislature cut corporate income taxes 30 percent \u2014 roughly $550 million a year \u2014 in hopes of stimulating the economy, but without success. Voters approved a temporary 1-cent sales-tax hike in a 2010 referendum, with proceeds designated primarily for education, then decisively voted down a permanent extension in 2012.The leader of the 2012 opposition to the sales tax was Doug Ducey, now the governor of Arizona, who was then the state treasurer. A former C.E.O. of Cold Stone Creamery and a Republican, he championed small government and free-market solutions to education like charter schools and Arizona\u2019s version of private school vouchers. Attacking public school districts as wasteful bureaucracies, he argued that more money would solve nothing. \u201cWe need to spend those dollars more effectively,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to raise taxes on hard-working citizens.\u201dCutting taxes and privatizing schools had long been popular in Arizona, but there were signs that the worsening teacher shortage was changing that. Beginning in 2015, the year Ducey took office, political polls showed education was the No. 1 concern for the Arizona electorate, even ahead of immigration and health care.While keeping his no-new-taxes pledge, Ducey found some ways to increase school aid. In 2016, he won legislative and voter approval to give districts $3.5 billion over 10 years, mostly from a state land trust created at the time of Arizona\u2019s founding and dedicated in part to funding public education. The move came after the Arizona Supreme Court found the state liable for failing to keep school funding even with inflation during the recession. Education leaders said the $3.5 billion came to less than was owed but embraced it as a way to funnel much-needed money to schools.As the economy improved, Ducey restored some other funds eliminated during the recession, and districts began raising salaries modestly for the first time in eight years. But this barely dented the legacy of decades of cutbacks in both wealthy and low-income districts.In January, Ducey unveiled his budget for 2018, specifying a raise of only 1 percent for teachers, along with some other aid that districts could apply to raises. On Feb. 22, news arrived of West Virginia teachers walking off the job to demand better pay and benefits. \u201cMy first thought was, They must be a union state,\u201d Berg said. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t, and I wondered what that meant for us.\u201dOne Saturday, Berg and Bunstein rallied with hundreds of other teachers along Baseline Road, a major thoroughfare, wearing red and waving Red for Ed posters. Traffic snarled as drivers slowed to honk and shout encouragement. Supporters dropped off pizzas and cases of water. From the back seat of a minivan, children waved homemade signs saying, \u201cWe support our teachers.\u201dOn March 28, another Wednesday, 2,500 teachers converged at a nighttime rally at the Capitol, which had been called by Arizona Educators United to announce the new movement\u2019s demands. They included a 20 percent salary increase, raises for support staff, no new tax cuts until Arizona increased per-pupil spending to the national average, a pay scale guaranteeing salaries would continue to rise and a return to prerecession school-funding levels. That would require an increase of $632 per student \u2014 the current level was $5,105 \u2014 or about $700 million in additional spending, based on legislative budget data.On April 2, teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky walked off the job over pay and pension issues. Amid a clamor for action in Arizona, A.E.U. leaders invited community supporters to join them on April 11 for \u201cwalk-ins,\u201d lining up outside schools before the opening bell and striding arm in arm to the entrance. More than 100,000 teachers, students, principals, parents and business owners participated at 1,100 schools.The next day, Governor Ducey, who is up for re-election in November, called a news conference and announced that he had found room in his budget for a 20 percent pay increase for teachers over three years that he called \u201c20 by 2020.\u201d There would be a 10 percent raise this year, and \u2014 if future Legislatures approved the funds \u2014 5 percent in 2019 and again in 2020.A.E.U. leaders called the raises unsustainable without new taxes and again demanded a return to funding levels from before the recession \u2014 a decade earlier. They held a vote to decide whether to walk out, and 78 percent of more than 50,000 participating teachers and support staff voted yes. The date was set for April 26, near the end of the legislative session; the walkout would continue until lawmakers voted on the education budget.The first morning of the walkout, Berg and Bunstein rode together into downtown Phoenix in Berg\u2019s Honda Odyssey, past miles of flat, exurban expanses with mountains looming in the distance, wondering how many teachers would actually show up. At the designated meeting spot outside Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, they found so many people in red \u2014 teachers from affluent suburbs and the highest-poverty schools around Phoenix \u2014 they couldn\u2019t see where the crowd stopped. Bunstein received an aerial photograph on her phone of a red sea surging 19 blocks down Washington Street from the ball field to the Capitol. It exceeded the scope of the camera, appearing to reach beyond the horizon. At about the same time, a deafening, celebratory roar went up from the crowd. Berg and Bunstein found themselves crying. So did many others.Also in the crowd was Lupita Almanza, a Mesa teacher who had gotten only one minimal raise in eight years. Weighed down by student debt and her obligations as a single mother of a daughter in kindergarten, she had been agonizing about whether to leave her job. She thought often of how much she would be paid in the private sector. \u201cI\u2019m bilingual,\u201d she said. \u201cI could make good money as a translator.\u201dBut something profound happened to her when she told her students she was walking out and wouldn\u2019t be there the next day. \u201cSaying goodbye to them was the hardest thing I ever did,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized, if this hurts my heart so much, I should be doing this. I went to the Capitol every day of the walkout, and I fought, not just for my daughter or my nieces and nephews and students, but for myself too, because this is my passion \u2014 to be a teacher \u2014 and I just can\u2019t close the door yet. I have found my voice.\u201dFar-right social-media sites including Breitbart and The Daily Caller searched Noah Karvelis\u2019s online history and revealed shortly before the walkout that he had volunteered as a college student for Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign and had tweeted about teaching students such topics as gender, race and \u201ctoxic/violent masculinity.\u201d Republican lawmakers quickly tarred Red for Ed as a socialist plot \u2014 \u201ccue Karvelis\u2019 former boss Bernie Sanders,\u201d Republican State Representative Maria Syms of Paradise Valley wrote in an op-ed in The Arizona Republic. When a high school music teacher in Tempe texted State Representative Kelly Townsend, a conservative Republican, asking to explore common ground, she replied, \u201cWhen the teachers denounce the socialists in charge of your Red for Ed movement, and parenthetically I wondered why they chose the color red, then we can sit down and talk.\u201d The teacher posted the exchange on Facebook.\u201cLet us band together, \u2018conservative\u2019 and \u2018liberal,\u2019 and WIN this war,\u201d Jonathan Massey, an English teacher of 14 years and a Republican who said he often votes like an independent, wrote on Facebook. \u201cAfter we have achieved sweet victory, we can resume attacking each other on other issues! Haha! WE are the kind of uprising which politicians of both major parties dread. They have lost control of us, and that means TROUBLE.\u201dFor six days, teachers lobbied their lawmakers amid debate over the education budget. In the end, the salary increase survived intact, but the other teacher demands went nowhere. Democrats presented most of them as amendments; all were defeated by Republicans banding together. On the last day, the vote on the overall state budget dragged on into the morning. It was common for Arizona budgets to pass in the middle of the night with only a handful of spectators watching. But this time, when the final vote was taken at 5 a.m., the gallery was still packed and solid red with teachers.Aidan Balt, 31, a high school English teacher and a Republican, had watched all night, growing increasingly distressed. She had been teaching for eight years at a school south of Phoenix where half the students are low income. She took home $2,200 a month, too little to afford to live on her own. She routinely worked 12-hour days and longer, trying to make up for what her students didn\u2019t get from their underfunded school. During the budget negotiations, she met with one of her representatives, a Republican, to tell him in detail why the system needed more revenue. She said he was cordial but told her she didn\u2019t understand the budget.\u201cYou go meet a Republican lawmaker, and they say you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she recalled later, sipping passion-tea lemonade in a Starbucks. \u201cBut I do know what I\u2019m talking about. This is something I\u2019m an expert in, something I love and live every day.\u201dShe said she identified strongly with the Republican Party. \u201cI was raised to believe in personal freedom. I was raised around people with guns. I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut over time my perception has changed. Politics shouldn\u2019t be polarized. I\u2019m not so black-and-white that I can\u2019t see that sometimes I might have to vote differently because of other issues. For me, all I can do is focus on something I know, and that\u2019s education.\u201dShe was just one teacher in a red shirt, sitting among many others in the Senate gallery in the wee hours of a morning in May. But watching the party-line votes against the teachers\u2019 demands, she felt compelled to take a stand. Pulling out her phone, she went to the online portal for the Arizona state government and changed her voter registration \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to Democratic.On May 4, teachers returned to school with a new slogan: \u201cRemember in November.\u201dChristine Marsh, Arizona\u2019s 2016 Teacher of the Year, decided last year to run for the State Senate in a district straddling Phoenix and the affluent suburb Paradise Valley, against its moderate Republican incumbent, Kate Brophy McGee. On a sweltering day this past June, having just completed her 26th year in the classroom, Marsh was traversing several Phoenix housing developments, riding in a fellow teacher\u2019s Prius, hopping out every minute or two to knock on voters\u2019 doors to ask them for support.\u201cTeachers live by the mantra \u2018Just close your door and teach,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Marsh, 52, who teaches high school English and calculated that she has taught more than 3,500 students. \u201cIf there were things we didn\u2019t like, we shut out the outside world and did our job to the best of our ability. We\u2019ve been systematically cut for 20 years, but the last 10 years, I came to the point I could not \u2018Close my door and teach\u2019 anymore. I\u2019m running to get to the point where teachers can focus on our students and not be testifying before the House Education Committee.\u201dThe G.O.P. holds a four-seat margin in the State Senate; Marsh\u2019s district, a mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents, is one of a handful that Democrats have targeted as winnable in hopes of flipping Senate control. Republicans have controlled both houses of the Legislature for 25 years, except in 2001 and 2002, when the Senate was tied.\u201cWe balance or flip the Senate, and there are no more budgets passed in the dark of night,\u201d Marsh told a crowd of former students and parents gathered at a Scottsdale home in June. \u201cWith a 15-15 split, Republicans have to come to the table. It\u2019s a game changer for the whole state.\u201dOn Facebook, teachers encouraged one another to work for candidates who are dedicated to more funding for education \u2014 mostly Democrats but in some cases Republicans. Hoping to circumvent the governor and Legislature, they also embraced Arizona\u2019s robust tradition of direct democracy, backing ballot initiatives to support public schools.One of those referendums was already on the ballot for November, thanks to a statewide coalition of mothers and teachers who came together in the summer of 2017 in a precursor to this year\u2019s grass-roots uprising. Calling their movement Save Our Schools Arizona, the cadre of women became overnight activists when Governor Ducey and the Legislature in April 2017 vastly expanded the state\u2019s then-limited program of private school vouchers \u2014 known as Empowerment Scholarship Accounts \u2014 by making all 1.1 million Arizona schoolchildren eligible for them. Under the voucher program, the state loads an average of $5,700 onto debit cards and issues them to parents to use for private schools, home instruction and other alternatives to public school. Ducey described the measure as necessary for children who struggle to succeed in traditional settings. \u201cPublic education is about educating our public,\u201d he said. Lawmakers limited the expansion to 5,500 new participants a year through 2022 to allay fiscal concerns. But the S.O.S. leaders argued that the Legislature could eventually lift the cap, triggering an exodus of students and revenue from public to private schools. With an all-volunteer force, in temperatures of 110 and higher, they gathered more than 100,000 signatures \u2014 well beyond the 75,000 needed \u2014 for what became known as Proposition 305, which blocked enactment of the voucher-expansion law until voters rule on it this November.In the middle of the walkout, inspired by Prop 305, Karvelis and other Red for Ed leaders endorsed another ballot initiative called Invest in Ed, developed by the national and state teachers\u2019 unions and liberal public-policy groups, that would raise $690 million a year through increased marginal tax rates on the state\u2019s top earners. It would create a dedicated funding stream to restore all-day kindergarten, reduce class sizes, hire more counselors and continue to raise teachers\u2019 pay.Karvelis said he and the other leaders informally polled teachers amid the frenzy of the walkout, finding widespread support for the initiative. But the endorsement created fissures in the movement. \u201cI thought this was a bipartisan fight for education,\u201d Kris Leffler, a Mesa teacher and a Republican, wrote on Facebook. \u201cOnce the chant for higher taxes for the wealthy started, you lost this teacher\u2019s support!!!!\u201d The proposed ballot measure would almost double the marginal tax rate on the richest residents \u2014 individuals making over $500,000, couples making over a million dollars \u2014 from 4.54 to 9 percent, making it the fifth-highest rate in any state. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that liberal thought,\u201d Leffler said. Other Republican teachers renounced Red for Ed on the same grounds. Jonathan Massey, who cautioned against partisanship from the start, lamented what he called \u201cthe loss of our trademark\u201d but didn\u2019t leave the movement.Those backing the measure argued that it would make the system more fair because the state budget now relies heavily on sales taxes, which disproportionately burden low-income residents. Berg said she would have preferred a broader-based tax but was moved by the bottom line of having more money for schools. So was Jenna Kaderlik, a Republican teacher from Surprise, a Phoenix suburb, who took a $15,000 pay cut when her family moved from Texas. \u201cThe ballot initiative really called to me \u2014 a dedicated, sustainable revenue stream every year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be voter-approved and voter-protected. The Legislature and the governor can\u2019t touch it.\u201dThey and thousands of other teachers across Arizona spent evenings and weekends collecting signatures; Berg took charge of distributing petitions to other teachers every Saturday morning across the Mesa school district. On one Saturday in June, she and Bunstein spent three hours collecting signatures at a coffee shop called Xtreme Bean in a busy shopping strip. Later that day, they moved to a bar and grill in Tempe, where they ran into S.O.S. activists from the previous year\u2019s battle for Prop 305. With their cause already on the ballot, S.O.S. was helping out supporters of Invest in Ed and a third referendum called Outlaw Dirty Money. It would require so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups that funnel millions of hard-to-trace dollars into Arizona political campaigns \u2014 mostly Republican but also Democratic \u2014 to reveal their individual donors. The parents and teachers who took on the voucher law had become intimately familiar with these groups.\u201cIf you cared last year about vouchers, and this year about the walkout, you need to ask the next question: Where did this issue come from?\u201d said Dawn Penich-Thacker, a communications professor at Arizona State University and an S.O.S. founder who was coordinating volunteers at the bar and grill. \u201cAnd that takes you to dark money.\u201dDucey had become a presence at conferences organized by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and donors to their political-finance network when he was state treasurer. An organization called Americans for Responsible Leadership, whose funding was traced by California authorities to the Koch network, contributed almost $1 million in support of Ducey\u2019s successful campaign against the 1-cent sales-tax hike in 2012.In his 2014 gubernatorial campaign, Ducey ran on a pledge to cut taxes every year and drive income tax rates in Arizona \u201cas close to zero as possible.\u201d That year, six dark-money groups spent almost $3.5 million supporting him or attacking his opponents, according to an investigation by The Arizona Capitol Times. Citing tax records, the paper found that five of the groups were financed by the sixth, American Encore, run by the Arizona political consultant Sean Noble, who was known to have funneled more than $100 million from anonymous Koch-network donors into political causes in 2012. \u201cOur network will work with anyone to help remove barriers that are preventing students from reaching their potential,\u201d Meredith Olson, an education spokeswoman for the Koch network, wrote to The Times in an email.In 2017, the Koch brothers\u2019 political advocacy arm, Americans for Prosperity, named the Arizona voucher-expansion bill its No. 1 education-reform priority in the country. The American Federation for Children, another bundler of anonymous contributions, founded by the family of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and focused on expanding school choice through charter schools, vouchers and private school scholarships, made it their top priority in the state.Charles Koch and five members of the DeVos family have each given the maximum $5,100 to Ducey\u2019s gubernatorial campaign this year, according to filings with the secretary of state.When the expansion of vouchers passed in 2017, DeVos tweeted congratulations from her official account: \u201cA big win for students & parents in Arizona tonight.... I applaud Gov. @DougDucey for putting kids first.\u201dFor weeks after leaders of Save Our Schools delivered their petitions to the secretary of state, a phalanx of activists from Americans for Prosperity and the American Federation for Children submitted multiple daily objections to individual signatures, according to Roopali Hardin Desai, an attorney who represented S.O.S. When the state nonetheless certified more than enough signatures as valid, lawyers representing the Koch network filed legal challenges that went all the way to the State Supreme Court but ultimately failed. Desai estimated that the voucher proponents spent as much as $500,000 on legal fees. But since Arizona law does not require such groups, known as social-welfare organizations, to disclose expenditures or individual donors in campaigns over ballot access, she said, \u201cI have no idea where it came from, who was paying or how much it was.\u201dThe school-choice movement in Arizona has fought to keep charter and private schools lightly regulated, arguing that too much state oversight would stifle innovation. In 2017, the Grand Canyon Institute, a nonprofit research organization, found that more than 77 percent of charter schools in Arizona use state funds to do business with for-profit companies owned by the charter holder, a member of the charter board or their relatives. With 18 percent of Arizona public school students in charters, the highest percentage of any state, David Wells, the institute\u2019s research director, reported that charters spent half a billion dollars in 2013-14 on these \u201crelated-party\u201d transactions, which are illegal in public school districts.One charter engaging in related-party transactions is Benjamin Franklin Charter School, owned by State Representative Eddie Farnsworth, a Republican, who has received regular infusions of campaign support from the American Federation for Children \u2014 more than $8,000 in his recent primary campaign, according to filings with the Arizona secretary of state. Farnsworth, who votes on charter school legislation despite his direct interest in one, owns a real estate firm from which B.F.C.S. leases its four campuses, according to records assembled by a watchdog group, Arizonans for Charter School Accountability. When the group complained that B.F.C.S. does not hold board meetings, the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office found that the state\u2019s open-meetings law does not apply because Farnsworth is the board\u2019s only member.Steve Yarbrough, the president of the Arizona Senate, a Republican who is retiring this year, was for years the prime legislative champion of the state program that provides tax credits for donations to private school scholarships. He also benefited personally from it. By law, donations go directly to so-called School Tuition Organizations, which then award the scholarships, and Yarbrough was until January the executive director of the state\u2019s biggest S.T.O., the Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization. (He was succeeded by his son Scott.) Under Arizona law, S.T.O.s can keep 10 percent of all donations. A.C.S.T.O. paid Yarbrough $129,649 in fiscal year 2017. A.C.S.T.O., a nonprofit, outsourced services like data entry and information processing to a for-profit company that Yarbrough co-owned with his wife and another couple. That company charged the nonprofit $672,453 in 2017 and millions of dollars combined over the previous decade. The Arizona Republic reported in 2015 that Yarbrough, in addition, was A.C.S.T.O.\u2019s landlord, receiving $52,000 a year in rent.He also served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee.\u201cIt\u2019s blatant that a number of lawmakers have something to make off of charters and private schools,\u201d said an infuriated Aidan Balt, the formerly Republican teacher who changed her registration. \u201cWho puts up with that? We do! Arizonans put up with that!\u201dAs a result of the increase approved by the Legislature \u2014 with a huge shove from Red for Ed \u2014 Berg got a $6,000 annual raise, the biggest of her career. Her husband recently got a new job with generous health benefits. Beginning Oct. 1, for the first time in years, she\u2019ll no longer be carrying the whole family of six on her health plan, adding $1,600 a month to her take-home pay. That, with her raise, allowed her to quit the community college job that had taken her away from her children three nights a week.Out on the campaign trail, Ducey was touting the pay raise as a signal accomplishment, along with other increases in state support to school districts. In November, he faces the Democrat David Garcia, an education professor at Arizona State University who won the Aug. 28 primary with a ringing call for more education funding.Ducey emphasized in one appearance after another that he made these changes while standing firm against a tax increase. He criticized the Invest in Ed initiative to hike taxes on the rich, along with its underlying argument that Arizona needs to raise more revenue to fund public education adequately. He pointed out that surging economic growth in the last year helped finance the raises. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019d raise a tax when we have such overwhelming revenues coming into our general fund,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThat would be the equivalent of hanging out a sign in Arizona that we\u2019re no longer open for business.\u201dBut as soon as school reopened, teachers began filling Facebook with evidence of all that remained unaddressed. They wrote of children sweating in buildings with broken air-conditioners their districts couldn\u2019t afford to repair, of a special-ed class being held in a trailer with a bullet hole in it. They wrote of spending $400, $500 and even $1,500 of their own money on classroom supplies. Christine Marsh, the State Senate candidate, posted that she had 37 students in one freshman English class. \u201cTeachers have to solve systemic problems on their own,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for years, but Arizona\u2019s children are entitled to a better system.\u201dBerg, who returned to Dobson High on Aug. 2, was in her empty math classroom for a prep period on Aug. 21 when a mass email showed up on her phone: The secretary of state had certified the Invest in Ed signatures, and the measure was officially on the Nov. 6 ballot. It now had a name: Proposition 207. \u201cI cried, I got goose bumps, I shared it on Facebook, I felt grateful for everyone who helped,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I got right to work\u201d on plans to mobilize support.In a stunning development, however, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled on Aug. 29 that Proposition 207 could not appear on the November ballot. The justices\u2019 finding was that the wording of the initiative inadvertently repealed the indexing of Arizona tax brackets to inflation and would eventually raise taxes on all Arizonans, not just the rich. Sponsors of Invest in Ed had successfully contested this interpretation in a lower court, but the justices found \u201ca significant danger of confusion or unfairness,\u201d invalidating the petitions signed by more than 270,000 Arizonans to put the tax increase on the November ballot. The order cannot be appealed.In a separate decision the same day, the justices upheld a lower-court ruling that invalidated petitions for the Outlaw Dirty Money initiative, disqualifying it from the ballot as well. The state director of the Kochs\u2019 A.F.P. was a plaintiff in the Outlaw Dirty Money case, and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry filed the challenge to Proposition 207. \u201cThis has been a great day for taxpayers,\u201d said Tom Jenney, an executive of the Arizona branch of A.F.P. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great day for everyone looking out for freedom.\u201dTeachers reacted with fury on the Arizona Educators United Facebook page, accusing \u201cDucey\u2019s stacked supreme court\u201d of subverting democracy. Ducey expanded the high court in 2016 from five to seven justices, of whom he has appointed three. Teachers of every political stripe called on one another to work in November to defeat all politicians opposed to more funding for education. \u201cThe ONLY way out of this . . . is to collectively \u2014 Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal \u2014 unite and vote for the same candidates,\u201d wrote Heather Gookin, a fourth-grade teacher and registered independent. \u201cIf politicians insist on inserting themselves into our classrooms, we need to insist that we let the right ones in.\u201dTeachers who last year couldn\u2019t identify their legislative district were crowdsourcing information on their state senators\u2019 and representatives\u2019 education records, their dark-money donors, their comments at meet-and-greet sessions. Whether Democrats, Republicans or independents, they said they were being deluged with requests for advice \u2014 from neighbors, friends, relatives, day care providers, kids\u2019 soccer coaches, gym buddies, even people at dog parks \u2014 on whom to support for governor and the Legislature.Berg said no one had ever asked her before how to vote in an election, nor could she have answered intelligently. But now she can, and she does. \u201cWe are educators who learn for a living and try to make a better world through our classrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we gather, focus, research and teach others what we have learned about Arizona politics?\u201d/\u2022/Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Once Looked Tough on Trade. Now Its Options Are Dwindling.", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, Mr. Trump has made his biggest move yet, announcing 10 percent tariffs starting in a week on $200 billion a year of Chinese goods. But this time, China can\u2019t match them all \u2014 and that crystallizes a growing problem for Beijing.China\u2019s responses have so far failed to thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s trade offensive, and with the White House amping up the fight again, Chinese leaders aren\u2019t sure how to respond, people briefed on economic policymaking discussions say.Chinese officials \u201care generally confused,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Hinojosa-Ojeda, a trade specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been traveling around China speaking with officials, businesspeople and workers.\u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he added. \u201cThey worry that the tit-for-tat model is playing into Trump\u2019s hands.\u201dChina does not import nearly enough from the United States to target $200 billion in American goods \u2014 let alone the additional $267 billion in Chinese goods that Mr. Trump has threatened to tax.Mr. Trump has said as much, and did so again at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cChina has been taking advantage of the United States for a long time, and that\u2019s not happening anymore,\u201d he said.The Chinese public could see any effort to soothe tensions as capitulation. Some hard-liners want a more aggressive stance.Lou Jiwei, who retired as finance minister in 2016 but is still the head of the country\u2019s social security fund, suggested on Sunday that China could deliberately disrupt American companies\u2019 supply chains by halting the export of crucial components mostly made in China. But Chinese trade experts dismiss that idea as impractical and not the government\u2019s position.Chinese officials know what they don\u2019t want to do. They have rejected one idea that would replace the matching tariffs with a more sophisticated system, said the people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the fragility of the deliberations. That response \u2014 discussed in detail within the Commerce Ministry and other agencies \u2014 would have led to lower tariffs on American goods in dollar terms, which could be seen as a fig leaf to the White House.That approach would have recognized a potentially expensive new reality for Beijing: The tariffs may be here to stay. Mr. Trump is suffering from weak approval ratings and could lose influence in congressional elections in November. Democrats have opposed most of his agenda, but many have supported his attacks on trade with China. Even if Mr. Trump leaves office in two years, there is little guarantee that his China trade policies will be changed.In Beijing, proponents of the new approach, which would scale down China\u2019s tariffs in dollar terms to reflect the lopsided trade imbalance between the two countries, say Chinese leaders could still revisit the idea because it offers them a way to contain the damage and soothe tensions.China\u2019s leaders \u201cdon\u2019t really want to engage in a dollar-for-dollar retaliation,\u201d said Yu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \u201cTheir purpose is to stop this trade war.\u201dChina\u2019s other options are limited.Other moves have already served as warnings, like delays at Chinese ports. Ford Motor\u2019s Lincoln cars and other goods have sometimes been the subject of unusually lengthy customs inspections this summer, although the delays do not appear to have caused much financial harm.\u201cIt is certain that China will have other, invisible retaliation against the United States,\u201d said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Commerce Ministry\u2019s policy research and training academy.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to build a reputation, and easy to harm a reputation,\u201d Mr. Mei said.China could also guide its currency to a weaker level against the dollar. It has already nudged the currency a bit lower, making Chinese goods cheaper in the United States and partly offsetting the tariffs. But a weaker currency would make China\u2019s imports more expensive, raise the risk of inflation and lead to a potentially damaging flight of money out of the country. It could also provoke further American retaliation.The trade war has hit only a small part of the Chinese economy for now, but the damage could add up. Higher tariffs on American goods raise the cost of essential imports like soybeans and microchips. China still derives a big chunk of growth from making smartphones, clothing, chemicals and a raft of other goods and selling them to Americans.The battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.The new plan that Chinese officials rejected in recent weeks could have been more warmly greeted by the White House.Under that plan, the United States and China would each levy tariffs based on proportions of trade rather than dollar amounts, people familiar with the discussions said. Because the United States imports nearly four times as much from China as it exports, that would lead to tariffs at different values.For example, the United States has already levied tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, one-tenth of what it imports from China. Instead of matching that with tariffs on $50 billion in American-made goods, China would levy tariffs on one-tenth of such goods, totaling $13 billion to $15 billion, depending on the details.Proponents of the plan say letting Washington impose more tariffs than Beijing would actually hurt the United States more because tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers and businesses in the countries that levy them.\u201cThe United States wants to hurt China by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports,\u201d Mr. Yu, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences economist, wrote in a journal in July. \u201cIn the end, it may be the United States itself\u201d that is hurt, he wrote.But other Chinese trade experts say tariffs on equal fractions of trade would be too big a compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic, it\u2019s difficult in practice, it\u2019s not doable, and it\u2019s against basic trade rules,\u201d said Mr. Mei, the Commerce Ministry researcher.Elsie Chen and Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Humans Are Making Hurricanes Worse. Here\u2019s How. ", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWhen hurricane Florence struck the Carolinas last week, humanity played a role in the destruction.Human intervention is making natural disasters unnaturally harmful, both in causes and effects, and the number of ways our own influence is making things worse, taken together, is sobering. On a global scale, we are bolstering the destructive potential of hurricanes and other extreme weather events by driving climate change. At the local level, we remain reluctant to deal with the problems of our own making, building and rebuilding in risky areas even as we avoid the policies and investment that would help mitigate the threats.Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said that people tended to think of climate change as an abstract problem with only technocratic solutions. But it is getting more concrete all the time, and requires real-life action in response.\u201cThis year has shown us that climate change is a present-day threat to the safety and livelihoods of communities across America,\u201d she said. \u201cSome communities are tackling these issues head on, but some have their heads in the sand.\u201dThe human contribution to heating up the planet by burning fossil fuels is already nudging up the destructiveness of hurricanes like Florence and last year\u2019s Hurricane Harvey in some ways, and will have even greater effects over time: \u201cClimate change is expected to make intense hurricanes more intense,\u201d said Andrew Dessler, a climate expert at Texas A&M University.On top of that, Dr. Dessler said, sea levels have already risen because of global warming, and those heightened sea levels make storm surge levels higher, pushing more water onto land and creating even more flooding.\u201cIf you live on a street named River Road,\u201d he said in an interview, your home \u201cis going to flood.\u201d But the problems stem not only from personal choices but also from a lack of national will to make things better, he said.Jim Blackburn, a professor of environmental law at Rice University in Houston, said that the bond measure was a start, but that attitudes had not changed enough after years of sprawling development and inadequate flood planning.\u201cThe bottom line is we really don\u2019t want to deal with this problem yet,\u201d Mr. Blackburn said. \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in selling houses than we are in taking care of people.\u201dWhat explains the lack of action to stave off climate change at the global level and to address issues of resilience and adaptation at the local level? Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, suggested it goes back to a fundamental human flaw.Long-range planning is necessary to confront the threat of climate change, but \u201cpsychologically, we\u2019re just not designed to do that,\u201d she said. Humans are most acutely attuned to immediate threats, she added: \u201cWe are evolved to run away from the bear, not plan for long-term food supply.\u201dGeneral Honor\u00e9 said he uses strategies to make the problem feel more real to audiences unwilling to accept that climate change was happening. \u201cI ask, \u2018Do you know of a place you used to be able to fish, and you can\u2019t fish any more?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThey all raise their hands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Hotel in Afghanistan That Refuses to Close Its Doors", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarThe bay windows in the Bost Hotel\u2019s dining room looked out across the Helmand River. For all the river\u2019s immensity, the current, borne hundreds of miles from up in the Hindu Kush, spoke only in whispers. The air hummed with mosquitoes. Beyond the river, on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah, the capital of Afghanistan\u2019s Helmand Province, red tracer rounds arced across the night sky.It was spring 2016, and the Taliban were as close to overrunning Lashkar Gah as they had been since they\u2019d been forced out in 2001. I had flown from Kabul for the third time in three months to try to illustrate, through photographs, the fallout from the mismanaged international military mission, and the consequences of its premature withdrawal, as the noose slowly tightened around Helmand\u2019s capital.Each time I checked into the Bost Hotel. Despite its decaying facades and jury-rigged amenities, with the river on one side, a street closed to traffic on the other and a garden of pink and purple chrysanthemums, the hotel maintained a tranquillity that defied the crisis unfolding only a few miles away. At night, that distance was just enough for the fighting to seem harmless, the bullets sailing dolefully through the dark.Since the early days of the American-led invasion of Afghanistan, Helmand, in the country\u2019s Pashtun south, has been the site and symbol of the comprehensive failure of international military and development goals. Today, drug production and corruption are rampant; women\u2019s empowerment, governance and security are threadbare. Support for the Taliban, whose austere tribal and cultural values are, to an extent, compatible with communities in the rural south, runs through Helmand\u2019s villages like the water that feeds its crops, the biggest and most notable of which is opium. Perhaps what best defines Helmand to non-Afghans of this war\u2019s generation is that more foreign soldiers have died fighting there than in any other province. For all that bloodshed, maybe as much as 90 percent of Helmand\u2019s land area (much of which is desert) is today under Taliban control. It\u2019s impossible to know with any certainty, and that alone speaks volumes.Lashkar Gah has suffered many isolated attacks but has been held tenuously by the government throughout. The Bost Hotel, despite the constant risk of attack and, nowadays, occupancy in the single figures, has survived too. Named after the ancient city of Bost, an abandoned ruin a few miles south of the modern city, the Bost Hotel was the first of dozens of structures built by Americans, and the axis around which Lashkar Gah grew to be Helmand\u2019s new capital in the 1950s. But after an idyllic early existence, the Bost has weathered not only decades of war but the occupancy of the cadres who have led the conflicts at each turn. It has hosted the masters of Helmand\u2019s wars and all their cronies and chroniclers. If it had one, the Bost\u2019s guest book would read like a glossary to Helmand\u2019s four decades of war.Once construction on the Bost was completed in the mid-1950s, development spread along the river and away from its east bank into the area that\u2019s now the town center. Lashkar Gah began to resemble the modern prototype city that Afghanistan\u2019s King Zahir Shah envisaged. American aspirations were no less ambitious; Lashkar Gah was the center of a huge Cold War effort to counter Soviet influence in the country. American engineers from the construction behemoth Morrison Knudsen built dams and canals and opened up hundreds of thousands of acres of desert to agriculture, splitting the Dasht-e Margo, the Desert of Death, in two. The goal was to propel Afghanistan into regional markets and, eventually, into the modern world.The engineers brought their families and lived in bungalows that ran two blocks deep along the Helmand River. They were built to American standards, with lush lawns that opened onto pine-tree-lined streets. On the weekends, the Americans would compete in egg-and-spoon races and picnic by the river. Afghan children would come from surrounding villages to marvel at the foreigners in their beautiful clothes. At the community clubhouse, American engineers and Afghan government officials hobnobbed by the pool in a garden of roses and palms overlooking the river. Gin and tonics were served at nightly card games, while movie screenings attracted families on the weekends. Locals say the king himself kept a room and an office on the first floor, as an escape from the bitter Kabul winters. That clubhouse, the center of life in the newly built company town, was the building that later became the Bost Hotel.Afghan opposition fighters, mujahedeen, advanced on Lashkar Gah in the early 1980s, but the city remained under the control of the Soviets and their Afghan allies throughout their nearly decade-long occupation. Fighting in the districts, however, was brutal. Aerial bombing and indiscriminate artillery fire flattened villages and destroyed irrigation canals. Soviet and government troops were accused of mass rape and massacres that wiped out whole villages. To wear down opposition factions, the Soviets deliberately exacerbated intertribal conflicts, ensuring the province\u2019s slide into civil war after their departure, in 1989. It was during this lawless time that the Bost Hotel suffered its worst damage to date. Without a functioning state to contain it, fighting between factions went unhindered in Lashkar Gah, and much of the hotel\u2019s riverfront facade was destroyed, the bricks from its three-foot-thick walls cascading down the steep bank and into the river. The building was abandoned, and its contents were looted. The Bost Hotel, like the city it was named after, was left in ruins.After 15 years of war, with the population tired of the criminal rackets and warlords fighting for power in the wake of their jihad, a new force with a reputation for high virtue swept through the south from neighboring Kandahar: The Taliban took control of Lashkar Gah in 1994 with barely a bullet fired. Soon, mujahedeen commanders were disarmed, and violence was almost eradicated. For regular Helmandis, the Taliban\u2019s harshness \u2014 rule based on fear and zero tolerance for crime \u2014 was a small price to pay for stability. In fact, there were few Taliban fighters in Helmand at all. With little opposition to their rule in the south, the majority were sent to fight the Northern Alliance. In Lashkar Gah, the handful of brick government buildings, including the Bost Hotel, were quickly occupied. After the damage was repaired, the hotel became a place for Taliban commanders and their fighters to convalesce away from the battlefield.Then came Sept. 11, 2001. After Al Qaeda\u2019s attack, the United States led an invasion of Afghanistan. It began on Oct. 7; 12 weeks later, on the last day of 2001, a Special Forces team entered Lashkar Gah. They found the Bost Hotel abandoned and took up residence, building sandbag machine-gun positions on the flat roof.Most Taliban in Helmand stowed their weapons and returned to agrarian village life; others allied themselves with the new administration in Lashkar Gah. American Special Forces teams worked with local militias, scouring the districts for remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. They killed or captured scores who were neither, but were simply rivals of the Helmandi commanders they had chosen to work with. Some Taliban, fearing capture and extradition to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, or worse, may have disappeared across the border into Pakistan. For a few years, with the Americans operating mostly in rural Helmand, and local tribal elites running the province with Kabul\u2019s blessing, Lashkar Gah maintained an uneasy peace.In 2002, one such tribal leader, Sher Mohammad Akhundzada, settled in as the new provincial governor and opened up his office in a compound next door to the Bost. One of his staff members, Jan Mohammad, had worked at the hotel during the tumultuous years that followed the Soviet departure, before the Taliban took over. He and other staff members cleared the Special Forces\u2019 fortifications from the roof; repainted the interior; laid new carpet; hung heavy, pencil-pleat curtains across the windows; and opened for business. The governor charged $50 per person per night. Jan Mohammad is still there, booking guests into the hotel today.The large function room, flooded with light from a bank of windows that looks over the river, and the long, narrow dining room were used for meetings between local Afghan officials and American military officers. Paying guests were mostly journalists, international envoys and visiting Afghan officials. Some of the hotel\u2019s first foreign guests were a British team sent to coordinate opium-eradication efforts. Concerned that they might curtail the lucrative opium business of his friends, Akhundzada convinced them, \u201cfor their own safety,\u201d not to leave the hotel, according to Mike Martin, who served in Helmand as a British army officer and is now one of the top Western experts on the province\u2019s complex web of factional wars. In the dining room, a famously ruthless Afghan general once held court at the head of the table and, in a show of faux humility that drew surreptitious eye rolls from around the table, served green tea and pilau to lower ranking soldiers and government aides, recalls one guest, who was visiting from Kabul as a political aide at the time. On summer evenings, journalists would eat dinner outside the hotel walls under the eucalyptus trees along the river, whose gray-green water seemed to absorb some of the lingering heat. In the comfort of clean rooms laden with plump cushions, visitors may have even divined the beginning of a return to the days of \u201cLittle America.\u201dOptimism, however, was short-lived. By 2005, insurgency was brewing again in rural Helmand. Assassins, whose work was often, rightly or wrongly, attributed to the Taliban, began picking off officials from the new provincial government, and by 2006 its shaky foundations were at risk of collapsing altogether. The British deployed about 700 soldiers to patrol Helmand but the increased foreign military footprint only exacerbated the violence.The West\u2019s interest in Helmand was proportional to its military presence in the province, and journalists began cycling in and out. With security continuing to deteriorate, the Bost became one of the few places safe enough for visitors to stay. At times, the hotel reaped the windfalls of the war economy. One year, the exterior received a fresh coat of paint. At another point there was enough money for gaudy new vinyl couches, which are still there now, positioned around the perimeter of common rooms like circling wagons.Journalists appreciated the Bost\u2019s relative security and majestic river view. Qais Azimy, then a senior producer with Al Jazeera who stayed there many times starting in the mid-2000s, said that for him, the Bost Hotel was \u201clike a safe bubble inside a fire.\u201d But with the governor next door, the threat was never far away. The scrub across the river made perfect cover for insurgents firing mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. One of the Bost\u2019s security guards still wears a cloth patch over an eye socket gouged out by shrapnel from a rocket strike in 2016. When the sun went down, the hotel curtains were always drawn, lest the light attract fire from a sniper.At least twice, the Bost has been menaced by more concentrated attacks. In 2008, 300 anti-government fighters launched an attack on the governor\u2019s compound. They made their way up the west side of the river, but were mowed down by British attack helicopters before they could reach their target. In 2010, heavily armed insurgents strapped with suicide vests occupied the unfinished Sun and Moon Hotel, right on the same street. British officers set up a command post inside the Bost and coordinated the joint Afghan-British counterattack.During summer, daytime temperatures in Lashkar Gah frequently reach 115 degrees. The sky turns white, as if faded by the sun, and for hours on either side of lunchtime, the half-dozen main streets are empty. Visiting journalists can find respite in a handful of dark, cell-like rooms facing away from the river and the scorching afternoon sun and equipped with faltering air-conditioners. For a period during the late 2000s, however, arriving guests were occasionally told that the rooms were occupied. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear by whom; the occupants were practically nocturnal. They would appear from time to time: a dozen hulking, bearded men wearing pale, slim-fitting shalwar kameezes like those favored by hip young men in Kabul and wraparound sunglasses. They were American Special Operations Forces, according to two journalists who spotted them occasionally. They disappeared into the districts at night, returning in dusty Toyota Corollas to sleep during the day. It wasn\u2019t the only building on the street where outsiders tried to keep a low profile. For several years, the unremarkable compound opposite the Bost was a C.I.A. safe house, says a Western military official who worked in the area at the time.In 2014, after British forces and American Marines withdrew from Helmand, interest in Helmand Province, and in Afghanistan more broadly, plummeted. News bureaus in Kabul shrank or closed altogether, and without stories of American and Europeans on the front lines, the news media\u2019s appetite for risk dwindled. For the handful of foreign journalists who continued to cover Helmand (and the number could literally be counted on one hand), the province was awash with stories of an international effort gone awry, told by Helmandis who had been left to deal with the consequences.The increasingly precarious conditions strangled the local economy. The opium industry was flourishing, but its multimillion dollar profits went into the war chests of the Taliban and their cartel allies or left the country altogether. Along with Lashkar Gah\u2019s decaying amusement park and disused cotton gin, the hotel suffered from neglect. With the electricity in Lashkar Gah frequently cut off, money from the diminishing number of guests was poured straight into the hotel\u2019s diesel generator. The swimming pool dried up and was never refilled; bored police used it as a cricket pitch instead. The ceilings and walls began to bubble from damp and crack in the oven-like heat. Bedsheets went unwashed, toilets and door handles went unfixed, and the cook fell into a tired routine: hard-boiled eggs and bread for breakfast, stewed okra and bread for dinner.By the time I first traveled to Helmand in 2014, the Special Operations Forces had retreated to heavily guarded military bases and hadn\u2019t been seen at the Bost in years. Journalists were increasingly scarce, too. One was far more likely, in fact, to share dinner with exiled district governors from Taliban strongholds like Musa Qala and Baghran. The insurgents were inching closer and closer to Lashkar Gah. Each time I returned, the front-line villages I had visited previously \u2014 and the ragtag government forces struggling to hold them \u2014 had been overrun by insurgents. By September 2016, the Taliban were at the city\u2019s gates. They controlled almost all of Helmand beyond the government\u2019s defensive lines, barely a mile from the hotel. Residents were leaving any way they could. The Taliban were regularly firing on the governor\u2019s house from across the river at night. Business for the Bost atrophied once again. Jan Mohammad, the governor\u2019s longtime staff member, wouldn\u2019t check in another guest for months.On the last night of my stay in 2017, silhouetted against the dusk on the hotel roof, I drank two bottles of beer I managed to smuggle in from Kabul with another journalist. I had chilled them in the Bost\u2019s only refrigerator. Our legs dangled over the edge into the darkness. That night, only stars burnished the sky, and below, the Helmand River flowed silently by.Andrew Quilty is a photojournalist based in Kabul, Afghanistan, where he has worked since 2014.

{"Headline": "Doctors Fleeing Syria for Germany Find Refuge, Hurdles and Delays", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHEIDE, Germany \u2014 When Ayham Ebrahim fled the war in his native Syria in 2016 and joined his wife, a pediatrician, in Germany, he was eager to continue his career as a doctor of internal medicine.But after arriving in the country that was offering them refuge, instead of finding a system eager to put his talents to use, Mr. Ebrahim said, he encountered hurdles and delays that left him discouraged, demoralized and frustrated.It took months before he could even apply for refugee status. That delayed the start of his required German-language classes. Then, his wife was offered a temporary job at a research hospital here in Heide, some 50 miles west of Kiel, the capital of Schleswig-Holstein State. So he moved with her.But no professional-level German-language classes were offered in the smaller city, so he was forced to commute two hours each way to complete the course.\u201cIt was the longest and coldest days I have ever lived,\u201d Mr. Ebrahim said recently.\u201cIt has been really tough. While on the train to attend my language class, I had moments when I thought I couldn\u2019t do this,\u201d he added, while sitting in his doctor\u2019s coat in the cafeteria of the West Coast Clinic, known by its German initials WKK, in Heide, Germany, shortly after he had begun an internship there.While no country allows foreign doctors to work in their country without ensuring that they meet local standards, the Syrians in Germany complain that the system here is complicated: There are, for example, different accreditation departments in each of the nation\u2019s 16 states, which they say often have different standards; and the process is riddled with wait times of several months between registration exams, adding to the difficultly.When Parliament reconvenes after its summer recess, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government plans to draw up a bill that would make it easier for foreigners to seek work in Germany. An initial proposal circulated last month calls for foreign candidates to have the necessary qualifications, to speak German and to have a job offer that ensures they can support themselves.The more than 3,370 Syrian doctors already treating patients in German hospitals and clinics are not likely to be affected by the new legislation.\u201cWe have seen a million people enter the country through uncontrolled immigration, and that should not be legalized after the fact,\u201d Bernd Baumann, head of the AfD\u2019s parliamentary caucus, said in August.Still, the country is scrambling to fill the vacancies among medical professionals left by retirees and a generational shift that is being worsened by employees\u2019 demand for a stronger work-life balance and a preference by young people for more part-time positions.Even so, the head of the doctors\u2019 association in Germany wants to introduce a requirement that foreign doctors from outside the European Union must pass a written exam equivalent to that taken by German medical students, amid concerns that too many foreigners are producing fake medical qualifications from their home countries.Although the idea faces opposition from others in the medical profession, the prospect is terrifying to Mr. Ebrahim and other colleagues. Already, they face stringent language and license exams before they are allowed to practice, and they and argue that asking them to effectively retake a medical exam in a foreign language would be an unnecessary burden.Mahmoud Jalloud, 43, a gastroenterologist from Raqqa, Syria, now living in L\u00fcneburg, southeast of Hamburg, spent his first five months in Germany teaching himself the language. After he finally landed in a class, he was surrounded, he said, by others who seemed to be there only to tick a box to receive their benefits.\u201cI finished studying medicine in 2000 and invested another seven years to specialize as a gastroenterologist,\u201d Mr. Jalloud said. \u201cNow I have to go through all of this to be recognized as a general practitioner, and God knows how long it will take before I am recognized as a gastroenterologist again.\u201d\u201cI am just wondering why Germany is not making it easy for us refugees who are keen on learning, working and contributing to this community,\u201d he added.Many older doctors who came to Germany say they feel the same way. Some have found menial jobs washing dishes or selling kebabs to support their families in Germany. They are daunted by the hurdles they face to begin practicing again.Aware of such obstacles, the WKK clinic has developed special programs and support for newly arrived staff members. Apartments on the hospital grounds allow new employees to live there while searching for a home. They are accompanied to the registry offices to complete their paperwork and are offered hospital bedside language coaching.\u201cWe are very open and make sure that we take care of those who are coming to us from afar \u2014 whether they are coming from Lithuania, Syria or Bavaria,\u201d said Sebastian Kimst\u00e4dt, a spokesman for the hospital.The assistance includes organizing special language classes tailored to the terms that doctors will need to know, including complaints in the local dialect, \u201cPlattdeutsch,\u201d still spoken by many of the older patients. Language teachers also accompany foreign doctors on their rounds to help coach them on their bedside manners.\u201cIt\u2019s helpful \u2014 I really wanted to take part,\u201d said Ali Eid, 31, who practiced in Syrian hospitals before he fled to Germany.For the Syrian doctors, the steep learning curve in their new country also includes some social and cultural differences. Mr. Ebrahim\u2019s wife, Roua Shaweesh, who treats patients in the WKK clinic\u2019s pediatric ward, said she was surprised at how many German parents took their children to the emergency room for coughs and colds.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t see that in Syria,\u201d she said, adding that she had also not encountered in Germany many of the childhood illnesses common in her homeland.Mr. Eid said he was surprised to learn that doctors addressed older patients directly when discussing severe, even fatal, illnesses with them. In Syria, the patients would be surrounded by their adult children and other family members, who would be a doctor\u2019s point of contact, he said.Over all, he said, he was impressed by the standard of medicine practiced in Germany and was happy to be able to contribute to his new community.Asked if he would consider returning to Syria, he counted the years it would take him to finish his internship, his language lessons, residency and licensing exam before he could begin practicing in Germany.\u201cBy then, I will be too old to start all over again,\u201d Mr. Eid said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Want to Believe Jobs Are the Solution to Poverty. They\u2019re Not.", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "FeatureU.S. unemployment is down and jobs are going unfilled. But for people without much education, the real question is: Do those jobs pay enough to live on?Supported byAt her childhood home, Vanessa began caring for her ailing father. He had been a functional crack addict for most of her life, working as a landscaper in the warmer months and collecting unemployment when business slowed down. \u201cIt was something you got used to seeing,\u201d Vanessa said about her father\u2019s drug habit. \u201cMy dad was a junkie, but he never left us.\u201d Vanessa, 33, has black hair that is usually pulled into a bun and wire-framed glasses that slide down her nose; a shy smile peeks out when she feels proud of herself.Vanessa\u2019s father died a year after Vanessa moved in. The family erected a shrine to him in the living room, a faded, large photo of a younger man surrounded by silk flowers and slowly sinking balloons. Vanessa\u2019s mother, Zaida, is 62 and from Puerto Rico, as was her husband. She uses a walker to get around. Her husband\u2019s death left her with little income, and Vanessa was often broke herself. Her health failing, Zaida could take only so much of Vanessa\u2019s children, Taliya, 17, Shamal, 14, and Tatiyana, 12. When things got too loud or one of her grandchildren gave her lip, she would ask Vanessa to take her children somewhere else.If Vanessa had the money, or if a local nonprofit did, she would book a motel room. She liked the Red Roof Inn, which she saw as \u201cmore civilized\u201d than many of the other motels she had stayed in. It looked like a highway motel: two stories with doors that opened to the outside. The last time the family checked in, the kids carried their homework up to the room as Vanessa followed with small grocery bags from the food pantry, passing two men sipping Modelos and apologizing for their loud music. Inside their room, Vanessa placed her insulin in the minifridge as her children chose beds, where they would sleep two to a mattress. Then she slid into a small chair, saying, \u201cY\u2019all don\u2019t know how tired Mommy is.\u201d After a quiet moment, Vanessa reached over and rubbed Shamal\u2019s back, telling him, \u201cI wish we had a nice place like this.\u201d Then her eye spotted a roach feeling its way over the stucco wall.\u201cOp! Not too nice,\u201d Vanessa said, grinning. With a flick, she sent the bug flying toward Taliya, who squealed and jerked back. Laughter burst from the room.When Vanessa couldn\u2019t get a motel, the family spent the night in the Chrysler. The back of the station wagon held the essentials: pillows and blankets, combs and toothbrushes, extra clothes, jackets and nonperishable food. But there were also wrinkled photos of her kids. One showed Taliya at her eighth-grade graduation in a cream dress holding flowers. Another showed all three children at a quincea\u00f1era \u2014 Shamal kneeling in front, with a powder blue clip-on bow tie framing his baby face, and Tatiyana tucked in back with a deep-dimpled smile.So that the kids wouldn\u2019t run away out of anger or shame, Vanessa learned to park off Route 1, in crevices of the city that were so still and abandoned that no one dared crack a door until daybreak. Come morning, Vanessa would drive to her mother\u2019s home so the kids could get ready for school and she could get ready for work.In May, Vanessa finally secured a spot in public housing. But for almost three years, she had belonged to the \u201cworking homeless,\u201d a now-necessary phrase in today\u2019s low-wage/high-rent society. She is a home health aide, the same job her mother had until her knees and back gave out. Her work uniform is Betty Boop scrubs, sneakers and an ID badge that hangs on a red Bayada Home Healthcare lanyard. Vanessa works steady hours and likes her job, even the tougher bits like bathing the infirm or hoisting someone out of bed with a Hoyer lift. \u201cI get to help people,\u201d she said, \u201cand be around older people and learn a lot of stuff from them.\u201d Her rate fluctuates: She gets $10 an hour for one client, $14 for another. It doesn\u2019t have to do with the nature of the work \u2014 \u201cSometimes the hardest ones can be the cheapest ones,\u201d Vanessa said \u2014 but with reimbursement rates, which differ according to the client\u2019s health care coverage. After juggling the kids and managing her diabetes, Vanessa is able to work 20 to 30 hours a week, which earns her around $1,200 a month. And that\u2019s when things go well.In recent decades, the nation\u2019s tremendous economic growth has not led to broad social uplift. Economists call it the \u201cproductivity-pay gap\u201d \u2014 the fact that over the last 40 years, the economy has expanded and corporate profits have risen, but real wages have remained flat for workers without a college education. Since 1973, American productivity has increased by 77 percent, while hourly pay has grown by only 12 percent. If the federal minimum wage tracked productivity, it would be more than $20 an hour, not today\u2019s poverty wage of $7.25.American workers are being shut out of the profits they are helping to generate. The decline of unions is a big reason. During the 20th century, inequality in America decreased when unionization increased, but economic transformations and political attacks have crippled organized labor, emboldening corporate interests and disempowering the rank and file. This imbalanced economy explains why America\u2019s poverty rate has remained consistent over the past several decades, even as per capita welfare spending has increased. It\u2019s not that safety-net programs don\u2019t help; on the contrary, they lift millions of families above the poverty line each year. But one of the most effective antipoverty solutions is a decent-paying job, and those have become scarce for people like Vanessa. Today, 41.7 million laborers \u2014 nearly a third of the American work force \u2014 earn less than $12 an hour, and almost none of their employers offer health insurance.The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines a \u201cworking poor\u201d person as someone below the poverty line who spent at least half the year either working or looking for employment. In 2016, there were roughly 7.6 million Americans who fell into this category. Most working poor people are over 35, while fewer than five in 100 are between the ages of 16 and 19. In other words, the working poor are not primarily teenagers bagging groceries or scooping ice cream in paper hats. They are adults \u2014 and often parents \u2014 wiping down hotel showers and toilets, taking food orders and bussing tables, eviscerating chickens at meat-processing plants, minding children at 24-hour day care centers, picking berries, emptying trash cans, stacking grocery shelves at midnight, driving taxis and Ubers, answering customer-service hotlines, smoothing hot asphalt on freeways, teaching community-college students as adjunct professors and, yes, bagging groceries and scooping ice cream in paper hats.America prides itself on being the country of economic mobility, a place where your station in life is limited only by your ambition and grit. But changes in the labor market have shrunk the already slim odds of launching yourself from the mailroom to the boardroom. For one, the job market has bifurcated, increasing the distance between good and bad jobs. Working harder and longer will not translate into a promotion if employers pull up the ladders and offer supervisory positions exclusively to people with college degrees. Because large companies now farm out many positions to independent contractors, those who buff the floors at Microsoft or wash the sheets at the Sheraton typically are not employed by Microsoft or Sheraton, thwarting any hope of advancing within the company. Plus, working harder and longer often isn\u2019t even an option for those at the mercy of an unpredictable schedule. Nearly 40 percent of full-time hourly workers know their work schedules just a week or less in advance. And if you give it your all in a job you can land with a high-school diploma (or less), that job might not exist for very long: Half of all new positions are eliminated within the first year. According to the labor sociologist Arne Kalleberg, permanent terminations have become \u201ca basic component of employers\u2019 restructuring strategies.\u201dHome health care has emerged as an archetypal job in this new, low-pay service economy. Demand for home health care has surged as the population has aged, but according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2017 median annual income for home health aides in the United States was just $23,130. Half of these workers depend on public assistance to make ends meet. Vanessa formed a rapport with several of her clients, to whom she confided that she was homeless. One replied, \u201cOh, Vanessa, I wish I could do something for you.\u201d When Vanessa told her supervisor about her situation, he asked if she wanted time off. \u201cNo!\u201d Vanessa said. She needed the money and had been picking up fill-in shifts. The supervisor was prepared for the moment; he\u2019d been there before. He reached into a drawer and gave her a $50 gas card to Shell and a $100 grocery card to ShopRite. Vanessa was grateful for the help. She thought Bayada was a generous and sympathetic employer, but her rate hadn\u2019t changed much in the three years she had worked there. Vanessa earned $9,815.75 in 2015, $12,763.94 in 2016 and $10,446.81 last year.To afford basic necessities, the federal government estimates that Vanessa\u2019s family would need to bring in $29,420 a year. Vanessa is not even close \u2014 and she is one of the lucky ones, at least among the poor. The nation\u2019s safety net now strongly favors the employed, with benefits like the earned-income tax credit, a once-a-year cash boost that applies only to people who work. Last year, Vanessa received a tax refund of around $5,000, which included earned-income and child tax credits. They helped raise her income, but not above the poverty line. If the working poor are doing better than the nonworking poor, which is the case, it\u2019s not so much because of their jobs per se, but because their employment status provides them access to desperately needed government help. This has caused growing inequality below the poverty line, with the working poor receiving much more social aid than the abandoned nonworking poor or the precariously employed, who are plunged into destitution.When life feels especially grinding, Vanessa often rings up Sheri Sprouse, her best friend since middle school. \u201cShe\u2019s like me,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cShe\u2019s strong.\u201d Sheri is a reserve of emotional support and perspective, often encouraging her friend to be patient and grateful for what she has. But Sheri herself is also just scraping by, raising two daughters on a fixed disability check. And because Sheri\u2019s housing is subsidized through a federally administered voucher, it is also monitored. \u201cWith Section 8, you can\u2019t have people staying with you,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t want to mess that up.\u201d When Vanessa was homeless, Sheri couldn\u2019t offer her much else besides love.Vanessa received some help last year, when her youngest child, Tatiyana, was approved for Supplemental Security Income because of a learning disability. Vanessa began receiving a monthly $766 disability check. But when the Mercer County Board of Social Services learned of this additional money, it sent Vanessa a letter announcing that her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits would be reduced to $234 from $544. Food was a constant struggle, and this news didn\u2019t help. A 2013 study by Oxfam America found that two-thirds of working poor people worry about being able to afford enough food. When Vanessa stayed at a hotel, her food options were limited to what she could heat in the microwave; when she slept in her car, the family had to settle for grab-and-go options, which tend to be more expensive. Sometimes Vanessa stopped by a bodega and ordered four chicken-and-rice dishes for $15. Sometimes her kids went to school hungry. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have nothing,\u201d Vanessa told me one morning. For dinner, she planned to stop by a food pantry, hoping they still had the mac-and-cheese that Shamal liked.Americans often assume that the poor do not work. According to a 2016 survey conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, nearly two-thirds of respondents did not think most poor people held a steady job; in reality, that year a majority of nondisabled working-age adults were part of the labor force. Slightly over one-third of respondents in the survey believed that most welfare recipients would prefer to stay on welfare rather than earn a living. These sorts of assumptions about the poor are an American phenomenon. A 2013 study by the sociologist Ofer Sharone found that unemployed workers in the United States blame themselves, while unemployed workers in Israel blame the hiring system. When Americans see a homeless man cocooned in blankets, we often wonder how he failed. When the French see the same man, they wonder how the state failed him.If you believe that people are poor because they are not working, then the solution is not to make work pay but to make the poor work \u2014 to force them to clock in somewhere, anywhere, and log as many hours as they can. But consider Vanessa. Her story is emblematic of a larger problem: the fact that millions of Americans work with little hope of finding security and comfort. In recent decades, America has witnessed the rise of bad jobs offering low pay, no benefits and little certainty. When it comes to poverty, a willingness to work is not the problem, and work itself is no longer the solution.Until the late 18th century, poverty in the West was considered not only durable but desirable for economic growth. Mercantilism, the dominant economic theory of the early modern period, held that hunger incentivized work and kept wages low. Wards of public charity were jailed and required to work to eat. In the current era, politicians and their publics have continued to demand toil and sweat from the poor. In the 1980s, conservatives wanted to attach work requirements to food stamps. In the 1990s, they wanted to impose work requirements on subsidized-housing programs. Both proposals failed, but the impulse has endured.Advocates of work requirements scored a landmark victory with welfare reform in the mid-1990s. Proposed by House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, welfare reform affixed work requirements and time limits to cash assistance. Caseloads fell to 4.5 million in 2011 from 12.3 million in 1996. Did \u201cwelfare to work\u201d in fact work? Was it a major success in reducing poverty and sowing prosperity? Hardly. As Kathryn Edin and Laura Lein showed in their landmark book, \u201cMaking Ends Meet,\u201d single mothers pushed into the low-wage labor market earned more money than they did on welfare, but they also incurred more expenses, like transportation and child care, which nullified modest income gains. Most troubling, without guaranteed cash assistance for the most needy, extreme poverty in America surged. The number of Americans living on only $2 or less per person per day has more than doubled since welfare reform. Roughly three million children \u2014 which exceeds the population of Chicago \u2014 now suffer under these conditions. Most of those children live with an adult who held a job sometime during the year.A top priority for the Trump administration is expanding work requirements for some of the nation\u2019s biggest safety-net programs. In January, the federal government announced that it would let states require that Medicaid recipients work. A dozen states have formally applied for a federal waiver to affix work requirements to their Medicaid programs. Four have been approved. In June, Arkansas became the first to implement newly approved work requirements. If all states instated Medicaid work requirements similar to that of Arkansas, as many as four million Americans could lose their health insurance.In April, President Trump issued an executive order mandating that federal agencies review welfare programs, from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to housing assistance, and propose new standards. Although SNAP already has work requirements, in June the House passed a draft farm bill that would deny able-bodied adults SNAP benefits for an entire year if they did not work or engage in work-related activities (like job training) for at least 20 hours a week during a single month. Falling short a second time could get you barred for three years. The Senate\u2019s farm bill, a bipartisan effort, removed these rules and stringent penalties, setting up a showdown with the House, whose version Trump has endorsed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that work requirements could deny 1.2 million people a benefit that they use to eat.Work requirements affixed to other programs make similar demands. Kentucky\u2019s proposed Medicaid requirements are satisfied only after 80 hours of work or work-related training each month. In a low-wage labor market characterized by fluctuating hours, tenuous employment and involuntary part-time work, a large share of vulnerable workers fall short of these requirements. Nationally representative data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation show that among workers who qualify for Medicaid, almost 50 percent logged fewer than 80 hours in at least one month.In July, the White House Council of Economic Advisers issued a report enthusiastically endorsing work requirements for the nation\u2019s largest welfare programs. The council favored \u201cnegative incentives,\u201d tying aid to labor-market effort, and dismissed \u201cpositive incentives,\u201d like tax benefits for low-income workers, because the former is cheaper. The council also claimed that America\u2019s welfare policies have brought about a \u201cdecline in self-sufficiency.\u201dIs that true? Researchers set out to study welfare dependency in the 1980s and 1990s, when this issue dominated public debate. They didn\u2019t find much evidence of it. Most people started using cash welfare after a divorce or separation and didn\u2019t stay long on the dole, even if they returned to welfare periodically. One study found that 90 percent of young women on welfare stopped relying on it within two years of starting the program, but most of them returned to welfare sometime down the road. Even at its peak, welfare did not function as a dependency trap for a majority of recipients; rather, it was something people relied on when they were between jobs or after a family crisis. A 1988 review in Science concluded that \u201cthe welfare system does not foster reliance on welfare so much as it acts as insurance against temporary misfortune.\u201dToday as then, the able-bodied, poor and idle adult remains a rare creature. According to the Brookings Institution, in 2016 one-third of those living in poverty were children, 11 percent were elderly and 24 percent were working-age adults (18 to 64) in the labor force, working or seeking work. The majority of working-age poor people connected to the labor market were part-time workers. Most couldn\u2019t take on many more hours either because of caregiver responsibilities, as with Vanessa, or because their employer didn\u2019t offer this option, rendering them involuntary part-time workers. Among the remaining working-age adults, 12 percent were out of the labor force owing to a disability (including some enrolled in federal programs that limit work), 15 percent were either students or caregivers and 3 percent were early retirees. That leaves 2 percent of poor people who did not fit into one of these categories. That is, among the poor, two in 100 are working-age adults disconnected from the labor market for unknown reasons. The nonworking poor person getting something for nothing is a lot like the cheat committing voter fraud: pariahs who loom far larger in the American imagination than in real life.Shamal and Tatiyana\u2019s father had recently moved back to Trenton, \u201ccarrying a sack like a hobo,\u201d Vanessa remembered. Other than erratic child-support payments and a single trip to Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s, he doesn\u2019t play much of a role in his children\u2019s lives. Taliya\u2019s father went to prison when she was 1. He was released when she was 8 and was killed a few months later, shot in the chest. Sometimes Vanessa\u2019s three kids teased one another about their fathers. \u201cYour dad is dead,\u201d Tatiyana would say. \u201cYeah? Your dad\u2019s around, but he don\u2019t give a crap about you,\u201d Taliya would shoot back.Other times, though, the siblings offered soft reassurances that their fathers\u2019 absence wasn\u2019t their fault. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for him,\u201d Tatiyana said once, as if it were her choice. \u201cI have time for my real friends.\u201d Taliya looked at her baby sister and replied: \u201cWatch. When you\u2019re doing good, he gonna start coming around.\u201dIf Vanessa clocked more hours, it would be difficult to keep up with all the ways she manages her family: doing the laundry, arranging dentist appointments, counseling the children about sex, studying their deep mysteries to extract their gifts and troubles. Yet our political leaders tend to refuse to view child care as work. During the early days of welfare reform, some local authorities thought up useless jobs for single mothers receiving the benefit. In one outrageous case, recipients were made to sort small plastic toys into different colors, only to have their supervisor end the day by mixing everything up, so the work could start anew the next morning. This was thought more important than keeping children safe and fed.Vanessa attributed her own academic setbacks \u2014 a good student in middle school, she began cutting class and courting trouble in high school \u2014 to the fact that her parents were checked out. At a critical juncture when Vanessa needed guidance and discipline, her father was using drugs and her mother seemed always to be at work. She didn\u2019t want to make the same mistake with her kids. Vanessa\u2019s life revolved around a small routine: drop the kids off at school; work; try finding an apartment that rents for less than $1,000 a month; pick the kids up; feed them; sleep. She didn\u2019t spend her money on extras, including cigarettes and alcohol. She was trying to save \u201cthe little money that I got,\u201d she told me, \u201cso when we do get a place, I can get the kids washcloths and towels.\u201dHere is the blueprint. First, valorize work as the ticket out of poverty, and debase caregiving as not work. Look at a single mother without a formal job, and say she is not working; spot one working part time and demand she work more. Transform love into laziness. Next, force the poor to log more hours in a labor market that treats them as expendables. Rest assured that you can pay them little and deny them sick time and health insurance because the American taxpayer will step in, subsidizing programs like the earned-income tax credit and food stamps on which your work force will rely. Watch welfare spending increase while the poverty rate stagnates because, well, you are hoarding profits. When that happens, skirt responsibility by blaming the safety net itself. From there, politicians will invent new ways of denying families relief, like slapping unrealistic work requirements on aid for the poor.Democrats may scoff at Republicans\u2019 work requirements, but they have yet to challenge the dominant conception of poverty that feeds such meanspirited politics. Instead of offering a counternarrative to America\u2019s moral trope of deservedness, liberals have generally submitted to it, perhaps even embraced it, figuring that the public will not support aid that doesn\u2019t demand that the poor subject themselves to the low-paying jobs now available to them. Even stalwarts of the progressive movement seem to reserve economic prosperity for the full-time worker. Senator Bernie Sanders once declared, echoing a long line of Democrats who have come before and after him, \u201cNobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty.\u201d Sure, but what about those who work 20 or 30 hours, like Vanessa?Because liberals have allowed conservatives to set the terms of the poverty debate, they find themselves arguing about radical solutions that imagine either a fully employed nation (like a jobs guarantee) or a postwork society (like a universal basic income). Neither plan has the faintest hope of being actually implemented nationwide anytime soon, which means neither is any good to Vanessa and millions like her. When so much attention is spent on far-off, utopian solutions, we neglect the importance of the poverty fixes we already have. Safety-net programs that help families confront food insecurity, housing unaffordability and unemployment spells lift tens of millions of people above the poverty line each year. By itself, SNAP annually pulls over eight million people out of poverty. According to a 2015 study, without federal tax benefits and transfers, the number of Americans living in deep poverty (half below the poverty threshold) would jump from 5 percent to almost 19 percent. Effective social-mobility programs should be championed, expanded and stripped of draconian work requirements.While Washington continues to require more of vulnerable workers, it has required little from employers in the form of living wages or job security, creating a labor market in which the biggest disincentive to work is not welfare but the lousy jobs that are available. Judging from the current state of the nation\u2019s poverty agenda, it appears that most people creating federal and state policy don\u2019t know many people like Vanessa. \u201cHalf of the people in City Hall don\u2019t even live in Trenton,\u201d Vanessa once told me, flustered. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know what goes on here.\u201d Meanwhile, this is the richest Congress on record, with one in 13 members belonging to the top 1 percent. From such a high perch, poverty appears a smaller problem, something less gutting, and work appears a bigger solution, something more gratifying. But when we shrink the problem, the solution shrinks with it; when small solutions are applied to a huge problem, they don\u2019t work; and when weak antipoverty initiatives don\u2019t work, many throw up their hands and argue that we should stop tossing money at the problem altogether. Cheap solutions only cheapen the problem.This month, I had dinner with first-year honors students at a university in Massachusetts. Some leaned right, others left. But all of them were united in their inability to explain poverty in a way that didn\u2019t somehow hold the poor responsible for their predicament. Poor people lacked work ethic, they told me, or maybe a strong backbone or a commitment to a better life. I began to regret that alcohol hadn\u2019t been served when one student brought up the movie \u201cThe Pursuit of Happyness,\u201d in which Will Smith\u2019s character performs superhumanly well at his job to leap from homelessness to affluence. The student was no senator\u2019s son: He told us that times were lean after his parents divorced. As I watched this young man identify with Smith\u2019s character, it dawned on me that what his parents, preachers, teachers, coaches and guidance counselors had told him for motivation \u2014 \u201cStudy hard, stick to it, dream big and you will be successful\u201d \u2014 had been internalized as a theory of life.We need a new language for talking about poverty. \u201cNobody who works should be poor,\u201d we say. That\u2019s not good enough. Nobody in America should be poor, period. No single mother struggling to raise children on her own; no formerly incarcerated man who has served his time; no young heroin user struggling with addiction and pain; no retired bus driver whose pension was squandered; nobody. And if we respect hard work, then we should reward it, instead of deploying this value to shame the poor and justify our unconscionable and growing inequality. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard to get where I am,\u201d you might say. Well, sure. But Vanessa has worked hard to get where she is, too.Matthew Desmond is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of \u201cEvicted,\u201d which won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Finding Common Ground at El Museo del Barrio", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookLocation, location, location. In real estate, place determines value. Sometimes it can for art too. El Museo del Barrio originated in 1969 in classrooms, storefronts and a repurposed fire station in what was then the predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood of East Harlem. The museum was a product of pride and necessity. In local public schools, young artist-activists, often working free, taught children the virtues of cultural self-expression and communal self-sufficiency. And they taught from experience. At the time, no mainstream art institution in the city would show their art. They needed a museum of their own and, collectively, they created one.His arrival coincided with a temporary closing of the museum for upgrades. The galleries have now reopened with two substantial, and very different, traveling exhibitions. Both being loan shows, they give little sense of what El Museo itself can produce. Yet their pairing seems calculated to bridge the rift in the institution\u2019s bifurcated mission.Mr. Maristany, who in 1969 became a founding member and official photographer of the Young Lords, a leftist Latino activist organization, still lives in East Harlem. (An exhibition in his honor was organized there by Hunter East Harlem Gallery in 2015.)Like street photographers in Newark, Los Angeles and other American cities with large, close-knit Latino populations, Mr. Maristany works in a genre that blends documentary and portraiture. He sees what\u2019s wrong in the immediate world he lives in \u2014 the poverty, the crowding \u2014 but also sees the creativity encouraged by having to make do, and the warmth generated by bodies living in close, affectionate proximity.The result, at least in this determinedly positive show \u2014 organized by E. Carmen Ramos, deputy chief curator at the Smithsonian American Art Museum \u2014 is advocacy art in the form of a kind of extended-family album. (Perla de Leon\u2019s views of a leveled South Bronx are exceptions.) This view by no means represents the full, complex story of a time and place; no art can. But it\u2019s a needed alternative to a poverty-porn that has long filled the popular media, and that made the sight of a United States president jocosely tossing rolls of paper towels to hurricane-devastated Puerto Ricans in San Juan last year unacceptable to some eyes.The survey of 35 objects, installations and videos, covers a ponderous block of time \u2014 some 50 years \u2014 but, as superbly installed by Humberto Moro, curator of exhibitions at SCAD, it feels unanchored in time and anti-gravitational. In pieces from the early 1970s, Ms. Porter adds spare pencil lines in photographs of her own hands and face as if to challenge optical perception: which is realer, the photographic image or the artist\u2019s mark?Despite the early work\u2019s formal economy, Pop Art was a big inspiration. In the 1980s and \u201990s, Ms. Porter began assembling and photographing groups of toys and figurines found in flea markets and antique shops. In one example, \u201cThe Intruder,\u201d images of Mao Zedong, George Washington, Pinocchio, the East Asian goddess Guanyin, Lassie, and the Venezuelan physician-saint Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez rub shoulders. Who, exactly, might qualify as an intruder in so multicultural a crowd is hard to say.Visual puzzles, triggered by a hallucinatory use of scale, are this artist\u2019s specialty. A great wash of cobalt paint covering a gallery wall appears to have its source in a minute statue of a man holding a paint brush. In a series called \u201cForced Labor,\u201d an inches-high figure of a knitting woman generates an oceanic pile of pink fabric. And what looks from afar like a smudgy, multipanel abstract painting proves to be a sculptural depiction of a military disaster. Up close you see that the smudges are clusters of toy figures \u2014 tipped-over carts, fallen horses soldiers \u2014 stuck to the canvas surface with engulfing gouts of pigment.Cruelty and loss are at the bottom of Ms. Porter\u2019s work. Her video, \u201cMatinee,\u201d which she directed with Ana Tiscornia, to a tender score by Sylvia Meyer, is a succession of tabletop tableaus enacted by dolls and figurines. The scenes are winsome and funny till disaster strikes: A ceramic child is abruptly beheaded by a hammer; in a segment called \u201cChicken Salad,\u201d a sudden avalanche of greenery buries a windup toy bird.Hers is a very adult art that brings us back to childhood: We project ourselves on these toys, find responsive presences in them. And, in an off-handed way, she links us up with lived history. \u201cMatinee\u201d opens on a weirdly ominous note as the camera pans a porcelain souvenir image of John F. and Jacqueline Kennedy seated in their fateful open-roofed Dallas limousine.In short, Ms. Porter\u2019s art, which is not declaratively Latin American or Latina, fits comfortably within the mission of a museum that describes itself broadly as \u201ca Latino and Latin American cultural institution.\u201d The expansiveness is valid. Much has changed, culturally, in the past half century. The ethnic demographics of the now gentrifying East Harlem have changed. The dimensions of \u201cLatino\u201d as an identity have changed. So have the needs of cultural institutions to attract audiences, local and global.What if the Studio Museum in Harlem restricted itself to black artists who lived, or had roots, in Harlem? That would be unhealthy for the museum, and the artists who showed there, and probably be fiscally unsustainable.But some things have not changed. The political disenfranchisement of Puerto Rico continues, evident in the United State\u2019s government\u2019s shameful post-hurricane treatment of the island. In the United States itself, class and economic barriers based on ethnicity stand firm. And cultural accomplishment, achieved against high odds, is often ignored or forgotten.El Museo begins its self-description in press material with these words: \u201cfounded by a coalition of Puerto Rican educators, artists and activists.\u201d And that reality should be honored and preserved in the institution itself. El Museo began as a platform for cultural expression and communal activism, and should remain that. Yet, how could it not be useful now for that local activism to share a larger Latin American/Latino/Latina/Latinx context, a wider global stage? Common ground is a powerful place to be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "House Hunting in \u2026 England", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInternational real estateSurrey has long attracted affluent buyers with good schools, an easy commute to London and rural beauty. But recently the housing market has taken a hit.11 PhotosThe 5,738-square-foot, two-story house retains original features like half-timbering, parquet floors, leaded-glass windows, wood paneling and ornate, wood-burning fireplaces. Some of the details were likely salvaged from the original manor house at Baynards Park, which was damaged by fire and demolished many years ago, said Nigel Mitchell, a partner with Knight Frank, which has the listing.A winding, oak-shaded drive leads over a stone bridge, through the property\u2019s formal gardens, to the house. The front door opens onto a foyer and reception hall, with a staircase and study to the left and a dining room to the right. The reception hall, which has a large fireplace and substantial ceiling beams, leads to a sitting room with another fireplace. Beyond the sitting room is a drawing room paneled in pine, with built-in bookshelves and a stone fireplace with a carved pine surround. The dining room has parquet floors and carved wood paneling. A large hatch with a pull-down door connects to the kitchen, which has stone floors, a large AGA range, and oak cabinets and countertops handmade in France. The first floor also has a utility room and a playroom.All six bedrooms are on the second floor, including the master bedroom, which has an en suite, wood-paneled bathroom. Attached to the master bedroom is a large dressing room that leads to another full bathroom. Two of the other five bedrooms have en suite bathrooms with bathtubs, and three share a bathroom.Across from the circular driveway are the converted barn and the stable complex. The barn has a double-height sitting room with a vaulted ceiling and floor-to-ceiling windows, a brick fireplace with a wood-burning stove, a family room and a kitchen; on the second floor are two bedrooms with en suite bathrooms. The pool complex, which houses a 49-foot pool, is clad in pine and includes a changing room and shower room, as well as a Turkish bath. There are several paddocks on the property, and a stable block with two boxes and a feed/tack room. The garage has room for four cars. In all, the outbuildings total 5,296 square feet.Brooklands Farm is about two miles from the village of Cranleigh (population 11,240) and 12 miles from the city of Guildford (population 77,000). Central London is about 40 miles north, and the train ride from Guildford to Waterloo station in London takes about 35 minutes, Mr. Mitchell said. The property is about 20 miles from Gatwick Airport and 30 miles from Heathrow Airport. The region has many excellent preparatory schools, as well as recreational options including golf clubs, theaters and racetracks. Not far from Brooklands Farm is the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which includes National Trust properties like Box Hill and Leith Hill.The housing market in Surrey has been fluctuating in recent years, following changes to the Stamp Duty Land Tax in 2014 and 2016, said Lottie Geaves, an associate director of the country department at the real estate agency Savills.\u201cPeak market in the Surrey area was definitely in 2013, and sort of crashed in 2014, but then actually has remained fairly stable since then, with a bit of growth,\u201d Ms. Geaves said. \u201cBut I would say there\u2019s been a bit of a correction more recently.\u201dThe southern stretch of the M25 road, which encircles London, roughly splits the county\u2019s real estate market, with multimillion-dollar estates to the north and multi-acre estates, farmhouses and equestrian properties in the more rural south and west.When the market is \u201crocking and rolling,\u201d there can be price differences of 20 to 40 percent between the properties in north and south Surrey, said Mr. Mitchell, of Knight Frank.But south Surrey \u2014 the area where Brooklands Farm is \u2014 continues to thrive, particularly in places like Guildford, one of the county\u2019s largest cities, said Frederick Biss, an agent in the country house division of the real estate brokerage Winkworth.\u201cGuildford remains a strong market, with property prices being protected by the ease of getting into London Waterloo in just over 30 minutes,\u201d he said, adding that the University of Surrey also plays a role, attracting foreign students and \u201cbringing in foreign buyers.\u201dTypical prices per square foot in Surrey are 450 to 500 pounds (about $600 to $650), said Mark Wheeler, director of the prime and country house department at Hamptons International.There are estates in St. George\u2019s Hill, in north Surrey, on the market for nearly 20 million pounds ($26 million), agents said. But much of the area\u2019s best housing stock is in the range of 750,000 to 1.25 million pounds ($980,000 to $1.63 million), with more options at the high end, Mr. Wheeler said.One of the Home Counties surrounding London, Surrey has long attracted bankers and executives, with excellent schools, an easy commute to central London and rural beauty. No single nationality predominates among the foreign buyers in Surrey, agents said, noting that in recent years, Russian, Chinese and Indian buyers have scooped up huge estates in areas of north Surrey like St. George\u2019s Hill and Virginia Water, but that the market for those homes has been slower in 2018.There are still wealthy foreigners buying property, Mr. Mitchell said, noting that in south Surrey two Russians recently bought estates worth more than 10 million pounds ($13 million) each. \u201cI\u2019d say there are a few Russians,\u201d he said, and \u201ca smattering of Scandinavians, but not a host of foreign buyers here.\u201d Agents said they also see buyers from the Middle East, China and Germany, and that they work with a number of British expatriates from countries like Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia.There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in the United Kingdom, although they must comply with strict money-laundering laws, Mr. Biss said.Most buyers hire a solicitor to represent them, which costs roughly 2,000 pounds ($2,600), but can vary, Ms. Geaves said. It is also becoming more common for buyers to hire acquisition agents to assist them, a service that costs about 2 percent of the sale price, she said.Prospective buyers usually hire a surveyor to assess the property, for a fee of about 2,000 pounds ($2,600), agents said.The seller typically pays the sales agent\u2019s fees, which range from 1 to 2 percent of the sale price, agents said.The total that buyers pay in closing costs can vary because of the Stamp Duty, which can be as high as 12 percent on the portion of the sales price above 1.5 million pounds ($1.95 million). \u201cDepending on the price being paid, buyers should budget for approximately 10 to 11 percent of the value in costs, to include Stamp Duty Land Tax, legal and local authority search fees,\u201d Mr. Wheeler said.Mortgages are available to foreign buyers, and the cost of borrowing at the moment is low, Mr. Mitchell said: \u201cYou can borrow money through a multitude of banks, but the criteria is quite tight to make sure people don\u2019t over-borrow.\u201d English; pound sterling (1 pound = $1.31)The council taxes on this property are about 3,000 pounds ($3,933) a year, Mr. Mitchell said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Recession Knocked Them Down. Only Some Got Up Again.", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrisis and ConsequencesRecession stories tend to begin the same way: lost job, lost home, lost savings. How they end varies much more widely.New York Times reporters interviewed hundreds of people during the Great Recession, many of them in the midst of their darkest days. We spoke with five of them again.In recent weeks, we returned to them to find out what happened next. A few have thrived, overcoming the recession or even using it as a springboard to success. Some were able to find their footing, but could not make up all the ground they had lost.For others, the recession was the moment when it all fell apart. Many seemed to disappear entirely, leaving a trail of disconnected phones, outdated addresses and abandoned Facebook profiles.The individuals we spoke with come from different backgrounds, industries and parts of the country. But for all of them, there were specific moments \u2014 right or wrong decisions, bits of good luck or misfortune \u2014 that determined where they are today.Here are five of their stories.Dante Whitfield has come a long way in nine years.\u201cI remember some nights being so hungry that you\u2019re eating ketchup or mustard out of the containers,\u201d Mr. Whitfield, 44, said today. Now he is a real estate agent in Tacoma, Wash., developing clients, building up his savings and, for the first time in more than a decade, planning for the future.\u201cI\u2019m feeling more financially secure than I have in probably 20 years,\u201d he said.Mr. Whitfield took a winding path to his newfound security. He moved to California in 1999, just in time to ride the dot-com roller coaster. He was single and in his mid-20s, and soon he was working at a communications company in Silicon Valley, earning $60,000 as an executive assistant.Even the bursting of the tech bubble proved only a minor setback. Mr. Whitfield quickly found a job in San Diego, then eventually found his way back to San Francisco when the economy recovered. Saving, he said, was never on his mind.\u201cI just took it for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cI was once again making big-time money, and I thought it was going to stay that way.\u201dIt didn\u2019t. Mr. Whitfield was laid off again in 2007, and this time there was no quick recovery. For the next two years, he was mostly unemployed, and even when he eventually found work, he was barely scraping by. At one point he worked three jobs that together paid just $500 a week. He battled depression.Eventually, however, Mr. Whitfield found his way to Tacoma, where his girlfriend encouraged him to follow a longtime dream of getting into the real estate business. He got his broker\u2019s license in January and quickly built a client base. Mr. Whitfield said he is about to close his seventh deal since March, for a total of $1.6 million in sales.\u201cThese other Realtors don\u2019t know what being starving is, what being homeless is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives me an advantage.\u201dOn his feet again, Mr. Whitfield is sticking to a budget and making backup plans in case the real estate market softens.\u201cI\u2019ve learned my lesson,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have our dry spells.\u201dPlan B turned out well for Jason Martin.\u201cMy original intention was to get a job,\u201d Mr. Martin said when The Times interviewed him in 2009. \u201cBut with the economy, there\u2019s so many people who just graduated who can\u2019t even get a cup of coffee with a prospective employer.\u201d He added, \u201cGraduate school is definitely Plan B.\u201dMr. Martin enrolled in a master\u2019s program in sport leadership at Virginia Commonwealth University. His parents paid most of his in-state tuition, and a small scholarship covered the rest. Grad school, he said, became a critical steppingstone to getting into a one-year professional development program at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando, Fla.Mr. Martin is glad about the one-year detour he took in 2009. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I needed to get some more seasoning. Four years of college wasn\u2019t really enough to prepare myself for the job market.\u201d\u201cHad I not gone, I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019d be,\u201d he added. \u201cI still think I\u2019d be successful, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have responsibilities I have today.\u201cTerri Sadler could have been retired by now.Back in the 1990s, Ms. Sadler worked on the factory floor at a 3M plant in Indiana. It was a good job with benefits and a pension plan that would have let her retire at 55. But Ms. Sadler, then in her early 30s, quit the job on a whim, convinced she could find something better. She never could.\u201cI got really mad and walked out, and I think that was the beginning of the downturn,\u201d she said. \u201cI never had that feeling of security that I had at that job.\u201dStill, Ms. Sadler muddled through. She found other factory jobs, including one in the auto industry in the mid-2000s that paid her as much as $18 an hour.Ms. Sadler, of Richmond, Ky., has worked on and off the past eight years, but none of the jobs have paid much or lasted long. Her current job, as a receptionist at a car dealership, pays far less than her old factory jobs and requires a 50-mile commute. Even so, she worries it will disappear when her probationary period ends in September. She dreads trying to find another job at age 60.Ms. Sadler said she tries to remain upbeat, but it has gotten harder. Her car seems to break down every time she manages to save some money, she said. She once dreamed of traveling the country in retirement; now she doubts she will be able to retire at all.\u201cI would like to go on that vacation, I would like to have this Jeep paid off, I would like to do something for my grandkids, but I just can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not get to live the American dream, and it\u2019s too late.\u201dWhen Meg Fisher lost her job in early 2009, it didn\u2019t feel like a turning point, at least not at first.Ms. Fisher, a legal secretary, had been laid off before and had always found work quickly. Even in the middle of the recession, she thought her college degree, two decades of experience and strong professional network would help her rebound again.\u201cI probably will never be officially full-time employed ever again,\u201d said Ms. Fisher, now 56.The layoff eliminated more than half her family\u2019s income, which once topped $80,000 per year. Ms. Fisher\u2019s husband had a job as a manager of a local pharmacy, but by the end of 2009, the family was forced to file for bankruptcy. Three years later, the Fishers lost their suburban Atlanta home to foreclosure.In their worst months, they turned to a food pantry for groceries. They took on boarders \u2014 one of whom, they later learned, did heroin while their daughter slept in the next room. Ms. Fisher\u2019s greatest regret, she said, is the effect the family\u2019s hardship has had on her two children, who were in elementary school when she lost her job.\u201cThey don\u2019t remember life when we used to go out to eat whenever we wanted to, or buy stuff that they wanted,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.Eventually, the Fishers found a measure of stability. Ms. Fisher started a business making custom Jewish prayer shawls, and a mortgage broker she met through a networking group hired her to do administrative work on the side. The family has caught a few breaks, too. A friend helped them buy a house after their foreclosure, and they received a small inheritance from an aunt this year, which helped them pay down medical debt.But the scars of the recession have never fully healed. Ms. Fisher earns a fraction of her former salary, and the couple, who live in Marietta, Ga., have practically no retirement savings. Once the Fishers\u2019 son graduates from high school, they are considering moving to a cabin in the mountains to save money.Government statisticians consider any work for pay \u2014 even informal, part-time work like Ms. Fisher\u2019s \u2014 as \u201cemployment.\u201d But she said she doesn\u2019t feel like a part of the traditional work force.\u201cI believe the reports that unemployment is at a record low, but people like me are not included in that,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be back to where we were.\u201dIt took nearly a decade, but Guillermo Gonzalez is a homeowner again.In June 2017, Mr. Gonzalez and his wife closed on a $129,000 two-bedroom house in Spring Hill, Fla., north of Tampa. It has a pool and a yard where their grandchildren can play. Most important, they can afford it.\u201cIt\u2019s not a brand, brand-spanking new house, but it\u2019s very comfortable,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good house.\u201dMr. Gonzalez\u2019s recession story is a typical one: In 2004, he and his wife bought a house outside Miami with little money down, counting on the ability to refinance to help them make their payments. They borrowed money to fund a lifestyle that, while never lavish, was more than they could afford on his salary working in sales for a liquor distributor.But when Florida\u2019s housing market collapsed, the Gonzalezes couldn\u2019t refinance. The cooling economy ate into liquor sales, cutting Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s commissions and leaving him unable to make his monthly payments.Mr. Gonzalez bristled at being a renter, paying $1,800 a month to live in a complex \u201cwhere you couldn\u2019t barbecue, where you couldn\u2019t wash your car, where you couldn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d His sister, who had lost her job selling real estate, moved in for a while.But gradually, things began to improve. Mr. Gonzalez got a job selling auto parts. He worked to rebuild his credit. By last year, he and his wife were ready to buy again \u2014 this time in the Tampa area, where homes are cheaper and they can be closer to their children.They are being cautious. Once, he said, he would have paid someone to rip out the run-down front lawn. This time, he did the work himself.\u201cMy grass is the greenest in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always taken a lot of pride.\u201dBut Mr. Gonzalez, 54, has little in the way of savings and no plans for retirement. His wife stopped working when they moved to Tampa so she could help with the grandchildren, but she is now looking for work to help cover some medical expenses that are coming up.\u201cWe\u2019re doing it one step at a time,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Would Socialism Better Our Lives?", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersReaders discuss the growing support for socialism in the United States and how it has worked in other countries.To the Editor:In Mr. Robin\u2019s account of socialism, only when the workers of this country liberate themselves from the miseries and anxieties of capitalism \u2014 like having to work for a \u201cboss\u201d to provide for themselves and their families \u2014 will they finally be able to live free and happy lives.The American capitalist system does not guarantee happiness \u2014 just its \u201cpursuit.\u201d As generations of Americans, including tens of millions of immigrants, have discovered, it is this freedom to pursue a better life that brings meaning to the lives of individuals, and collective benefits to all of society.To the Editor:What the \u201cnew socialists\u201d want is social democracy, not socialism. Socialism is a failed economic system. The real question is what kind of capitalism do we want \u2014 the one we\u2019ve been moving toward since the 1980s, with reduced regulation, weakening of the social safety net, weakened organized labor and growing income inequality \u2014 or the one that was established and subsequently expanded between the 1930s New Deal and the 1960s Great Society, during which the social safety net was established, organized labor was strong and income inequality declined?To the Editor:We don\u2019t call these things socialistic, but they are so nevertheless \u2014 called usually by other descriptors: communal, commonwealth, public. Besides providing for the common good, they counter the grasping, unregulated effects of unfettered capitalism. These social institutions \u2014 challenged though they have been in recent years \u2014 are still the glue that holds our society together. A better balance of acquisitive competition (capitalism) and communal investment (socialism) is what we should seek once again, so that our connective social tissue is nurtured and strengthened. History teaches that either extreme is oppressive. To the Editor:Guess what happened? The brightest and hardest workers went off to start businesses or work for other enterprises, and the remaining members of the socialist endeavor slowly saw their standard of living reduced (think of Cuba) and the entire effort eventually either collapsed or, in a few cases, adopted a \u201cprivate enterprise\u201d model.For other examples of socialism failures we can look at starving Venezuela \u2014 where the oil revenue should provide a Scandinavian standard of living \u2014 or study the failure and collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Maybe the media could ask a few of the \u201cself-identified socialists\u201d running for office how they plan to pay for all the \u201cfree entitlements\u201d they propose. To the Editor:Then I read the article arguing that today\u2019s \u201csocialists\u201d seek the freedom of the working class from forced participation in and subservience to the market economy. I thought, Right on!The beast that is corporate capitalism will not be tamed without an awakening of the working class. But since the right has spent decades deliberately dividing workers along cultural and religious lines, freedom for the masses may take more: open revolt.To the Editor:Mr. Robin\u2019s essay does not mention just how much the two ideologies have merged. Socialism in China depends on the private ownership of capital to feed its populace \u2014 that is, capitalism \u2014 whereas capitalism in the West has meant shared ownership of corporations through their shareholders, a modern form of socialism serving enlightened self-interest.To the Editor:Once you go to a socialist economy \u2014 well, look at Russia, 1917 to the present. Look at China. More recently look at Venezuela. Look at Cuba. Are these the economies to emulate? Are these the oppressive governments we want? Absolutely not. Without the wealth created by a capitalist economy there is no \u201cfree\u201d stuff because the money simply isn\u2019t there. And those of us who have worked hard to better ourselves by the sweat of our brows, by taking whatever job we must to support ourselves so as to not burden society, resent the promise to others that \u201cyou don\u2019t have to work hard, we\u2019ll just hand it to you\u201d that the socialists put forward.Capitalism may not be perfect, but it got the United States to an economic level that makes it the destination for millions around the world. Start electing socialists, and we\u2019ll be a third-world country in two decades. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Heard of Outsourced Jobs, but Outsourced Pollution? It\u2019s Real, and Tough to Tally Up ", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver the past decade, both the United States and Europe have made major strides in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions at home. That trend is often held up as a sign of progress in the fight against climate change.But those efforts look a lot less impressive once you take trade into account. Many wealthy countries have effectively \u201coutsourced\u201d a big chunk of their carbon pollution overseas, by importing more steel, cement and other goods from factories in China and other places, rather than producing it domestically.That may be changing. Last fall, California\u2019s lawmakers took an early stab at confronting the issue by setting new low-carbon standards on the steel the state buys for its infrastructure projects. But dealing with imported emissions remains a thorny problem.Some environmentalists see it as the next frontier of climate policy.Not surprisingly, China, which has become the world\u2019s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, remains the world\u2019s factory. About 13 percent of China\u2019s emissions in 2015 came from making stuff for other countries. In India, another fast-growing emitter, the figure is 20 percent.The United States, for its part, remains the world\u2019s leading importer of what the researchers call \u201cembodied carbon.\u201d If the United States were held responsible for all the pollution worldwide that resulted from manufacturing the cars, clothing and other goods that Americans use, the nation\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions would be 14 percent bigger than its domestic-only numbers suggest.Between 1995 and 2015, the report found, as wealthier countries like Japan and Germany were cutting their own emissions, they were also doubling or tripling the amount of carbon dioxide they outsourced to China.\u201cJust as China\u2019s starting to deal with its emissions, it\u2019s been pushing some of its more carbon-intensive activities into countries like Cambodia, Vietnam and India,\u201d said Steven J. Davis, a scientist at the University of California, Irvine and co-author of that study. \u201cFrom a climate policy context,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s like a game of whack-a-mole.\u201dSo some policymakers are exploring other ideas.California\u2019s new law may initially favor domestic producers \u2014\u00a0which helps explain why it was supported by some steel companies and the United Steelworkers. And in the long term, environmentalists hope the policy could have a ripple effect worldwide. \u201cCalifornia can\u2019t go regulate factories in other parts of the world,\u201d said Kathryn Phillips, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s California chapter. \u201cBut we can say, if you want to do business with us, the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, you have to do what you can to reduce emissions.\u201dLawmakers in Washington State recently requested a study of \u201cBuy Clean\u201d standards for their state, and a similar bill was introduced in Oregon\u2019s last legislative session. But the idea can be contentious: In California, the cement industry fought hard to be exempted from the rule. Steel and cement production worldwide each account for about 5 percent of global emissions.Chris Erickson, the chief executive of Climate Earth, a firm that helps companies assess the environmental impact of their supply chains, says that even transparency can be eye-opening. His company built a searchable database of different concrete mixes that are available, allowing architects to seek out materials that have, in some cases, a carbon footprint that is one-third of the industry average.That, in turn, could put pressure on suppliers to lower their emissions. \u201cEven for companies who don\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d Mr. Erickson said, \u201cthey know a change is coming.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "R.I.P., the Celebrity Profile", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAll glossy magazine superstar covers may look the same from a distance, but inside, you\u2019re never quite sure what you\u2019ll find.The story worked in two ways: For the reader and fan, it was appealingly revealing; for Mr. McCartney, who\u2019s been famous so long he is more sculpture than human, it was a welcome softening.For devotees of Beyonc\u00e9, this might not matter (though it should). But for devotees of celebrity journalism \u2014 the kind of work that aims to add context and depth to the fame economy, and which is predicated on the productive frisson between an interviewer and interviewee \u2014 this portends catastrophe. And it\u2019s not an isolated event. In pop music especially, plenty of the most famous performers essentially eschew the press: Taylor Swift hasn\u2019t given a substantive interview and access to a print publication for at least two years. For Drake, it\u2019s been about a year (and a tumultuous one at that). Frank Ocean has all but disappeared (again).What\u2019s replaced it isn\u2019t satisfying: either outright silence, or more often, unidirectional narratives offered through social media. Monologue, not dialogue. It threatens to upend the role of the celebrity press.But that was in a climate in which print publications had a disproportionate amount of leverage, and the internet and TMZ hadn\u2019t wrested away narrative control. When stars\u2019 comings and goings began to be documented on a minute-by-minute basis, those changes triggered celebrity reticence. On its own, that wouldn\u2019t signal the death knell of celebrity journalism as it\u2019s been practiced for decades. But the pressure being applied to celebrity journalism from the top might pale in comparison to the threat surging from below, where a new generation of celebrities \u2014 YouTube stars, SoundCloud rappers, and various other earnest young people \u2014 share extensively on social media on their own terms, moving quickly and decisively (and messily) with no need for the patience and pushback they might encounter in an interview setting.This generation is one of all-access hyperdocumentation, making the promise of celebrity journalism \u2014 emphasizing intimate perspective and behind-the-scenes access \u2014 largely irrelevant.These are one-sided stories, with no scrutiny beyond the comments section. And so they\u2019ve be come highly visible safe spaces for young celebrities, especially in an era when one\u2019s direct social media audience \u2014 via Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and more \u2014 can far exceed the reach of even the most prestigious or popular publication, and in a way that\u2019s laser-targeted to supporters.All of which leaves celebrity journalism in a likely unsolvable conundrum. The most famous have effectively dispensed with it, and the newly famous have grown up in an age where it was largely irrelevant. Over time, the middle space may well be squeezed into nothingness.What\u2019s more, creation of content has been diversified \u2014 for the casual consumer, it can be difficult to tell the difference between original reporting and aggregation, content created by journalistic outlets and content created by brands. This blurriness incentivizes the famous away from traditional media, where they don\u2019t control the final product.And so as the power dynamic tilts in favor of the famous over the press, publications \u2014 weakened, desperate, financially fragile \u2014 have been forced to find ever more contorted ways to trade, at minimum, the feeling of control in exchange for precious access.These stories trade on the perceived intimacy of friendships as a proxy for actual insight, abdicating the role of an objective press in the process. The covenant implicit in celebrity profiles is that the journalist is a proxy for the reader, not the subject. But in the thirst for exclusive access, the old rules get tossed by the wayside \u2014 ethics become inconvenient. Friendship should be a disqualifier, not a prerequisite.That is a disservice to fans, who miss out on what happens when someone in the room is pushing back, not merely taking dictation. Imagine how wildly illuminating probing conversations with Beyonc\u00e9 about \u201cLemonade\u201d or Ms. Swift about \u201cReputation\u201d would have been, a boon to the curious as well as an opportunity for the interview subjects to be shown in their full complexity. But rather than engage on those terms, these stars have become hermetic. It\u2019s a shame: We\u2019ll never know the answers to the questions that aren\u2019t asked.Advertisement"}

Leaders of its advisory board include Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state and national security adviser, and Henry M.

{"Headline": "French Turn on Macron, as They Grow Impatient for Results", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCIVRAY, France \u2014 The cheese lady, the melon man, the retiree downing his morning glass, the olive seller, the housewife sipping coffee and the village mayor submerged by constituents\u2019 unpaid bills \u2014 all agreed that their country\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, was letting them down.\u201cOh, it\u2019s a very good government! A very good government for the rich, who are kicking the poor out into the street! It\u2019s not a good government for people who are actually working,\u201d said Fernand Aso, 60, who sells olives and relishes at the outdoor market squeezed into the little main square of Civray, a town of just a few thousand in central France.From villages to the district\u2019s ancient white limestone towns, across the rolling fields of sunflowers and corn burned brown by a torrid summer, through the French heartland, and even into the cities, the judgment is largely the same: negative.In a spate of recent polls, Mr. Macron has dropped so sharply in popularity that he dipped even below his much-derided predecessor, the hapless Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. A poll released last Monday showed Mr. Macron\u2019s approval rating at only 19 percent, while 60 percent found his achievements \u201cnegative,\u201d nearly double the figure six months ago.Today Civray and its environs demonstrate the souring of opinion on Mr. Macron as well as anywhere. Its representative in Parliament was one of the first to break openly with Mr. Macron\u2019s political movement. Conversations across this emblematic region amount to a buffet of disillusionment.\u201cIn the beginning I thought, \u2018Yes, he\u2019s young, he\u2019s dynamic,\u2019\u201d said Ana\u00efs Bonetat, 22, a waitress in an empty cafe in nearby Montmorillon. \u201cBut really, now, I see he\u2019s just doing it his way, without even asking us.\u201dMr. Macron, a product of France\u2019s top schools, may still command respect on the world stage, where he has positioned himself as the West\u2019s indispensable alternative to know-nothing populism. But at home the young man christened \u201cJupiter,\u201d king of the gods, by the news media and aides, half in awe at his total self-confidence and lightning ascent, has fallen very far, very fast.The far-right Rassemblement National, formerly the National Front, waits in the wings, polling a close second to Mr. Macron\u2019s movement before elections for the European Parliament next year.\u201cI\u2019m fearful that the extremes will have the wind in their sails,\u201d said Michel Pain, mayor of the tiny nearby town of Saint-Maurice-la-Clou\u00e8re.But the problems are about more than just image; they are substantive.Despite 18 months of reforms, the unemployment rate has barely budged and hovers over 9 percent. The economy is growing at a meager rate, around 1.7 percent.In small-town France, where there has been a steady retreat of services, underway long before Mr. Macron took office, the negative feelings are especially sharp. They have been made more acute by his proposal to do a way with a crucial tax on which these towns depend, the lodgings tax.\u201cI\u2019m a little bit perplexed.

His reforms are seen as unjust. People are thinking that the majority isn\u2019t benefiting.\u201dMr. Macron\u2019s defenders say that his agenda is for the long haul, and that it is too soon to pass judgment.\u201cWe didn\u2019t say that we were going to change the country in a year and half,\u201d said Stanislas Guerini, a lawmaker from Paris who is a spokesman for Mr. Macron\u2019s movement, La R\u00e9publique en Marche (The Republic on the Move).\u201cIf we really want to change the country deeply, we\u2019ve got to take the time to undertake deep reforms,\u201d Mr. Guerini said.He pointed to what he called \u201cweak signals\u201d that Mr. Macron\u2019s program was having an effect: 40 percent more youth enrolled in apprenticeship programs; 15 percent fewer disputes before labor tribunals; 15 billion euros, or $17.6 billion, invested in job training programs; a doubling of classes in troubled areas.\u201cAll of our policies are geared toward emancipation, so that no matter where you start, you will have the same chance as anybody else,\u201d said Herv\u00e9 Berville, another spokesman for Mr. Macron\u2019s movement. \u201cWe want people to leave poverty, not live better in poverty.\u201dHowever, many people complain that the burden of moving the economy forward has been foisted on the less fortunate of an aging population.\u201cMacron\u2019s falling, and the grace period is finished,\u201d said Mr. Pain, the mayor, who is a retired schoolteacher. \u201cThe results just aren\u2019t there. There\u2019s no improvement in the unemployment rate. France\u2019s reindustrialization is not taking off.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re hitting retirees hard,\u201d he added \u2014 a widely shared perception, and a dangerous one for Mr. Macron in a country where most retire at 62 or earlier and the ratio of retired people to workers is expected to be one to one by 2030.Around 60 percent of retirees \u2014 those earning over $25,000 \u2014 have seen a social security tax on their state pensions increase by nearly 2 percent under Mr. Macron, while the value of their pensions is not keeping pace with inflation.\u201cHe\u2019s nicking money from me,\u201d said Roger Coquillaud, 65, a retired army officer at the modest central cafe in Civray.Facing angry reactions, the government announced this past week that it would exempt some 300,000 retirees from the tax increase.Mr. Macron\u2019s perceived imperious manner \u2014 in a country where toppling leaders is part of the national DNA \u2014 has only compounded the fears of social and economic slippage.\u201cWhen you\u2019ve already got a bad opinion of a politician, the slightest thing can add to it. There\u2019s a bad atmosphere around it,\u201d said Jean-Michel Cl\u00e9ment, the local representative in Parliament who broke with Mr. Macron over the president\u2019s toughening line on immigration, and who has been effectively shut out ever since.The cross-fertilizing element in the complaints about Mr. Macron was evident in the responses of many.\u201cFor me, I think he\u2019s moving further and further away from the population,\u201d said Jean-Marie Peigner, a retired phone company worker who is now the part-time mayor of the adjoining village of Saint-Pierre-d\u2019Exideuil. \u201cI have quite a few who regret having voted for him.\u201dAmong the regretful is Bernard Blanchet, 61, who directs a music school in Montmorillon.\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of spirit of royalism in him,\u201d said Mr. Blanchet, who had stopped between two market stalls to discuss politics.Mr. Macron once declared to an interviewer that the French missed their king \u2014 forgetting that they had also executed him.\u201cYou can\u2019t disagree with him,\u201d Mr. Blanchet said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear: I won\u2019t vote for him again.\u201dAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article carried an erroneous credit.

{"Headline": "For Big Tech, a Comeuppance We\u2019ve Seen Before: On Wall St.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When I moved to the Bay Area two years ago, it was with a sense of relief.Relief from New York winters and deteriorating subways, yes. But also relief after six years of covering Wall Street, an industry that had moved from one crisis to another after the financial crash of 2008, drawing the unending wrath of the public.In California I was joining a growing team of reporters covering Silicon Valley, which had quickly become the new engine of the economy. Just like Wall Street before it lost its luster, the tech industry had become the destination of choice for the top college graduates. I would be writing about a place where everyone was focused more on the future than on the past.Now, just two years after getting here, and a decade after the start of the financial crisis, I have a creeping sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I go about my job.Admiration of the tech world has, in the wake of a growing list of scandals, quickly soured into an intense suspicion that manages to cross partisan lines, similar to what Wall Street faced after 2008.As was true after the financial crisis, the backlash against tech rises out of a public awakening to the integral role that these huge companies occupy in our society \u2014 with Facebook, Uber and Twitter playing the part that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase did a decade ago.\u201cPeople talk about bankers being amoral,\u201d said Charlie Beckett, the director of the Truth, Trust and Technology Commission at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey are starting to talk about tech people in similar language. Where before they were kind of heroes \u2014 they were people who brought us these wonderful products \u2014 they are now starting to be blamed for the ills of the world.\u201dIt often feels as though these companies took on their pivotal positions so quickly that no one \u2014 not even their employees \u2014 had a chance to understand how they really worked or how much influence they had.Ana Bot\u00edn, a longtime executive at the giant Spanish bank Santander, recently wrote on LinkedIn that the tech companies were losing the same basic thing that banks lost in 2008: the public\u2019s trust.\u201cSome in big tech are beginning to accept what we in banking learned some years ago: We don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d Ms. Bot\u00edn told me last week.The storm that Ms. Bot\u00edn and other bank executives faced after 2008 and the one we are witnessing now are obviously different.The crisis precipitated by the banks was a financial one that caused markets to crash, and threatened to bring down the global economy.The crisis involving the internet giants is not hitting our pocketbooks \u2014 it is straining our confidence in what we know about the world. If Russian hackers can create and amplify fake news stories across the many sites we have come to rely on, where can we go for reliable information?In public surveys, like the Harris Poll Reputation Quotient, the tech giants are still polling well ahead of Goldman and Wells Fargo, and some, like Amazon and Apple, seem to be mostly flying above the fray.The exact ills that people assign to the industry tend to differ based on their politics. While people on the right, including President Trump, have expressed the most concern about political bias and censorship, the left has worried more about the way the companies opened the door to election interference and have exacerbated income inequality. But nearly everyone is voicing unease about the way our children have been turned into digital addicts.The broad shift in perception is inevitably piling more blame onto the shoulders of one industry than it should bear. Like the mortgage meltdown, our current crisis of confidence is the result of factors that go beyond any one player in the drama \u2014 from the polarization of the media landscape to the growing economic inequality that has led to distrust of elites of all sorts.Whatever the reality, political momentum is building behind some sort of broader regulatory response, similar to what came together in the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The current push has begun with talk of legislation that would protect our privacy \u2014 but much bolder steps are being considered.What I wonder now is whether any regulatory response will follow a similar path to what came after the financial crisis.A long list of new laws in the United States and Europe did seem to make the banks safer and another crisis less likely.But the regulations also appear to have cemented the status of the biggest banks in our economy. The largest financial institutions now control a bigger proportion of the industry\u2019s assets than they did before the crisis. These big banks are regulated as if they were more like utilities, but the high regulatory costs provide a kind of barrier against most competitors.It is easy to imagine something similar happening in the technology industry, and European authorities have already taken some steps in that direction.If tech companies are forced to be more responsible for the content on their platforms, they will most likely need to build a significant apparatus for compliance. That would cut into profitability. It would also make it very hard for upstarts to challenge them.\u201cThere\u2019s an increasingly loud call for the platforms to get involved in content moderation,\u201d said Cory Doctorow, a special adviser with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s well intentioned, but the outcome of that is very likely to be pretty disastrous.\u201dMr. Doctorow has been part of a growing chorus of people calling for antitrust actions to break up the biggest companies, rather than tweaking their operations.Whatever steps the government takes, they are unlikely to help recover the trust that has already been lost. As I know from those years of covering the banks, confidence, once gone, is not easily regained.As for me, the familiar problems have not allowed for the change of pace I was expecting. And in truth, the subways out here are no better. But the weather is still very nice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.C.B., at Latest Meeting, Highlights Risks From Trade War", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 When President Trump first provoked a trade war, the fear in Europe was that the biggest impact would be psychological. Executives would be rattled, and they would postpone or cancel plans to invest in expansion.Increasingly, that is exactly what seems to be happening: European factories are producing fewer goods, automobile exports are plunging and surveys show that business managers around the Continent are nervous.Soon, that will have a measurable impact on economic growth across the region. At least, that is what the European Central Bank expects.On Thursday, the bank lowered its projections for economic growth across the 19-nation euro area, and warned that any potential escalation of the dispute \u2014 which threatens to ensnare the European automotive industry \u2014 could create further headaches.Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, said in a news conference that rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility had \u201cgained more prominence.\u201d He added that the reduced forecasts were \u201cmainly due to a somewhat weaker contribution from foreign demand.\u201dAccording to Mr. Draghi, the bank\u2019s lowered growth projections only factored in protectionist measures that had so far taken effect. Any potential escalation could yet worsen them.\u201cBesides the effects on prices, tariffs, quotas, volumes traded and so on, what is going to be the effect on confidence of an extended trade war?\u201d Mr. Draghi said.The economic assessment published by the European Central Bank\u2019s in-house economists comes despite some bright spots in the eurozone that will affirm the bank\u2019s determination to continue dialing down stimulus.The French economy is looking perkier. Eurozone unemployment, at 8.2 percent, is lower than it has been for around a decade. Wages in the common currency area are rising after years of meager growth.But European political leaders and business managers are nervous that the American leader could grow restive if the talks do not produce quick results \u2014 and they probably will not. The European Commission is methodical in its approach, and hamstrung by the need to get approval from its 28 member states.\u201cThere is really nothing the union can do to expedite its decisions on trade,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director in London at Eurasia Group, a political consultancy.United States tariffs on steel and aluminum imports remain in place, raising prices and disrupting intricate supply chains. The Commerce Department continues to examine whether foreign-made cars are a threat to national security, a process that would create the legal foundation for the 25 percent tariffs on auto imports that Mr. Trump has threatened.Mr. Trump seems to thrive on keeping people guessing, but businesses hate uncertainty. As long as the Damocles sword of Trump tariffs hangs above the eurozone, companies will be hesitant to buy new machinery or expand operations.They are right to worry. Oxford Economics in London estimates that a full-blown trade war, including auto tariffs, would shrink the European economy more than 1 percent and cost 1.6 million jobs. Such a severe downturn would certainly prompt the European Central Bank to reverse course, but it would not be able to prevent substantial pain.\u201cA trans-Atlantic trade war would have a severe economic impact on both the European and U.S. economies,\u201d Oxford Economics said in a report in August. \u201cThere would be no winners.\u201d\u201cThe E.C.B. remains on autopilot,\u201d Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the German unit of Dutch bank ING, said in a note to clients.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt, and Amie Tsang from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Moving into a Changing Prospect-Lefferts Gardens", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe HuntAfter watching Harlem slip out of their budget, a couple finds a home in a part of Brooklyn that is very new to them. Emmett Murphy arrived in New York nearly 30 years ago, and spent much of that time living with roommates. Six years ago, he rented a two-bedroom in a modern Harlem building with his partner, Robert Balaguer.\u201cI had never lived that far north, and I loved the Harlem vibe,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cAs we saw the economy return, the neighborhood really bloomed.\u201d And over time, their rent did too, rising from $2,300 to $3,500 a month.Mr. Murphy hoped to buy a home for $600,000 to $850,000, with a monthly outlay of no more than $3,000. But finding a two-bedroom apartment \u2014 with the extra bedroom to serve as an office \u2014 didn\u2019t seem feasible. Places often looked wonderful online, but the information wasn\u2019t always accurate or complete, and the apartments usually fell short in real life.\u201cReal estate is a fantasy, and your mind fills in a lot of blanks,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cBut when you walk in, you have a visceral reaction, like the ceiling is too low or something smells funky. I was looking at the lower end of the market and trying to find the best version of that.\u201dMany of the buildings he visited, charming though they were, needed structural work. Some that were just a few dozen years old didn\u2019t appear to be holding up well, making brand-new buildings more enticing.The Style, a condominium that opened last year in East Harlem, had two buildings connected by a landscaped courtyard. Last fall, there was only one one-bedroom available, for $611,000, with monthly charges of around $1,100.The apartment was on a low floor, with plenty of activity outside, including a parking lot and a playground across busy East 132nd Street. \u201cYou can hear children screaming with joy through a plate-glass window,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. Both men work from home, making the noise a problem. \u201cI am there during the day when all that is happening,\u201d he said. The apartment later sold for $622,000.Elsewhere in Harlem, a two-bedroom in a small, renovated condo was listed at the temptingly low price of $550,000, with monthly charges in the mid-$400s.\u201cWhen I got up there, I kind of loved it,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. The unit had a long, skinny layout with an extra nook for working or dining. But there were several drawbacks, including its location on the top floor of a five-story walk-up. \u201cI have lived in those buildings in the past, but I was younger at the time,\u201d he said.It also had a monthly assessment of more than $860. \u201cWhen you climb up and have the sweat running down your neck, they hand you a paper with the financials, and that\u2019s when they tell you about the assessment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was kind of a jaw-dropper.\u201d The apartment later sold for $530,000.Mr. Balaguer was out of town for most of the hunt, so Mr. Murphy sent him photos as he went. \u201cI could tell he wasn\u2019t really sold on anything and was going to keep looking,\u201d Mr. Balaguer said.To avoid getting locked into another one-year lease, the couple temporarily moved into the apartment of Mr. Murphy\u2019s cousin, whose travels often left her two-bedroom rental in Flatbush, Brooklyn, near Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, vacant.\u201cWe moved in on top of her stuff,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cI had been to the neighborhood only once.\u201d His familiarity with the borough was limited mostly to events at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.\u201cIt felt like New York felt 20 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing how Harlem changed in six years, I could see the potential.\u201d The couple embraced the neighborhood, which they found charming, diverse and convenient. From the corner of Flatbush and Church Avenues, the 2, 5 and Q trains were within walking distance, as was Prospect Park.\u201cI turned the corner, and it felt like a completely different neighborhood,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cYou could hear the volume of the whole neighborhood drop.\u201dSeveral one-bedrooms in that price range were available. They chose one with around 700 square feet, in a corner of the top floor, for privacy and a view. They liked the big closets, the wall of windows and the small private terrace.Mr. Murphy bought the unit for the asking price, $630,000, plus $10,000 for a storage cage in the basement. Common charges are just under $400 a month, so the monthly outlay is around $2,400, well within their budget. But living in a developing neighborhood has its challenges, as they discovered when they moved in last winter. Although neither man commutes to work, their excursions to the theater and opera mean they often return home late at night on sluggish, under-construction subways. They find themselves spending more on Uber.\u201cWe were excited to be a part of this new neighborhood and see it develop over time,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cAll of a sudden, there is a ton of new building.\u201d Two wood-frame Victorians next door were recently sold, with a condominium building planned to replace them. So their tranquillity will be interrupted, at least for a time.\u201cYou can look out and see that orange construction stuff they wrap buildings with,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cIn a funny way, it\u2019s kind of exciting. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how this neighborhood is going to change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Should legislators give consumers control over the data companies have on them?Ms. Singer is a technology reporter at The New York Times.There\u2019s just one flaw with this setup.In a surveillance economy where companies track, analyze and capitalize on our clicks, the issue at hand isn\u2019t privacy. The problem is unfettered data exploitation and its potential deleterious consequences \u2014 among them, unequal consumer treatment, financial fraud, identity theft, manipulative marketing and discrimination.In other words, asking companies whose business models revolve around exploiting data-based consumer-influence techniques to explain their privacy policies seems about as useful as asking sharks to hold forth on veganism.The Senate Commerce hearing, however, doesn\u2019t seem designed to investigate commercial surveillance and influence practices that might merit government oversight.For one thing, only industry executives are currently set to testify. And most of them are lawyers and policy experts, not engineers versed in the mechanics of data-mining algorithms.That may be because Congress is under industry pressure.Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the Senate Commerce Committee, said the group planned future hearings that would include other voices, such as consumer groups. But \u201cfor the first hearing,\u201d Mr. Hill said, \u201cthe committee is bringing in companies most consumers recognize to make the discussion about privacy more relatable.\u201dMany consumers know that digital services and ad tech companies track and analyze their activities. And they accept, or are at least resigned to, data-mining in exchange for conveniences like customized newsfeeds and ads.And that leads to a larger question: Do we want a future in which companies can freely parse the photos we posted last year, or the location data from the fitness apps we used last week, to infer whether we are stressed or depressed or financially strapped or emotionally vulnerable \u2014 and take advantage of that?(Amazon said it does not use Alexa data for product recommendations or marketing.)It\u2019s tough to answer those questions right now when there are often gulfs between the innocuous ways companies explain their data practices to consumers and the details they divulge about their targeting techniques to advertisers.Here\u2019s what it means in practice: AT&T can find out which subscribers have indigestion \u2014 or at least which ones bought over-the-counter drugs to treat it.Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for AT&T, said the company\u2019s privacy policy was \u201ctransparent and precise, and describes in plain language how we use information and the choices we give customers.\u201dBut consumer advocates hope senators will press AT&T, Amazon and other companies this week to provide more details on their consumer-profiling practices. \u201cWe want an inside look on the analytics and how they\u2019re categorizing, ranking, rating and scoring us,\u201d Professor Citron said.Given the increased public scrutiny, some companies are tweaking their tactics.AT&T recently said it would stop sharing users\u2019 location details with data brokers. Facebook said it had stopped allowing advertisers to use sensitive categories, like race or religion, to exclude people from seeing ads. Google created a feature for users to download masses of their data, including a list of all the sites Google has tracked them on.Government officials in Europe are not waiting for companies to police themselves. In May, the European Union introduced a tough new data protection law that curbs some data-mining. It requires companies to obtain explicit permission from European users before collecting personal details on sensitive subjects like their religion, health or sex life. It gives European users the right to see all of the information companies hold about them \u2014 including any algorithmic scores or inferences. Advertisement"}

But on both sides of the Pacific, a bleaker recognition is taking hold: The world\u2019s two largest economies are in the opening stages of a new economic Cold War, one that could persist well after Mr. Trump is out of office.\u201cThis thing will last long,\u201d Jack Ma, the billionaire chairman of Alibaba Group, warned a meeting of investors on Tuesday in Hangzhou, China. \u201cIf you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.\u201dThe diplomatic stalemate has many in the business and policy communities considering the possibility that the United States may be in a protracted and economically damaging trade fight for years to come and wondering what, if anything, America will gain.Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia and an expert on China, said in an interview that 2018 signaled \u201cthe beginnings of a war of a different type: a trade war, an investment war and a technology war between the two great powers of the 21st century, with an uncertain landing point.\u201dThe latest tit-for-tat leaves little room for concessions, at least in the interim, as both countries dig in their heels and China tries to remain strong, despite an economic softening that Mr. Trump clearly sees as an opening to force Beijing\u2019s hand.Chinese growth in investment, factory production and consumer spending have all slowed this year, and its economic growth has slowed alongside. The situation is expected to worsen as effects of the escalating American tariffs ramp up.While the United States made overtures toward China in recent days to talk trade in Washington this month, some officials said they now doubted Beijing would engage again at a high level until after the midterm elections in November, when President Xi Jinping may meet Mr. Trump on the sidelines of an economic summit meeting in Buenos Aires.Mr. Trump himself seemed to dangle the prospect that he, and he alone, could broker a resolution that threatened to cause economic pain to companies and consumers on both sides of the Pacific.\u201cHopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his statement announcing the tariffs.The Chinese side has its own political reasons to avoid capitulation. Acceding to Mr. Trump would be considered a sign of weakness for Mr. Xi, according to analysts.And they see no sign that China is willing to give up on Made in China 2025, an industrial program that aims for dominance in robotics, artificial intelligence, and other high tech industries that have been the domain of the United States and Europe and that Mr. Trump has identified as a policy initiative that must be stopped.While Chinese officials have expressed a willingness to get rid of the name Made in China 2025, they have been much more cautious about accepting limits on some of the crucial features of the country\u2019s industrial policy, like big loans from state-owned banks at very low interest rates to favored industries.Inside the White House, there remains a pitched battle between those who want to make a deal with Beijing and those who are determined to keep piling on pressure to force a more radical change in its trade practices. At the moment, the hard liners have Mr. Trump\u2019s ear.\u201cYou would expect the administration to have tabled a negotiating text with a clear set of commitments, but that has apparently not been done,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThere are some in the administration who see tariffs as an end in themselves.\u201dMr. Price said the Trump administration had done a good job of cataloging China\u2019s abuses: theft of intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from foreign companies, predatory joint venture agreements. But it has failed to marshal a coalition to confront China, instead provoking separate trade fights with the European Union, Japan, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatening additional taxes on imported cars.\u201cDoing this without the E.U. and Japan fully on board as though Chinese unfair trade practices were only a bilateral problem is wrongheaded and certainly less effective,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to galvanize your allies when you impose steel and aluminum tariffs on them and threaten auto tariffs.\u201dFor China, a complicating factor is figuring out who has influence in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been leading the negotiations, invited China\u2019s top trade negotiator, Liu He, to Washington for a meeting next week, even though his last visit ended badly when Mr. Trump spurned a deal that would have cut the American trade deficit with China.Mr. Mnuchin believes the United States must be open to talks as long as China is willing to address structural issues, including the trade gap between what America exports and what it imports, pressure on American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition for doing business in China and intellectual property theft.Other senior officials, notably Peter Navarro, who oversees the office of trade and manufacturing policy, have told colleagues that inviting the Chinese now was a sign of weakness. Mr. Navarro, an economist who made his name with book titles like \u201cDeath by China,\u201d is among those who favor putting more pressure on China to force a change in its behavior.It is not clear whether Mr. Liu will visit Washington next week. But even if he does, people who have spoken to Chinese officials said the unraveling of the agreement Mr. Liu believed he had struck on his last visit would make him reluctant to make any deal this time.\u201cThe Chinese deep learning from that is, \u2018We should not substantively re-engage until the administration has its internal house in order,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Rudd, who is now the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.After months of bruising encounters with Mr. Trump, Mr. Rudd said Chinese officials recognized that they would need to change their policies on trade and market access. But he said Mr. Xi was no less likely than Mr. Trump to risk losing face by giving in to American pressure.\u201cChina has politics too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole notion of \u2018back down\u2019 and \u2018face\u2019 is as live a consideration within internal Chinese politics as it is within U.S. politics.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s aggressive moves drew intense criticism from some quarters at home. Fred Smith, the chief executive of FedEx and an enthusiastic supporter of the president\u2019s tax cuts, called his trade policy a form of mercantilism that was \u201cworrisome to everyone.\u201dBut Mr. Trump has shown little sign of changing course. While there are differences among members of his economic team, there is a broad consensus in the administration about taking a hawkish stance toward China. Some point to evidence that the trade pressure on China was making it less adventurous in the East China Sea, where it spars regularly with Japan.Mr. Trump has forged ahead with tariffs even while saying that the trade tensions were making China less cooperative in pressuring North Korea on its nuclear arsenal \u2014 a claim that puzzles some of his own advisers.\u201cThey have been helpful; I hope they\u2019re still helpful,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference Tuesday with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda. \u201cThere\u2019s a question about that.\u201dBut the president added, \u201cIt got to a point where the numbers were too big.\u201d China \u201crebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve changed that around.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Other states \u2014 like Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington \u2014 are racing to catch up.One big reason for that: While many states have found it relatively painless to clean up their electric grids, swapping out coal for cleaner and cheaper natural gas and renewables, power plants are responsible for only about one-third of America\u2019s emissions. \u201cThese are sectors that require huge technological and behavioral changes,\u201d said Kate Larsen, a co-author of the Rhodium Group report. \u201cIt\u2019s a much heavier lift.\u201dOnly 16 states and Puerto Rico have actually promised to uphold the Paris agreement. Most of those states are led by Democrats, and efforts to persuade Republican-led states like Ohio or Texas to join have been largely unsuccessful. \u201cThat has been one of the great struggles,\u201d said Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington and a co-chairman of the alliance. \u201cBut I can tell you that I am confident that the alliance will grow after this next election cycle.\u201d That assumes, though, that states like Florida, New Mexico or Maine will see a change in party control.Governor Brown stressed that the San Francisco conference was meant to be a global summit, and he is leading it with foreign representatives like Xie Zhenhua, China\u2019s chief climate negotiator, and Anand Mahindra, a prominent Indian industrialist.In effect, the leaders of We Are Still In are seeking to conduct their own version of foreign policy on climate change \u2014 forging partnerships with other local governments in countries like China to address global warming and urging leaders abroad to do more \u2014 at a time when the Trump administration has disengaged on the issue.\u201cIt\u2019s a new world,\u201d Governor Inslee said. \u201cWe have the ability to work with the United Kingdom, as we have, with British Columbia, with Mexico, which we do. We can share best practices, we can look for investment opportunities. We are just not hampered by the Trump administration at all.\u201d\u201cLook, we\u2019re at the base camp of Mt.

Watchdog Says It\u2019s a Flop.", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 An American aid project in Afghanistan that was billed as the world\u2019s biggest program ever designed purely for female empowerment has been a failure and a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money, the head of a government watchdog agency has charged.The project by the United States Agency for International Development, which was named Promote, was originally budgeted at $280 million and was supposed to help 75,000 Afghan women get jobs, promotions, apprenticeships and internships.\u201cWe can\u2019t find any good data that they\u2019re helping any women,\u201d said John L. Sopko, the head of the watchdog agency, which was established by Congress to monitor American spending in Afghanistan.The Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction has repeatedly criticized American aid projects in Afghanistan as wasteful and poorly conceived.The new report expressed concern that three contractors\u2019 security and overhead costs accounted for 18 percent of the $89 million disbursed so far, five years after USAID announced it was introducing Promote.\u201cThis is a classic example of hubris and mendacity,\u201d said Mr. Sopko, a former prosecutor who was appointed as the special inspector general by President Barack Obama in 2012 and has remained under the Trump administration.\u201cRaj Shah and his people at USAID oversold it, lied to the taxpayer and the American and Afghan people about what we could accomplish,\u201d Mr. Sopko said, referring to the USAID administrator when Promote was started. \u201cThe hubris is they thought we could do all this and help all these people when the Afghan economy was in the tank,\u201d Mr. Sopko said. \u201cTo me, this is Exhibit A in what\u2019s wrong with reconstruction in Afghanistan.\u201dRajiv Shah was the administrator of USAID when Promote was launched and called it \u201cthe largest single investment USAID has ever made in its history in the future of women and girls anywhere in the world.\u201d He left the agency in 2015.\u201cWorking in conflict settings to help girls go to school and bring health care to vulnerable women is absolutely essential,\u201d Mr. Shah said in response to Mr. Sopko\u2019s remarks. \u201cFor roughly 2 percent of the cost of the war in Afghanistan, the U.S. government made investments in the health of women and children, in education, in governance, and in improving the economy \u2014 and those investments made an undeniable and positive difference in the lives of tens of thousands of Afghans.\u201dIn addition to the American funding that eventually totaled $280 million, Mr. Shah, who is now president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said USAID had hoped to persuade other countries to contribute and bring total funding to $416 million over five years.Five years later, the agency\u2019s report said, not a single other country has donated. Mr. Sopko recalled going to a meeting of European ambassadors in Kabul and asking, \u201cCan you tell me how you guys are supporting the Promote program?\u201d Their answer, he said, was \u201cWhat program?\u201dAs the years went by, the report said, USAID continually changed Promote\u2019s stated goals, making evaluations look less pessimistic. A leadership initiative that was meant to train women to land better jobs was originally aimed at reaching 12,500. But that target was reduced to 1,824.Even so, the agency said that USAID had failed to evaluate the program effectively. With $89 million of the original $280 million spent so far, it needed to \u201cconduct a new sustainability analysis for the program,\u201d it said.In a written response to the report, USAID agreed that it would carry out a sustainability analysis. Asked for comment, the agency repeated remarks it made in a formal response to the inspector\u2019s report.The report cited a letter from USAID saying that the program had \u201cdirectly benefited 50,000 Afghan women with the training and support they need to engage in advocacy for women\u2019s issues, enter the work force and start their own businesses.\u201dIt added that Promote had helped women \u201craise their voices and contribute to the peace and prosperity of their country.\u201dMr. Sopko said that USAID\u2019s claims for the program were not backed up by any measurable data, such as actual jobs, other than training and internships. And even those were not evaluated to show how often training had led to jobs.In some cases, attendance at a single gender empowerment class was counted as a woman benefiting. One target was to help 20 women find leadership positions in the Civil Service. None have so far, according to the report.Mr. Sopko said, \u201cI feel sorry for the poor Afghan women, who are saying, \u2018Where\u2019s my private sector job? Where\u2019s my government job?\u2019\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated when Rajiv Shah left USAID.

{"Headline": "In a Sign of the Economy\u2019s Strength, Jobs and Wages Moved Higher in August", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the Labor Department\u2019s latest bulletin also hinted that President Trump\u2019s tariffs could be starting to take a toll on manufacturing jobs.\u201cWhat\u2019s worth noting is that even though there still remains a lot of headline noise around politics and protectionism, underneath that, the U.S. economy \u2014 and that includes labor markets \u2014 is doing quite fine,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays.Employers fattened payrolls by 201,000 jobs; the jobless rate remained under 4 percent, near territory not seen since the 1960s; and average hourly earnings rose by 10 cents, up 2.9 percent from a year earlier.The manufacturing sector, however, which Mr. Trump has made a centerpiece of his economic and trade policies, registered fewer gains than had been previously thought. The combined addition of 93,000 jobs that the government originally reported for May, June and July was revised down to 62,000. And in August, the sector shed 3,000 jobs. The auto industry, which is particularly exposed to trade, eliminated 4,900 jobs last month after cutting 3,500 in July.\u201cYou could tell the story that protectionism is taking some toll here,\u201d Mr. Gapen said. \u201cIn most of the manufacturing indices, all showed a drop-off in new export orders.\u201dBut other analysts warned against drawing too many conclusions from the latest payroll report \u2014 which excludes agriculture, an industry that is very vulnerable to trade tensions. While some businesses will keenly feel the effects of tariffs, the mammoth United States economy is primary driven by domestic demand.\u201cManufacturing employment creation was still pretty good\u201d in previous months, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. \u201cThe impact of the tariffs that are in place now are annoying but modest in size and limited in scope, though the risk is certainly there. If tariffs broaden, we could see business activity impaired much more significantly.\u201dMost of Friday\u2019s report illustrated the economy\u2019s resilience.\u201cThis is the strongest labor market in a generation of workers,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the career site Glassdoor.The latest figures relieved some of the persistent anxiety about sluggish wages, with an increase of 0.4 percent in average hourly earnings last month. The report most likely helped clear the way for the Federal Reserve to lift its benchmark interest rate this month.Amy Glaser, a senior vice president at the staffing company Adecco, said she had noticed a significant change in employers\u2019 willingness to increase hourly wages. \u201cNow clients are talking in terms of dollars instead of cents for wage increases,\u201d she said.During the busy holiday season, employees often jump from one business to another for an additional 50 cents an hour, Ms. Glaser said. Companies are trying to head off that exodus, she said, by starting seasonal hiring earlier \u2014 in August, instead of September and October \u2014 and by offering higher starting pay.In Louisville, Ky., where there are many distribution centers, jobs that have paid $12 to $13 an hour are reaching the $15 level, Ms. Glaser said. \u201cThe race for talent is just so tight, employers are trying to get any step ahead of their competition,\u201d she said.At the same time, employers are doing more to develop their work forces.Customer call centers in the retail and financial sectors are devoting more money to training, Ms. Glaser said. Because of the prevalence of texting and social-media slang, many service agents \u2014 who typically earn $12 to $17 an hour, depending on the area and the job \u2014 lack the required typing skills and professional telephone style.Some companies, like Blue Ridge HealthCare in North Carolina, are taking more aggressive steps. Entry-level certified nursing assistants still earn $9 to $9.50 an hour, but the company has focused on training and incentives, said Cindy Cross, the system manager of recruitment and retention.\u201cThere are individuals who really want to go back to school but can\u2019t pay for it,\u201d she said, so the company covers tuition and books, and then guarantees them a job after graduation. If staff members want further training to move up the career ladder, Blue Ridge will pay for that as well, Ms. Cross said.Low-, middle- and high-skilled jobs all saw some wage growth. Even so, the job market can vary radically depending on what people do and where they live.\u201cIn some occupations \u2014 typically those with low-skill requirements and relatively pleasant working conditions \u2014 there is a huge oversupply of candidates,\u201d said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the online employment market site ZipRecruiter.The listings afford a glimpse of the mismatch between what employers are offering and what workers are seeking.Over the past year, for example, roughly 68,500 ZipRecruiter postings for administrative assistants attracted over 8.1 million applications, or 118 responses on average for every job. The 136,000 warehouse job listings drew over 9.2 million applications, or 68 per job.Geography is critical: Lower-wage workers rarely move for a job, so openings in distant places, of course, might not be useful to them. Still, on average, Ms. Pollak wrote in an email, \u201cit is harder (in some sense, at least) to get a job as an administrative assistant, receptionist or warehouse worker than it is to get into Harvard, with its relatively generous 5.2 percent acceptance rate\u201d in 2017.At the other end of the market, there are severe labor shortages for jobs demanding specialized skills, licensing requirements or tough working conditions. For the roughly 246,000 truck-driver listings on the ZipRecruiter site, there were 12 responses for each job, Ms. Pollak said. For the 237,000 skilled nursing jobs, there were just nine on average.Although the headline jobless rate remained 3.9 percent, a broader measure of unemployment that includes part-time workers who would prefer full-time jobs, as well as discouraged workers, fell to 7.4 percent last month.Over the past six months, 781,000 part-time workers have moved to full-time jobs.The Labor Department\u2019s report provides only a partial and temporary barometer of the economy. The August estimates will be revised twice in the coming months. Overall job growth for June and July was revised down by 50,000 jobs, bringing the three-month average gain to 185,000.As some economists warned of pending inflation, others maintained that the job market was not as heated as many employers suggest. Technological advances that replace workers and the availability of cheaper labor abroad have kept wages low, said Robert Frick, corporate economist with the Navy Federal Credit Union. \u201cI still think there\u2019s slack in the work force.\u201dExperts were also unsure what impact tariffs would have on jobs and the economy.The issues surrounding jobs, trade and tariffs loom large in some states where Republican and Democrats are struggling to keep or flip congressional seats in the midterm elections.Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a former White House senior trade economist, said it was still too early for the effect of the tariffs to show up in the data.The manufacturing job losses so far are consistent with the historical record, she noted. Steel tariffs imposed by President George W. Bush in 2002, Ms. McDaniel said, were responsible for a net loss of jobs. There was a short-lived steelworker boom that disappeared soon after the tariffs were withdrawn. But the manufacturing jobs that were lost never came back, she said. Many employers invested in automation or other alternatives like offshoring, instead.\u201cThese things take a while to play out, but we know how they played out in the past,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Reason for Slow Wage Growth? More Benefits", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 One of the most perplexing questions about the nation\u2019s economic recovery is why a tight labor market has not translated into faster wage growth. Part of the answer appears to be that American workers are receiving a growing share of compensation in the form of benefits rather than wages.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, began in July to offer four weeks of paid time off to its employees, including part-time workers, to take care of family members. The company decided that paid leave was the best way to show appreciation for its employees, said Jeff Shelman, a company spokesman. \u201cOur philosophy is that our employees are our most important asset, and we want to take care of them and allow them to take care of the people that matter most to them in their lives,\u201d he said.The shift toward nonwage compensation has helped to persuade the Federal Reserve to keep pushing up interest rates. The central bank is expected to increase its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the fourth consecutive quarter, to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent. Asset prices already reflect the full increase, leaving only the formality of the Fed\u2019s announcement, scheduled for 2 p.m.Even including nonwage benefits, the growth of compensation is very slow by historical standards.Some economists outside the Fed argue the weakness of wage growth is evidence that employers are still tapping a plentiful supply of workers. While the unemployment rate is just 3.9 percent, they note that an unusually large proportion of American adults are neither working nor looking for work.The Boyd Group, a Canadian auto repair company that operates in the United States as Gerber Collision & Glass, said it was struggling to hire enough technicians to meet the demand for repairs. So the company plans to spend $4.5 million this year to sweeten benefits for its United States workers, including additional paid vacation and larger contributions to employees\u2019 401(k) retirement accounts.\u201cThe objective is to make ourselves a more attractive employer within the context of the collision repair industry and, therefore, take advantage of opportunities to attract people from our competitors,\u201d Brock Bulbuck, the company\u2019s chief executive, said on a conference call with investors in May.Even using the White House measure, there is no sign of an acceleration in compensation since President Trump took office, but Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America, said it made sense to use broader measures. \u201cI think it goes back to the idea of whether our old models are as valuable as they once were,\u201d she said. \u201cThe story changes over time, and I do think the fact that there are other ways of being compensated means that simply looking at average hourly earnings is not going to be a comprehensive measure of how the economy is responding to tightness in the labor market.\u201dCompanies have kept most of the benefits of economic growth in recent years in the form of higher profits, so the shift toward benefits appears to be a rare example of workers getting something they want, albeit a consolation prize. There is longstanding evidence that workers would prefer a larger share of compensation in the form of benefits. Unionized workers, who have greater leverage to negotiate the mix of wages and benefits, have long used that power to insist on better benefits. The average unionized worker last year received 40 percent of their compensation in the form of benefits, compared with just 29 percent for the average non-unionized worker, the federal data shows.\u201cEmployers mostly care about the level of compensation, so the composition of it, they\u2019d generally be glad to do what their workers want them to do,\u201d said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. \u201cWhen workers actually have an effective voice, the benefit share tends to be a little higher.\u201dEmployers, too, may prefer to offer increased compensation in the form of benefits, because they may find it easier to cut benefits during a downturn.\u201cYou can increase benefits, bonus payments and other perks to keep your workers happy without creating a permanent adjustment in how they\u2019re compensated,\u201d Ms. Meyer said. \u201cIf they go away, it doesn\u2019t give the same perception of a change in their value to the company.\u201dFor the median worker, benefit compensation has increased 5 percent.\u201cWhen I talk with blue-collar or service workers, they\u2019re generally pretty unhappy about wage stagnation and about inadequate benefits,\u201d Mr. Bernstein said.The benefit that appears to be in the highest demand is paid time off.One recent survey reported that the share of Fortune 1000 companies offering \u201csummer Fridays\u201d \u2014 days on which employees were allowed to leave early for a long summer weekend \u2014 doubled from 21 percent in 2015 to 42 percent in 2018.The White House Council of Economic Advisers calculates that increasingly generous paid leave benefits mean that the average American worker is getting an additional half-day of paid leave each year, compared with five years ago.In surveys, younger workers often place a greater emphasis on benefits, and some analysts expect the shift toward nonwage compensation to continue as the millennial generation replaces the baby boomers in the work force.Ms. Meyer, the Bank of America economist, pointed to the tech industry as a harbinger.

But many find when they reach the European Union that landing a regular job without the correct papers is almost impossible \u2014 especially in high-unemployment countries like Spain.The street vendors, who often approach tourists on the city\u2019s beaches or promenades, have become an increasingly hot-button topic in Spain, and episodes involving manteros have occasionally turned violent.In recent weeks, a court sentenced a mantero to four and a half months in prison and a fine of 3,500 euros, about $4,000, for injuring a police officer during a check in Cambrils, a resort south of Barcelona. The mantero repeatedly kicked the officer, who had put his foot on the merchandise cloth to stop the vendor from running away.Leading up to municipal elections in Barcelona and other cities next year, opposition politicians have used the tensions over the manteros to accuse Barcelona\u2019s leftist mayor, Ada Colau, of failing to maintain law and order in the city.The street vendors have found Barcelona to be a relatively good base, largely because the city has plenty of tourists willing to buy counterfeit sunglasses and bags. But many people oppose the sellers\u2019 presence; shopkeepers express particular frustration, saying the manteros are drawing away customers.\u201cIt\u2019s just horrible to have this illegal competition,\u201d said Carlos Servidio, whose market stand offers leather belts and bags manufactured at his workshop in Rub\u00ed, a town just outside Barcelona. Born in Argentina, Mr. Servidio arrived in Barcelona 30 years ago.\u201cI don\u2019t want to criminalize these Africans, because I know what it\u2019s like to be a migrant and to have to make a new start in life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the authorities must decide whether everybody should be paying taxes \u2014 or instead nobody.\u201dParvati Nair, the Barcelona-based director of the United Nations University Institute on Globalization, Culture and Mobility, said the absence of figures was a problem. \u201cStreet vendors are part of an informal economy that is legally and politically invisible,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if we could work at least with exact data, we could come up with better policies for these people.\u201d\u201cMadrid is a very large city where there are irregular activities that shouldn\u2019t take place, but the fact that there is a certain number of people selling irregularly is by a long shot not among the main problems,\u201d she told reporters last month.Babacar Diop, from Senegal, was among the 15 vendors selected to begin the cooperative. Having reached Spain a decade ago, he turned to street vending after bouncing for several years between occasional odd jobs, including working as a security guard on a construction site.\u201cI thought Spain would bring money and stability, but the reality wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d said Mr. Diop, 38. The cooperative, he said, was \u201ca chance to stop taking risks on the streets, where you\u2019re always trying to get away from the police.\u201dIn the Barcelona district of San Roque, dozens of undocumented migrants live in an abandoned factory, sleeping on mattresses around wooden stoves to keep warm.New arrivals who turn to street vending in Barcelona normally start out with help from an established mantero. The contact usually lends enough money to buy counterfeit merchandise from one of the warehouses in the nearby city of Badalona.One recent evening, Samba Diallo, 28, ventured out to sell his goods in central Barcelona. Threading his way between tables on a cafe terrace, he held two wooden sculptures of elephants and a large cloth bag over his shoulder filled with bracelets and other trinkets. He headed for a table occupied by three elegantly dressed women; when they saw him approach, two clutched their handbags and waved him off.Like many other street vendors, Mr. Diallo had not aimed for Barcelona when he decided to migrate to Europe. He crossed from Libya to Italy and spent five years in different Italian cities. He said he had moved to Barcelona after friends advised him that \u201cthe Spanish are nicer to African migrants than the people in Italy.\u201d But after a few months, he added, \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that it\u2019s much better here.\u201dAt another table, Mr. Diallo struck up a conversation with a Dutch family and got the father to hold his elephant sculpture and have his photograph taken alongside him.The Dutch tourist later explained that he had liked the elephant but worried about buying the bulky object because of luggage restrictions on his low-cost airline ticket.Mr. Diallo failed to find a single buyer that evening. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get people to trust you as an African \u2014 and luck also wasn\u2019t on my side today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at least I made somebody happy with a photo souvenir.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The accusation could also be a test of JD.com\u2019s stability, as well as the ability of a Chinese technology company to rebound from the problems of its leaders. China\u2019s most powerful technology companies are still tightly controlled by their founders, so the fortunes of businesses worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars are closely intertwined with the fates of a small number of executives.JD.com, whose shares trade in the United States, has prospered by catering to the increasing sophistication of Chinese shoppers. Big global brands such as Nike, Prada and Levi\u2019s use JD.com\u2019s sales platform to reach the country\u2019s burgeoning middle class, and the company is closely watched as an indicator of consumer confidence.A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department said Mr. Liu was released \u201cpending formal complaint.\u201d Spokesman John Elder said the police could have held Mr. Liu in custody through Tuesday, but did not feel that was necessary while they conducted their investigation.The police will, after the investigation, recommend to prosecutors whether Mr. Liu should be charged with a misdemeanor or felony or face no charges, at which point the case would be closed.The company said that Mr. Liu\u2019s trip would continue as planned, but a spokeswoman declined to comment further. When asked when Mr. Liu would return to China, the spokeswoman said she did not have that information. Mr. Liu did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Liu has not been charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing in that case. But he tried to get an Australian court to prevent the release of his name in connection with the case by citing potential damage to his marriage and business, court documents show. In July, a judge in Australia rejected his request for a suppression order.JD.com is a heavyweight in China\u2019s technology scene, and Mr. Liu, its chairman and chief executive since its 2004 founding, is one of its leading lights. Legal troubles for Mr. Liu could darken perceptions overall of JD.com, whose shares trade on the Nasdaq stock market in New York and have a market value of around $50 billion.The company competes with Alibaba, the country\u2019s largest e-commerce provider, for the attention of China\u2019s increasingly affluent middle class, and says it has more than 300 million customers. It specializes in electronics such as smartphones and appliances.Alibaba and JD.com are both trying to lure high-end global brands to open virtual stores on their sales platforms. Alibaba says it has more than 570 million customers across its Chinese marketplaces.Whereas Alibaba operates platforms on which outside merchants sell their wares to consumers, JD.com\u2019s business model is more like Amazon\u2019s. It typically buys products from manufacturers and stores them in its own warehouses. JD.com has also invested in its own logistics network, which the company says helps provide quicker, more reliable delivery than Alibaba can offer. The company\u2019s major shareholders include Google and the Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent.For many companies with shops on the platform, JD.com offers a way into an exciting market. China\u2019s dramatic economic rise has meant that hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers are no longer content with shoddily made goods, and are ready to pay more for quality.But as the economy has shown signs of a slowdown in recent months, JD.com has suffered too. Last month it reported disappointing financial results, citing increasing competition.China\u2019s technology scene is young \u2014 many of its most influential companies were founded only in the past two decades \u2014 and company founders like Mr. Liu tend to retain outsize influence on their businesses, even as they grow large and list on public stock exchanges. Founders control voting rights and have ultimate say in matters large and small. Their personalities seep into the corporate culture.Mr. Liu was born in a poor part of Jiangsu Province in eastern China in the 1970s. When he earned a place at the prestigious Renmin University in Beijing, other people in the village scraped together cash and boiled eggs to sustain him in the capital.In the past, Mr. Liu has spent one day a year wearing JD.com\u2019s red uniform, riding an electric bike and making home deliveries. He likes to say that as the son of a poor family, he wants to treat his employees with fairness and respect.Raymond Zhong reported from Beijing, and Li Yuan from Hong Kong.

And the United States should help him, because that\u2019s the best way to sustain progress toward denuclearization and eventually eliminate the threat posed by North Korea.But much of the international community, and Washington in particular, has been so fixated on North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities that it hasn\u2019t paid enough attention to Mr. Kim\u2019s broader strategic intentions \u2014 or how to make progress on denuclearization by working with, rather than against, them.Mr. Kim wants North Korea to become a normal East Asian economy, catch up with and integrate into the region, and it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to help him do so.For North Koreans, economic development would bring opportunities to feed their families and run businesses, trade and perhaps travel. As the economic and social chasm between North and South began to close, South Koreans could slowly envisage a time when reunification seems plausible. With the peace process on the Korean Peninsula moving forward, Americans \u2014 who already have enough to worry about \u2014 could remove the threat of a North Korean nuclear strike from their list of pressing concerns.Yet the opportunities for peace and denuclearization that Mr. Kim\u2019s economic ambitions present seem largely lost on the U.S. government. Sanctions and economic pressure may have helped induce Mr. Kim to engage, but they will be an obstacle to further progress.Only by selectively suspending sanctions \u2014 say, carving out exceptions for joint ventures \u2014 and gradually lifting them, can the United States tap Mr. Kim\u2019s economic ambitions to advance its own goals.Will Mr. Kim ever give up North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons?

{"Headline": "U.S. Household Income Rises to Pre-Recession Levels, Prompting Cheers and Questions", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The income of the median American household has finally rebounded from the damage caused by the 2008 financial crisis, a significant milestone in the nation\u2019s painfully slow economic recovery.The gains in income were also driven by increased employment, rather than increased pay. The average annual earnings of both male and female full-time workers actually declined last year, but that drop was offset in the national data by the increase in the number of people with jobs.\u201cWe have tight labor markets but not tight enough to generate a break from the trend \u2014 to spur meaningful wage growth,\u201d said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the liberal Economic Policy Institute.The report provides ample fodder for both political parties in the run-up to the midterm elections in November. Congressional Republicans, saddled with an unpopular president, are eager to take credit for economic gains, rallying behind the slogan that Americans are \u201cbetter off now.\u201d Representative Ted Budd, Republican of North Carolina, described the report as \u201chuge news for the middle class.\u201dBut Democrats argue that the benefits of growth are mostly being pocketed by the wealthy. Economic output, adjusted for inflation, increased by 16 percent between 2007 and 2017, while median income remained unchanged. The median is the midpoint of the income distribution, meaning that an equal number of households made more and less than that figure.Jared Bernstein, an economist at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who served as the chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the numbers showed \u201ca structural gap between overall economic growth and the prosperity of many families.\u201dWhile middle-class incomes are treading water, the rich have prospered and the poor have fallen behind. Between 2007 and 2017, household income at the 90th percentile rose by 7.5 percent, according to the Census Bureau, while at the 10th percentile it fell by 4.5 percent.That was an improvement over 2016, when the poverty rate stood at 12.7 percent.There are also large differences by race. The median income of African-American households in 2017 remained 2.9 percent lower than in 2007, according to the Economic Policy Institute, while the median for white households rose by 1.5 percent over the same period. For Hispanics, the median rose by 6.7 percent.The Census Bureau made significant changes in its methodology in 2013, complicating comparisons with earlier years. The reported level of median household income in 2017 was the highest on record, but officials said the changes in methodology tended to increase reported income. Adjusting for those changes, median household income was comparable to the level in 2007, and slightly below 1999.The Census Bureau also reported on Wednesday that the share of Americans with health insurance did not increase in 2017, breaking a trend of steady increases dating back to 2010.The report said that 28.5 million people, or 8.8 percent of the population, lacked health insurance for all of 2017. The change from 2016 was not statistically significant for either number.The stagnation was striking because of the increase in the share of Americans with full-time jobs. Such an increase would ordinarily be expected to produce a rise in health insurance coverage rates. Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the likely explanation was the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act. Otherwise, he said, \u201cwe probably would have seen further progress in 2017.\u201dTurmoil in health insurance markets as Congress considered proposals to repeal the Affordable Care Act may have also created uncertainty. \u201cBetween 2016 and 2017, we saw that the uninsured rate decreased in three states, and it increased in 14 states,\u201d said Edward Berchick, a demographer at the Census Bureau. \u201cThis was the first time since 2013 that we saw an increase in any state.\u201dThe effect of opposition to the Affordable Care Act, passed by Democrats during the Obama administration, is most clearly visible in states that declined to expand Medicaid.In states that did not expand Medicaid, 16.7 percent of the population had no health insurance coverage at any time during 2017, up from 16.1 percent in 2016. By contrast, in states that chose to expand Medicaid, there was no significant decrease in coverage. The Census Bureau said 9.4 percent of people age 19 to 64 had no health insurance coverage, roughly the same as last year.The states with the highest proportion of uninsured residents were Texas (17.3 percent) and Oklahoma (14.2 percent), followed by Alaska, Georgia, Florida and Wyoming, all with more than 12 percent of their residents lacking coverage. Massachusetts, which has been working systematically to expand coverage for more than a decade, had the lowest uninsured rate last year, with 2.8 percent of residents uninsured. Five other states \u2014 Hawaii, Iowa, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Vermont \u2014 as well as the District of Columbia had uninsured rates of less than 5 percent.In both expansion states and non-expansion states, the uninsured rate for working-age adults has declined significantly over the last decade. Most of the decline has taken place since 2013, as provisions of the Affordable Care Act expanding coverage took effect in 2014.Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the new census data suggested that \u201cthe historic progress in reducing the number of people uninsured has stalled.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But they\u2019re not as a clever as you are. At least not yet.My name is Cade Metz, and here at The New York Times I cover emerging technologies, which is a fancy term for cool stuff that is probably not as cool as you think it is. My stock example: driverless cars.Driverless cars are very cool.

Much the same applies to robots in general.At times, you can\u2019t help but think of these mechanical creations as living things. The company will start selling one of them, a doglike robot called SpotMini, in the coming year. But even Boston Dynamics is not quite sure what these robots are actually good for.Robots play tricks on the mind. We tend to think they are more advanced than they really are, perhaps because of science fiction movies or because our brains are wired to believe in bots. This is particularly true when it comes to the biomimetic machines inside a lab like Boston Dynamics.\u201cWhen we see a biped that looks like a person or a quadruped that looks like a dog, we project our previous experiences with people and dogs onto these machines. But, in fact, there is nothing inside,\u201d said Gill Pratt, who worked with Boston Dynamics as an official at Darpa, a research arm of the Defense Department, and is now exploring new forms of robotics as the chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute. \u201cIt is like a hollow doll.\u201dKeep that in mind as you think about any other robot.The week I visited Boston Dynamics, I spent time with about 25 other roboticists \u2014 which was not hard in the Boston area. Cambridge breeds them as if they were really smart rabbits.

Presented with a bin full of stuff, they can grab and pick up individual objects, even if they haven\u2019t seen them before. This is just what a company like Amazon need inside its massive distribution centers.But companies like RightHand are still perfecting the art of picking. And the next task \u2014 deciding where each object should go \u2014 is even harder. Right now, RightHand is leaning on systems that scan the bar code attached to each item.

Fifty-four percent of Oregon\u2019s House Democrats now are female, a rare majority in state capitols, where men still mostly rule.But by being early to elect so many women, particularly Democrats, Oregon has also been early to skip ahead to a new chapter \u2014 and a new layer of complication.Female elected officials in Oregon now have significant and lengthy track records in office, and they are being forced to defend those records this year. Notably, some of them are facing challenges over their stances on the very issues that have propelled calls for more female candidates around the country: sexual harassment and abortion.Republicans, long out of power in the state, are arguing that liberal women leaders have pushed the state farther to the left on social issues, including abortion rights, than many Oregon women would prefer. At the same time, a long-simmering sexual harassment scandal has come to a boil in recent weeks in Salem, the state capital, raising a suggestion from some that women leaders may be no more effective at handling the issue than men.\u201cThe culture in the State Capitol building is something that has been festering for decades,\u201d said Jillian Schoene, co-executive director of Emerge Oregon, a group in Portland that recruits and trains women to run for office. \u201cCulture change takes time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also unfair to say that women are solely responsible for fixing it.\u201dThese forces are playing out all through Oregon\u2019s election landscape. In the race for governor, Knute Buehler, an orthopedic surgeon, state legislator and rare Republican who says he supports abortion rights, has staked his campaign on appealing to moderate female voters, especially in the suburbs of Portland. Mr. Buehler has repeatedly pressed an idea that Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat seeking a second term, has focused on social issues that play well in big liberal centers like Portland at the expense of core matters like education and the economy around the state.Seeking to win over those same voters, Ms. Brown and her allies have pushed back in television ads, asserting that Mr. Buehler was not to be trusted, especially on abortion rights. The Oregon Legislature passed a far-reaching bill last year guaranteeing and expanding access to contraception, abortion and postpartum care. Ms. Brown signed the bill into law. Mr. Buehler, representing a House district in central Oregon, voted no.Some Republican women, like Jessica Gomez, a business owner in southwest Oregon who is running for office for the first time, are sharpening the argument: Women in power in Salem have accomplished some admirable things, she tells voters, but they\u2019ve gone too far.\u201cWe need to support women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s health and those things are important, but when you have a legislature that really just pushes that off the deep end, I think people have an issue with it,\u201d said Ms. Gomez, who has described herself as \u201cpro-choice\u201d on abortion in her race against a male candidate for an open seat in the State Senate.Many women in elected office in Oregon link their progress to Barbara Roberts, the state\u2019s first female governor, who was elected in 1990. When Ms. Roberts, a Democrat, left office, she became a mentor to others, helping to start political training camps. Thirty women are now among the 90 members of the State Legislature\u2019s two chambers, and 25 of the women are Democrats.Over the last year, public debate over a sexual harassment scandal has played out inside the Capitol. Jeff Kruse, a state senator, resigned earlier this year after an independent report found that for years he had touched women, including three senators, inappropriately or offensively, sometimes hugging them from behind or putting his hands below their waists. Mr. Kruse, a Republican, said he did not recall many of the incidents and did not intend anything sexual.In August, Brad Avakian, the State Commissioner of Labor and Industries filed a complaint with his own commission accusing legislative leaders of having \u201cpermitted a generally hostile environment based upon sex\u201d that affected legislators, employees, lobbyists and interns. The accusation \u2014 by a Democrat, though the Commissioner\u2019s job is formally nonpartisan \u2014 sent an electric charge into the election cycle, suggesting that women, even as they rose to power, had not acted forcefully enough against a climate of harassment.Legislative leaders like Ms. Williamson said the harassment allegations in the Legislature were distressing, but that emerging reports of harassment should not be taken to mean that harassment is a growing problem. Rather, she said, women feel safer about coming forward with their experiences with women now in leadership.Oregon\u2019s Legislature is only ninth-highest in the country for the percentage of its members who are women, but it has more women in top leadership roles \u2014 including the house speaker and majority leaders of both chambers \u2014 than any other state\u2019s, according to Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Arizona, a Republican-leaning state, is among the top states for elected women overall, with 40 percent of seats in the Legislature and five statewide elected offices held by women.Some of Oregon\u2019s female lawmakers say the argument that women could lead Oregon Democrats too far to the left will be rejected by voters, especially as President Trump\u2019s nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court have opened new questions about the fate of Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling.\u201cWhen you start talking about something being taken away, it all changes, and the idea that we\u2019re taking Democrats to the left gets no traction,\u201d said Val Hoyle, a Democrat and former State Representative who won an election in May to replace Mr. Avakian as Labor Commissioner.But Republicans, led by Mr. Buehler, say that ideological rigidity has become the real problem in Salem. Mr. Buehler said that his position on abortion is more moderate \u2014 essentially the same as former President Bill Clinton\u2019s, who said abortion ought to be \u201csafe, legal and rare.\u201d Mr. Buehler, who faces an uphill battle against Ms. Brown, said he voted against the state\u2019s broad bill last year to expand abortion rights because he was concerned about the cost.\u201cPeople are weary of divisiveness,\u201d Mr. Buehler said. \u201cAs a physician, you\u2019re trained to solve problems.\u201dMs. Brown said her push to make health care coverage, including reproductive health care, accessible to all Oregonians seemed more essential than ever, given Republican efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration\u2019s signature health law.In an interview, Ms. Brown said that Oregon\u2019s recent political experience reflected a next step in a process \u2014 from the first wave of feminists in the early 1900s, seeking votes for women; through a second wave in the late 1960s and early 1970s, reaching for equality; to the present, in places like her state.\u201cWe\u2019re really wrestling with the third wave, and that is culture change, and that is hard and it is challenging,\u201d she said.Voters like Susie Garrison, 67, a retired teacher in Portland, say they are caught in the middle. She said she was planning to vote for Ms. Brown and other Democrats in November, but that she was not entirely thrilled with what state leaders have done on the topic she cares most about \u2014 education. \u201cTheir heart\u2019s in the right place,\u201d she said.Katie Turley, 39, who works in a dental office in eastern Oregon, described herself as \u201cvery pro-choice,\u201d and an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Buehler. But she said she struggles with questions over health care and the idea that some people cannot afford it \u2014 the central issue on which Democrats have launched their attacks on Mr. Buehler.\u201cThere has to be funding for low-income moms,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

It is expected to make landfall Thursday night near the North Carolina-South Carolina border.Ms. Brown knew that evacuation was necessary. She also knew it would not be easy. There was her pit bull puppy, Kaya, to think of. And her little sister. And her sister\u2019s 3-week-old baby. And the question of whether her mother would join them as they rushed out of town by noon Tuesday, when the governor\u2019s order takes effect.\u201cI wasn\u2019t nervous,\u201d Ms. Brown said in a phone interview, \u201cuntil there was a mandatory evacuation.\u201dGovernor McMaster said at a Monday afternoon news conference that the lanes of two major divided highways \u2014 Interstate 26 and U.S. 501 \u2014 would be reversed to make them one-way, carrying traffic only away from the coast, and that two other routes might also be reversed if needed. Schools and state offices in the lower half of the state will be closed.\u201cWe know that this evacuation order I\u2019m issuing is going to be inconvenient for some people,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe do not want to risk one South Carolina life in this hurricane.\u201dIn North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper asked President Trump on Monday to declare a federal state of emergency for his state. In coastal Dare County, the local emergency management agency announced a mandatory evacuation for all residents and visitors on Hatteras Island, the long, slender barrier island off the North Carolina coast, with a similar order to go into effect Tuesday for the rest of the county. Schools in 17 counties were expected to be closed on Tuesday.\u201cThe forecast places North Carolina in the bull\u2019s-eye of Hurricane Florence, and the storm is rapidly getting stronger,\u201d Governor Cooper said. \u201cWhen weather forecasters tell us \u2018life-threatening,\u2019 we know it\u2019s serious. We are bracing for a hard hit.\u201dIn Myrtle Beach, Ms. Brown said she had not yet decided where to flee to. She was thinking about Savannah, Ga., a few hours\u2019 drive down the coast. She did not have a place to stay there, she said, but she was hoping it would be far enough south to be out of harm\u2019s way.And so it went. Across the coastal South, an order to clear out is an ever-looming and rarely pleasant possibility all through hurricane season, which officially lasts from June 1 through Nov. 30. Evacuation can often mean hours on choked freeways, followed by days idling in a motel, a shelter or on a friend\u2019s sofa.The Category 2 storm approached the North Carolina coast on Thursday, with winds of up to 110 miles an hour.This week, residents of the Carolinas were left to make their own hard and familiar choices once more. Lisa Presgraves, 48, a bartender at a restaurant in Kill Devil Hills on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks, said that she would ride out the storm as she always did, in her condominium in the barrier island community of Nag\u2019s Head, even though it was included in the Dare County mandatory evacuation order.\u201cIt\u2019d have to be really bad for me to leave,\u201d Ms. Presgraves said on Monday afternoon. \u201cI have a dog, and financially, it\u2019s hard to take off and get a hotel room.\u201dStaying home would be no party, she said. Her black Labrador retriever, Lucas, \u201cflips out\u201d during hurricanes, she said. And she would be watching floodwaters with great concern: During Hurricane Matthew, she said, the water rose up to her deck. \u201cIt\u2019s not fun,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of stressful.\u201dSome experts said that Hurricane Florence\u2019s impact could be particularly ugly. A report by the Program for the Study of Developed Shorelines at Western Carolina University said that on its projected track and intensity, \u201cthis will be a worst-case scenario storm,\u201d with record storm surges and interruptions to electric power that could last for days.The report suggested that at Sunset Beach, N.C., southwest of Wilmington, the storm surge could exceed 18 feet, the record set during Hurricane Hazel in 1954.Inland flooding was also a major concern. Governor McMaster said that significant flooding could occur around South Carolina\u2019s Pee Dee region in the northeastern corner of the state.In Chapel Hill, N.C., northwest of the capital, Mayor Pam Hemminger spent Monday on the phone with state emergency officials and making sure that locals in flood-prone parts of town were aware of the risks.\u201cFlash flooding is always a concern,\u201d she said. Also at the top of the list: \u201cLoss of power for individuals, and our senior centers and public housing.\u201dExperts said that getting people away from the coast might not put them entirely out of danger, because the inland areas of the two states where many will take refuge face risks of their own.J. Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and professor of geography at the University of Georgia, said that the probability of severe flooding is very high if Hurricane Florence stalls for several days after making landfall, as forecasters say it might. \u201cThe models are suggesting something very similar to what we saw with Harvey,\u201d he said, referring to the catastrophic flooding in Houston and other parts of Texas and Louisiana last year.\u201cThis is another example of a one-two-punch storm,\u201d he said, adding that the danger may be greater from the second punch, because people are afraid of hurricane winds but think of rains and flooding as familiar problems.As important as it is to prepare for the coastal impact, he said, people \u201cmay underestimate or undervalue\u201d the flooding threat posed by 20 to 40 inches of rain. \u201cPeople have a hard time internalizing, preparing for something that\u2019s outside their realm of experience.\u201d he said, but Hurricane Florence could bring conditions that people have not seen in their lifetimes.\u201cIt\u2019s a dire situation that I believe is setting up,\u201d he said.Complicating the risk, many areas in the path of the storm are already sodden with recent rainfall, Dr. Shepherd said, and the elevated terrain across much of North Carolina could lead to greater flooding and landslides.Although climate change does not cause hurricanes, he said, it does tend to make them more destructive in a number of ways. \u201cWhen we have a storm like Florence, it\u2019s certainly going to be shoving higher sea levels onto the coastline,\u201d he said.For all of the attention on Florence, the Carolinas were not the only parts of the United States in the path of approaching storms. In the Pacific, warnings and watches were posted in Hawaii on Monday for Hurricane Olivia, a Category 1 storm, while Typhoon Mangkhut swept across the Mariana Islands and Guam.And in the Caribbean, when Hurricane Isaac crosses the Lesser Antilles later this week, its northern side may graze Puerto Rico, where residents are still struggling to recover from last year\u2019s catastrophic storm, Hurricane Maria.John Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Marine\u2019s Son Takes On U.S. Military Bases in Okinawa", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOKINAWA \u2014 Concluding a stump speech before more than 500 supporters in a large auditorium, Denny Tamaki, a candidate for governor on this southern Japanese island blanketed by American military installations, invoked his parentage to explain why he thinks he is uniquely qualified for the job.\u201cMy father is American and my mother is Okinawan,\u201d said Mr. Tamaki, 58, who never actually met his father, a Marine who returned to the United States before he was born.Mr. Tamaki says that his American heritage could help him negotiate with the United States government over a planned relocation of a busy Marine air base from a central Okinawan city to a less-populated coastal area. Mr. Tamaki wants the base moved off Okinawa altogether.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible that the democracy of the country of my father will reject me,\u201d Mr. Tamaki said at the campaign rally on Monday night, to laughter from the audience. \u201cOnly Denny can say that.\u201dMr. Tamaki, the first Amerasian to be elected to Japan\u2019s House of Representatives, has been taunted on social media for his background. \u201cDenny Tamaki, you can\u2019t be a true Japanese no matter how hard you try but you are an incomplete \u2018half,\u2019\u201d one commentator wrote on Twitter.\u201cDenny says, \u2018I am half American so I can talk to the U.S.\u2019 Hahaha, the world is not that optimistic,\u201d someone else wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou can\u2019t even speak English!\u201dSupporters of Mr. Tamaki said they view his blended heritage as an asset. \u201cBeing a mixed-race governor is unprecedented,\u201d said Yuichi Kiwaki, a beverage salesman who attended the campaign rally on Monday with his family. \u201cSo I think there are some things only he can do.\u201dMr. Tamaki faces a considerable challenge from his opponent, who is receiving heavy support from Tokyo.The election comes at a time when Mr. Abe is ever watchful for signals that President Trump might pull back from the longstanding American security alliance with Japan.\u201cFor the Abe administration, the picture is that the election in Okinawa is the one that they have to win,\u201d said Seiji Endo, professor of international politics at Seikei University in Tokyo. \u201cThey want to make sure that the operation of the U.S.-Japan security pact will be kept stable.\u201dThe governor\u2019s race is complicated by Okinawans\u2019 evolving \u2014 and often ambivalent \u2014 views.Many residents recognize that the bases have lifted the local economy, contributing slightly more than 5 percent of the region\u2019s revenue. Okinawa is Japan\u2019s poorest prefecture.A generational divide is emerging between older residents who nurse the wounds of history and younger voters who are looking for practical improvements more closely related to their daily lives.To people like Naomi Machida, 62, the owner of a cafe near the Marine air base who was among Mr. Tamaki\u2019s supporters at the campaign event on Monday, rejecting the relocation of the American base is the primary driver of her vote.\u201cI want to reject anything related to war in Okinawa,\u201d said Ms. Machida, who recalled her mother\u2019s experiences during the Battle of Okinawa in World War II, which cost tens of thousands of lives. \u201cI can\u2019t express with words the importance of this election. It is a life or death issue.\u201dTo many younger people, the bases are less central to their political calculations.\u201cMilitary bases have been here since they were born,\u201d said Manabu Sato, professor of political science at Okinawa International University, which overlooks the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, slated for relocation. \u201cThe U.S. military personnel and their families are on the street and come to the shopping malls and supermarkets and fast food restaurants where my students work part-time, so the presence of the U.S. military is nothing to question for them.\u201dOn the campus, Shin Tanahara, 22, a law major, said most of his classmates were more worried about job hunting than the fate of the base.\u201cPeople tend to focus only on the bases, but we have to think of other issues as well,\u201d Mr. Tanahara said. Among his concerns, he said, was poverty and helping to increase tourism in the region. He plans to vote for Mr. Sakima.Up in Henoko Bay, a fishing village where the Japanese and American governments agreed to move the Futenma air base a dozen years ago, a chain-link fence topped by barbed wire blocked off a long stretch of beach designated for a new runway.Just before he died, Governor Onaga announced that he would rescind his predecessor\u2019s approval to use landfill in the construction of the runway, the latest in a series of legal maneuvers he used to thwart the base\u2019s relocation.Miwako Aragaki, a clerk at a grocery store in town, said she voted for Mr. Onaga four years ago because of his opposition to the new base and would vote for Mr. Tamaki this time.During the campaign, American military officials are trying to remain \u201cas invisible as we can humanly be,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Eric M. Smith, the commander of the Third Marine Expeditionary Force on Okinawa.In an interview in his office overlooking an expanse of ocean about 20 miles south of Henoko, General Smith said it would be up to Okinawa to negotiate with Tokyo over the location of any new bases.\u201cThat is really an internal question for the government of Japan,\u201d he said.On the campaign trail, Mr. Sakima has steadfastly avoided talking directly about the American bases, focusing instead on the economy. At a campaign event in Yonabaru on the southern end of the island on Tuesday night, Mr. Sakima touted his work to reduce school lunch fees and medical costs as mayor of Ginowan.Ryogo Okuhira, 31, a construction worker who attended the campaign event, said he liked Mr. Sakima\u2019s focus on the economy and was skeptical that Mr. Tamaki would lure new businesses to Okinawa if he was preoccupied with the fate of the military base.\u201cReality is more important than ideals,\u201d Mr. Okuhira said.Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Okinawa and Hisako Ueno contributed research from Tokyo.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Youth Sports Megacomplex Comes to Town, Hoping Teams Will Follow", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEMERSON, Ga. \u2014 Just past the Hampton Inn and the Chick-fil-A, beyond the climbing wall but not as far as the water park, is your field of dreams. Actually, there are eight of them: all major league-sized, synthetic-turfed and LED-lit, and wedged in next to the three soccer pitches. The Champions Center is ahead on your left, where a dozen basketball courts can be converted into two dozen for volleyball.It is here at the LakePoint Sporting Community where the visiting boys and girls in their cleats and their uniforms have come to play, with their parents trailing them from the diamonds and the hardwood to the fast-food restaurants and the hotels. In the summer, hundreds of teams pass through here every week.\u201cThe plan is to be like a cruise ship for youth sports,\u201d said Bob Zurcher, the chief financial officer of LakePoint Land, which has helped turn Emerson, a town of 1,500 about 40 miles north of Atlanta, into an unlikely year-round tourist destination. \u201cYou give them first-class competition and facilities, then try to give them everything else they need right here.\u201d\u201cThey may be holding back on vacation or on a car, but they will make certain that Susie goes to the cheerleading competition in Orlando and Johnny gets to his Little League tournament in Georgia,\u201d said Mary Helen Sprecher, the managing editor of Sports Destination Management, a trade publication for event managers and rights holders. \u201cThese youth complexes have become part of the sports ecosystem by putting heads in beds, filling up restaurants and delivering economic impact.\u201dThe miles, and the costs, can add up quickly. The Peach State Basketball Classic at LakePoint in July, for example, was only a midseason stop for Scott Wyatt and his 16-year-old daughter, Claire. Her team, the Tennessee Fury, was coming from a girls tournament in Louisville that had attracted more than 800 squads, and it would head to an event in Atlanta a few days later.Wyatt, a pharmacist in Knoxville, Tenn., stayed with his wife and daughter at the Holiday Inn, as the tournament required. The Fury\u2019s game schedule was tight, which meant the families\u2019 meal options were largely limited to the Taco Bell or the Chick-fil-A or the pizza restaurant near the complex. LakePoint officials said out-of-town visitors spend an average of $122 per person a day; for locals, it\u2019s about half that.Over two nights and three days, Wyatt said, his family expected to spend about $800 here, or about one-third the $2,550 their trip to Louisville had cost. The three-day tournament in Atlanta that followed would add more to their tab. Toss in an earlier trip to Raleigh, N.C., and Wyatt estimated that the summer travel basketball schedule for Claire, a 6-foot-1 junior, would cost the family about $6,000.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get college scholarships \u2014 that\u2019s the only reason we are here,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cThe whole goal to get these girls in a school and some of it paid for.\u201dThe Peach State Basketball Classic was considered a boutique exposure tournament for the nearly 100 teams that participated, and there were college coaches carrying clipboards roaming the special lanes between courts reserved for them \u2014 set up to allow them to watch players away from parents. The coaches wore shirts bearing the logos of every kind of program: Bible colleges and Ivy League universities, big state schools and small liberal arts institutions. Signs for scouting services and sneaker companies surrounded the courts.Earlier in the year, the big shoe companies \u2014 Nike, Adidas and Under Armour \u2014 all had hosted top-tier boys tournaments here that drew some of the biggest names in college basketball: Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, Kentucky\u2019s John Calipari, Villanova\u2019s Jay Wright. Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder turned up to check in on an A.A.U. team that he sponsors, and the former Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade came to watch one of his sons play.Other weeks, the complex\u2019s focus switches effortlessly between baseball and volleyball, soccer and cheerleading.For the players and their parents, though, the potential payoff is worth the sizable investment of time and money. N.C.A.A. member universities hand out about $3 billion in scholarships a year. And while the organization reminds parents that only 2 percent of high school athletes are awarded athletic scholarships, the pursuit of even a microscopic share of those billions continues to drive the youth sports economy.Disney was among the first to recognize this emerging market, and in 1997 it dived in by creating the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex on the grounds of its Disney World theme park in Orlando, Fla. The 220-acre complex has nine venues \u2014 including a tennis center, outdoor fields, indoor courts and field houses \u2014 and hosts annual events like the Pop Warner football and national cheer and dance championships.Entering the market was a steeper climb, however, for communities like Emerson, in Bartow County, where the youth sports facilities had to be built from scratch \u2014 along with the infrastructure and every other supporting business and service.Peter Olson, the county administrator, recalled the original developers\u2019 offering a succinct pitch for the 1,300 acres here along Interstate 75. \u201cWe\u2019ll build the ocean,\u201d Olson said they told him, \u201cand then the beach will be valuable.\u201dThe county offered the developers a tax abatement for 10 years and financed the Champions Center with $36 million in bonds from its development authority. Since opening in 2014, more than 3 million visitors from all 50 states have come to play here, producing what the county said was an annual economic impact of $97.4 million. Food, bar and hotel revenue in the county, Olson said, was up 80 percent.\u201cWe have some skin in the game,\u201d he said.There also have been some missteps. Building a massive youth sports development is a capital-intensive project, and the original investors ran out of cash after only 100 acres had been developed. In June, a hedge fund based near Los Angeles, Rimrock Capital Management, took the complex into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and, as the major creditor, decided to try to turn its debt into equity.\u201cThey are doubling down,\u201d said Dan Berman, a senior managing director of GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group, the Atlanta-based firm Rimrock brought in to restructure the deal.With more than $100 million already at work, a priority is more hotels and restaurants: Signs marking the future homes of a Holiday Inn Express and a Spring Hill Suites stand alongside the bulldozers creating the roads that will connect them with the sprawling LakePoint complex. Berman said more sports facilities were a certainty, but Rimrock is also exploring more options, like added amusement attractions and a convention center.In the meantime, and with summer over, lacrosse and soccer tournaments and flag football leagues are expected to keep the outdoor fields busy through the spring. The Champions Center is booked through next summer with cheerleading competitions and volleyball, basketball and futsal tournaments.With new youth sports complexes popping up throughout the nation, including two projects in neighboring Alabama, Dean Keener, a senior vice president who helps manage the indoor facilities, said the youth sports industry had become as competitive \u2014 and as potentially lucrative \u2014 as his old profession: He is the former men\u2019s basketball coach at James Madison University.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like college recruiting,\u201d Keener said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to sleep with one eye open.\u201cYou sign someone and you may be on to the next recruiting class, but these complexes continue to go up and you can\u2019t rest on what you\u2019ve done or you\u2019ll be out of business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Deuce\u2019 Season 2, Episode 3 Recap: Wonderland", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe DeuceFor the streetwalkers turned adult-film aspirants in \u201cThe Deuce,\u201d Los Angeles has lingered in the imagination like a Xanadu of sunshine and cocaine, a place where they can make real money without feeding the succubi of pimps and gangsters, and perhaps own a little piece of Hollywood in the process. This idealized image is reinforced by the almost dreamlike scene when Lori arrives at her hotel room, sans C.C., and steps onto a balcony facing the Hollywood Hills, warm breeze blowing through her hair. She has robes on her bed and chocolate on her pillow \u2014 a far cry from the dingy flophouses and makeshift soundstages and commuter tunnels where she\u2019s used to plying her trade. For now, she\u2019s made it.Yet this week\u2019s episode, \u201cSeven-Fifty,\u201d is careful not to buy into the fantasy. In the episode\u2019s most important scene, Candy takes a meeting in Los Angeles with a producer, looking to raise a sizable budget for what will be her solo directorial debut \u2014 an adults-only \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood,\u201d cut into R- and X-rated versions like \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d was the year before. It\u2019s a great pitch, but the producer is confused to learn that Candy doesn\u2019t intend to perform; it\u2019s inconceivable to him that a porn star could retreat behind the camera.He agrees to cut her a check for $10,000, but only if she performs fellatio on him while he does it. She pauses a long while before acquiescing. She needs the money.In that moment, Candy understands that Los Angeles is no different from New York, despite its promise of legitimate representation, higher production values and greater freedoms and opportunities for women. For all her experience on the streets, this transaction is simultaneously the most lucrative and the most degrading of her life. The producer is paying her $10,000 to accept the message that he\u2019s in control, which is the message she implicitly rejected all those years by not allowing pimps to represent her. He has made her an offer she can\u2019t refuse, a dollar amount that\u2019s extravagant for a prostitute \u2014 we had just learned that a new parlor on the Deuce was selling a comparable service for $7.50 \u2014 but just enough to buy her independent soul.That doesn\u2019t mean these men have the last word, however. Keep in mind, \u201cSeven-Fifty\u201d opens with C.C. balking on the Los Angeles trip because he has never been on an airplane and he\u2019s too scared to do it. He\u2019s small potatoes, a joke among local pornographers like Harvey Wasserman, who knows his reputation for shaking down producers for extra cash. His only true hold over Lori now is intimidation and violence, which makes him dangerous but weak. As for Candy, that $10,000 will be a down payment on her freedom, creative and otherwise, if she can parlay it into making the next crossover hit in porn\u2019s \u201cGolden Age.\u201dBack in New York, though, they\u2019ll have to survive a stitched-together economy that\u2019s starting to pop at the seams. The city seems serious about pushing its Times Square Action Plan, starting with initiatives like preventing \u201chot-bedding\u201d (the rental of the same hotel room more than twice in 24 hours), shutting down the parlors and perhaps looking into why the vice squad has been so conspicuously ineffective. Meanwhile, various mob factions are in a dispute over territory, which is making Rudy Pipilo feel less generous toward good earners like Vinnie and Paul, and steeling him for war with a rival family. There\u2019s no word yet about which parlor is on fire at the end of the episode, but odds are it offered basic services at a deep discount.Until the bottom drops out completely, the denizens of \u201cThe Deuce\u201d are more concerned with the day-to-day grind. Alston shrugs off Goldman\u2019s empty talk about urban renewal because the city in front of him is broken. (\u201cWe\u2019re catching dead bodies most of the week, and he\u2019s talking about box office receipts for \u2018Annie\u2019 and \u2018A Chorus Line.\u2019\u201d) Haddix\u2019s days at vice may be numbered, but in the meantime, he\u2019s out there leading fake raids so he can make his shakedown of Vinnie\u2019s club look good. And now Abby\u2019s out on a minibus patrolling the area, looking for sex workers to support. Their lives will all change dramatically soon, but not today.Outtakes:\u2022 The hilarious spectacle of C.C. at the airport parking lot emphasizes how absurd this man of worldly confidence and swagger is once he leaves the few narrow blocks he calls home. Not only has he never flown, the concept of time zones freaks him out. (\u201cWe go back in time?\u201d)\u2022 The news that underage girls are populating the rival parlors instantly calls to mind Jodie Foster as Iris in \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d released the year before this season of \u201cThe Deuce\u201d unfolds.

Hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims have been hauled into re-education camps for weeks or months at a time, often indiscriminately, with no clear idea of when, or if, they\u2019ll get out. The city itself \u201cfeels as if under a siege by an invisible enemy,\u201d with ubiquitous surveillance cameras, metal detectors, checkpoints, police outposts, biometric data collection, and local residents assigned to spy on their neighbors.None of this is evidence of extremism.

{"Headline": "Facebook Accused of Allowing Bias Against Women in Job Ads", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe job seekers, in collaboration with the Communications Workers of America and the American Civil Liberties Union, filed charges with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday against Facebook and nine employers.The employers appear to have used Facebook\u2019s targeting technology to exclude women from the users who received their advertisements, which highlighted openings for jobs like truck driver and window installer. The charges were filed on behalf of any women who searched for a job on Facebook during roughly the past year.Debra Katz, a Washington-based employment lawyer not involved in the case, said the advertising campaigns appeared to violate federal law, which forbids employers and employment agencies like recruiting firms to discriminate on the basis of gender, among other categories. Some state laws also forbid aiding and abetting discrimination.\u201cThat seems pretty egregious,\u201d said Ms. Katz, who specializes in bringing discrimination cases. She said Facebook\u2019s technology made it akin to an employment agency. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re using this tool to facilitate discrimination absolves neither the hiring business nor Facebook.\u201d\u201cThere is no place for discrimination on Facebook; it\u2019s strictly prohibited in our policies,\u201d said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe are reviewing the complaint and look forward to defending our practices.\u201dThe lawyers involved in the case said they discovered the targeting by supervising a group of workers who performed job searches through their Facebook accounts and clicked on a variety of employment ads. For each ad, the job seekers opened a standard Facebook disclosure explaining why they received it. The disclosure for the problematic ads said the users received them because they were men, often between a certain age and in a certain location.For example, the Facebook disclosure for an ad by Nebraska Furniture Mart of Texas seeking staff members to \u201cassemble and prepare merchandise for delivery\u201d said the company wanted to reach men 18 to 50 who lived in or were recently near Fort Worth. The lawyers and their team collected the ads between October 2017 and August 2018.The New York Times contacted three of the employers to inquire about the allegations. Two of them, Renewal by Andersen, which sells and installs windows and doors, and Defenders, which sells and installs home security systems, declined to comment. Nebraska Furniture Mart did not respond.In principle, the companies could have simultaneously aimed similar ads at women, but they do not appear to have done so, according to the lawyers involved. Some conceded that they had directed the ads only at men, and some promised to stop doing so, according to Peter Romer-Friedman, counsel at Outten & Golden, one of the lawyers in the case.LinkedIn and Google also generally allow advertisers to exclude men or women from receiving ads. LinkedIn said in a statement that it would take down job ads that exclude a gender; Google said it would remove ads that discriminated against a protected class but declined to say if it would take down ads like those in the Facebook case. Facebook said that it was still reviewing the ads but that it generally did not take down job ads that exclude a gender.In practice, Facebook, with its more than two billion monthly active users, can be the most important tool for reaching certain types of workers, such as hourly workers, who often do not use other platforms like LinkedIn and sometimes do not even have r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Bobbi Spees, a 35-year-old mother of three from Smethport, Pa., who is one of those bringing the charges, said that she was a part-time job coach for special-education students and that she had sought a better-paying position.Ms. Spees spent several years in her 20s working at a container factory where, she said, the pay was roughly two to three times what she currently makes and her health coverage was impeccable. She said she would like to find a similar job and had used Facebook actively for her search but had difficulty finding leads.By contrast, Ms. Spees said, her husband saw numerous ads for high-paying manual jobs when he was searching online for a job two to three years ago.\u201cIt really came to my attention that I was seeing hardly any jobs offered other than home health and stuff like that,\u201d Ms. Spees said in an interview.In a sense, Ms. Spees was lucky to receive such intelligence from her husband. More often, said Galen Sherwin of the A.C.L.U., her lawyer, \u201cpeople don\u2019t know they\u2019re not seeing an ad.\u201dLawyers for the workers in the case argue that Facebook is an employment agency and therefore liable for the discriminatory targeting because it is an active participant in the recruiting campaign rather than a passive publisher of content like a traditional newspaper with a classified section.Pauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the question was more ambiguous, hinging on the extent to which Facebook uses its algorithms to match an ad with a particular subgroup.\u201cThe more it gets into the use of these algorithms to really start narrowing down the matching, the more it moves toward looking like an employment agency,\u201d Ms. Kim said. But she said that how far a platform like Facebook must move down that path before it is considered an employment agency remains \u201can open question.\u201dTo show culpability, the lawyers in the case point out that Facebook requires advertisers to indicate which gender they want their ads to reach, and that two of the three choices for this category \u2014 male only and female only \u2014 are illegal for employment ads. (Only the third choice, \u201call,\u201d would past muster under federal anti-discrimination law.)Even if Facebook argues successfully that it is not an employment agency, future plaintiffs could bring complaints under state laws, such as California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act, that bar aiding and abetting employment discrimination \u2014 a more liberal standard.Traditionally, Facebook\u2019s strongest defense has been the Communications Decency Act, a federal law that includes a provision shielding internet companies from liability for content generated by third parties.Advertisement"}

The hedge fund has claimed that market manipulation was to blame in that case, but courts never agreed.Higher prices would mean China\u2019s leaders would have to be careful as they seek ways to bolster slowing growth, lest their efforts drive up prices still further. The trade war with the United States could also lead to higher prices for Chinese consumers and companies as tariffs raise the cost of imported goods.Chinese economists say that there is no cause for alarm, and that some price increases may be temporary. But the consumer price index may understate the situation, so expect close scrutiny of prices over the coming weeks.Some investors and employees have said that the approach has stunted growth.

{"Headline": "The New York Times Endorses Andrew Cuomo for Governor in Thursday\u2019s Primary", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "OpinionThe threat of Donald Trump and new pressure from reformers are likely to summon his formidable strengths.Supported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.New York is a big state with small politics. It is home to many of the most ambitious and inventive people in the world, but its governance is stunted by party hacks and special interests, petty rivalries and systemic corruption.The Democratic primaries on Thursday, Sept. 13, provide some ground for hope. The damage being done by the Trump administration has reawakened New Yorkers to the importance of political participation. Recognizing this new spirit, energetic Senate candidates are promising real reform. Candidates for attorney general \u2014 in particular Zephyr Teachout, a national expert on corruption \u2014 are campaigning to clean up Albany and take on the Trump administration, and they\u2019re well positioned to do just that.Unfortunately, the top of the ticket offers less cause for enthusiasm.In his two terms as governor, Andrew Cuomo has had significant accomplishments. But he has done little to combat the corruption in the Legislature and his own administration, and he has allowed the subway system, the foundation of the New York City economy, to rot. The case for change, at a time when so many New Yorkers yearn for change, is not hard to make.Yet the actor and activist Cynthia Nixon was the only Democrat with the guts to take on Mr. Cuomo, his $30 million campaign war chest and his reputation for vindictiveness. She has campaigned on sweeping promises to address New Yorkers\u2019 hunger for health care, housing and a fair criminal justice system.Ms. Nixon\u2019s candidacy has demonstrated the impressive effect of reformist pressure on Mr. Cuomo. When she spoke forcefully about criminal justice reform, he restored voting rights to parolees. When she criticized him for blessing the Independent Democratic Conference \u2014 a group of rogue Democrats who empowered Republican control of the State Senate in exchange for perks and pork \u2014 he made sure the alliance was dismantled.But Ms. Nixon\u2019s lack of experience in government or management of any sort do not inspire confidence that she could overcome the old guard in Albany to fulfill her promises and run the state. Her campaign has, at times, boiled down to a largely negative message \u2014 that she is not Andrew Cuomo \u2014 and while that can indeed seem an appealing truth, it is not, in the end, enough.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]This is not a reason to despair. Strategic and at times bullying in his use of power, driven and maddeningly evasive, deeply schooled in state and federal policy, Mr. Cuomo is, his supporters and critics would agree, a formidable political animal, and he has scented a change in the wind. His legacy is at stake. New statehouse reformers are demanding striking progress on promises long stymied by special interests and Albany deal-making. And Donald Trump is threatening his constituents. These are circumstances that are likely to summon Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strengths, and that is the reason we think he merits one more chance to serve New York and fulfill his potential as governor.When Mr. Cuomo is focused on governing, no New York politician in memory has been as effective. Because of his leadership, New York passed one of the toughest gun control measures in the country, legalized same-sex marriage, raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour and enacted paid family leave. While his tuition-free plan for state colleges remains too narrowly focused to benefit most of the families who need it, it is a step in the right direction.The governor has supported clean energy programs and banned hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking. His handling of Hurricane Sandy \u2014 the kind of crisis that most tests a leader \u2014 was sure and largely efficient. Urged on by his rival Mayor Bill de Blasio, he funded a prekindergarten program that has given thousands of New York children a better start in life.Mr. Cuomo has also overseen the construction of a bridge to replace the decrepit Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson River, pushed to transform Midtown\u2019s James A. Farley Post Office into a grand new train station and led a long-overdue overhaul of La Guardia and Kennedy airports.And he has stood up against President Trump\u2019s assaults on racial minorities, immigrants and other vulnerable groups. We are glad to see him fighting to protect New Yorkers from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan, which sharply reduced the amount of state taxes that can be deducted from federal tax bills. He backed a change to the state tax code to blunt the impact of the federal changes and directed the state to sue the federal government.Yet Mr. Cuomo\u2019s failures threaten to eclipse his record of accomplishments.Day after day, New Yorkers are being tormented below ground, at a cost to the state\u2019s economy of billions of dollars, because of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s inadequate efforts to address the crisis in the subway system. Let there be no doubt, the governor controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. As Mr. Cuomo has said, \u201cIf a governor wanted to step up and be responsible, he or she could be.\u201d It is past time for Mr. Cuomo to step up, to persuade the Legislature to approve congestion pricing as a source of revenue \u2014 despite the mayor\u2019s blinkered opposition \u2014 and to find whatever other funds he needs to turn the system back into one of the glories of New York, if not the wonders of the world.One reason the governor has been able to build up a campaign treasury large enough to repel potential competition is that he has raised funds through the \u201cL.L.C. loophole\u201d that he pledged to end years ago. This loophole allows businesses called limited liability companies to flout limits on corporate donations.Four years ago, because Mr. Cuomo had failed to deliver promised ethics reform and because he faced a more prepared opponent in Ms. Teachout, we did not endorse any candidate in the Democratic primary for governor. This year, his ethics record remains a black mark, but circumstances have changed.If the State Senate shifts to Democratic control, as now seems possible, Mr. Cuomo will be in a position to push through reforms he has failed to deliver in the past. First among these should be changes to make it easier for New Yorkers to vote, including by mail-in ballot, and to run for office. Though it may be hard to persuade even Democrats in Albany to support genuine campaign finance reform, the L.L.C. loophole is so egregious, and Mr. Cuomo so relentless when he sets his mind to something, that we expect him to close it at last.Mr. Cuomo is flawed. When he allows petty enmity and political grievance to distract him from his commitment to public service, he is his own worst enemy. But when he confronts a real problem and gets down to work, he is a very capable governor.Yet he can\u2019t \u2014 he won\u2019t \u2014 do it alone. Voters need to show up at the polls on Thursday, Sept. 13, in large numbers and, wherever possible, support reform-minded candidates who will hold Mr. Cuomo to his promises and take on Democrats beholden to corporate interests. Those voters will need to return to the polls in November.That is how New York can finally get the government, and governor, it deserves, and how it can become the model of humane and honest public service that all America needs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Reliving Wall Street\u2019s Near-Death Experience", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTen years ago today, the C.E.O.s of Wall Street\u2019s banks were huddled at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a mad scramble to save the financial industry and the economy. They were playing out arguably the most consequential period in modern economic history.We\u2019ve spent the last decade debating the crisis. Could Lehman Brothers have been saved? Were bank bailouts the best way to protect Wall Street? Could the government have helped ordinary individuals more directly? Did the response widen inequality? Did the crisis create today\u2019s populist politics? And, perhaps most important, are we any safer today?My colleagues and I have put together a brief recap of key moments of the crisis, from that meeting at the Fed to the government\u2019s rescue of Wall Street. At the end, I\u2019ll be back with a little analysis and some highlights from an interview I conducted yesterday in Washington with Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner, who all played instrumental roles during the turmoil.For many of us, it is painful to relive those moments. But they are instructive if we hope to avoid another crisis.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinThat day, Dick Fuld, Lehman\u2019s C.E.O., seemed hopeful. He told Ken Lewis, his counterpart at Bank of America:\u201cYou and I both know we\u2019re doing this deal.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send us a message!\u201dA little after 4 p.m., the heads of Wall Street\u2019s top banks were told to attend the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by 6 p.m. There, Mr. Paulson told the executives:\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be government money. You\u2019re going to have to figure this out.\u201d\u201cI am not here to sell Merrill Lynch,\u201d Mr. Thain said. Mr. Lewis responded, \u201cWell, that is what I want.\u201dAfter a long day at the New York Fed, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase retired to his bank\u2019s executive dining room, where he told staff that disaster loomed:\u201cSo you might as well enjoy the champagne and caviar!\u201d\u201cHow many of you would kick in $1 billion \u2014 I don\u2019t care what form it takes \u2014 to stop Lehman from going down?\u201dOne by one, they raised their hands. Lehman executives rejoiced. But by 11 a.m., British regulators had quashed the idea of a Barclays-led deal without government assistance. Mr. Paulson told colleagues that his British counterpart didn\u2019t want to \u201cimport our cancer,\u201d and urged Mr. Thain to hurry up and save Merrill:\u201cIf you don\u2019t find a buyer by this weekend, heaven help you and heaven help our country.\u201dLate that afternoon, Bank of America cut a $50 billion deal to buy Merrill. By 10 p.m., it was approved. At close to midnight, Lehman\u2019s board voted to file for bankruptcy. Mr. Fuld told the room:\u201cWell, I guess this is goodbye.\u201dRead more:\u201cIf they default, you\u2019ll see default probabilities explode on all financial firms.\u201d\u201cI slammed the phone more than a few times on discussing A.I.G. I understand why the American people are angry.\u201d\u201cOne by one, all of my safe havens aren\u2019t so safe anymore, and that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201dThe chaos typified by Lehman\u2019s collapse spread far beyond America\u2019s shores. Here were some of the biggest impacts around the world:What saved America\u2019s financial system in 2008? A government bailout of big banks \u2014 using $700 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP \u2014 was key. But the authorities had to deploy several bazookas.\u201cThis is a huge cow patty with a piece of marshmallow stuck in the middle of it, and I am not going to eat that cow patty.\u201dLawmakers disliked the bill because it gave the executive branch sweeping authority. In his autobiography, Mr. Geithner was unapologetic:\u201cWe don\u2019t expect Congress to micromanage battle plans during wars, and I felt the same way about financial wars.\u201dThe bill finally passed on Oct. 3, with tax breaks and other provisions added. But markets continued to crater. The government had to put TARP funds to use with maximum impact, and quickly.Should the government have required more from the banks? That\u2019s still debated. Tony Fratto, a press officer in the White House at the time, said in an interview this week:\u201cIt was like coming up with the design for a plane as you fly it, and then flying that plane in stormy conditions.\u201d\u201cI care about Wall Street for one reason and one reason only \u2014 because what happens on Wall Street matters to Main Street.\u201dThe worst financial crisis in 80 years had its roots in low interest rates, lax oversight and complacency on Wall Street. Debt issuance and risk-taking had surged. Wall Street gobbled up loans from risky borrowers and repackaged them into complex financial products, inflating one of history\u2019s largest credit bubbles.The Fed rode to Bear\u2019s rescue anyway, fearing that the collapse of a major investment bank would cause panic in the markets and wreak havoc with the wider economy. Fed officials knew that they were doing a bad thing, but believed that the alternative would be even worse.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a bazooka, and people know you\u2019ve got it, you may not have to take it out.\u201d\u201cThis turmoil would directly and negatively impact household wealth: from family budgets, to home values, to savings for college and retirement. A failure would affect the ability of Americans to get home loans, auto loans and other consumer credit and business finance. And a failure would be harmful to economic growth and job creation.\u201dFannie and Freddie remain under government control.Read more:The tactics the men chose can be second-guessed, but the result of their efforts speaks for itself. The expansion has lasted nine years, the second longest on record. Although job gains were disappointingly slow for years, the unemployment rate is now 3.9 percent, among the lowest in decades.And then:The response to the crisis was in many ways the high-water mark for a mold of centrist, technocratic policymaking that seeks to tweak and nudge existing institutions toward better outcomes. It also undermined any widespread popular support for that mode of governing for the foreseeable future.When I spoke to Mr. Paulson, Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Geithner yesterday at a symposium in Washington, they said the one thing they wished they had done better was communicating their strategy to the public.\u201cIt was very hard to explain that we had go to the source to stop the bleeding. Otherwise it was going to kill the economy,\u201d Mr. Paulson told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard case to make, and we were unable to make it.\u201dMr. Geithner recounted conversations with his wife. \u201cThe hardest thing was sitting at the table with my wife in the morning with her reading about what I was doing, and just seeing on her face the mix of despair and doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe she felt that we were ethical people trying to do the right thing, but she looked at what we did and said \u2018Really?\u2019 \u201dThe big question that remains is: Are we any safer today? I would say yes, for now. But as Mr. Geithner told me yesterday, the job of preventing the next crisis is \u201ca forever war.\u201d\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinRead more:Thanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Trump Loosens Secretive Restraints on Ordering Cyberattacks", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has authorized new, classified orders for the Pentagon\u2019s cyberwarriors to conduct offensive attacks against adversaries more freely and frequently, the White House said on Thursday, wiping away Obama-era restrictions that his advisers viewed as too slow and cumbersome.\u201cOur hands are not as tied as they were in the Obama administration,\u201d John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, told reporters in announcing a new cyberstrategy.The order essentially delegates more power to Gen. Paul M. Nakasone, who took over this year as the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command. During his Senate confirmation hearing in March, General Nakasone complained that America\u2019s online adversaries attacked with little concern about retaliation.\u201cI would say right now they do not think that much will happen to them,\u201d said General Nakasone, who previously oversaw the Army\u2019s cybercommand. \u201cThey don\u2019t fear us.\u201dBut this month, General Nakasone said he was more comfortable with the new guidance issued by the White House, even though the administration has not made any of it public.Senior officials have said it eliminates a lengthy process of consensus-building across the government \u2014 the Departments of Commerce, Treasury and Homeland Security among them \u2014 before the United States conducts an offensive action.It is not clear whether Mr. Trump must still approve every major offensive online operation, as Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama did.Mr. Bolton did not shed much light. \u201cOur presidential directive effectively reversed those restraints, effectively enabling offensive cyberoperations through the relevant departments,\u201d he said.He said that since Mr. Trump took office, the administration has \u201cauthorized cyberoperations\u201d against rivals, though he gave no details.Much of the strategy that was made public on Thursday strongly echoes similar documents issued by Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush. They focus on improving digital defenses for the United States government, bettering training, working with private industry to share information about vulnerabilities and working with allies.While the words in the strategy differ from the past, the impetus is the same. It did, however, identify specific countries as adversaries.\u201cRussia, Iran and North Korea conducted reckless cyberattacks that harmed American and international businesses and our allies and partners without paying costs likely to deter future cyberaggression,\u201d the strategy read. \u201cChina engaged in cyberenabled economic espionage and trillions of dollars of intellectual property theft.\u201dBut the classified directive appears to be significantly different, as Mr. Bolton said on Thursday.His indictment of the previous administration omitted the fact that Mr. Obama continued or initiated three of the most aggressive cyberoperations in American history: one to disable Iran\u2019s nuclear fuel production, another to attack North Korea\u2019s missile programs and a third against online recruitment and communications by the Islamic State.The first, code-named Olympic Games, was judged successful at destroying about 1,000 nuclear centrifuges for a year. The Korea operation had only mixed results at best, and Mr. Obama\u2019s own defense secretary later wrote that the operation against the Islamic State proved largely ineffective.Mr. Bolton became the first American official to formally acknowledge what was widely known: that the Chinese government was behind that intrusion.But Mr. Bolton, whose concepts of deterrence were formed in the Cold War, is likely to discover what his predecessors learned: Almost every strategy that worked in deterring nuclear attacks does not fit the digital era, and even figuring out where an attack originated can be a challenge.The government has grown more skilled at attributing the source of a cyberattack, but the process remains lengthy. By the time a conclusion is reached, it is often too late to mount a successful counterstrike.Mr. Trump has particularly muddied the waters in assigning blame for attacks, repeatedly expressing doubts that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. The Justice Department has indicted officers of Russia\u2019s military intelligence unit, once known as the G.R.U., and the Internet Research Agency, in those attacks.Part of the strategy calls for the United States to develop what it describes as an international cyberdeterrence initiative, which sounds similar to efforts to develop a theory of nuclear deterrence. The document provides few details, but says the Trump administration will build \u201ca coalition and develop tailored strategies to ensure adversaries understand the consequences of their malicious cyberbehavior.\u201dSome of those efforts have already begun: The American accusations against North Korea and Russia last year were immediately echoed by Britain and other Western powers.Representative Jim Langevin, Democrat of Rhode Island who has been active in developing new cyberstrategies, said that the White House approach was focused \u201cin starkly offensive terms.\u201d\u201cI agree that our adversaries need to know that we can \u2014 and will \u2014 challenge them in cyberspace,\u201d Mr. Langevin said. \u201cBut as the country with the most innovative economy in the world, we must also acknowledge the abiding interest of the United States in encouraging stability in this domain.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Red Carpet Hasn\u2019t Changed. Don\u2019t Blame the Stars. They\u2019re Just Working.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a few fleeting moments earlier this year, it seemed as if the red carpet had magically changed course.With awards season approaching, stylists are at fashion weeks, scoping out looks for their clients, readying them to be at their best for months of parading down scads of red carpets. Harvey Weinstein may be banished, but the awards campaign machine he helped create grinds on. Now, a year into #MeToo, and after the emboldened feminist statements made by actresses at the last Golden Globes and in Cannes, has the marketing machinery of the red carpet changed at all?The early answer is no. With an asterisk.The red carpet, of course, has a not-so-secret double life as a klieg-lighted walking advertisement for lavish brands. Many actresses and actors on the carpet get paid to wear gowns, watches and jewels, and can pocket anywhere from an estimated $5,000 to more than $100,000 for their efforts.But recent high-profile red carpets at the Venice and Toronto film festivals and at the Emmys felt like a return to the same old, with actresses swathed in such familiar couture names as Armani Priv\u00e9, Valentino and Givenchy. At the Emmys, Dakota Fanning was resplendent in a green Dior gown and plum-size emeralds, reportedly weighing 175 carats, from Lorraine Schwartz.\u201cThe whole seriousness of #MeToo \u2014 and certainly Ask Her More \u2014 is somewhat compromised by these women trooping out in jewels which often match their movie salaries,\u201d said Bronwyn Cosgrave, a fashion historian who has contributed to red carpet coverage by The New York Times. \u201cBut it\u2019s too much of a booming economy to have #MeToo jeopardize it.\u201dSeveral Hollywood stylists noted that there had been a shift on the red carpet since #MeToo. Their female clients felt more like a tribe, they said, united in common cause. More people were requesting female collaborators and minority designers. And they said that women should not have to account for or defend their sartorial choices, whether or not they\u2019re paid to make them.\u201cThe relationships between designers and actresses is more like a happy marriage and less like an arranged one,\u201d said Erica Cloud, who has styled Mandy Moore, Lake Bell and Sophia Bush, in an email. The sentiment was echoed by Leith Clark, who is Keira Knightley\u2019s personal stylist as well as style director-at-large for Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK.\u201cI don\u2019t think anything an actor chooses to wear counters Me Too,\u201d Ms. Clark wrote in a text message. \u201cIt\u2019s their choice. I don\u2019t think this movement is in any way about setting further rules or restrictions for women.\u201dAs for the money stream from endorsement deals, Arianne Phillips, the costume designer and longtime stylist to Madonna, said that celebrities aligned with various charities or causes should trumpet them, and donate the money accordingly.\u201cWe can use that revenue stream in positive ways,\u201d Ms. Phillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s a missed opportunity not to.\u201dWhile the marketing machine marches on, some insiders said that the red carpet has seen a tonal shift. Four years ago, interviewers were urged to ask actresses about more than their dresses. These days, not asking about sexual harassment or gender equity is the rarity rather than the norm.Perhaps unsurprisingly, several stylists saw nothing wrong with asking someone about who designed her dress, so long as the queries did not end there \u2014 especially since, as Ms. Clark said, \u201cclothes can serve as armor, and a vessel of strength, confidence and grace.\u201d Ms. Cloud said that designers like Christian Siriano, who dresses women of all sizes, ages and ethnicities, should be celebrated and, she added, \u201cbecome the norm.\u201dThe structural inequities in Hollywood have nothing to do with what people happened to put on for a premiere or an awards show, Ms. Welch said.\u201cIt\u2019s about your contract, negotiating for an inclusion rider, making sure the female star gets paid as much as the male star, making sure that executives and all the studios give more,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the work is done. The red carpet is the last thing about it.\u201dA question that still hangs about is whether people will ever again opt to put their clients in Marchesa, the label run by Georgina Chapman, Harvey Weinstein\u2019s former wife. Ms. Welch said that while she would not rule out the possibility, the question annoyed her nonetheless.\u201cIt\u2019s another example of blaming a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cAgain the woman is suffering for the toxicity of the man.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Terms to Reopen Nuclear Talks? Trump Has to Back Down", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Hassan Rouhani of Iran, visiting the United States for the first time since President Trump exited the 2015 Iran nuclear accord, said Monday that the only way his country would consider new talks with Washington is for Mr. Trump to reverse himself and honor the agreement.Speaking to a group of two dozen academics, former government officials and journalists, Mr. Rouhani argued that going back \u201csix months ago is much easier than going back six years,\u201d when the first efforts to negotiate an agreement were broached.While he declared that Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy of trying to crush the Iranian economy with sanctions would fail, he expressed no anger and portrayed his government as the one that was abiding by international agreements that the United States had tossed aside.But when pressed on how long Iran planned to play a military role in Syria, Mr. Rouhani was unrelenting. \u201cWe will be in Syria until terrorism is completely eradicated,\u201d he said, and as long as Iran remained invited there by the Syrian government.\u201cThe U.S. sees a right for itself to have a presence in the region,\u201d he said, referring to the Middle East. But it \u201cdoes not recognize the right for Iran.\u201dOn Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he had \u201cno plans\u201d to meet with Mr. Rouhani.Despite his relentless optimism in his appearances on Monday, Mr. Rouhani arrives at a perilous moment for his government. As sanctions have begun to bite, the Iranian economy is once again under tremendous pressure, its currency plummeting, its oil sales jeopardized. His enemies in the Revolutionary Guard Corps, the elite military unit that also oversaw the nuclear program, have been in the ascent, arguing that the United States was an untrustworthy negotiating partner, and that Mr. Rouhani was na\u00efve to have entered the agreement.On Monday evening, Mr. Rouhani got a boost from the remaining signatories of the Iran nuclear accord. They issued a defiant statement, reaffirming their commitment to the deal and vowing to find ways to circumvent Trump administration sanctions to continue to do business with Iran.\u201cThe participants recognized that Iran has continued to fully and effectively implement its nuclear related commitments as confirmed by 12 consecutive reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency,\u201d said the statement, which was signed by the foreign ministers of France, Germany, Britain, China, Russia and Iran.The statement was read first in English by Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief, and then in Persian by Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly gathering of world leaders in New York.As part of their effort to save the Iran deal, the ministers agreed to create a special vehicle that would facilitate legal financial transactions with Iran and protect companies doing business with the country from American reprisals. Exactly how the vehicle will function will be worked out in future meetings, the statement said.In his session Monday evening, Mr. Rouhani deflected questions about Iran\u2019s repression of dissent, its imprisonment of Americans and other Westerners on thin charges of plotting against his government and its support of terrorism.Instead, he noted divisions inside the Trump administration, saying he did not know whether to believe Mr. Trump, who before his tweet had said he would meet with Mr. Rouhani at any time, or Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has laid out a list of conditions from ceasing missile tests to stopping support of terrorism.But Mr. Rouhani, sitting beside Mr. Zarif, his foreign minister and chief negotiator on the nuclear deal, insisted he had \u201cno regrets\u201d about striking the deal with the Obama administration three years ago. He described it as an accord that briefly \u201cbuilt trust,\u201d and described Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to dismantle it as self-destructive. Picking a single example, he said that cutting off sales of airplane parts \u201cdidn\u2019t help Boeing,\u201d endangered Iranian air passengers and ultimately harmed the United States.He argued that Iran did not exit the Iran deal after the United States did, saying that he did not want to play into Mr. Trump\u2019s designs.\u201cWe have a great deal of patience,\u201d he said, seeming to suggest that he would wait out the Trump administration. But he said Iran could exit the deal \u201cat will\u201d if it determined it was in its interests.But Mr. Rouhani, on his first day in New York for the annual opening of the General Assembly, went on a public relations blitz, speaking for hours to editors and reporters, appearing on NBC\u2019s evening news, and talking optimistically about future dealings with Europe, China and Russia. He dismissed the effects of new American sanctions scheduled for November, when the United States plans to tell companies around the world that if they want to deal with Iran, they cannot do business with the United States.\u201cThe United States is not capable of bringing our oil exports to zero,\u201d Mr. Rouhani told Lester Holt of NBC. \u201cIt\u2019s a threat that is empty of credibility. Perhaps on this path, we will sustain certain pressures but certainly the United States will not reach its objective.\u201dMichael Schwirtz contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Your Culture \u2018Tight\u2019 or \u2018Loose\u2019? The Answer Could Explain Everything", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.There is a longstanding debate among social scientists about what ultimately drives human behavior. Do ideals, symbols and beliefs lead people to act as they do? Or are the wellsprings of action and the drivers of history less ethereal: money, fear, the thirst for power, circumstance and opportunity, with culture as an afterthought?Scholars in the first camp are culturalists; in the second, materialists. And the disagreement between them is not merely academic. It spills over into heated policy debates about crime, poverty, immigration, economic development and everything in between.In \u201cRule Makers, Rule Breakers,\u201d the psychologist Michele Gelfand sides with the culturalists. \u201cCulture is a stubborn mystery of our experience and one of the last uncharted frontiers,\u201d she writes. Her aim isn\u2019t to guide readers through all the complex elements that make up a culture, but to draw attention to one aspect she believes has been ignored: the social norms \u2014 or the often informal rules of conduct, the dos and don\u2019ts, the sources of tsking and raised eyebrows \u2014 that emerge whenever people band together.According to Gelfand, cultures can be located along a continuum from \u201ctight\u201d to \u201cloose\u201d depending on the strictness of these rules. \u201cTight cultures,\u201d she observes, \u201chave strong social norms and little tolerance for deviance, while loose cultures have weak social norms and are highly permissive.\u201d Think of the difference between a gathering for buttoned-up middle-aged churchgoers and a party for 20-somethings in Bushwick, Brooklyn.Gelfand\u2019s thesis is that mapping the tightness or looseness of the cultures of various groups \u2014 nations, regions, social classes, companies, friendship circles \u2014 helps explain things that might otherwise be puzzling. After discussing the dynamics of social norms she goes broad, using the tight-loose distinction to analyze authoritarianism, populism, terrorism, inequality, political polarization, the world of business, even the happiness of individuals.Take authoritarianism: Why did Egyptians vote overwhelmingly for Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in that country\u2019s 2014 presidential election, choosing to be led by an autocrat just a few years after the democratic hopefulness of the Arab Spring?Gelfand argues that whatever a country\u2019s baseline level of constraint (Egypt\u2019s religious conservatism would put it near the tight end of the spectrum), it can adjust in response to shifting conditions. Perceived threats, including social instability, produce tightening. So it was in Egypt, she claims. The ouster of Hosni Mubarak and the political chaos that ensued sent Egypt\u2019s society into a tailspin, leaving voters yearning for a strongman who could assert control and bring back order.Although Gelfand can occasionally come across as too much of a salesperson for her big idea, she\u2019s generally an engaging writer with real intellectual range. She sparkles most when diving into evolutionary anthropology to make sense of long-term patterns in cultural tightness and looseness. Humans have evolved to be strikingly sensitive to norms, which provide a major evolutionary advantage as a way of facilitating cooperation. The evidence Gelfand reviews suggests that tighter cultures tend to form in the face of ecological challenges, high population density and threats from other groups. This is interesting stuff.The problem is that \u2014 in spite of the context she provides for how norms developed in the first place \u2014 Gelfand routinely ignores materialist explanations for the various phenomena she considers. Sure, would-be strongmen can and do exploit voters\u2019 fears of instability and change. But another crucial element in explaining why Sisi, Egypt\u2019s former minister of defense, won 96 percent of the vote is that the military, determined to maintain its grip on the country and to keep billions of dollars in foreign aid flowing, banned the main opposition, the Muslim Brotherhood, after deposing Mohamed Morsi, the inept but democratically-elected Islamist president who followed Mubarak in office.Other examples are even more glaring, as when Gelfand accounts for limited upward mobility in the United States by pointing to the ostensibly tight culture of the working class, incapable of the flexibility needed to find a place in the new economy. She writes as though the hoarding of resources and opportunities by the wealthy was not a huge part of the story.Neil Gross is a professor of sociology at Colby College.Advertisement"}

His marriage was also falling apart. (He and his wife eventually divorced.) He decided to volunteer at a homeless shelter in Northwest Washington. A Vietnam veteran who was staying there encouraged him to go to church, and Volz started attending services, trying different congregations. After more than a year, he was hired as a case manager at the shelter, and then as its director. \u201cI loved the whole second-chance culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe accountability, the \u2018We\u2019re in this together.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn 2008, Volz agreed to spend a few months fixing up a condominium in Fort Myers, Fla., that his parents inherited, so the family could sell it. He didn\u2019t know anyone in town. He met a woman, fell in love and decided to stay in Fort Myers, cleaning pools and restaurants at night. He and his girlfriend married and joined a nondenominational church, where Volz ended up taking a job as outreach director. He went on to run a recovery center and to lead the county homeless coalition.In 2015, Volz happened on a meeting at Florida Gulf Coast University, where a small group of students and community activists were listening to an African-American law-school graduate named Desmond Meade. He was talking about his yearslong crusade to restore voting rights to people who had committed felonies, as he had. The issue affected Volz, who knew he was barred from voting, as is automatically the case in Florida for anyone with a felony conviction. Meade was president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an organization founded by the Florida A.C.L.U. for former felons, or, as he and others prefer to call themselves, \u201creturning citizens.\u201d Meade was in the midst of trying to collect the 766,200 signatures required to place an initiative on the ballot to amend Florida\u2019s Constitution, which denies former felons the right to vote. Volz stayed after the meeting to talk to Meade. \u201cWe chatted for a long time, and by the end, I wanted to help,\u201d he said.Volz, who is 47, has a reddish-brown beard and still roots for the Ohio State Buckeyes. He said he was nervous about taking the job and especially about talking to me when we met in June at a coffee shop near his home in Fort Myers. Several years ago, he participated in a documentary about Abramoff and self-published a memoir, and the media mostly mocked him as a man desperate to eat again in Washington steakhouses. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get back in the game,\u201d he said of returning to politics. At the same time, he remains an informed Republican \u2014 he wasn\u2019t a Trump supporter, but he was precise and analytical when talking about Trump\u2019s appeal \u2014 and he said he found it satisfying, if surreal, to put what he learned in Washington at the service of the second-chances movement.To its supporters, Amendment 4 represents a potential civil rights triumph: It could enfranchise more people at once than any single initiative since women\u2019s suffrage. Amendment 4 could also change the Florida electorate. White people represent a majority of the state\u2019s former felons. At the same time, black people are disproportionately affected by the current ban. More than one in five black voters can\u2019t vote in Florida, compared with about one in 10 voters in the state\u2019s general population (and one in 40 nationwide). Florida is one of the country\u2019s truly purple states, with a recent history of squeaker elections for governor, Congress and other offices. In three of the last five presidential contests, Florida went to a candidate who won the state by a margin of 1.2 percent or less. This year, polls show tossup races for governor (the Republican Ron DeSantis running against the Democrat Andrew Gillum) and senator (the Republican Rick Scott against the Democrat Bill Nelson). Five of the state\u2019s congressional seats are also in play.I asked Volz if he thought he might be hurting the Republican Party if Amendment 4 had a shot at turning Florida from purple to blue. He said he didn\u2019t think it would happen. But if it did, I asked, would its passage undermine his conservative policy goals? \u201cYou have to cross a line,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you believe that it\u2019s better that more people vote, or not? I crossed that line long ago.\u201d[Read about how there\u2019s a good chance we simply won\u2019t know if someone has altered the digital votes in the next election.] Weeks after the case was filed, Florida brought the contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore to a halt with one of the most disputed vote counts in the country\u2019s history. After Bush was declared the winner by 537 votes, it came to light that before the election, just over 12,000 people had been wrongly eliminated from the voting rolls, many of them because they were misidentified as former felons. Though African-Americans made up about 11 percent of registered voters in the state, they accounted for a reported 44 percent of the people who were purged. Given the strong support of black voters for Democrats in Florida, if they had remained on the rolls, the election might have been decided differently.In the last few years, other researchers have challenged Uggen and Manza\u2019s assumptions about partisan effect and turnout. \u201cRe-enfranchisement might not produce big electoral effects,\u201d Traci Burch, a political scientist at Northwestern University, told me. \u201cCohorts released many years ago\u201d \u2014 people she thinks are more likely to support Republicans \u2014 \u201cmight be more likely to vote than people who finished their sentences more recently.\u201dNorris Henderson was convicted of murder in 1977 and spent 27 years in prison before being released on probation. Since then, he has worked for voting rights in Louisiana, his home state, registering former felons, who can vote when their sentences have been completed. \u201cWhen folks get to the box for picking a party, most of them choose to be independent,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cBecause in our state, like a lot of places, felon disenfranchisement was bipartisan. Both y\u2019all parties done this. Folks assume this is a population that\u2019s indebted to Democrats. That\u2019s far from the truth.\u201d Uggen, who has interviewed former felons in Oregon, has reached a similar conclusion. But he still thinks that they could tip the balance toward Democrats in a closely contested election in Florida.At 51, Meade has a clean-shaven head and a short salt-and-pepper beard. He was born in St. Croix and moved to Miami with his parents when he was 5. His mother worked as a waitress, and his father was a mechanic. His family was stable and neither well off nor poor, he said, and he remembers his upbringing as \u201ctypical\u201d \u2014 he played football and wrestled, but not seriously, and after graduating from high school in 1985, he went into the Army. He worked on helicopters as a mechanic, hoping to become a pilot. But Meade\u2019s eyesight wasn\u2019t sharp enough, and in his early 20s, he found his ambitions stymied. Around that time, while he was stationed on a military base in Hawaii, a friend introduced him to cocaine.Meade soon developed a drug habit and started stealing to support it. After being caught stealing liquor and electronics on the base, he was dishonorably discharged and given a three-year sentence in a military brig, which he served in Kansas. After his release in 1993, Meade went back to Florida and started working as a celebrity body guard, a job that led him back to cocaine. He was devastated by the death of his mother in 1996, followed by a bank foreclosure on the home he grew up in. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really dove deeper into drugs,\u201d he said. He was convicted of aggravated battery, a felony, after a fight with his brother and his brother\u2019s friend.Meade went to jail for felony cocaine possession multiple times over the next handful of years. In 2001, he was convicted of possession of a firearm as a felon. He was sentenced to 15 years but got out in 2004 when his conviction was reversed on appeal because of a problem with the jury selection. Meade returned to cocaine and to living on the streets.Speaking at the benefit in Pensacola, Meade began his story here, at his lowest point. \u201cIn August of 2005, I found myself standing in front of railroad tracks in South Florida,\u201d he told his audience. \u201cAs I stood there that day, I was a broken man.\u201d Meade paused. \u201cBut there was a power greater than me that did not allow that train to come that day,\u201d he said. \u201cI crossed those tracks, and I walked a couple blocks further, and I checked myself into drug treatment.\u201dMeade got clean over the course of the four-month program and found a spot at a homeless shelter. While living there, he enrolled at Miami-Dade College, paying with Pell grants and student loans. He tried to take full advantage of the school, visiting his professors during their office hours, asking them to read and comment on his papers and rewriting them. He graduated summa cum laude in 2010. In 2011, he enrolled in law school at Florida International University, graduating three years later. But the Florida Bar won\u2019t allow him to sit for the bar exam until the state restores his rights.Meade first applied for clemency to be able to vote in 2006, before Charlie Crist streamlined the clemency process. In 2011, he was told he had to wait five more years, and he still can\u2019t vote. Meade became the unpaid head of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. At first, the project often felt like a one-man operation. He put 50,000 miles a year on his car to travel the state and give talks at churches, universities, community events, picnics \u2014 anywhere he could gather an audience to hear his message. Struggling to raise money, he spent part of his student loans on fruitless fund-raising trips to New York and Washington. In 2012, he started working for the Live Free Campaign, which addresses gun violence and mass incarceration, while continuing to do the voting rights work. He married a woman that year whom he met doing voting outreach; they\u2019re raising her five children, who are between the ages of 12 and 21. Meade says that when he started the drive for Amendment 4 in 2015, his mother-in-law sorted the petitions, and his children counted the names.In fall 2017, several months after the Florida Supreme Court unanimously approved the proposed language of the ballot initiative for clarity, the Florida A.C.L.U. (whose director, Howard Simon, has been working on voting rights since he marched in Selma in 1965) put $1.6 million into hiring people to help collect and sort signatures, eventually contributing a total of $5 million to support the initiative. Other major donors came on board, beginning with the Open Philanthropy Action Fund, based in California and started by a group including the Facebook founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna. Meade began drawing a paycheck from the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition for the first time last year.Before his speech in Pensacola, Meade spent time with a small group of the local leaders of Movement for Change. One of them wondered if Hillary Clinton would have won Florida if turnout had been higher in black communities like the one in Pensacola. Meade offered a general theory about turnout. One reason people who can vote don\u2019t do so, whether they realize it or not, is that they\u2019re closely related to someone who can\u2019t vote, he proposed. \u201cBack in the day, when Dad went to vote, he took the whole family with him, and voting was part of the conversation at the dinner table.\u201d But, Meade continued, \u201cwhen you strip Mama and Daddy of the right to vote, you kill that conversation. So what we think is happening now is, a person like me who can\u2019t vote, you come to me talking about going out to vote, it\u2019s like you slapping me in my face, reminding me I\u2019m not part of society. So to mask that pain, \u2019cause I don\u2019t want to tell you I\u2019m a felon, I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Man, your vote don\u2019t count.\u2019\u2009\u201d In other words, former felons may discourage turnout among those around them by covering their hurt with indifference.The crowd erupted in applause. Meade had a seven-hour drive back to Orlando, but he stayed until all the people lined up to shake his hand and take a photo with him were satisfied. When he returned to his home in a tidy gated community near Universal Studios, the dawn was breaking.The majority-white low-income neighborhood, which voted for Trump in 2016, sits between two branches of the interstate and feels rural, with few sidewalks, lots of trees and the occasional pickup truck parked on the lawn. The group of canvassers approached a gray-haired woman as she came out of her ranch house, where an American flag hung from the front porch, to check the mailbox at the end of her driveway. One canvasser, Tammie Schafer, asked the woman if she remembered signing the Amendment 4 petition, explaining that it would restore the vote to former felons if it passed. The woman said that her next-door neighbor hadn\u2019t been able to vote for the last 30 years. \u201cFor something she did when she was 19 years old. That makes no sense. She did her time. She made a mistake. Move on. Give them a chance to vote!\u201dSchafer, who is petite and has short blond-streaked hair, started volunteering for the campaign after she saw a Facebook post by Volz, whom she knew through homeless-outreach work. Now 40, she was convicted 15 years ago of possession of Xanax without a prescription, a felony. In 2006, a couple of months after she gave birth to her daughter, she was sent to jail for violating her probation by testing positive for marijuana, which she says she used to relieve back pain and anxiety. She had to leave her newborn baby with her mother. \u201cThree months in, my mother sent me a picture of her, and I didn\u2019t recognize her,\u201d she said. \u201cI was heartbroken.\u201d After that, she never went back to jail.Schafer rarely voted before her conviction. But two years ago, she got interested in an initiative on the Florida ballot to expand access to medical marijuana. \u201cIf I could have voted for my medicine, that would have been tremendous for me,\u201d she said. The initiative passed, and she got permission to use the marijuana that had landed her in jail.At one house in Palmona Park, Schafer and her group knocked on a door with a sticker that read \u201cMy Dog Is a Republican.\u201d The older man who answered wore an undershirt, shorts and knee-high compression stockings. Once he understood the canvassers\u2019 pitch, he put up a hand to stop them from talking. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go to jail, you lose all your rights. You kill someone, you don\u2019t ever get them back.\u201dSchafer told him that Amendment 4 wouldn\u2019t give the vote to people convicted of murder or sex offenses. \u201cThis is for people like me,\u201d she said, looking the man in the eye. \u201cI never did anything violent. I just want a second chance.\u201d The man shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll work up to the murderers next. You\u2019ll see.\u201d He turned to go inside but first aimed one more retort at Schafer: \u201cYou don\u2019t need second chances.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve turned a corner,\u201d says Jon Liss, who has worked on the issue for more than a decade as co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, a civic-engagement organization. He wonders if the opioid epidemic has affected the way people think about the issue. \u201cWe have large numbers of white working people incarcerated now in Virginia. If you\u2019re a white rural legislator, a lot of your constituents can\u2019t vote.\u201dOne researcher has data, not yet published, that could help explain it. Victoria Shineman, a political scientist at the University of Pittsburgh, did a study with 150 former felons in Ohio and Virginia. Some of them received help getting back their voting rights and registering to vote, and afterward, that group was more likely to say they trusted the government and the justice system. \u201cThe results suggest that reversing disenfranchisement causes citizens to increase their pro-democratic attitudes and behaviors \u2014 all of which are predictors of reduced recidivism,\u201d Shineman wrote.Meade and Volz would like the expansion of the franchise to be a key pillar of the platform of both parties. That\u2019s an idealistic notion, at odds with current Republican strategy and the intensely polarized national landscape. If Amendment 4 passes, however, it will be possible to argue that democracy for democracy\u2019s sake is good politics.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the affiliation of Neil Volz. He is the political director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, not the Amendment 4 campaign.An earlier version of this article included an erroneous description of Amendment 4, a Florida referendum to restore former felons\u2019 voting rights. If the amendment becomes law, it is not the case that it would allow former felons to serve on juries and run for public office.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe Gets One Step Closer to Becoming Japan\u2019s Longest-Serving Premier", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe won a commanding victory in a vote for the leadership of Japan\u2019s governing party on Thursday, moving him closer to his dream of becoming the longest-serving prime minister in the country\u2019s history and fueling his hopes of revising its pacifist Constitution.The victory gives Mr. Abe, 63, a new three-year term as president of the Liberal Democratic Party and assures him of remaining prime minister. If he remains in office until November 2019 \u2014 just short of seven years after he was elected in December 2012 \u2014 he will surpass the previous longevity record for prime minister, set during the Meiji era in the early 20th century by Taro Katsura.Mr. Abe faces a full slate of challenges, including towering national debt, the increasing threat of climate change-related disasters, a rapidly aging society and the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.\u201cCooperating with you, I\u2019d like to do my best to hand over to our children\u2019s generation a Japan filled with hope and pride,\u201d Mr. Abe said in his acceptance speech.Above all, analysts said, Mr. Abe\u2019s signature accomplishment is his stable political leadership in a country that had grown weary of a conveyor belt of prime ministers. Since World War II, the average tenure of Japanese prime ministers has been about two years. By the end of next year, Mr. Abe would exceed Mr. Katsura\u2019s almost eight years in office because Mr. Abe\u2019s tenure includes an earlier stint as prime minister.Critics have been disappointed by Mr. Abe\u2019s entanglement in influence-peddling scandals and his failure to deliver stronger economic growth or the gender equality measures that he has long promised. But his opponent in the party election, Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister, failed to generate enough enthusiasm to justify a change of course.Domestically, Mr. Abe\u2019s biggest test could come as he tries to revise Japan\u2019s war-renouncing Constitution, which was enacted by American postwar occupiers in 1947.\u201cI\u2019d like to work on constitutional reform together with you,\u201d Mr. Abe said in his victory address to the Liberal Democrats. Amending the pacifist clause has long been one of his most cherished goals, as his grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, tried and failed to do.Analysts said that Mr. Abe faced considerable risks, given that any change to the Constitution has to be approved not only by Parliament, but by the general public.\u201cIf he cannot win a national referendum it will be a suicidal act for him,\u201d said Yuichi Hosoya, a professor of international politics at Keio University in Tokyo.A poll conducted this month by NHK, the public broadcaster, found that only 18 percent of those surveyed would support a constitutional change if a bill were to be submitted this fall. About a third said submitting such a measure this fall was not necessary, leaving about 40 percent undecided.After being elected prime minister again in 2012, Mr. Abe focused on the economy, promoting policies of low interest rates and high infrastructure spending in a platform he dubbed Abenomics. Under his leadership this time around, the Liberal Democrats have expanded their dominance in Parliament.\u201cHe matured before he came back to the prime ministership in 2012,\u201d said Hiroshi Nakanishi, a professor of international politics at Kyoto University. \u201cI think the basis of Abe\u2019s strength is the economy.\u201dBut with a declining and aging population and debt that is more than double the size of the national economy, Mr. Abe has limited room to maneuver, particularly if a global trade war becomes a drag on growth.\u201cThere are lots of worries, and Prime Minister Abe has already extended all sorts of means through Abenomics,\u201d said Mieko Nakabayashi, a former member of Japan\u2019s House of Representatives and now a professor in the School of Social Sciences at Waseda University, Tokyo. \u201cHe has utilized all the possible tools already.\u201dOrdinary citizens have not necessarily felt the benefits of Mr. Abe\u2019s economic prescriptions so far.\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d said Miwa Ishimori, 46, a caretaker in a nursing home in Saitama Prefecture outside Tokyo. \u201cOur salary hasn\u2019t changed. I want Abe-san to look after people in the lower rungs of society.\u201dAs part of his economic plan, Mr. Abe has often talked of the importance of promoting more women in the workplace and creating a society in which women can \u201cshine.\u201d Yet critics point to lugubrious progress, with Japan ranking 114th of 144 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s global gender equality rankings.\u201cOn questions of the woman\u2019s role in society, I think the Abe administration has shifted into a much more social conservatism than I would have thought likely,\u201d Ms. Smith said.With Mr. Abe\u2019s extended tenure come concerns that he and his party exert too much power in Japan, where the opposition is extremely weak.\u201cI\u2019m worried about the situation where he stays for such a long time that no one can say \u2018no\u2019 to him,\u201d said Noriko Iwasaki, 46, an assistant at a Kabuki theater in Tokyo. \u201cIs it O.K. to have only \u2018yes\u2019 men around him as he becomes too strong?\u201dBut with so much international uncertainty, others said they appreciated a domestic even keel.\u201cOur lives aren\u2019t so wonderful, but that\u2019s not bad,\u201d said Susumu Amano, 57, who works for a butcher in a Tokyo department store. \u201cIt\u2019s good not to see much change.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Alliances Made Athens Great", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ancient Athenians manipulated their allies, spreading democracy and providing protection, always with their own interests first. Trump could learn something.Mr. Konstandaras is a columnist at the Greek newspaper Kathimerini. ATHENS \u2014 In his declared intention to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d President Trump appears set on destroying the foundations of American greatness. The multinational organizations and agreements that established peace and stability, and encouraged economic growth for some seven decades, were designed principally by Americans. They organized the world pretty much the way that suited them, and they reaped the benefits of dominating it through a complex network of organizations and treaties. On a global scale, this post-World War II American hegemony echoed the way that ancient Athens, after leading a victorious alliance of Greek city-states against a Persian invasion, gradually shaped the alliance into an empire. The Athenians of the fifth century B.C.E. took charge of the Greek states\u2019 defense, controlled their diplomatic and trade relations, and intervened in their politics.An enigmatic figure from that time known only as the Old Oligarch, because of his blunt critique of democratic Athens, was very clear in his writing about what he did not like about the city\u2019s Constitution and its citizens\u2019 behavior. Unlike Mr. Trump, however, he understood that the Athenians had gained much by rigging the Greek world in their favor.\u201cI do not think well of their Constitution,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut since they have decided to have it so, I intend to point out how well they preserve it and how they accomplish those other things for which the rest of the Greeks criticize them. One must forgive everyone for looking after their own interests.\u201dIn democracy, the Old Oligarch declared, the worst citizens had an equal say and could even be elected to office, at the expense of the city\u2019s finest. Furthermore, as the economy boomed through the links of empire, some slaves and foreign residents had even become rich in trade and commerce. Slaves didn\u2019t know their place, the Oligarch complained. You could not even beat them in the street. They dressed the way their masters did, and it was impossible to tell them apart.The Athenians, he charged, bullied their allies, turning a defense agreement into an empire in whose center they sat, pulling all the strings. They drew tribute from their allies; they supported democrats against the best citizens to fit Athenian interests. \u201cFor like is well-disposed to like. Accordingly, the Athenians prefer those sympathetic to themselves,\u201d the Old Oligarch noted. With their powerful navy, the Athenians controlled their allies\u2019 dealings, from politics to trade. They made their partners use Athenian currency, weights and measures. They obliged the allies to bring their legal issues to Athenian courts, where litigants had to win the favor of Athenian citizens who sat in judgment of them. \u201cIn this way, the allies have become the slaves of the Athenian people,\u201d the Old Oligarch charged.Scholars are uncertain of the date of the \u201cOld Oligarch\u201d text (originally attributed mistakenly to Xenophon of Athens). It may have been written before 431 B.C.E., when war broke out between Athens and Sparta, and certainly before 404, when the victorious Spartans imposed an oligarchy on Athens, tore down its walls and dismantled its alliance. (Less than a year later, after brutal oligarchic rule and civil strife had made the city ungovernable, the Spartans accepted a return to democracy in Athens.)One year into the war with Sparta, in the prime of his city\u2019s democracy and power, Pericles, the great Athenian leader, also expressed a composite view of his state\u2019s policies: \u201cIn nobility of spirit, we stand in sharp contrast to most men; for it is not by receiving kindness, but by conferring it, that we acquire our friends,\u201d the historian Thucydides quoted him as saying at a funeral of war dead. But Pericles was no softhearted liberal in the modern sense. His pursuit was Athenian greatness \u2014 and domestic and foreign policy contributed to this. Before succumbing to a plague that struck Athens during the war, he tried to encourage his fellow citizens. \u201cIt will be remembered forever, how we of all Greeks held sway over the greatest number of Greeks, how in the greatest wars we held out against our foes whether united or single, and inhabited a city that was the richest in all things and the greatest,\u201d he declared.Both the grudging respect of a political opponent of democracy and the inspired rhetoric of its champion reveal that Athens had created a network of common interests among its citizens and with its allies, all of which it was able to manipulate to its own advantage. Allied tribute helped fund the glorious temples whose ruins still grace the Greek capital; allied money and ships contributed to Athens\u2019s naval might, which, in turn, helped the Athenians dominate their allies. In Thucydides\u2019s analysis, it was this rise in influence that provoked Sparta to reassert its authority as the Greeks\u2019 greatest power. After Pericles\u2019s death, arrogance toward other states and recklessness contributed to Athens\u2019s defeat.The Oligarch was given his catchy name a century ago by a prominent classicist, Gilbert Murray, at a time when the word was not synonymous with friends of Vladimir Putin or billionaires funding political campaigns. The name reflected the perennial tension in Athens and other city-states between the rule of the many and the rule of the few. Unlike those who today try to manipulate politics to their ends, the Old Oligarch could appreciate the effectiveness of what he did not like. He knew that the common people had to have economic benefits and a say in the running of the state, because the state depended on them. \u201cThe people generally are right to have more than the highborn and the wealthy, because it is the people who man the ships and impart strength to the city,\u201d he wrote.Today, as President Trump tries to roll back health care for a large part of the population, as he invests in domestic division and further economic inequality, as he undermines alliances and the international order, he seems blind to the value of what he does not like, indifferent to the consequences of his actions. Endowed with the immense powers of his office, he lacks the cynical Old Oligarch\u2019s understanding of politics. Unlike Pericles, he does not see that power can be enhanced through the projection of kindness.Nikos Konstandaras is a columnist at the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Rise of Authoritarian Capitalism", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKevin Rudd is a former prime minister of Australia and is president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.Liberal democracy and capitalism have been the two commanding political and economic ideas of Western history since the 19th century. Now, however, the fate of these once-galvanizing global principles is increasingly uncertain.Democratic capitalism is showing signs of deep, systemic sickness in the United States, Europe and Australasia, even as varieties of state or authoritarian capitalism are slowly becoming entrenched around the world, particularly in China and Russia.In the developing world, democratic capitalism has always had a mixed reputation. While the West preached its freedoms at home, it happily engaged in political and economic exploitation abroad. The hypocrisy of colonialism is still lost on many in the West, who ask why so many people in the developing world have found the truths of Western political and economic freedom to be less than self-evident in their own national experiences.After the end of the Cold War, however, four structural challenges emerged to endanger the future of democratic capitalism: financial instability, technological disruption, widening social and economic inequality and structural weaknesses in democratic politics. If the West cannot overcome these challenges, they will, over time, spread to the rest of the world and undermine open polities, economies and societies.Revolutions in technology threaten democracies\u2019 ability to cope with the complexity, speed and trajectory of change. Democracies, like corporations, can now be hacked. Social media distorts the free flow of facts that has been the lifeblood of democratic capitalism. In the past, disruptions to employment brought about by rapid technological change resulted in a movement of lower-skilled jobs to newer industries. But now we may no longer be capable of providing enough new jobs in areas where they are needed.The financial and technological challenges are compounded by a rising economic inequality. The extreme concentration of wealth in the United States in recent decades is well documented. The new barons of capital and technology thrive while the American middle class stagnates and the American dream fades. The bottom line is simple: Citizens will continue to support their democratic capitalist systems so long as there is reasonable equality of opportunity and a humane social safety net. Take these away and the citizenry no longer has a material stake in mainstream democratic politics. Nationalism and xenophobia take over.Lastly, there are the inherent structural failings in modern democratic politics. In the United States, unrestricted campaign financing continues to undermine democracy. The spectacular corruption of the electoral redistricting system \u2014 gerrymandering \u2014 only compounds the problem. On top of this, the polarization of traditional news media by Fox News and others is poisoning the capacity of the democratic system to build a sustainable consensus around what is left of the political center, as shown by the debacle of the American gun-control debate.As Western democracies look increasingly sick, other systems of governance are now on offer. Russian nationalism represents a departure from Western political, economic and diplomatic norms. China has become increasingly confident in its own model, described as authoritarian or state capitalism. And its \u201cBeijing consensus\u201d is held up to the non-Western world as an example of a more effective form of national, and even international, governance.If the United States wants to remain a global beacon of democratic capitalism, it must first confront its domestic challenges. The American social contract needs to be rebuilt through a revised New Deal. The social impact of technological change must be politically managed, rather than left to the market. Finance should return to its historical role as the servant of the real economy, rather than its master. And the Supreme Court must set a new direction on campaign finance (by overturning the Citizens United decision), gerrymandering and some of the crazier interpretations of the Second Amendment used to justify a breakdown in basic law and order.The United States also needs to re-embrace its responsibilities to the liberal international order it painstakingly created after World War II. This order was anchored in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary Fund and other institutions and principles that have become the bedrock of free societies, free economies and free polities. The world now asks: Does the United States still embrace this order?Both democracy and capitalism are relatively recent developments in the long history of the West. They represent even more recent developments in the considerably longer history of the East. Both represent the enduring idea of freedom. Yet both rest on increasingly fragile political and economic institutions. History cautions us against any belief that democratic capitalism will somehow inevitably prevail. Unless, of course, we make it so by tending the garden while there is still time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Security Breach Exposes Accounts of 50 Million Users", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook, already facing scrutiny over how it handles the private information of its users, said on Friday that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users.The breach, which was discovered this week, was the largest in the company\u2019s 14-year history. The attackers exploited a feature in Facebook\u2019s code to gain access to user accounts and potentially take control of them.Senior executives have testified several times this year in congressional hearings where some lawmakers suggested that the government will need to step in if the social network is unable to get tighter control of its service. On Friday, regulators and lawmakers quickly seized on the breach to renew calls for more oversight.In the conference call on Friday, Guy Rosen, a vice president of product management at Facebook, declined to say whether the attack could have been coordinated by hackers supported by a nation-state.Three software flaws in Facebook\u2019s systems allowed hackers to break into user accounts, including those of the top executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, according to two people familiar with the investigation but not allowed to discuss it publicly. Once in, the attackers could have gained access to apps like Spotify, Instagram and hundreds of others that give users a way to log into their systems through Facebook.The software bugs were particularly awkward for a company that takes pride in its engineering: The first two were introduced by an online tool meant to improve the privacy of users. The third was introduced in July 2017 by a tool meant to easily upload birthday videos.Facebook said it had fixed the vulnerabilities and notified law enforcement officials. Company officials do not know the identity or the origin of the attackers, nor have they fully assessed the scope of the attack or if particular users were targeted. The investigation is still in its beginning stages.\u201cWe\u2019re taking it really seriously,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cI\u2019m glad we found this, but it definitely is an issue that this happened in the first place.\u201dCritics say the attack is the latest sign that Facebook has yet to come to terms with its problems.\u201cBreaches don\u2019t just violate our privacy. They create enormous risks for our economy and national security,\u201d Rohit Chopra, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement. \u201cThe cost of inaction is growing, and we need answers.\u201dFacebook has been roundly criticized for being slow to acknowledge a vast disinformation campaign run by Russian operatives on its platform and other social media outlets before the 2016 presidential election.Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, testified in a Senate hearing that month about what the company was trying to do to prevent the same thing from happening in midterm elections in November.In April, Mr. Zuckerberg testified about revelations that Cambridge Analytica, the British analytics firm that worked with the Trump presidential campaign, siphoned personal information of millions of Facebook users.Outside the United States, the impact of disinformation appearing on Facebook and the popular messaging service it owns, WhatsApp, has been severe. In countries such as Myanmar and India, false rumors spread on social media are believed to have led to widespread killing.Facebook said the attackers had exploited two bugs in the site\u2019s \u201cView As\u201d feature, which allows users to check on what information other people can see about them. The feature was built to give users move control over their privacy.The company said those flaws were compounded by a bug in Facebook\u2019s video-uploading program for birthday celebrations, a software feature that was introduced in July 2017. The flaw allowed the attackers to steal so-called access tokens \u2014 digital keys that allow access to an account.It is not clear when the attack happened, but it appears to have occurred after the video-uploading program was introduced, Facebook said. The company forced more than 90 million users to log out early Friday, a common safety measure taken when accounts have been compromised.The hackers also tried to harvest people\u2019s private information, including name, sex and hometown, from Facebook\u2019s systems, Mr. Rosen said. The company could not determine the extent of the attackers\u2019 access to third-party accounts, he said.Part of that effort has been to gird Facebook against attacks on its network in preparation for the midterm elections. Facebook has spent months setting up new systems to pre-empt such attacks, and has already dealt with a number of incidents believed to be connected to elections in Mexico, Brazil and other countries.Still, the recently discovered breach was a reminder that it is exceptionally difficult to entirely secure a system that has more than 2.2 billion users all over the world and that connects with thousands of third-party services.\u201cThis has really shown us that because today\u2019s digital environment is so complex, a compromise on a single platform \u2014 especially one as popular and widely reaching as Facebook \u2014 can have consequences that are much more far-reaching than what we can tell in early days of the investigation,\u201d said April Doss, chairwoman of cybersecurity at the law firm Saul Ewing.As the news of Facebook\u2019s data breach spread quickly across Twitter, Google searches and other online sites, there was one place where it remained difficult to find some detailed reports: Facebook.Users who posted breaking stories about the breach from The Guardian, The Associated Press and other outlets were prompted with a notice that their posts had been taken down. So many people were posting the stories, they looked like suspicious activity to the systems that Facebook uses to block abuse of its network.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Connected Is Your Community to Everywhere Else in America?", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nAmerica is often described as a place of great divides \u2014 between red and blue, big cities and rural towns, the coasts and the heartland. But our social lives are shaped by a much stronger force that ignores many of these lines: distance.Even in the age of the internet, distance matters immensely in determining whom \u2014 and, as a result, what \u2014 we know.Coastal cities like New York, Washington, San Francisco, Boston and Los Angeles do exhibit close ties to one another, showing that people in counties with similar incomes, education levels and voting patterns are more likely to be linked. But nationwide, the effect of such similarity is small. And the pull of regionalism is strong even for major cities. Brooklynites are still more likely to know someone on Facebook near Albany or Binghamton than in the Bay Area.This map shows an index of connectedness, created using friendship links between pairs of anonymous Facebook users from a snapshot of the platform in April 2016. The researchers aggregated the links at the county level, so neither the Times nor other academics working with the data can identify individual users within it, or how many Facebook users live in each county. Because counties with more people invariably have links to more places, this map rescales the index to account for differences in population.The darker the color, the greater the relative likelihood that any two people living in two different counties are connected on Facebook. Counties that are broadly tied to more \u2014 and more distant \u2014 places will color in more of the map. Counties where nearly all ties are very local will look more isolated.The networks that emerge reveal a distinct social fingerprint for each county, influenced by past migration patterns, geographical features and quirks of the local economy \u2014 whether, for example, the county is home to a military base, a resort hub or a booming oil industry.\u201cBut distance is the thing that shows up everywhere,\u201d said Johannes Stroebel, a professor at N.Y.U.\u2019s Stern School of Business and a co-author of the research, along with Michael Bailey at Facebook, Rachel Cao at Harvard, Theresa Kuchler at N.Y.U. and Arlene Wong at Princeton. \u201cDistance matters,\u201d Mr. Stroebel said, \u201cin explaining every single county\u2019s connectedness.\u201dProximity works alongside every other pattern shown below.State lines are powerful boundaries in binding nearby places. For many counties, as the maps illustrate, the likelihood of friendship drops off sharply at state borders. And counties within a given state tend to be strongly connected to one another. This is particularly striking in Michigan, where counties near the Indiana and Ohio state line are more closely tied to Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula than to out-of-state counties closer by.History is another significant force in shaping these networks. Decades-old migration patterns can help explain why some distant counties are disproportionately connected today. Northern cities like Chicago and Milwaukee still retain close ties to Southern counties along the Mississippi River, where African-American workers who were part of the Great Migration starting a century ago left communities for industrial jobs in the North.In other parts of the country, physical geography forms a kind of social barrier. Friendship links from Belmont County, Ohio, extend east but don\u2019t cross the Appalachian Mountains in Pennsylvania or the Blue Ridge range in Virginia. In Scott County, Ark., friendships do cross state lines, into Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas. But they don\u2019t cross the Mississippi River to the east. In Nassau County, N.Y., the likelihood of friendship links declines steeply off Long Island.Other county outliers in the data can be explained by distinct roles some communities serve: Onslow County, N.C., which is connected to much of the country, is home to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune.Charlotte County, Fla., a retirement community destination, is disproportionately connected to counties across the northern Midwest and Northeast. Washington, D.C., a magnet for college graduates from across the country, is closely tied to counties that are home to major state universities in Florida, Alabama, Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan.The power of distance underlying these other patterns can be seen another way: If we were to divide the United States into two regions, merging counties that are most closely connected to one another, we would get a very simple map. It would not show the coasts versus the heartland, or red America versus blue America.It would show, simply, all of the continental U.S. and Alaska in one region, and far-off Hawaii in the other. Divide the country further, and cohesive regions become clear at different scales. Northern Florida merges with southern Georgia. Texas and California splinter. Divide the country into 50 regions, and you get something that looks like how we might redraw our state borders to reflect the social worlds people in America inhabit today.These networks are important in part because of other patterns that are correlated with them. Counties with more dispersed networks \u2014 where a smaller share of Facebook friends are located nearby, or among the nearest 50 million people \u2014 are on average richer, more educated and have longer life expectancies. Places that are more closely connected to one another also have more migration, trade and patent citations between them.Counties that are more geographically isolated in the index are more likely to have lower labor force participation and economic mobility, and they have higher rates of teenage births. Some of the most economically distressed parts of the country appear to be the most disconnected: Among the 10 U.S. counties with the highest share of friends within 50 miles, six are in Kentucky.Where most friends live within 50 milesThe patterns in this Facebook data don\u2019t necessarily mean that limited social networks cause worse economic and health outcomes, or that wide-ranging networks produce better ones. But other researchers say this data will make it possible in future studies to untangle why they\u2019re related.\u201cThis gives us the first way to systematically look at some of those relationships,\u201d said Mark Granovetter, a sociologist at Stanford who has written influential papers on the value of social networks. \u201cThey have just scratched the surface here.\u201dFacebook links used in the research are between users active on the platform within 30 days of the April 2016 snapshot. Users in the study were assigned a county based on the location in their Facebook profile, their activity on the site and their regular login sources. Some independent cities in Virginia are missing from the data.The Upshot has partnered with Siena College to poll dozens of the most competitive House and Senate races across the country.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Policymakers Saved the Financial System. And America Never Forgave Them.", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrisis and ConsequencesBut for all that anger, the engineers of the American crisis response got the economics mostly correct, and more right than most of those \u2014 including leading economic thinkers and prominent politicians \u2014 who were second-guessing them.To understand the challenges and ultimately the failure of the politics of their response, it helps to put yourself back in 2008 and 2009, when the financial might of the United States government \u2014 trillions of dollars, cumulatively \u2014 was deployed to try to contain the crisis. Mr. Geithner, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke are centrists in the context of modern American politics, but they are conservatives in the traditional sense \u2014 people trying to preserve a system they inherited. Their strategy was to patch things up as quickly as possible. The goal was not to try to reinvent Wall Street on the fly, but to keep the flow of capital coursing through the global economy while minimizing the depth and duration of the recession that the crisis had caused.Mr. Geithner\u2019s disinclination to nationalize banks drew fierce criticism from liberals who argued that the government was essentially funneling money to banks with little assurance they would resume lending.These attacks were misguided.Mr. Paulson\u2019s financial rescue package did not herald an era of socialism on Wall Street; nor did it come at a huge continuing cost to taxpayers. By many measures, it made money.Mr. Geithner\u2019s stress tests achieved their goal of restoring confidence in major banks without the cost and political damage of nationalizing them. They were successful enough that similar stress tests are now a part of regulators\u2019 tool kits both in the United States and overseas.Mr. Bernanke\u2019s aggressive monetary policy probably played a role in getting the expansion on track starting in mid-2009. Quantitative easing and low interest rates did not cause a collapse of the dollar or spiraling inflation.Nobody would argue that the United States economy is perfect, or that the policymakers got everything exactly right.If Mr. Paulson had secured financial rescue legislation before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, perhaps the most severe phase of the crisis could have been avoided altogether, though it is a puzzle how he could have gotten the votes for such a plan before the crisis became more severe. If Mr. Bernanke had moved faster \u2014 putting an open-ended quantitative easing program in place in 2009 or 2010 instead of waiting till 2012 \u2014 maybe full recovery would have come sooner. It\u2019s not clear how the recovery might have looked had Mr. Geithner embraced a more activist approach to replacing management and taking greater government control of the most troubled large banks, notably Citigroup and Bank of America. Or if he had welcomed a larger program to help relieve borrowers who were underwater on their homes. The tactics the men chose can be second-guessed, but the result of their efforts speaks for itself. The expansion has lasted nine years, the second longest on record. Although job gains were disappointingly slow for years, the unemployment rate is now 3.9 percent, among the lowest in decades.From 2007 to 2017, per-person inflation-adjusted G.D.P. rose 6.3 percent in the United States, compared with only 3 percent in the eurozone, where similar policies were embraced more slowly.It was Feb. 19, 2009, less than a month into the Obama administration. Mr. Geithner and his colleagues had introduced plans to assist struggling homeowners, which many liberal critics considered deeply inadequate. The human cost of the foreclosure crisis was indeed immense; there were 2.8 million foreclosures that year alone. But the politics of helping troubled homeowners were more toxic than the crisis managers had foreseen.From the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CNBC broadcaster Rick Santelli began a rant for the ages. \u201cHow many of you people want to pay for your neighbor\u2019s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can\u2019t pay their bills?\u201d Mr. Santelli said, as traders cheered behind him. \u201cPresident Obama, are you listening?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about having a Chicago tea party in July,\u201d he continued.The term stuck, and was embraced by the conservative activists who propelled Republicans to victory in the 2010 midterm elections \u2014 driven, in no small part, by opposition to economic stimulus, financial bailouts and the work of the Federal Reserve.The policymakers knew history\u2019s warnings about economic policy that reacts too sluggishly to financial crisis.There\u2019s a reason, of course, that they were in their roles as appointed technocrats and not politicians. But it isn\u2019t clear that George W. Bush or Barack Obama had any better ideas for bringing along the public than did the men they chose to lead financial policy. The crisis response may well have been a Rubik\u2019s Cube of political and economic challenges too complicated to solve.It was foreseeable, perhaps, that many on the left would view the Geithner-Paulson-Bernanke strategy as too friendly to Wall Street interests. It was also foreseeable that the libertarian right would loathe the bailouts. More surprising were the ways in which some of the biggest beneficiaries of the strategy became vocal opponents.The Geithner strategy was based on rescuing Wall Street, using hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars \u2014 while building a more rigorous regulatory system to try to prevent a similar crisis.Even as Mr. Bernanke\u2019s easy money policies pushed the stock market upward and coincided with a gradually improving economy and low inflation, the drumbeat of commentary was overwhelmingly negative.Success has rarely been so unpopular.Might the rise of anti-establishment parties around the world \u2014 not least Donald J. Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders-esque socialists on the left in the United States \u2014 be traced to their work as crisis responders?\u201cWe know from history that financial crises, particularly big ones, do tend to get followed by a populist reaction,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cI think we all tried our best to explain what we were doing and work with the politics, as difficult as it was. I think back to the crisis, we were very focused on preventing the collapse of the financial system. And developing our communication to the broad public wasn\u2019t always our first priority.\u201dHe argued, though, that longer-term trends \u2014 like stagnation in middle-class wages, social dysfunctions, rising mistrust in government and hostility to immigration \u2014 were a bigger explanation for the rise in a politics of extremes.This analysis seems both correct and incomplete. Of course, the embrace of anti-immigrant nationalism on the right and of socialism on the left have roots considerably deeper than a bank bailout or a quantitative easing program.But it was the experience of the crisis, and the sense among Americans of all ideological dispositions that they were being asked to foot the bill for someone else\u2019s mistakes \u2014 whether by Wall Street C.E.O.s or by Mr. Santelli\u2019s neighbor with the renovated bathroom \u2014 that helped make those long-simmering problems boil over. It turns out, when you throw trillions of dollars at rescuing a system that most people don\u2019t like very much in the first place, the result isn\u2019t relief.It\u2019s anger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bag Fee Creep, and How to Fight It", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateDelta and American Airlines are among the carriers that are charging more for checked bags. But a few tricks can help travelers avoid those fees altogether.All four domestic airlines boosted the fee for the first checked bag from $25 to $30 and the second from $35 to $40. But passengers, experts emphasize, don\u2019t have to pay the fee if they follow a few travel strategies, from airline selection to packing less.American Airlines was the first carrier to implement checked-bags fees, then $15, in 2008, and the practice has been standard on most domestic flights (a checked bag on most international routes is still free). Southwest has been the exception.Many travelers may feel nickel-and-dimed by the practice, but for the airlines, raising fees increases revenue without reaching into the pockets of their most frequent fliers.\u201cChecked-bag fees tend to fall disproportionately on price-sensitive leisure travelers,\u201d Mr. Leff said. \u201cBusiness travelers are less price sensitive than leisure travelers and often they\u2019re not checking bags. If they do, they have status that means they don\u2019t pay.\u201dObtaining elite status usually requires flying a lot with one carrier. Elite fliers often get early boarding, when there\u2019s still room in the overhead bins for their carry-ons, and free checked bags. The same is true for passengers flying in business or first class, normally tickets that cost much more than economy plus the $60 round-trip checked bag fee.A cheaper way to gain status with an airline is to carry their branded credit card. Most of these cards cost less than $100 a year and, if used to purchase the airline ticket on that carrier, grant cardholders earlier boarding and a free checked bag, sometimes for friends or family booked on the same itinerary. With bags costing $60 round trip, the card pays for itself in, at most, two trips a year.Besides saving money, there are other advantages to relying on carry-on bags. Since airlines require passengers to fly on the plane with their checked bag, those with stowed luggage can\u2019t standby for an earlier flight. \u201cWhen you check a bag, it really cramps your style with flight changes,\u201d Mr. Kelly said.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to travel with just a carry-on, you have to make a couple of sacrifices, and if I\u2019m not wearing the exact right shoes, then that\u2019s one of those sacrifices,\u201d Ms. Falconer said. \u201cI have a lot of black, and I wear jeans with everything.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.Another factor: Under Nike\u2019s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can\u2019t sell league-branded merchandise after 2020.

{"Headline": "Trudeau Sought Support From Mexico\u2019s President on Nafta", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada appealed to President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico this week to help salvage a three-country North American Free Trade Agreement as the White House prepared to send Congress a bilateral trade deal with Mexico.The telephone conversation between the two leaders, which took place on Thursday, came as the United States and Mexico were poised to release text of the trade pact reached last month that excludes Canada. The White House had set a Sunday deadline for delivering text of the agreement to Congress and was expected to release the details sometime this weekend. Those close to the discussions said the situation remained fluid and that discussions between the three countries were expected to continue over the weekend.The overture by Mr. Trudeau comes at a rocky moment between the United States and Canada, as President Trump threatens to leave Canada out of the 25-year-old Nafta and tax its cars as punishment for not agreeing to the United States\u2019 trade demands.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, speaking to reporters on Friday, said that Mr. Trudeau had asked him \u201cto intervene to bring the United States to an understanding\u201d and that he had agreed to help.\u201cWe want to maintain a good relationship with Canada of course and a good relationship with the United States,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said.Mexico\u2019s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said late Friday that Canada and the United States would be involved in an intense effort over the weekend to reach an agreement over the remaining issues dividing them.\u201cFor the first time there is real effort\u201d on both sides, he said. \u201cIn the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will have a trilateral text or whether we will have to release the text of a bilateral understanding\u201d which could then be adapted to incorporate Canada.It is unclear whether the United States and Canada can bridge the differences that have so far stymied an agreement. And Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said he had no plans to reopen the trade pact that Mexico, under the leadership of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, had reached last month.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put our economic future, our financial stability at risk. We want there to be investment in Mexico so that there are jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we are not going to reopen the deal, the agreement with the United States. We have already concluded this matter.\u201dHe added: \u201cI told him that we would insist that the treaty would be trilateral.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office said that the prime minister and the president-elect \u201cagreed to work closely together to further strengthen the dynamic partnership between Canada and Mexico,\u201d and that \u201cthey discussed Nafta and the mutually beneficial economic and trading relationship between our two countries.\u201dA spokesman for the office of the United States trade representative declined to comment. At a United Nations summit meeting in New York this week, Mr. Trump said that he rejected a meeting with Mr. Trudeau, which the prime minister said he never requested.The Sept. 30 deadline is being fueled by political considerations in both the United States and Mexico. Mr. Trump and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto want to sign the pact by Nov. 30, before the new Mexican administration takes over and before a potential change in control of the United States Congress.But the agreement faces an uncertain fate without Canada. Lawmakers have urged the White House to continue working to retain a trilateral pact that has become critical to automakers, farmers and other businesses across North America.The release of the text does not preclude Canada from joining the agreement but, for that to happen, the United States and Canada must resolve some the remaining issues that have so far prevented a deal.Many of the most significant changes to Nafta involve the rules governing car manufacturing, which are being altered in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico.The preliminary agreement unveiled in August required that at least 75 percent of a car\u2019s value be produced in North America for a company to import it into the United States duty free. That is up from 62.5 percent under the original Nafta.Carmakers also would be required to use more local steel, aluminum, glass and other parts. And 40 to 45 percent of vehicles would have to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. That increase is intended to increase jobs in the United States and Canada, where wages are higher.Those changes are generally acceptable to Canada, but it remains resistant to broadening access to the Canadian dairy market and to abandoning an independent tariff dispute settlement system. Mexico has agreed to put off discussions over removing tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on steel and aluminum imports, but Canadian negotiators have argued that these should be lifted as part of a new Nafta deal.Robert E. Lighthizer, the Trump administration\u2019s chief negotiator, told lawmakers this week that talks with Canada would continue even after the release of the agreement with Mexico. Administration officials are hopeful that Canada will be more willing to make concessions after provincial elections take place in October. Modest changes to the text can be made after it has been released and even after it has been signed.\u201cGoing forward, Ways and Means and Finance Republicans and Democrats will be analyzing this carefully and looking for ways to advance a three-country agreement,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on Friday.He added: \"I\u2019m hopeful Canada steps it up and steps to the table in a big way.\u201dBusiness groups have also been expressing their trepidation about moving forward with a free-trade agreement that does not include Canada.\u201cIf Canada doesn\u2019t come into the deal, there is no deal,\u201d Thomas Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, warned last week. Those concerns were echoed on Friday by the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents the leaders of major American companies. \u201cOur northern ally is critical to allow trade to strengthen the U.S. economy,\u201d the group said.Relations between the governments of the United States and Canada have fallen to their lowest point in recent memory, leaving open the possibility that no deal will be reached anytime soon. Mr. Trump said this week that he was frustrated with how Canada had been behaving during negotiations and vowed that he would be just as happy to levy tariffs on imports of Canadian cars \u2014 a move that would likely spur backlash from carmakers and consumers in the United States.After imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports against the wishes of businesses, Mr. Trump does not appear to put much stock in those concerns.\u201cYou have to believe when he threatens to do it on automobiles that he might, even though this would be incredibly painful for Americans as well,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Preserving a healthy trade relationship with the United States is pivotal to Canada\u2019s economy, but many in the country have been supportive of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s firm stance in the face of threats from Mr. Trump.\u201cHad Trudeau caved in to the demands on a whole range of issues, it would have been politically indefensible in Canada,\u201d said Lawrence Herman, an international trade lawyer in Toronto.For months now, Canadians have followed the Nafta negotiations with the rapt attention normally reserved for hockey playoffs. Almost three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports flow south across the border. But more worrisome to the Canadian economy than an end of Nafta is the prospect of a 25 percent tariff on automobile and auto part exports heading into the United States that Mr. Trump has threatened.That would cripple Canada\u2019s largest manufacturing sector, putting an estimated 250,000 people out of work, according to one forecast. It would also cast a shadow over the government of Mr. Trudeau, who faces his own re-election in a year\u2019s time.\u201cThat can only hurt the prime minister,\u201d said Janice Stein, founding director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \u201cWere that to happen, once you unroll tariffs, it\u2019s not easy to roll them back.\u201dMs. Stein, however, remained optimistic that negotiators come out with deal in the next 10 days. \u201cEveryone knows what\u2019s at stake,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated Lawrence Herman\u2019s law practice location.

General Assembly Updates: Trump Speaks Out on Globalization", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, whose apocalyptic speech in his United Nations debut last year riveted much of the world\u2019s attention, spoke again on the world\u2019s most important diplomatic stage on Tuesday, at the organization\u2019s New York headquarters. [Read our article on why Mr. Trump\u2019s aides feared he might be too nice at this year\u2019s General Assembly.]Mr. Trump boasted of what he called impressive accomplishments in the United States and around the world.\u201cIn less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,\u201d he said, setting off murmurs of laughter by world leaders in the cavernous hall. \u201cI did not expect that reaction,\u201d he said.\u201cThe United States is stronger, safer and a richer country than it was when I assumed office less than two years ago,\u201d Mr. Trump told the General Assembly, in his second address as president. \u201cWe are standing up for America and the American people. We are also standing up for the world.\u201dHe said that under his administration the United States had started building a wall along the border with Mexico, defeated the Islamic State and eased the crisis with North Korea through dialogue with the leader of the nuclear-armed state.\u201cWe have engaged with North Korea to replace the specter of conflict with a bold and new push for peace,\u201d Mr. Trump said, speaking about his Singapore summit meeting with Mr. Kim.\u201cThe missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction, nuclear testing has stopped,\u201d the president said. \u201cI would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken though much work remains to be done.\u201dMr. Trump said that sanctions against North Korea would stay in place until denuclearization occurs, but called the moment \u201cfar greater\u201d than people would understand.Mr. Trump denounced Iran\u2019s leaders, calling them a \u201ccorrupt dictatorship\u201d responsible for \u201cdeath and destruction\u201d and said his reimposition of nuclear sanctions had severely weakened the Iranian government. \u201cThey do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations,\u201d he said.He also called for the \u201crestoration of democracy in Venezuela,\u201d and that he was adding economic sanctions on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d and close advisers.\u201cAs far as America is concerned,\u201d Mr. Trump said, the court \u2014 which prosecutes war crimes and crimes against humanity \u2014 has \u201cno legitimacy and no authority.\u201dWe \u201creject the ideology of globalism,\u201d he said.He also spoke of renegotiating \u201cbad and broken trade deals,\u201d and said that \u201cmany nations agree that the trade system is in dire need\u201d of change. He said the United States had \u201cracked up $13 billion in trade deficits\u201d in the last two decades. \u201cBut those days are over,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will no longer tolerate such abuse.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump touted America\u2019s energy independence, he assailed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \u2014 which includes Saudi Arabia, a strong United States ally \u2014 for rising oil prices.OPEC nations are \u201cripping off the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. Nobody should like it.\u201d \u201cWe want them to stop raising prices, we want them to start lowering prices,\u201d he said in reference to the OPEC cartel. \u201cWe are not going to put up with it, these horrible prices, much longer.\u201dWarning against international reliance on a single supplier of energy, Mr. Trump applauded some European nations, singling out Poland, for moving to establish pipelines with the Baltics to break a dependence on Russian oil \u2014 in one of his few mentions of Russia. But as he has done before, he attacked Germany for what he called its energy dependence.\u201cGermany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Rouhani, who has all but ruled out a meeting with Mr. Trump, offered a portrait of his country that is law-abiding, respectful and first in the fight against terrorism \u2014 diametrically opposite the description presented a few hours earlier by the American president.Mr. Rouhani denounced the Trump administration not only for repudiating the nuclear agreement, but also for threatening through the use of sanctions to punish any country that seeks to do business with Iran.\u201cThe economic war that the United States has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the Iranian people, but entails harmful repercussions for people of other countries,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said. He also made clear that he thought Mr. Trump\u2019s offer to talk with Iran\u2019s leaders was disingenuous at best.\u201cIt is ironic that the United States government does not even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said.In a clear sign of irritation, the Trump administration warned the United States\u2019 chief European partners on Tuesday of unhappiness over their move to bypass its reimposed sanctions on Iran. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, told a conference in New York that the European plan to create a way for Iran to conduct international financial transactions was a big mistake.  \u201cWe do not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anybody else,\u201d Mr. Bolton said at the conference, which was organized by United Against Nuclear Iran, a group that has criticized the 2015 nuclear deal reached under the Obama administration. Mr. Bolton, who has made no secret of his antipathy for Iran\u2019s leaders, also directed some of his strongest ire at them. \"If you cross us or our allies or our partners, you harm our citizens,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you continue to lie and cheat, yes there will indeed be hell to pay.\" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who spoke directly after President Trump addressed the assembly, took aim at some United States policies, without specifically mentioning the Trump administration.Mr. Erdogan assailed Mr. Trump\u2019s Iran sanctions, support for a Kurdish-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria and the legal protections afforded to Fethullah Gulen, the Turkish cleric-in-exile in Pennsylvania. Mr. Erdogan has described Mr. Gulen and his organization as the instigator of the failed 2016 coup in Turkey. \u201cWhere does the head, the mastermind of that terrorist organization reside?\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. \u201cIn the United States of America. And from there they export terror.\u201dThe sanctions, which have contributed to a sharp downturn in Turkey\u2019s once-mighty economy, came after Turkey refused to release an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who was arrested in a widespread crackdown after the failed coup.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s communications director shared photos on Twitter of the Turkish leader shaking hands with Mr. Trump. President Emmanuel Macron of France, during his time at the podium, defended multilateralism, a policy that Mr. Trump rejected. Without multilateralism, Mr. Macron warned, global wars would return. He cautioned that \u201cnationalism always leads to defeat.\u201d\u201cI do not accept the erosion of multilateralism and don\u2019t accept our history unraveling,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cOur children are watching.\u201dHe also took aim at Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to quit the Paris climate agreement \u2014 an ambitious effort to halt climate change. \u201cThe Paris agreement has stayed intact, and that is because we have decided to stay unified in spite of the United States\u2019 decision to withdraw,\u201d Mr. Macron said. \u201cThis is power, and this is the way that we overcome the challenges.\u201dUrging radical action to ensure that the goals of the agreement are met, Mr. Macron told fellow signers to consider action against the countries that rejected it.\u201cLet\u2019s, for example, stop signing trade agreements with those who don\u2019t comply with the Paris agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s have our trade agreements take on board our environmental obligations.\u201d The United States and Syria are the only nations that are not part of the agreementPresident Trump had a chilly greeting for his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, during a lunch hosted by the United Nations secretary general on Tuesday afternoon, remaining firmly in his seat when the prime minister approached. Just before the lunch started, Prime Minister Trudeau briefly approached Mr. Trump and shook his hand as the American president sat at the head table, according to a White House pool report.Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, who was first to address the General Assembly on Tuesday, called for solidarity among member nations and urged world leaders to help revitalize the global body at a time when multilateralism is \u201cunder fire.\u201dHe focused his speech on a \u201ctrust deficit disorder\u201d playing out around the world that has affected the United Nations\u2019 ability to function. He also cited divisions in the Security Council \u2014 the United Nations body primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security \u2014 that have left the council unable to make decisions. \u201cWe must repair broken trust,\u201d Mr. Guterres said. \u201cWe must invigorate our multilateral project, and we must uphold dignity once and for all.\u201d\u201cDespite the chaos and confusion of our world, I see winds of hope blowing around the globe,\u201d Mr. Guterres said, pointing to recent peace agreements between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and between warring parties in South Sudan. New York went into gridlock mode as the F.B.I., Secret Service and New York Police Department safeguarded visiting dignitaries to attend the General Assembly. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to stay at his Manhattan penthouse atop Trump Tower throughout added to the already chaotic midtown traffic. The General Assembly typically creates traffic jams. At one point during the two-week session, the police said, 189 motorcades are expected to cross Manhattan in a single day.Nearly 50 dump trucks filled with sand serve as street barricades, according to officials. Earlier this week, at least 17 of them had lined Fifth Avenue between 55th and 57th Streets.\u201cThey are a 32-ton obstacle should someone try and penetrate that area,\u201d said Vito A. Turso, a spokesman for the Department of Sanitation, which supplies the vehicles.\u201cWanted for mass murder,\u201d say the posters, pasted on street corners and illuminated on the sides of special trucks circulating in near United Nations headquarters in New York.They feature the photo of a bespectacled man named Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of Myanmar\u2019s military, who a United Nations fact finding mission has said should face genocide charges over the slaughter of thousands of Rohingya Muslims \u2014 a stateless ethnic group \u2014 in the country last year.The plight of the Rohingya is not high on the list of priorities at this year\u2019s United Nations General Assembly gathering. But the posters, part of a campaign by Amnesty International, serve as blunt reminders to heads of state, visiting dignitaries and regular New Yorkers of the atrocities carried by the Myanmar military against the minority group. Thousands were killed and more than 700,000 forced to flee their homes when soldiers launched coordinated attacks on Rohingya villages in Myanmar\u2019s Rakhine State over several weeks in August and September last year.So far, accountability has been elusive. China, a Security Council member and an ally of Myanmar\u2019s government, stands in the way of serious United Nations action, such as imposing sanctions. The International Criminal Court has said it has jurisdiction to evaluate whether criminal charges could be filed, though in this case it is the Trump administration \u2014 which has expressed disdain for the court \u2014 that could prove an obstacle.There Rohingya are not represented at high level meetings at the United Nation\u2019s this week, and Myanmar\u2019s leaders, who have denied responsibility for the mass killings, have shunned the event.Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and Myanmar\u2019s civilian leader, has skipped the General Assembly gathering for the second year in a row. Once embraced internationally as a humanitarian hero, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is now something of a pariah, accused of failing to raise her voice in opposition to the killing.Reporting was contributed by Rick Gladstone, Megan Specia, Michael Schwirtz, Sarah Maslin Nir, Mark Landler, Gardiner Harris and Tess Felder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Should Match California\u2019s Effort to Slow Climate Change", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy pledging to cut its emissions in half by midcentury, China would propel itself into a world-leading role in the fight against global warming.Mr. Gillis and Mr. Harvey are writing a book on how to speed up the clean-energy transition.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At long last, a handful of political leaders are starting to set goals on greenhouse emissions that are consistent with the magnitude of the climate crisis.It is not clear how this goal can be met, and we will come back to that in a moment. But first, we offer a challenge: China should match California\u2019s initiative with a bold new target of its own.A zero-emissions goal by midcentury may be unrealistic for a fast-growing developing country, but China could shoot for a 50 to 60 percent reduction in emissions by then, to be followed by a goal of zero later in the century. This week, Governor Brown has been hosting a big climate-action meeting in San Francisco, with thousands attending. China sent the largest delegation of any country, highlighting its efforts to modernize its power grid, push electric cars and buses, and clean up the air pollution that chokes its cities.Both California and China have made historic progress. California already gets more than half its power from low-emission sources. The state long ago adopted one of the world\u2019s best building codes, so that every new house and office is highly efficient. Sales of electric cars are growing rapidly. California emissions have fallen below 1990 levels years earlier than expected, and the state is in the vanguard as emissions throughout the United States have begun to fall. The Chinese emissions story is more complicated. The country started the cleanup race with a filthy, inefficient power system based largely on coal; with massive, highly polluting basic industries; and with manufacturing techniques that consumed far more energy to do a given task than those in the industrialized West.About 15 years ago, China adopted energy-efficiency targets that cut the energy used per dollar of goods farther and faster than any nation ever has. China also invested heavily in wind and solar power, helping to drive the cost down drastically; in many places they have become the cheapest new sources of electricity. Thanks largely to that push, developing and developed nations alike are turning to clean power on a scale that was hard to imagine even a decade ago.Now, as China pushes electric vehicles to mass adoption, Western companies are straining to keep up. Shenzhen, a city of 12 million near Hong Kong, has 17,000 electric buses on the street. The entire taxi fleet will be electric by the end of the year, and its version of Uber is close behind.Despite all this, economic growth in China has been so strong that total greenhouse pollution is still growing, and partly because of that, so are global emissions. Globally, we have simply not made enough progress to put emissions on a downward slope. Until emissions get to zero, the climate problem will keep getting worse, so we have a long way to go. Governor Brown\u2019s new pledge is important not just because others may follow, but because the dynamic California economy can help invent much of the necessary technology. It is true that his zero-carbon goal for the state\u2019s economy is just an executive order and could be reversed. But in California, such newly announced goals from governors tend to be followed within a few years by legislation locking the targets into law.China\u2019s leaders have engaged in intensive dialogue with California on climate policy for more than a decade, and they consider the state\u2019s role to be more important than anything happening in Washington. That is fortunate, given the reprehensible efforts of the Trump administration to take America backward on climate.As we mentioned, it is not yet clear how a zero-carbon goal for an economy the size of California\u2019s can be met \u2014 especially in the time set by the governor, 27 years hence. Governor Brown leaves office at the beginning of next year, so he is making promises his successors will have to keep.What we do know is that California started setting climate goals during the administration of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican governor, and it has tended to meet or exceed them years early. Goals serve to organize the bureaucracy; they point up gaps in achievement that may need to be filled with detailed policies; they send a powerful signal to inventors that useful technologies or business concepts will find a market. For example, it was a California mandate, copied by other states, that pushed electric cars into the American marketplace.If China were to follow California\u2019s target in setting an ambitious low-emissions policy, the challenge would be enormous. How do you eliminate emissions from huge industries like steel making or aluminum smelting, or limit oil use in a country of 1.4 billion people pining for cars?Industrial techniques will need to be reinvented, and this work cannot drag out for decades. But that, in a sense, is the point. We are already seeing profound damages from global warming, and the situation is likely to worsen rapidly.The crisis is urgent; the time for half measures is past. Governor Brown has shown the world what really needs to be done. We hope other politicians will find the courage to follow in his footsteps, China\u2019s leaders above all.Advertisement"}

Nixon asks in a recording from Sept. 19, 1971, at a time when Ms. Fonda was vehemently protesting the Vietnam War. \u201cI feel so sorry for Henry Fonda, who\u2019s a nice man. She\u2019s a great actress. She looks pretty. But boy, she\u2019s \u2026 often on the wrong track.\u201dIt certainly surprised Ms. Fonda.\u201cI had no idea how she was going to structure it, and when it opened on the tape of Nixon\u2019s voice, I just thought that was so brilliant,\u201d she said, recalling how she had initially told Ms. Lacy, \u2018I don\u2019t want a movie star documentary, because if you\u2019re going to do a real documentary about me, there\u2019s a lot more to it than just my career.\u2019\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time, and this is the most important election that I have ever experienced,\u201d she said during a telephone interview from Los Angeles, in which she spoke about coming into her own, her current passions and her next acts.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Your public persona is that of a fiercely independent woman with little need for male support. Did you question Ms. Lacy\u2019s decision to define you by your men?You never felt that you lived up to your father\u2019s expectations \u2014 that he thought you were fat, that you made him ashamed. When did you stop seeing yourself through his eyes?Is that when you came to believe in your own worth and beauty?No, no, no, that didn\u2019t happen until I was in my 60s. I\u2019m still a work in progress. You know, when your father doesn\u2019t show up for you or isn\u2019t able to really show you that he loves you unconditionally, then you spend a lot of your life trying to be lovable rather than authentic.Your stance against the Vietnam War continues to inflame. Last month, protesters gathered at the Traverse City Film Festival, where Michael Moore gave you a lifetime achievement award. There was a veteran inside the theater who stood up, and I thought, \u201cWell, O.K., let him say his thing, and we will talk, and that will be cathartic for both of us.\u201d But instead, he said: \u201cIf I had a Congressional Medal of Honor, I would present it to you. I am so grateful that you helped end the war.\u201d It was very, very beautiful. The men and women who were outside were extremely well behaved, and I just feel badly that they don\u2019t understand the war. Because if they did, and they understood what was true then, I wouldn\u2019t be the lightning rod that I am. It would be the series of presidents and administrations, both Republican and Democrat, that they would be angry at, because we were lied to.What\u2019s the focus of your activism today? Grass-roots organizing. The organizations that are going door to door and helping people understand that the white working class is not the enemy of people of color, and vice versa. That we have to stand together against a common enemy, which is people that only care about money and power and don\u2019t give a hoot about average Americans.What do you think about #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up?I never thought I\u2019d live to see it happen. I think it emanated from Hollywood because the women who were speaking out were white and famous. And then it spread across sectors to the women who are far more vulnerable \u2014 farm workers, office workers, restaurant workers, domestic workers. If we\u2019re going to win this \u2014 by winning, I mean creating safety and dignity and respect for women of color in the workplaces \u2014 we also have to create economic equality. And we have to stand alongside women in other sectors of the economy, which is what I\u2019ve been doing.You\u2019ve said that until last year, you didn\u2019t realize that perhaps you weren\u2019t paid the same as your male co-stars. I didn\u2019t pay any attention. It never occurred to me that I was worthy to get paid the same as my male co-star. I was a good girl. Good girls don\u2019t talk about money. Good girls aren\u2019t ambitious. [Now] I ask and I fight. It\u2019s never too late.At an age when a lot of women feel rendered invisible, both personally and professionally, what are your secrets for coming out on top?This is the honest truth that I am telling you: I have always been invisible.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Picks Expert on Regulation for Federal Reserve Board", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump nominated Nellie Liang, a longtime Federal Reserve staff member who is an expert on financial regulation, on Wednesday to join the Fed\u2019s board of governors.Ms. Liang, 60, played a key role in the Fed\u2019s efforts to tighten oversight of the financial system after the 2008 crisis, including the creation of a new Fed department focused on monitoring financial stability.She is well known and well regarded in the close-knit world of central banking, and Mr. Trump\u2019s decision was applauded by her peers. Carl R. Tannenbaum, the chief economist at Northern Trust, called the nomination an \u201cinspired choice.\u201dIn a presentation last week at the Brookings Institution, Ms. Liang reiterated her support for tougher postcrisis regulations. \u201cThe regulatory and supervisory structure needs to be kept up-to-date with changes in the financial system, and to make it more resilient to a wider range of shocks,\u201d she said.Krishna Guha, the head of the central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, said Ms. Liang was likely to be open to efforts to streamline and perhaps to prune postcrisis safeguards. He added, however, that \u201cshe is unlikely to favor any wholesale pullback from the postcrisis regime.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s board oversees the central bank\u2019s work as a financial regulator and, together with the presidents of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional reserve banks, it also charts the course of monetary policy.Before the crisis, those jobs were viewed as relatively distinct, at least in good times. Experts on monetary policy generally agreed that the Fed and other central banks should raise and lower interest rates for the sole purpose of controlling the pace of inflation. Since the crisis, however, some experts, including Ms. Liang, have argued that central banks should pay attention to financial markets, too. If financial speculation is rising to unsustainable heights, it might make sense to raise interest rates.Officials are also wrestling with the role of regulation in popping asset bubbles. The Fed, for example, now has the power to constrain bank borrowing if the economy appears to be overheating by requiring the banks to raise a larger share of their funding in the form of capital.Some Fed officials have argued in recent months that the Fed should impose such a requirement.Ms. Liang, who must be confirmed by the Senate, would become the first Asian-American to serve on the Fed\u2019s board, and just the 10th woman. She has spent almost her entire professional life at the Fed. She graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1979, then completed a doctorate at the University of Maryland in 1986. That same year, she joined the Fed\u2019s staff in Washington as a research economist.She played a critical role in the \u201cstress tests\u201d of major banks in 2009.The next year, Ms. Liang was chosen by the Fed chairman at the time, Ben S. Bernanke, to lead a new division of the central bank focused on monitoring financial stability. She served in that role from 2010 until 2017, when she left for a job at the Brookings Institution.Mr. Trump has now made nominations for all three of the open seats on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board. Mr. Trump previously nominated Michelle Bowman, the chief banking regulator for the State of Kansas, and Marvin Goodfriend, a conservative professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University.Ms. Bowman and Mr. Goodfriend are awaiting Senate confirmation.Richard Clarida was sworn in on Monday as the Fed\u2019s vice chairman.If Mr. Trump\u2019s remaining nominees are confirmed, it could be the first time since 2013 that the Fed would operate with a full complement of governors.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter: @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

Even worse, the statistics have become more misleading over time.The stock market, for example, has completely recovered from the financial crisis, and then some. Stocks are now worth almost 60 percent more than when the crisis began in 2007, according to a inflation-adjusted measure from Moody\u2019s Analytics. But wealthy households own the bulk of stocks. Most Americans are much more dependent on their houses. That\u2019s why the net worth of the median household is still about 20 percent lower than it was in early 2007. When television commentators drone on about the Dow, they\u2019re not talking about a good measure of most people\u2019s wealth.All the while, the federal government and much of the news media continue to act as if the same economic measures that made sense decades ago still make sense today. Habit comes before accuracy.And there is no reason that data reform needs to be limited to G.D.P. The Labor Department could change the monthly jobs report to give more attention to other unemployment numbers. It could also provide more data on wages, rather than only broad averages. The Federal Reserve, for its part, could publish quarterly estimates of household wealth by economic class.\u201cAs someone who advises policymakers, I can tell you there is often this shock: \u2018The economy is growing. Why aren\u2019t people feeling it,\u2019\u201d Boushey says. \u201cThe answer is: Because they literally aren\u2019t feeling it.\u201d She argues \u2014 rightly, I think \u2014 that the government should not focus on creating wholly new statistics. It should instead change and expand the ones that are already followed closely. Doing so could force the media and policymakers to talk about economic well-being at the same time that they are talking about economic indicators.It\u2019s worth remembering that the current indicators are not a naturally occurring phenomenon. They are political creations, with the flaws, limitations and choices that politics usually involves.Several years later, he received a promotion. He was named the first head of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a job he would hold for 20 years. His original methods from Massachusetts influenced the way that the federal government began calculating unemployment data, and still do to this day. The fact that the official rate ignores millions of discouraged workers is \u2014 although Wright wouldn\u2019t have used this phrase \u2014 a feature not a bug.The whole point of statistics is to describe reality. When a statistic no longer does so, it\u2019s time to find a new one \u2014 not to come up with a convoluted rationale that tries to twist reality to fit the statistic.After all these years, though, we haven\u2019t solved the problem. Maybe it takes a financial crisis to do so.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Strategic Iraqi City, a Week of Deadly Turmoil", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAGHDAD \u2014 Iraqi security forces stepped up patrols Saturday in the southern city of Basra, a strategically important oil port on the border with Iran where longstanding protests about quality of life have escalated into days of rioting and violence.The predominantly Shiite city is among the poorest areas of Iraq, despite the huge nearby oil reserves that drive the national economy. Although Basra has escaped the terrorist violence that has racked the country for years, its population has struggled with its own set of problems: high unemployment, crumbling infrastructure and rampant organized crime groups with leaders linked to powerful Shiite militias.The city sent tens of thousands of its young men to northern Iraq in 2014 to fight against the Islamic State. Now, as many of them have returned from battle to these same old problems, their anger has intensified, driven by a sense of frustration that their sacrifices at war haven\u2019t come with tangible socioeconomic gains.Since June, Basra residents have organized some of the largest street protests in years, demanding clean water, jobs and better infrastructure in a city that hosts a world-class stadium but where many residents live in crumbling dirt-brick houses in shantytowns.As happened this past week, the protests sometimes turn violent, with mobs destroying symbols of Iraqi political power or other landmarks that drive their rage, like those associated with Iran, which bankrolls many of the Shiite political movements and militias.In the past few days, the offices of local political parties were burned. So was the provincial council building.On Friday night, a mob shouting anti-Iran slogans rushed the perimeter of the sprawling Iranian consulate and burned the main gatehouse in which visitors register. Some of the protesters sprayed graffiti, and one wall read, \u201cDown with Iran, down with the militias.\u201dAbu Al-Hassan Alaa, 17 years old, said that he and his friends were motivated to target the Iranian structure because they opposed Iranian political interference in Iraq.\u201cIranian intervention in the affairs of our country is destroying Iraq,\u201d he said.The main consulate buildings remained undamaged, according to security officials.American officials joined Iranians in condemning the attack.Amid these violent street scenes, Iraqi security forces have opened fire. At least 15 people have died in the past week, and more than 200 were injured, according to local officials.The unrest highlights the deep fractures within Iraq\u2019s majority Shiite population and frustrations among society at large about what they see as ineptitude among their political leaders.Laith Hani, 46, said protesters should not be blamed for the violence; instead, politicians should be held accountable for the poor quality of life.\u201cVandalism started with these Shiite political parties,\u201d Mr. Hani said. \u201cThey are to blame.\u201dIn Baghdad, politicians scrambled for a response.Elections in May saw the lowest turnout since 2005, and political parties are deadlocked in an attempt to build a majority coalition in Parliament, in part because the country\u2019s major Shiite political factions have not agreed to work together.This political battle has complicated the situation in Basra. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who is fighting to stay in his position, replaced the local security commander after an outcry over the deaths of protesters earlier in the week.Shiite militias that belong to the government-sponsored Popular Mobilization Forces said they would also send men to quell the violence. The political faction that represents these militias hopes to choose the next prime minister candidate.At a special parliamentary session this past week a long line of leaders called for Basra\u2019s problems to be solved, but no one offered any concrete plans.Basra\u2019s summer temperatures routinely hit 120 degrees, but the city faces a critical electricity shortage. And even though the wide Tigris and Euphrates Rivers run through the center of town, many residents no longer have access to safe drinking water.An employee of The New York Times contributed reporting from Basra, Iraq.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA record number of women are running. Trump endorsements helped shape Republican races. And the Democrats are looking for a comeback. Here\u2019s what to know about the next 53 days.Primary season is over: Democrats and Republicans have chosen their standard-bearers and defined their major arguments, and the general election has begun. The midterm campaigns will not only determine the balance of power in Congress and the states, but also shape the strategies and identities of the two parties heading into the 2020 presidential race. Here are some of the main lessons we've taken from the primaries and the start of the fall campaign.Democrats hope to use the midterm elections to position themselves for a comeback in the 2020 presidential election, by retaking or capturing two swaths of the country President Trump carried in 2016: the industrial Midwest, stretching from Wisconsin to Pennsylvania, and the diverse Sun Belt battlegrounds of Florida, Arizona and Georgia.They have nominated starkly different sets of candidates in the two regions, representing two broad paths forward for the party. In the Midwest, the party has largely fielded well-known white politicians who are modestly to the left of center \u2014 figures like Richard Cordray, the former bank overseer in the Obama administration who is locked in a close race for governor in Ohio; and Gretchen Whitmer, the former Democratic leader in the Michigan State Senate who is leading in the governor\u2019s race. These candidates are seeking to reassemble the traditional, union-heavy Rust Belt Democratic coalition that frayed badly in 2016.Democrats are likely to gain across both regions, over all. But if they fare markedly better in one than another, it could heavily shape Democrats\u2019 thinking about 2020 and bolster either the primary candidates more focused on mobilizing Democrats or those determined to win back Trump voters.On the Democratic side, the appeal of female candidates appeared to transcend ideological fault lines in the party. Democrats nominated liberal women and moderate women, military veterans and activists, corporate lawyers and Bernie Sanders organizers. They nominated women who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic presidential campaign, and women who pledged never to help Nancy Pelosi, the barrier-breaking former House speaker, reclaim that job.Polls suggest the country is headed for a gaping gender gap in November, as moderate women flee the Trump-led Republican Party but white men remain mostly loyal. That could set up a powerful contrast in the new Congress between an incoming class of female lawmakers, and a president who has been accused by numerous women of serious sexual misconduct. And it could send a clear signal about the kind of leader Democrats want in 2020.Republican candidates jockeyed to see who could hug President Trump tighter in this year\u2019s primaries, while Democratic hopefuls veered to the left in a series of nominating contests. But even as the two parties seem to be pulling farther apart from one another, it was what they had in common this primary season that illustrates how much politics is being transformed: Republicans and Democrats in 2018 paid little heed to the decorous rules and precedents that have long governed how they choose candidates.For their part, a group of Democratic insurgents targeted incumbent lawmakers who had no whiff of scandal and reliably liberal voting records. And incumbency, corruption-free service and voting the right way did not prove sufficient for Representatives Joseph Crowley of New York and Michael P. Capuano of Massachusetts, who were upset by women of color, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, who argued that this moment demanded something more.The question now is whether 2018 represented a Trump-era anomaly \u2014 a norm-defying president and a radicalized opposition party \u2014 or the start of a new, less genteel primary culture.The Republican House majority is beleaguered, burdened by Mr. Trump\u2019s intense unpopularity and battling an imposing set of Democratic challengers with broad appeal. But at the outset of the general election, there is no more urgent problem for the party than the dozens of open seats Republicans must defend, where long-serving incumbents chose to retire and the party has struggled to field strong replacements.But their margin for error is painfully slim, and the booming economy is not offering them the sort of political lift they expected as Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive style overwhelms the campaign.Democrats must gain 23 seats to take control of the House, and they could win a quarter or more just from these vacancies. Democrats might have struggled to beat Representative Dave Reichert in the Seattle suburbs or Representative Frank LoBiondo in southern New Jersey, and it could have been impossible to defeat Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in Miami. But all three incumbents retired, and their seats are now tossups or leaning toward the Democrats.Republicans may yet keep their control of the House, with a powerfully funded, overwhelmingly negative campaign aimed at disqualifying Democratic challengers in swing seats. But their margin for error is painfully slim.With strategists in both parties increasingly convinced Democrats are well positioned to take control of the House, the center-stage drama this fall may be the battle for the Senate majority. And unlike in the House, no Senate Democrats were denied renomination or, more to the point, faced much in the way of a challenge at all from the left.So with the Senate election this year mostly being fought in conservative-leaning states that Mr. Trump carried in 2016, this turn of events has created an odd juxtaposition: The full success of the anti-Trump forces in the midterms could hinge on Senate Democratic candidates who spend more time discussing how they can work with the president than they do vowing to block his agenda.From North Dakota and West Virginia to Tennessee and Arizona, Democratic candidates for the Senate are benefiting from their party\u2019s disdain for Mr. Trump, raising money from all over the country and welcoming a new wave of motivated activists to their campaigns. But they are downplaying their objections to his presidency in a way that makes clear that they do not think red America is fully embracing the #resistance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Most Important Least-Noticed Economic Event of the Decade", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA localized recession in manufacturing-heavy areas can explain a lot of things. Sometimes the most important economic events announce themselves with huge front-page headlines, stock market collapses and frantic intervention by government officials.Other times, a hard-to-explain confluence of forces has enormous economic implications, yet comes and goes without most people even being aware of it.In 2015 and 2016, the United States experienced the second type of event.There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar.The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment. Overall economic growth slowed but remained in positive territory. The national unemployment rate kept falling. Anyone who didn\u2019t work in energy, agriculture or manufacturing could be forgiven for not noticing it at all.Yet understanding this slump \u2014 think of it as a mini-recession \u2014 is important in many ways. It helps explain some of the economic discontent evident in manufacturing-heavy areas during the 2016 elections. It offers warnings for where the next downturn might come from, and shows how important it is for policymakers to remain watchful and flexible about unpredictable shifts in the global economy.Most important, the mini-recession of 2015-16 offers a cautionary tale for any policymaker who might want to think of the United States as an economic island.The episode is stark evidence of the risk the Trump administration faces in threatening economic damage to negotiate leverage with other nations on trade and security. What happens overseas can return to American shores faster and more powerfully than once seemed possible.The mini-recession defies neatness. It\u2019s a story of spillovers and feedback loops and unintended consequences. But here\u2019s a summary:In 2015, Chinese leaders were concerned that their economy was experiencing a credit bubble, and they began imposing policies to restrain growth. These worked too well and caused a steep slowdown. That in turn caused troubles in other emerging nations for whom China was a major customer.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, finally growing confident that the United States economy was returning to health, made plans to end its era of ultra-easy monetary policy.As the Fed moved toward tighter money, its counterparts at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were going in the opposite direction. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and lower rates in the eurozone and Japan fueled a steep rise in the value of the dollar on global currency markets.That in turn made China\u2019s problems worse. China had long pegged the value of its currency to the dollar, so a stronger dollar was also making Chinese companies less competitive globally. When China attempted to reduce this burden by loosening the peg in August 2015, it faced capital outflows, making the economic situation worse.Moreover, across major emerging markets, many companies and banks had borrowed money in dollars, so a stronger dollar made their debt burdens more onerous.Put it all together, and when the Fed moved toward raising interest rates \u2014 as it eventually did in December 2015 \u2014 it was essentially making financial conditions tighter and therefore slowing growth across big swaths of the world.The slowdown across emerging markets, in turn, meant less demand for oil and many other commodities. That helped cause their prices to fall. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell to under $30 in February 2016 from around $106 in June 2014. The drops in the prices of metals like copper and aluminum, and agricultural products like corn and soybeans, were also steep.That only heightened the economic pain for the many emerging economies that are major commodity producers, such as Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia.Given falling prices and high debt loads among energy producers in the United States, the markets for stocks and riskier corporate bonds came under stress, especially in early 2016. That generated losses for investors and fears about the overall stability of the financial system.Each of these forces has connections to the others. It wasn\u2019t one problem, but an intersection of a bunch of them. That made it devilishly hard to diagnose, let alone to fix, even for the people whose job was to do just that.When Federal Reserve officials meet eight times a year to set interest rate policy, their job, assigned by Congress, is to figure out what is best for the United States economy. Their job isn\u2019t to set a policy that will be best for China or Brazil or Indonesia.Entering 2015, things were looking pretty good for the United States.Inflation was below the 2 percent level the Fed aims for, but the traditional economic models on which the central bankers had long relied predicted that it would start to rise thanks to a rapidly falling unemployment rate.Even when prices for oil and other commodities started falling in the middle of the year, the Fed\u2019s models viewed it as a positive for the overall economy. Sure, some oil drillers and farmers might experience lower incomes, but consumers everywhere would enjoy cheaper gasoline and grocery bills.Although officials spent a lot of time monitoring the global economy, the fact remained that the United States wasn\u2019t as dependent on exports as many smaller countries. The 2008 financial crisis had shown how the American and European banking systems were deeply intertwined, but the same couldn\u2019t be said of the ties with Chinese banks.In other words, through the summer of 2015 it sure looked to many Fed officials as if the sound move was to start raising interest rates.At the Treasury Department, which is responsible for the United States\u2019 currency policies, it seemed well into 2015 that the strengthening dollar was mostly benign.\u201cThere was a sense that the U.S. was doing well and the rest of the world was not doing very well,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, a Treasury under secretary at the time and now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cIt was driven by strong U.S. fundamentals.\u201dBut in late summer 2015, financial markets started to react more violently to the feedback loop of global currencies and commodities. It started to seem as if some of the old rules of thumb \u2014 about how a rising dollar or falling oil prices might affect the economy \u2014 might not apply.Perhaps the economics models used by forecasters had become outdated, failing to fully account for the ways surging energy production had become more intertwined with the manufacturing sector and the financial markets.\u201cThese things were all interconnected in different ways, and they all cycled back on the same industries and parts of the economy,\u201d said Jay Shambaugh, a member of the Obama White House Council of Economic Advisers at the time. Still, distilling that complex story into crisp memos for senior officials was no easy task.\u201cYou have to make memos short and to the point in the White House, and it was hard to say what exactly we thought was happening,\u201d he said.Behind closed doors at the Fed, officials started debating whether this outburst of volatility in markets really posed a risk to the overall economy. Should they stick to their plans to raise interest rates steadily, or slow down?Over two days in October, the debate played out publicly.Stan Fischer, the vice chairman of the Fed, was reluctant to adjust the planned rate increases, not wishing to let swings in financial markets dictate policy.\u201cWe do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy,\u201d he said in a speech in Lima, Peru, on Oct. 11, 2015.Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who had worked on international issues at the Treasury, was quite a bit more worried.Ms. Brainard was right.The vicious circle of a stronger dollar, weaker emerging market growth and lower commodity prices caused spending on certain types of capital goods to plummet starting in mid-2015.Spending on agricultural machinery in 2016 fell 38 percent from 2014 levels; for petroleum and natural gas structures \u2014 think oil drilling rigs \u2014 the number was down a whopping 60 percent.The oil and gas exploration boom tied to fracking technology came to a halt with energy prices at rock-bottom levels, and with it sales of equipment tied to that boom. With the fall in domestic capital investment in those industries and with weakness overseas, companies in related industries took it on the chin. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, had 30 percent lower revenue in 2016 than 2014.In large segments of the economy, by contrast, it was business as usual. Business spending on investments like computers and office buildings kept rising, as did consumer spending.Still, the industrial sector downturn was powerful enough to turn a strong expansion into a weak one. Overall growth fell to 1.3 percent in the four quarters ended in mid-2016, from 3.4 percent in the preceding year.The national economy kept adding jobs. But Harris County, Tex., which encompasses energy-centric Houston and its near suburbs, shed 0.8 percent of its jobs in that span. In Peoria, Ill., hometown of Caterpillar, employment fell 3.2 percent.In effect, this was a localized recession \u2014 severe in certain places, but concentrated enough that it did not throw the overall United States economy into contraction.But it could have been worse.When Janet Yellen assumed leadership of the Federal Reserve in early 2014, she inherited an economy that had been expanding steadily for years, with a great deal of help from the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies.Deciding how and when to pull that support \u2014 when to raise interest rates, which had been near zero for more than six years \u2014 was set to be the defining choice of her tenure.In 2015, with signs that the United States economy was returning to health, she and her colleagues believed it was time to begin raising interest rates. She is a leading labor market scholar who spent a career studying, among other things, how a tight labor market can eventually feed through to inflation.Ms. Yellen elected not to raise rates in September, waiting for more evidence that the economy was truly on track and that the emerging market troubles wouldn\u2019t do too much damage to the domestic economy. But by December she judged that the situation had stabilized enough to raise rates.At the same time, the Fed revealed forecasts indicating that its senior officials expected to raise interest rates four more times in 2016. Within weeks, global markets were sending a message: Not so fast.In mid-February 2016, the financial leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful nations were set to convene in a Shanghai for the periodic G20 summit. With global markets in turmoil, the great question was: Can the officials rein in these forces?Three weeks after the summit, the Fed had another policy meeting. Rather than raise interest rates further as had been envisioned in December, Fed officials declined to raise rates \u2014 and steeply reduced their expectations of how much further they would raise rates over the remainder of 2016.Together, these steps were enough to end the vicious cycle. The dollar stopped appreciating and started dropping. Oil prices bottomed out and began a recovery. In the United States, capital spending was growing again by the summer of 2016.Ms. Yellen said it\u2019s not so. She said in an interview that there was an extensive exchange of views and information with the Chinese delegation in Shanghai, but that there were no promises or explicit agreements.\u201cI realize it looked to much of the world like some kind of secret handshake deal,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a deal. This was the global economy and capital markets affecting the U.S. outlook, and the Fed being sensitive to that, taking that into account and its influencing policy appropriately.\u201dThe Fed, she said, did what it thought was best for the United States economy without knowing exactly what the Chinese would do.Mr. Sheets, the former Treasury official, also dismissed the idea of some secret agreement.\u201cIt\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were a lot of meetings. A lot of bilaterals and quadrilaterals. You meet with your counterparts and talk about the global economy and think about the challenges and what might be done. But there was nothing agreed behind closed doors that was not part of the formal statement.\u201dEven if there was no formal secret agreement, the result \u2014 leaders of the world\u2019s two biggest economies squarely focused on the risks that the situation presented \u2014 turned out to be enough.The impact of the global commodity-currency spiral of 2015-16 is evident from a glance at the economic statistics. It is less so in the economic debates of 2018.First, while the Trump administration has claimed full credit for a surge in business investment, the bounce-back from the mini-recession is a major factor.Second, the mini-recession might well have affected some political attitudes during the 2016 election. While the economy was in pretty good shape for people in large cities on the coasts, 2016 was rough for a lot of people in local economies heavily reliant on drilling, mining, farming or making the machines that support those industries.Third, economic policymakers need to display the flexibility to respond to incoming information, even when it doesn\u2019t fit their own forecasts or preconceptions.If Ms. Yellen had been more stubborn about sticking to the plan to keep raising rates through 2016 because of her training as a labor market economist, the result might well have been an actual recession. \u201cShe\u2019s always learning,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, \u201cand not so egotistical that she\u2019s wedded to one view of the world.\u201dFinally, it shows the global economy is so interconnected that events in Shanghai or S\u00e3o Paulo can cause unpredictable effects in faraway places.In the last year, the Trump administration has been lobbing tariffs at China and other major economic partners to extract more advantageous terms for trade. But the mini-recession warns of the risk of ricochet.Like it or not, the complexity of our global connections means that policy can\u2019t just focus on the home front. In 2016, we learned that lesson the hard way, even if not everybody was paying attention.An earlier version of this article misstated the year when the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was around $106. It was 2014, not 2015.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Billionaires Can Seem Like Saviors to Media Companies, but They Come With Risks", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoughly a century ago, men like William Randolph Hearst, Joseph Pulitzer and Henry Luce dominated the media landscape. These moguls built their publishing empires and used them to intimidate rivals, espouse favored causes and settle scores.Today, members of a new Gilded Age are again in control of many of the country\u2019s most venerable media outlets. Only now, it is tech entrepreneurs, casino magnates and hedge fund billionaires who are seizing control of the press, simply by writing a check.With the deal, Mr. Benioff joined an elite club of relatively new press barons that includes the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post; Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and the head of the Emerson Collective, who acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic; and Michael R. Bloomberg, who owns Businessweek and Bloomberg News.At a moment when many print publications are struggling to survive, the largess of a wealthy owner can seem like a godsend. But there are also fresh concerns, some based on recent experience, that these individuals are assuming an unhealthy amount of influence.\u201cEven good billionaires need to have less of a role in our public life,\u201d said Anand Giridharadas, author of \u201cWinners Take All,\u201d a new book about the global elite. \u201cThey are buying up the free press, which is meant to hold them accountable.\u201dBeyond the marquee names, local billionaires now own the daily newspapers in Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Boston. Smaller outlets \u2014 including The Village Voice, The New Republic and Gothamist \u2014 were also bought by wealthy individuals in recent years.And all of this is happening as the business model for print and online journalism remains precarious at best.\u201cWe have a new era, particularly in the last few years, of billionaire owners from the new economy who are intrigued by this old dilemma,\u201d said Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, a journalism advocacy group.In some cases, these new owners succeed in revitalizing the publications they acquire, injecting them with new energy and freeing them from the pressures of short-term profits, while preserving editorial independence.And in Minnesota, a local businessman, Glen Taylor, has drawn praise for his ownership of The Minneapolis Star Tribune, which he bought for about $100 million in 2014.But just as often, it seems, the new owners of newspapers and magazines can sap newsroom morale, or quickly discover that they have little tolerance for financial losses, or unions.\u201cBeing owned by a local billionaire is not necessarily an act of charity,\u201d Mr. Rosenstiel said. \u201cThere are clearly billionaires who are buying up publications because they want to influence political discourse in the country.\u201dEven John Henry, who made a fortune with his investment firm and is well regarded as the owner of The Boston Globe, has recently expressed some distaste for the economics of print media.For much of the 20th century, print publications were largely owned by private companies \u2014 often helmed by families like the Scrippses and the Chandlers \u2014 that had started a publication in one city and gradually expanded.By the 1970s, consolidation and ample profits from print advertising led many of these companies to go public.But in the late 1990s, advertising on the internet began to chip away at print profits. And in recent years, many once-proud print empires have consolidated, others have been sold for parts, and some papers and magazines are simply going out of business.Amid this turmoil, the new generation of wealthy buyers has emerged. But while buying a high-wattage publication can deliver an owner a certain amount of status and prestige, it can also invite controversy.President Trump, displeased with coverage of his administration in The Washington Post, has taken to attacking Amazon on Twitter, even though Mr. Bezos \u2014 not Amazon \u2014 owns the newspaper.Walter Isaacson, a former editor of Time, said that for most of his career, he had believed that the best owners for media companies were publicly traded corporations, where there was less of a chance for a wealthy owner to meddle.That changed, he said, during his tenure at Time.\u201cThen I went through the disaster of Time Warner, a company that only cared about short-term stock price and didn\u2019t have a feel for journalism,\u201d he said.Now, Mr. Isaacson said, \u201cI have come to the belief that a sole proprietor, especially a benevolent and public spirited one, is a good thing in troubled times.\u201dMr. Giridharadas, however, remains skeptical that ultrarich individuals, however public spirited, are the best owners for the free press.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the powerful having an oligopoly of the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only amount of power that a billionaire should have over a paper they own is zero.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Probably not.The student loan market is much smaller than the mortgage market. And the main lender is the federal government, so even a surge of defaults would barely touch the banking system, unlike the mortgage meltdown.The bigger issue is whether growing amounts of student debt may be a drag on consumers. Some think it could be playing a role in the decline of homeownership over the last decade, an important driver of spending in the consumption-led American economy.After the crisis, central banks slashed their interest rates. Investors moved their money out of government bonds, which were paying essentially nothing. And they piled into corporate bonds, which typically pay slightly higher rates.American companies were more than happy to satisfy investors\u2019 ravenous appetites \u2014 and they did so by selling gobs of debt.Corporate debt oustandingAs a share of G.D.P.50%40Averagesince 199830Average from1952 to 19982010RECESSIONS01952\u201960\u201970\u201980\u2019902000\u201908\u201918Corporate debt oustandingAs a share of G.D.P.50%40Averagesince 199830Average from1952 to 19982010RECESSIONS01952\u201960\u201970\u201980\u2019902000\u201908\u201918There are signs that the borrowing binge may have gone too far. Debt issued by non-financial companies is near its highest levels, as a share of the United States economy, since World War II. In the past, such indebtedness has been followed by a rise in defaults.Even in the market for the safest corporate bonds, funds have been flowing to the borrowers that have some of the lowest credit ratings \u2014 the category known as BBB. Roughly $1.4 trillion of the debt is currently outstanding, making it the largest single piece of the investment-grade corporate bond market, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s.More than $500 billion of these BBB-rated bonds are just one downgrade away from being junk, according to Fitch Ratings. A wave of downgrades could cause losses for investors, potentially scaring them from lending more.

But their standards are nowhere near as lax as the subprime mortgages that preceded the 2008 bust.It\u2019s much harder for regulators, investors and banks to keep track of where the risks lie in this so-called shadow banking sector, potentially allowing big problems to bubble up undetected.50%Share of mortgagesoriginated by nonbanks403020100\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916Share of mortgages originated by nonbanks50%40302010020022004200620082010201220142016Another pocket of concern is the fast-growing market for so-called leveraged loans.

{"Headline": "Cheaper Battery Is Unveiled as a Step to a Carbon-Free Grid", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLithium-ion batteries have become essential for powering electric cars and storing energy generated by solar panels and wind turbines. But their drawbacks are also by now familiar: They use scarce minerals, are vulnerable to fires and explosions, and are pricey.A plentiful, safe and more affordable alternative would be worth a lot.On Wednesday, an energy company headed by the California billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong announced that it had developed a rechargeable battery operating on zinc and air that can store power at far less than the cost of lithium-ion batteries.Tests of the zinc energy-storage systems have helped power villages in Africa and Asia as well as cellphone towers in the United States for the last six years, without any backup from utilities or the electric grid, Dr. Soon-Shiong said.\u201cIt could change and create completely new economies using purely the power of the sun, wind and air,\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong, a surgeon and a biotechnology entrepreneur, said in an interview in Los Angeles before the announcement.The battery units, in conjunction with solar arrays, can be combined to create a microgrid system powering a village or a larger area, Dr. Soon-Shiong said. They have been deployed to support 110 villages in nine countries in Asia and Africa \u2014 including places that otherwise relied on generators or even lacked electricity, he said.The International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank fostering private-sector projects in developing countries, was an early investor in NantEnergy, and an agency representative sits on the company\u2019s board.The United States Department of Energy made development grants to NantEnergy (formerly known as Fluidic Energy) totaling $5 million, Dr. Soon-Shiong said.NantEnergy, based in Phoenix and in El Segundo, Calif., says it expects to expand the use of its product in telecommunications towers and eventually extend it to home energy storage, beginning in California and New York. Beyond that, it anticipates use in electric cars, buses, trains and scooters.His energy company says it is the first to commercialize the use of zinc air batteries and has more than 100 related patents. It is taking orders for delivery next year and sees the potential for a $50 billion market.Dr. Soon-Shiong said the cost of his zinc air battery had dropped steadily since development began. NantEnergy says the technology costs less than $100 per kilowatt-hour, a figure that some in the energy industry have cited as low enough to transform the electric grid into a round-the-clock carbon-free system.The prevailing cost of lithium-ion technology varies, depending on the scale and application. Yogi Goswami, distinguished university professor and director of the Clean Energy Center at the University of South Florida, estimated that it is most likely $300 to $400 a kilowatt-hour.Engineers want to turn the dam into a vast reservoir of excess electricity from the solar farms and wind turbines that represent the power sources of the future.\u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d Dr. Goswami, who was not involved in the effort, said of the advances claimed by NantEnergy. \u201cYou have to have storage.\u201dDr. Goswami said he warned in congressional testimony a quarter-century ago that storage advances would be needed as the use of solar and wind power grew. That imperative has been somewhat overshadowed as the fracking boom made natural gas plentiful.\u201cUntil recently it didn\u2019t make any sense to worry about storage because we had cheap gas,\u201d said Mark Cooper, senior research fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at the Vermont Law School.But energy storage is increasingly needed to manage the ebb and flow of solar and wind energy that sometimes forces places like California to pay other states to take surplus power. And that need is driving innovation and decreasing cost.\u201cObviously it comes at a point where everyone is already looking for storage,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cCapitalism isn\u2019t going to deal with a problem where there isn\u2019t scarcity. In capitalism what we get is relentless reductions in cost.\u201dIn addition to their deployment in Asia and Africa, NantEnergy\u2019s batteries have been used to power more than 1,000 communications towers in the United States, Latin America and Southeast Asia. They include a Duke Energy location in North Carolina that withstood the effects of Hurricane Florence recently and Hurricane Irma last year.Sherif Abdelrazek, a senior engineer at Duke Energy, said that because the zinc air battery does not pose fire hazards as lithium-ion batteries can, it does not need external cooling systems to prevent overheating.The system\u2019s success means the Duke tower no longer needs to be connected to the electric grid, he said. As a result, 13 acres of land in the Great Smoky Mountains that was used for power lines is being turned over to the National Park Service.NantEnergy\u2019s announcement that it had reached the $100-per-kilowatt-hour threshold made the device even more attractive, Mr. Abdelrazek said.The product design is simple: plastic components and shell casing, a circuit board and zinc oxide, all in a package the size of a briefcase.In charging the batteries, electricity from solar installations is stored by converting zinc oxide to zinc and oxygen. In the discharge process, the system produces energy by oxidizing the zinc with air.The NantEnergy battery can provide power for up to 72 hours on a single charge, meaning it could have lasted throughout the period of cloud cover and stormy weather from Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas.Dan Reicher, an assistant secretary of energy in the Clinton administration, said successful development of a rechargeable zinc air battery could be a milestone in energy storage. He said the challenge had been to make such batteries reliable for continuous use. \u201cThat\u2019s an attractive characteristic if it\u2019s true,\u201d he said.But he cautioned that a battery\u2019s cost per kilowatt-hour depended on the application and scale. And he said the company\u2019s technology would have to live up to scrutiny. \u201cPeople do make claims and offer what they feel like is a legitimate set of data,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always elated to hear progress in storage, but you have to be careful.\u201dLyndon Rive, a co-founder of SolarCity \u2014 now a part of his cousin Elon Musk\u2019s company, Tesla \u2014 said recently that solar and storage innovations were likely to transform the electricity market. \u201cOver all, the trajectory is for solar to be the No. 1 source,\u201d said Mr. Rive, who left Tesla after the two companies merged two years ago.Dr. Soon-Shiong said he knew Mr. Musk \u2014 a fellow South African native \u2014 and considered him a visionary for his accomplishments in electric vehicles and energy storage. \u201cWe both are trying to make the world a better place,\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong said.Tesla has based its businesses on lithium-ion technology, and Mr. Musk has told shareholders that the company may get the cost of lithium-ion cells down to $100 a kilowatt-hour this year.NantEnergy made its announcement weeks after California mandated 100 percent carbon-free electricity in the state by 2045. Legislators have also approved a bill providing about $1 billion in subsidies for residential energy storage.\u201cCalifornia is obviously in need of that kind of breakthrough to meet our goals,\u201d said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group. \u201cI cannot claim to be in absolute certainty that this is everything they say it is, but it\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s this kind of breakthrough that we expect from our innovators.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of a California move to provide subsidies for energy storage. Such a bill has been approved by legislators; it has not been signed into law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A World of Tyrants and Graves", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIlham Ahmed is a Kurdish politician and co-chairwoman of the Syrian Democratic Council, a group of progressive, democratic parties governing the Northern Syria Federation.Throughout history, violence has been a primary tool of totalitarian regimes. And when a tyrannical authority responds to legitimate demands for liberty with indiscriminate violence, its people must decide whether to flee to parts unknown or to stay and fight for their freedom.In Syria, we live with this dynamic every day.My group, the Syrian Democratic Council, is a multiethnic coalition that makes up the political arm of the Syrian Democratic Forces. We have resisted the Assad regime for years. But what began as peaceful protests soon evolved into a more complex movement that has been compelled to adopt violence as a means of protection and as the only effective way to establish liberal democracy in Syria.The Syrian regime that portrays itself as a secular government established its power decades ago by using violence against its opponents and anyone who disagreed with it. It established a dynastic dictatorship \u2014 a far cry from the republican system that allegedly exists today.The real rulers in Syria were not politicians who could be held accountable by their constituents, but rather covert security forces that acted as the legislature, executive and judiciary. Judge, jury and executioner were all in the hands of the secret police. Among the most infamous of its branches was the Air Force Intelligence Directorate, which saw the rise of Hafez al-Assad. Mr. Assad used his influence there, and his later role as minister of defense, to seize the presidency in Syria in 1970 before passing rule to his son, Bashar al-Assad.In March 2011, young women and men marched in the streets calling for peaceful change and democratic transition in Syria. They were filled with hope and new ideas. None of these men and women thought that they would be forced to embrace violence \u2014 the same means used by the government to stay in power \u2014 in their struggle for democracy.The Assad regime responded to these protests with brutality. Children who had been arrested for spraying antigovernment graffiti on a school were imprisoned and beaten. People took up arms to protect their families, their homes and their neighborhoods. The regime responded in kind, laying the groundwork for extremist groups to legitimize themselves as protectors of the people while mobilizing Syria\u2019s youths under the banner of radical ideologies.In northern Syria, the Syrian Democratic Council realized the problem that this violent dynamic presented early on. The line between fighting for democracy and fighting for our lives is razor sharp, and the two are not mutually exclusive.Yes, we use weapons to protect ourselves, but our society has not fallen into chaos. Those who use violence must be held accountable, even when they use it as a last resort. We have established supervised local units of fighters that are allowed to use violence only for self-defense. Meanwhile, Mr. Assad\u2019s military continues to attack civilians with chemical weapons. Whereas we employ fighters whose power is limited by the rule of law, Mr. Assad\u2019s weapons are the law.We have not abandoned other means of struggle, either. We organize protests in Syria and abroad, and have set up fair elections in areas protected by the Syrian Democratic Forces. We have proposed a decentralized solution to governance, as we believe that power in the hands of only a few has been responsible for so much of the recent bloodshed and oppression in Syria.Our efforts serve as a reminder of what democracy really is: the rule of the people, by the people, for the people. Since Mr. Assad\u2019s ascent to power, democracy has served as little more than a cover for expanding his control. The government held elections in 2016, but only in regions it ruled. As a result, the vote overwhelmingly favored the regime, propping up its legitimacy. In the background, activists, journalists and even whole populations continued to be imprisoned, displaced or murdered.Today, the Syrian Democratic Council helps maintain an educational system for more than 80,000 students in the Jazira region, and for more than 50,000 in the Afrin region. We provide education in Kurdish, Aramaic and Arabic, and have established universities in Afrin and in the cities of Qamishli and Kobani.Building a new Syria helps ensure a proper balance between violent and peaceful resistance. While war may make a new democracy possible, a democratic society cannot survive in peacetime without infrastructure and education.Managing such reconstruction amid the ravages of war is a constant struggle. We are literally rebuilding Kobani from ruins. Even while under Turkey\u2019s economic embargo, we began industrializing and diversifying Afrin\u2019s economy. Then the city of Afrin was invaded and occupied by jihadist mercenaries, sponsored by the Turkish government, who have displaced its people and engaged in widespread looting.As long as Syria, or any other country, has a leader who desires more control than a liberal democracy can provide, violence will continue to spread. At a time when hundreds of thousands of people have been killed simply to consolidate power for a few, democracy must be defended by more than just rhetoric. To believe otherwise is to resign oneself to a world of nothing but tyrants and graves.Advertisement"}

Mr. Ma turns 54 on Monday, which is also a holiday in China known as Teacher\u2019s Day.The retirement makes Mr. Ma one of the first founders among a generation of prominent Chinese internet entrepreneurs to step down from their companies. Firms including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com have flourished in recent years, growing to nearly rival American internet behemoths like Amazon and Google in their size, scope and ambition. For Chinese tycoons to step aside in their 50s is rare; they usually remain at the top of their organizations for many years.Mr. Ma, a natural salesman and charismatic leader, co-founded Alibaba with 17 others \u2014 some of them his students \u2014 out of his apartment in Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province in 1999.Alibaba started as an online marketplace for businesses to sell their products to other businesses. But it did not take off until it began the Taobao marketplace in 2003, which merchants used to sell goods directly to consumers. Alibaba later rolled out Alipay, an online payment service, to facilitate transactions in a country where few people had credit cards. Alipay later became Ant Financial, the financial subsidiary that Mr. Ma also controls.Today, Alibaba\u2019s empire encompasses e-commerce, online banking, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment \u2014 and even a corporate messaging service similar to Slack. The company owns or holds stakes in some of China\u2019s most important media assets, including the Twitter-like social media site Weibo and the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper The South China Morning Post.Among China\u2019s biggest companies, Alibaba is viewed as one of the firms with the deepest ranks of management talent. Many of the co-founders are still around, and professionals who joined the company later are now in charge.While Alibaba has become dominant in China, it has faced a tougher time expanding internationally.

{"Headline": "Let Teenagers Sleep In", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting schools before 8:30 a.m. shows a tragic disregard for both the mental health of children and for science.Mr. Nicholls is a journalist and a high school science teacher.This article has been updated to reflect news developments.A fresh-faced batch of teenagers just began a new school year, but will they get the most out of it? In the mornings, many are forced to get to school much too early. And at night, ubiquitous screens are a lure that\u2019s hard to resist. This double whammy is a perfect lesson in sleep deprivation.It is important to understand why teenagers have a particularly hard time getting enough sleep, and what adults need to do to help.First, a reminder of the basic biology: After puberty, adolescents are no longer the morning larks of their younger years. They become rewired as night owls, staying awake later and then sleeping in. This is not part of a feckless project to frustrate parents, but is driven by changes in the way the brain responds to light.The growth in screen time is particularly problematic for sleep. Not only does it eat into the time available for rest, but the blue light emitted by LEDs, TVs, tablets and smartphones suppresses the body\u2019s secretion of melatonin, the hormone that signals it\u2019s time to sleep. Overdosing on screens at night effectively tells the brain it\u2019s still daytime, delaying the body\u2019s cues to sleep even further. Parents should set real limits on screen time, model responsible use of devices and praise children who show signs of regulating their own media consumption. In the hour before bedtime, there should be a moratorium on bright lights in the home, avoiding devices and harsh LED bulbs often found in kitchens and bathrooms.But Ms. Ziporyn Snider remains upbeat: \u201cEventually a bill like this, created in the best interests of children, will pass. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201dParents need to be vocal about the reasons change is so important, joining forces with community leaders, sleep scientists, health professionals and educators to put school start times on the local, then state agendas.Advertisement"}

Did the Russians have anything to do with President Trump\u2019s becoming the Republican candidate in the first place? Did Russia interfere in the primaries?\u2014 Jim Houghton, Encino, Calif.As we say in our story, it certainly must have been welcome news at the Kremlin that the one person to emerge from a very crowded field of Republican candidates was someone who advocated better ties to Russia. That said, we don\u2019t know of any evidence that the Russians had a hand in helping the Trump campaign win the nomination.Is there any solid evidence that anyone actually voted for Mr. Trump instead of Hillary Clinton as a result of the fake accounts?\u2014 David Merzig, Oneonta, N.Y.Why didn\u2019t the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. realize what was going on? Where were American spies in Russia? Some news reports indicate that the United States has an informant in Russian President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle; is it possible that the person knew but did not want to disclose the information?\u2014 Kristian Wachtell, CopenhagenHow do we know the Russians didn\u2019t hack the voting machines and voter registration databases in swing states to allow Mr. Trump to win? How would we know?\u2014 Ron Balassanian, San FranciscoWhat is the most direct evidence currently known connecting Mr. Trump with any Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election?\u2014 John English, East Lansing, Mich.What I don\u2019t understand is why Russia wanted Mr. Trump as president and not Mrs. Clinton? Why are Russia and Mr. Putin better off with Mr. Trump?\u2014 Tony Olds, Lansing, Mich.In practice, the Trump administration has produced a contradictory record: Mr. Trump has kept up the Putin-friendly rhetoric even as his cabinet has persuaded him to take a series of tough actions, escalating sanctions, expelling Russian diplomats suspected of spying and supplying defensive weapons to Ukraine.Is Mr. Putin seeking to overtake the United States in terms of dominance and presence on the world stage? Does Mr. Putin believe that with President Trump\u2019s help Russia will emerge as a rejuvenated world power, with the United States in a diminished capacity?\u2014 John C. Turley, ChicagoWhat Mr. Putin has demonstrated, however, is that by using the cheap, new tools of hacking, leaking and social media manipulation, Russia can cause outsize trouble for the United States and other countries. Presumably one of Mr. Putin\u2019s goals is to convince Russians and their neighbors that the United States is a deeply troubled, bitterly divided country whose brand of democracy should be a model for no one. Russia is a much-discussed, much-feared player on the world stage, and that may be enough for Mr. Putin.Has there ever been successful foreign interference in American internal affairs on this scale before? Or did Russia achieve something that had never been done before during the election?\u2014 Jeffrey Rahman, Washington StateWhat changed by 2016 was the availability of hacking, leaking and social media chicanery as inexpensive tools for political meddling \u2014 and Mr. Putin\u2019s willingness to risk using such tools aggressively.Who decides whether or not the results of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation are made public? Who decides the form of that reporting? I\u2019m sensing we may be heading for a Pentagon Papers moment.\u2014 Renata Simone, MassachusettsFrom there, Mr. Rosenstein will face a decision about whether to deliver the report to Congress, which could then make Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings public. The conventional wisdom is that there will be intense political pressure on Mr. Rosenstein to deliver any report to Congress, and it seems far more likely than not that Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings will officially be made public.What are all of the \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201cthoughts\u201d of Mr. Putin you describe and state throughout the article based on?

{"Headline": "The Recovery Threw the Middle-Class Dream Under a Benz", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrisis and ConsequencesOnce a year or so, the economist Diane Swonk ventures into the basement of her 1891 Victorian house outside Chicago and opens a plastic box containing the items that mean the most to her: awards, wedding pictures, the clothes she was wearing at the World Trade Center on the day it was attacked. But what she seeks out again and again is a bound diary of the events of the financial crisis and their aftermath.\u201cIt\u2019s useful to go back and see what a chaotic time it was and how terrifying it was,\u201d she said. \u201cThat time is seared in my mind. I looked at it again recently, and all the pain came flooding back.\u201dThe most profound of these is that the uneven nature of the recovery compounded a long-term imbalance in the accumulation of wealth. As a consequence, what it means to be secure has changed. Wealth, real wealth, now comes from investment portfolios, not salaries. Fortunes are made through an initial public offering, a grant of stock options, a buyout or another form of what high-net-worth individuals call a liquidity event.Data from the Federal Reserve show that over the last decade and a half, the proportion of family income from wages has dropped from nearly 70 percent to just under 61 percent. It\u2019s an extraordinary shift, driven largely by the investment profits of the very wealthy. In short, the people who possess tradable assets, especially stocks, have enjoyed a recovery that Americans dependent on savings or income from their weekly paycheck have yet to see. Ten years after the financial crisis, getting ahead by going to work every day seems quaint, akin to using the phone book to find a number or renting a video at Blockbuster.The financial crisis didn\u2019t just kill the dream of getting rich from your day job. It also put an end to a fundamental belief of the middle class: that owning a home was always a good idea because prices moved in only one direction \u2014 up. The bubble, while it lasted, gave millions in the middle class a sense of validation of their financial acumen, and made them feel as if they had done the Right Thing.In theory, if you lost your job, or suffered some other kind of financial setback, you could always sell into a real estate market that was forever rising. Ever-higher home prices became a steam valve, and the \u201cgreater fool\u201d theory substituted for any conventional measure of value.The kindling for the fire that consumed Wall Street and nearly the entire economy was mortgages that should never have been taken out in the first place. Homeowners figured the more house the better, whether or not their income could support the monthly payment, while greedy banks and middlemen were all too happy to encourage them.When the bubble burst, the bedrock investment for many families was wiped out by a combination of falling home values and too much debt. A decade after this debacle, the typical middle-class family\u2019s net worth is still more than $40,000 below where it was in 2007, according to the Federal Reserve. The damage done to the middle-class psyche is impossible to price, of course, but no one doubts that it was vast.Banks were hurt, too, but aside from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the pain proved transitory. Bankers themselves were never punished for their sins. In one form or another \u2014 the Troubled Asset Relief Program, quantitative easing, the Fed\u2019s discount window \u2014 the financial sector was supported in spectacular fashion.Worsening the picture, the post-crisis era has been marked by an increased disparity in wealth between white, Hispanic and African-American members of the middle class. That\u2019s according to an analysis of Fed data by the Pew Research Center, which found that families in the latter two groups were more dependent on housing as their principal form of investment. Not only were both minority groups harder hit by foreclosures, but Hispanics were also twice as likely as other Americans to be living in Sun Belt states where the housing crash was most severe.In 2016, net worth among white middle-income families was 19 percent below 2007 levels, adjusted for inflation. But among blacks, it was down 40 percent, and Hispanics saw a drop of 46 percent. For many, old-fashioned hard work has simply not been a viable path out of this hole. After unemployment peaked in the fall of 2009, it took years for joblessness to return to pre-recession levels. Slack in the labor market left the employed and unemployed alike with little leverage to demand raises, even as corporate profits surged.Maybe it was inevitable that when half the population watches its wages stagnate while the other half gets rich in the market, the result is President Donald Trump and Brexit.\u201cIt peeled away the facade and revealed an anger that had been building for decades,\u201d said Ms. Swonk, who is chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. \u201cThe crisis was horrific, but its legacy pushed us over the edge in terms of the discontent.\u201dWhether or not he is right, the concentration of wealth that is a legacy of the financial crisis will make itself felt far into the future. Younger Americans, in particular, will be marked by the experience of 2008 much as the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression haunted the generations who lived through it in the last century. Not only were they unable to accumulate assets in the lean years of the early recovery, but they also missed out on the recent stock market rally that benefited their older and richer peers.For those fortunate enough to still possess wealth after the crisis, the future looks very different. With the security provided by assets, rather than just income, they and especially their children are on a glide path for a gilded financial future. \u201cOver and over, you see that family wealth is an important determinant of opportunity for the next generation, over and above income,\u201d said Fabian T. Pfeffer, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. \u201cWealth serves as a private safety net that allows you to behave differently and plan differently.\u201dA wealthy person who loses a job can afford to be more choosy and wait for an opportunity suited to his or her skills and experience. The risk of going to an expensive college and taking on debt is lower when there is parental wealth to fall back on.Timothy Smeeding, who teaches public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin, put it more bluntly. \u201cYou can see dynasties starting to form,\u201d he said.Ten years have passed since the trauma of 2008, the nerves are still raw, and the pain still has a way of flaring up. Every time she goes down into the basement and peruses her diary, Diane Swonk feels it anew.\u201cIt is the diary of an economist, as well as a mother and a human being,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. It includes her published writings for clients, as well as her feelings, thoughts and fears as the crisis unfolded. She also recorded her impression of key figures she met during those fateful months, including Lawrence H. Summers, a top White House economic official at the time, and Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve.\u201cThe financial crisis became a delineator,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were those who could recoup their losses and those who could not. Some people have amnesia, but we are still living with the wounds.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gordon Parks on Poverty, the \u2018Most Savage of Human Afflictions\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRACE STORIESEmpathy for the poor may not come easily to people who never experienced poverty. They may blame the victims and insist their predicament can be overcome through determination and hard work. But they may not realize that extreme poverty can be psychologically and physically incapacitating \u2014 a perpetual cycle of bad diets, health care and education exacerbated by the shaming and self-fulfilling prophecies that define it in the public imagination.Gordon Parks \u2014 perhaps more than any artist \u2014 saw poverty as \u201cthe most savage of all human afflictions\u201d and realized the power of empathy to help us understand it. It was neither an abstract problem nor political symbol, but something he endured growing up destitute in rural Kansas and having spent years documenting poverty throughout the world, including the United States. \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fearful Foe\u201d was the second article in \u201cCrisis in Latin America,\u201d a five-part series intended to promote President John F. Kennedy\u2019s proposed Alliance for Progress, which fostered cooperation between the United States and Latin America, while discouraging the spread of communism by raising the standard of living in region.The magazine initially asked Mr. Parks to find one emblematic image about poverty in each of seven Latin American countries. Finding this approach too abstract and detached, he argued for a more in-depth story. Working in Brazil with a Portuguese-speaking reporter, Jos\u00e9 Gallo, he soon found his subject: 12-year old Flavio, the eldest child of Jos\u00e9 and Nair da Silva. Mr. Parks spent nearly three weeks documenting the boy\u2019s desolate life, a daily grind of cleaning, cooking, scavenging for supplies and taking care of his seven siblings. While Mr. Parks portrayed the da Silva family with dignity, he did not sidestep the brutal details of their lives: their ragged and filthy clothes; the rickety shed in which they lived; the despair and anger of children struggling to survive; and the desolate landscape strewn with garbage and raw sewage, and teeming with insects. To the editors of Life, committed to anti-communism and American exceptionalism, the wrenching story of Flavio \u2014 whom they portrayed as a \u201csymbol of impoverished millions\u201d \u2014 could help sway public opinion in favor of intervention. Raising nearly $30,000, first in unsolicited reader contributions and later in an understated appeal, Life began its own rescue effort. It arranged for Flavio, who suffered from asthma and malnutrition, to be treated at a Denver hospital, moved the da Silva family to a new home and administered funds to support the favela. Mr. Parks, who later returned to Brazil to bring Flavio to the United States for medical treatment, maintained a relationship with the young man for many years. Some Brazilians resented Mr. Parks\u2019s photo essay. Convinced that Americans should examine their own legacy of extreme poverty, the weekly magazine O Cruzeiro retaliated by sending the photographer Henri Ballot to New York to document the urban poor. After photographing despairing street scenes in East Harlem and on the Bowery, Mr. Ballot, echoing \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fearful Foe,\u201d focused on a Puerto Rican family: Felix and Esther Gonzalez and their six children, who lived in a small apartment in a decrepit Lower East Side tenement. The parallels that Mr. Ballot set up between his photographs and those of the Life photo essay were meant to underscore that poverty in the United States was no different from that in Brazil. But they also appeared contrived. \u201cBy presenting Ballot\u2019s work as a page-by-page comparison without making a critical assessment of the independent quality and effectiveness of the photographs,\u201d wrote Mr. Burgi, \u201cO Cruzeiro inadvertently exposed the Brazilian photographer, and the magazine itself, to criticism of the methods used to produce the report.\u201dO Cruzeiro\u2019s implicit criticism of \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fearful Foe,\u201d while valid, may have applied more to Life than to Mr. Parks, who acknowledged at the time that the United States needed to \u201cclean up its own yard\u201d with regard to racism and segregation before it could credibly address the plight of Latin America. He intrinsically understood that the magazine\u2019s largely middle class readers did not have to confront Flavio\u2019s daily challenges nor those of millions of poor people close to home. In this regard, he resisted the magazine\u2019s impersonal approach to the assignment, preferring instead, as Mr. Roth wrote, \u201cto confine the story to one situation, hoping that Life\u2019s readers could more easily relate to it.\u201d Through his disturbing photographs, he wanted to convince them that extreme poverty \u2014 no matter where \u2014 was an injustice and threat to humanity that needed to be remedied.\u201cThe world must see the tragedy of poverty as it is, and feel all its drama\u201d Mr. Parks told the Brazilian newspaper Jornal do Brasil in 1961. \u201cEveryone must face the problems of humanity. My way of facing these issues is through photography. It is important because it can show, without needing words, everything that is wrong and can be improved.\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

{"Headline": "3 Investments That May Have Hit Their Peak", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersThis week is the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a flash point in the financial crisis. The economy has rebounded since then and the stock market has risen to record highs, but a feeling of caution looms over many investors.One of them is Dan Rasmussen, a contrarian investor who has marshaled data and historical returns to argue that three of the most popular asset classes for high-net-worth investors are not as desirable as they seem.\u201cI want to give the advisers the intellectual ammunition to allow them to say, \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to put money into these strategies,\u2019\u201d he said.But some advisers challenge this point of view, saying it is almost akin to market timing. \u201cYou could look at any asset class at any point in time and position it in a way and understand why it\u2019s outperformed or underperformed,\u201d said Scott Stackman, managing director of private wealth at UBS Wealth Management.Here is Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s argument for caution in three areas:During the financial crisis, Mr. Rasmussen worked at Bain Capital, a leading name in private equity. One of his jobs was to collect data on deals by Bain and its competitors to determine why some had done well and others had not.The more profitable deals were the least expensive ones, he found. The cheapest 25 percent of deals accounted for 60 percent of the funds\u2019 profits. The top 50 percent accounted for just 7 percent of profits. The difference was the price paid for the company. This was not solely for the obvious reason that paying less is better, but because private equity funds typically borrow 60 percent of the purchase price, which affects a company\u2019s profitability.Mr. Rasmussen said he admired the success Bain had in the 1980s and \u201990s, but began to question whether the private equity model it had helped pioneer was still sustainable.When early private equity firms bought relatively small companies at a discount and loaded them up with debt, the amount of leverage on the company was still about four times the company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of profitability known as Ebitda.Private equity firms continued to apply this strategy, but they were paying more for the companies, and consequently the amount of debt was rising to more than six or seven times Ebitda. With leverage at 10 times Ebitda, Mr. Rasmussen found, a company\u2019s free cash was almost all going toward debt service, and it was nearly impossible to be profitable.Mr. Rasmussen said the sector would look worse if not for a few high-performing funds that pulled up overall returns.\u201cIt\u2019s probably the worst time ever to invest in private equity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s being packaged for wealth management firms and registered investment advisers.\u201dAccording to PitchBook Benchmarks, which gathers data on private equity investments, only 25 percent of funds have been outperforming the market, and have done so by a smaller amount.Mr. Stackman of UBS said he was still putting money into private equity and hedge funds for certain clients, and reducing their investments in public equities or fixed income.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d term it as a true shift,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our belief in how the high-net-worth clients could and should be invested.\u201dMr. Rasmussen said the funds that still provided high returns equal with the risk were generally smaller ones that acted more like the owners of the companies they bought and didn\u2019t just add debt to increase returns.At his own firm, Mr. Rasmussen said, he modeled the strategy on what private equity funds were doing in the 1980s and 1990s: buying smaller companies at cheap prices and putting a reasonable amount of debt on them. In Verdad\u2019s case, Mr. Rasmussen focused on buying publicly traded companies with a small market capitalization.Verdad\u2019s main leveraged company fund lagged its small-cap benchmark in the first two quarters of this year but kept pace with a broader global benchmark. Over the past three years, the strategy has beaten both the small-cap and global benchmarks by six percentage points.The argument against venture capital is less nuanced. Top private equity funds are still delivering high returns, but venture capital funds have largely functioned as what Mr. Rasmussen calls \u201ca rich man\u2019s lottery.\u201dHe cites data from Cambridge Associates showing that venture capital has underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Nasdaq over the last 15 years. And he argues that those venture capital firms that built big names often did so with a few spectacular investments that overshadowed more mediocre ones.The venture capital firm Benchmark, for example, invested $6.7 million in eBay in 1997. That investment grew to $5 billion in two years, outshining other investments.Any venture capitalist will argue that the big winners make up for all the bets that did not pay off. Mr. Rasmussen does not dispute that; he emphasizes how difficult it is to find those funds that are going to consistently make the big winning investments.Mr. Rasmussen draws a distinction between real estate owned by private equity firms and real estate investment trusts. And for him, the difference in returns comes down to fees. A REIT typically charges a management fee of less than 1 percent. A fund that owns real estate will charge a typical private equity fee, which can be as high as 2 percent to manage the money and 20 percent of the profits.\u201cBy and large, it\u2019s a pretty efficient asset class, since rental income is a fixed contract,\u201d he said. So fees play a big role in the difference in returns.But real estate owned in REITs, he said, could be a good buffer for anxious investors because they have a low correlation to traditional equities given their stream of rental income. They\u2019re also less risky, he wrote, than his focus, small-cap stocks.Excluding entire asset classes can be a tough sell, some financial advisers say. Investors should be asking instead whether an asset class is performing as it should.\u201cYou could put together a low-volatility portfolio of hedge funds, and they will get very consistent return,\u201d Mr. Stackman of UBS said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not getting the generous returns the S. & P. has been giving you since 2009.\u201dThat would be around 2 percent a year for hedge funds versus about 18 percent for the S. & P. 500. And many asset classes now have had a good run.There\u2019s another cautionary argument on private investments. Because they are inherently risky, they should be undertaken only by the most experienced investors.Michael W. Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club for people with $10 million to $1 billion, said the group\u2019s 630 members had increased their investments in private equity and real estate.The group\u2019s collective portfolio has about 50 percent allocated to private equity and real estate. Public equity and debt make up just 35 percent.Mr. Sonnenfeldt said that such high allocations to risky private assets were a product of how Tiger 21\u2019s members often made their fortunes, building businesses and taking risk.But he agreed with Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s argument on investing in smaller companies.\u201cWhat our members do is not a referendum on the entire market,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. \u201cIt\u2019s our members. Most people who are thinking about these investments wouldn\u2019t do well without the skills to be successful. That\u2019s an important distinction.\u201dAnd he said the group\u2019s members expressed interest in private asset classes because, they said, their experience allowed them to influence the management of the investment.\u201cOur members overwhelmingly express their interest in private equity through ownership of a company or investment in a company,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a third have put money into a fund, and then they\u2019re biased toward the smaller funds over the larger ones, for the reasons Rasmussen is talking about.\u201dIn other words, the message is a resounding caveat emptor.Advertisement"}

The Justice Department has now brought charges against state actors from North Korea, China, Iran and Russia, the United States\u2019 most formidable cyberfoes.Mr. Trump wrote that Mr. Kim, whom he has sought to engage on nuclear talks, \u201cproclaims \u2018unwavering faith in President Trump.\u2019 Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!\u201dIt was unclear whether Mr. Trump knew about the forthcoming complaint. A Justice Department official would not directly answer when asked whether he was briefed in advance.The complaint against Mr. Park was filed under seal on June 8, just four days before Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim held a historic summit meeting in Singapore.The complaint described only one side of the yearslong cyberconflict between North Korea and the United States. It made no mention of the American-led attacks on North Korea\u2019s missile program, ordered by President Barack Obama months before the Sony attack. And it omitted the source of some of the weapons in the WannaCry attack, which were leaked or stolen from the National Security Agency, though the United States has not publicly conceded that.Cyberattacks have not been a topic of the recent negotiations with North Korea. But as the complaint makes clear, such weapons have been the North\u2019s primary tool against American targets.\u201cThe North Korean government, through a state-sponsored group, robbed a central bank and citizens of other nations, retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away, and created disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries, causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars\u2019 worth of damage,\u201d John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, said in a statement.\u201cThese charges will send a message that we will track down malicious actors no matter how or where they hide,\u201d he added.Mr. Park, who also went by the alias Pak Jin Hek, is unlikely to see the inside of an American courtroom. The United States has no direct, formal relations with North Korea and did not communicate with its reclusive government ahead of the charges.Adding him to the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions list means that no financial institution that does business in the United States can also do business with or provide accounts to Mr. Park or Chosun Expo Joint Venture, the company he worked for that American officials said was a front for the government. He actually appeared to work for North Korea\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, the country\u2019s closest equivalent to the C.I.A., intelligence officials said.The sanctions are unlikely to have much effect on Mr. Park and are a less powerful tool than the criminal charges in ensuring that Mr. Park cannot travel far outside North Korea and outing him as a state-sponsored hacker.In its complaint, the government mapped out a yearslong, brazen scheme to undermine institutions around the world and steal millions of dollars.North Korea broke into the systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment in late 2014 in retaliation for the company\u2019s production of a comedic film, \u201cThe Interview,\u201d that mocked Mr. Kim and depicted a plot to assassinate him.The attack wiped out 70 percent of the studio\u2019s computer capability, erasing all the data on about half of the company\u2019s personal computers and more than half of its servers. Sony was left without voice mail, email or production systems, essentially crippling operations.A month later, the F.B.I. pinned the crime on North Korea and the White House soon imposed sanctions on the country.Mr. Park and the other North Korean hackers would go on to engage in cyberattacks around the globe.From 2015 through 2018, they attacked banks to amass funds for North Korea, according to the complaint. They infiltrated Bangladesh Bank in 2016 by sending malware-ridden emails to employees, a practice known as phishing, and eventually gained access to computers connected to the global banking communication system.They directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to transfer money from Bangladesh Bank to accounts in other Asian countries, stealing $81 million. Only because an alert official at the reserve bank noticed that the word \u201cfoundation\u201d was spelled \u201cfandation\u201d did the transaction get additional scrutiny, and it was halted before more than an additional $900 million was transferred, the complaint said.Over the same time, the North unsuccessfully targeted American defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, with spear-phishing emails, in which malicious files or links are sent in a seemingly innocuous message.The complaint gave the most detailed technical accounting yet of how the crippling WannaCry malware made its way around the globe. It also made clear that the malware turned into an unguided missile \u2014 in which the British health care system, which used outdated Microsoft operating systems, turned out to be especially vulnerable.It acknowledged that some of the code, originally from the National Security Agency, was published by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. But the code\u2019s American roots went unmentioned in the complaint \u2014 in essence, an extension of the American government\u2019s position that the North, rather than the American code makers who lost their weapons, bore complete responsibility for the attack.North Korea operated relatively freely in China, according to the complaint. Chosun Expo Joint Venture helped fund North Korean hacking organizations by doing legitimate programming work from an office in Dalian, China, a coastal city near North Korea. Some customers knew the employees \u201cwere North Korean computer programmers connected to the government,\u201d the complaint said.Mr. Park, who worked there from 2011 to 2013, and his colleagues were overseen by a company manager and North Korean political attach\u00e9\u0301, the Justice Department said.Even though the Justice Department made clear that many North Koreans were involved in the attacks, only Mr. Park was charged because the government apparently believed it had evidence to convict only him beyond a reasonable doubt, said John Carlin, the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.The Justice Department said the investigation is continuing. The indictment took years to put together, in part because it covers multiple hacking campaigns and because the government cannot use classified information when it brings a criminal case against a nation-state.\u201cIn order to get admissible evidence,\u201d Mr. Carlin said, \u201cprosecutors have to work through any issues the intelligence community might have.\u201dAdam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington, and Brooks Barnes from Los Angeles.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Greece\u2019s Biggest Migrant Camp Is a Mental Health Crisis, Aid Groups Say", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 Aid groups are warning of a growing safety and mental health crisis in Greece\u2019s largest migrant camp, a combustible place where violence, attempted suicide, untreated psychological trauma and unsanitary conditions are commonplace, even as the government takes steps to relieve dangerous overcrowding.There is only one shower for every 84 people and one toilet for every 72 people, the report said, and \u201cthe sewage system is so overwhelmed that raw sewage has been known to reach the mattresses where children sleep.\u201dThe alarms about conditions on Lesbos came as other European countries are taking increasingly tough stands against migrants.On Monday, Italy\u2019s government adopted a proposal by the hard-line, anti-immigrant interior minister, Matteo Salvini, to cut the number of asylum seekers it admits and double the amount of time the authorities can hold migrants in detention, awaiting deportation.And on Tuesday, France refused to allow a ship operated by aid groups, carrying migrants who were rescued from the Mediterranean Sea, to dock in Marseille.Later in the day, France and other European countries reached a deal to have the migrants on the ship land in Malta and then be relocated across Europe.Conditions in the Moria camp have drawn condemnation for years, but the complaints have grown more urgent as the thinly spread aid workers have recounted assaults and suicide attempts, even by preadolescent children. They have warned of a serious threat of major rioting.The International Rescue Committee said its overwhelmed mental health clinic at the camp had been able to treat only 126 people this year \u2014 and that 30 percent of them had attempted suicide and a total of 60 percent of them had considered it.\u201cThe only reason I am glad I didn\u2019t succeed is because of my children,\u201d the report quoted Ahmad, a 35-year-old Iraqi father of four, as saying.Lesbos, an island of about 86,000 residents, came under enormous pressure in 2015 when it became the main gateway to Europe for nearly a million migrants. Even with international aid, the flood of people strained the resources of Greece, a small country that was still struggling to emerge from its economic crisis.Arrivals have slowed significantly since then, but the burden on Moria and other Greek camps has not eased. The processing of asylum applications is slow, other countries have made it harder for migrants who travel through Greece to cross their borders, and officials have made it tougher for migrants to win permission to relocate to the Greek mainland.Earlier this month, regional officials responsible for the southern Aegean Islands threatened to close Moria unless the central Greek government improved conditions.Last Friday, following talks between Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and the European migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the authorities moved 100 migrants from the camp to facilities in northern Greece. On Monday, 444 people more were moved, and an additional 1,000 will be relocated by the end of the week, Migration Minister Dimitris Vitsas told Greek radio on Tuesday. He also said that people would also be moved out of crowded centers on the islands of Samos and Chios.\u201cThe goal is to relocate 6,000 to 7,000 people to mainland Greece by November,\u201d he said. \u201cThere needs to be redistribution across Europe,\u201d he added, but some countries have resisted a European Union plan to share the burden.The International Rescue Committee\u2019s Greece director, Jana Frey, said she welcomed the government\u2019s effort, but added, \u201cIt comes far too late.\u201d The camps in northern Greece were already nearly full, she said.In many European countries, anti-migrant sentiment rose even as the flow of people declined, contributing to gains by right-wing parties. In Italy, the League party, headed by Mr. Salvini, and the anti-establishment Five Star movement made gains in elections this year, formed a coalition, and entered government for the first time.On Monday, the cabinet adopted an emergency decree, drafted by Mr. Salvini, that would eliminate some grounds for migrants to be permitted to remain in Italy, like fleeing anti-gay persecution, and would allow the authorities to detain migrants for up to 180 days, rather than 90. To take effect, the decree must be approved by Parliament \u2014 where the governing coalition has a large majority \u2014 and President Sergio Mattarella.\u201cThis is a step toward making Italy safer,\u201d Mr. Salvini said in a tweet.After a similar situation in August, the Aquarius docked in Malta and 141 migrants disembarked. They, too, were given refuge by several countries.On Monday, the Aquarius, operated by SOS M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e and Doctors Without Borders, asked permission to dock in Marseille and disembark 58 migrants, including 17 women and 18 minors.Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s economy minister, said on Tuesday that his government was refusing, \u201cbecause if we want to have a coherent policy on migration, we have to respect European rules.\u201dUnder the agreement reached later on Tuesday by French, Maltese and Portuguese officials, the Aquarius will disembark the migrants in international waters. They will then be taken to Malta, where they will be redirected to various European countries.Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome, and Aurelien Breeden from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Tariffs Corrupt Again", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump has perverted the process and undermined U.S. credibility.Opinion ColumnistIn normal times, Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, bringing us closer to an all-out trade war, would have dominated headlines for days. Things being as they are, it was a below-the-fold story, drowned out by all the other scandals underway.Yet Trump\u2019s tariffs really are a big, bad deal. Their direct economic impact will be modest, although hardly trivial. But the numbers aren\u2019t the whole story. Trumpian trade policy has, almost casually, torn up rules America itself created more than 80 years ago \u2014 rules intended to ensure that tariffs reflected national priorities, not the power of special interests.The costs of this free-for-all went beyond economics: They undermined U.S. influence and damaged the world as a whole. Most notably, in the years after World War I, America demanded that European nations repay their war debts, which meant that they had to earn dollars through exports \u2014 and at the same time America imposed high tariffs to block those necessary exports.This U.S. innovation became the template for a global trading system, culminating in the creation of the World Trade Organization. And tariff policy went from being famously dirty to remarkably clean.Now, the creators of this trading system knew that it needed some flexibility to remain politically viable. So governments were given the right to impose tariffs under a limited set of circumstances: to give industries time to cope with import surges, to respond to unfair foreign practices, to protect national security. And in the U.S. the power to impose these special-case tariffs was vested in the executive branch, on the understanding that this power would be used sparingly and judiciously.Then came Trump.Even the big China announcement, supposedly a response to unfair Chinese trade practices, was basically a put-up job. China is often a bad actor in the international economy. But this kind of retaliatory tariff is supposed to be a response to specific policies, and offer the targeted government a clear way to satisfy U.S. demands. What Trump did was instead to lash out based mainly on a vague sense of grievance, with no end game in sight.So what are the criteria for these exemptions? Nobody knows, but there is every reason to believe that political favoritism is running wild.Beyond that, America has thrown away its negotiating credibility. In the past, countries signing trade agreements with the United States believed that a deal was a deal. Now they know that whatever documents the U.S. may sign supposedly guaranteeing access to its market, the president will still feel free to block their exports, on specious grounds, whenever he feels like it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane Florence and the Displacement of African-Americans Along the Carolina Coast", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe places that are most threatened by Hurricane Florence this week, especially along the coast of the Carolinas, were heavily and, in some areas, almost entirely populated and owned by African-Americans a century ago.Regina Cobb, 50, and her family have lived in Princeville for generations. \u201cIf it floods this time, I think my family is out,\u201d she said this week. \u201cThis is God\u2019s way of saying: \u2018It\u2019s time to do something different.\u2019\u201dAfrican-Americans have been driven from their homes in the region for decades, but the decision to leave has not always been theirs to make. In 1950, African-Americans were about a quarter of North Carolina\u2019s population, according to census data. Today, blacks are roughly one-fifth of the total population.White plantation owners never thought twice about acquiring this land, and many of these areas were abandoned after the Civil War. The same was the case with the Sea Islands and Hilton Head. Union Army forces captured that early in the Civil War and white planters fled the area, leaving it to their former slaves.You began to see an explosion in coastal development in the 1950s targeting African-American landowners for displacement, often through various speculative schemes that tried to fleece them of their property.Local governments worked alongside private developers to essentially steal land from black folks through various legal mechanisms. Until the 1950s, Hilton Head Island was where African-American children could grow up without seeing a white face for their entire life. Today, it is a playground for mostly white and wealthy people.It was around this time that America\u2019s coastlines became highly coveted and desirable places to live and vacation. That\u2019s really the story of postwar America: The middle class is growing, real-estate growth and development is a major engine of the economy, but it\u2019s at the expense of African-American communities.People in coastal areas 100 years ago lived much more in harmony with these volatile, mercurial environments. First of all, the areas were sparsely populated, which makes sense because they were highly prone to storms that caused substantial damage.The folks who lived there had a better understanding of nature\u2019s limits. In the 20th century, the Army Corps of Engineers, federal programs and agencies, local governments, as well as private developers came in. They thought that coastal areas could be stabilized and made suitable for large-scale development.That has really led to the point where not only do these areas continue to be subject to massive storms, but the sheer number of people who are living in these areas is mind-boggling, given how vulnerable they are.Bridges and causeways were built right up to the ocean\u2019s door and, all of a sudden, Americans were flocking to the sea to build second homes. Suddenly, African-Americans are in the cross hairs of this growth industry. Many of the decisions that were being made were similar to the decisions that were being made in the cities with urban renewal, where black neighborhoods were the ones being demolished and cleared out.Similarly, decisions were often being made by the Army Corps of Engineers and local officials that would literally eat away at black-owned land. There were communities whose acreage was washed-out to sea, as a result of erosion that was directly caused by the engineering decisions that were being made by public officials in the interest of facilitating commerce and growing the economy. Again, growing the economy at the expense of vulnerable populations.Here we have this effort to enhance the environment in the interest of economic growth, but doing so in a way that really destroyed the foundations of black communities.The very types of environmental engineering practices and other measures that aimed to make these areas what they are today, and worked to build up the coastal real estate markets, ultimately did so in ways that were damaging to the environment and unsustainable. They were the very same measures that worked to displace and dispossess black people of their land a century ago.These are the same areas that are now facing a dire threat from this hurricane.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Jeff Bezos Should Push for Nobody to Get as Rich as Jeff Bezos", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtJeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has been publicly agonizing over a vexing problem: what to do with all his money.The question of how Mr. Bezos should spend his money is a good one, but a better place to start might be: Why does he have so much money in the first place? What does his fortune tell us about the economic structure and impact of the tech industry, the engine behind his billions? And, most important, what responsibility comes with his wealth \u2014 and is it any business of ours what he does with it?The answer: Of course it\u2019s our business.In the book, Mr. Giridharadas argues that the efforts of the super-wealthy to change the world through philanthropy are often a distraction from the planet\u2019s actual problems. To truly fix the world, Mr. Bezos ought to push for policy changes that would create a more equal distribution of the winnings derived from a tech-driven economy, Mr. Giridharadas said.\u201cHe should address himself to America\u2019s deepest problems in ways that would demand sacrifice from the winners of our age \u2014 making a difference at the expense of their opportunity to make a killing,\u201d Mr. Giridharadas said.There\u2019s another way of putting this: Jeff Bezos should spend his vast fortune pushing for a society where no one can ever become as rich as Jeff Bezos is now.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Bezos\u2019 philanthropic plans.But Mr. Bezos isn\u2019t just rich. He is growing unprecedentedly rich \u2014 rich enough that his wealth, by itself, illustrates a new economic reality.Most of Mr. Bezos\u2019 wealth is tied up in Amazon\u2019s stock, so he could well lose billions if Amazon flails. But if he does, there will probably be someone else just as megarich to take his place, because extreme concentrations of wealth are baked into the dynamics of the modern tech economy.Tech-powered businesses are often driven by an economic concept known as network effects, in which the very popularity of a service sparks even greater popularity. Amazon, for instance, keeps attracting more third-party businesses to sell goods in its store \u2014 which in turn makes it a better store for customers, which attracts more suppliers, improving the customer experience, and so on in an endless virtuous cycle. Digital businesses are also characterized by tremendous economies of scale \u2014 Amazon can create a robotic assistant once and deploy it to everyone \u2014 that further entrench concentration.\u201cWe have technology that has allowed us to create vastly more wealth for society,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy. \u201cBut there\u2019s no economic law that says that these benefits will be distributed evenly \u2014 and it\u2019s worked out that some people have gotten most of the benefits and a lot of other people have been left behind.\u201dBut economics isn\u2019t destiny, he said.\u201cTechnology has led to some of this concentration, but since it makes the pie bigger, you could make everyone better off simultaneously \u2014 you could make the poor better off and the rich better off \u2014 and whether we do that is a matter of policy,\u201d he said.\u201cThey\u2019re not providing the sort of high-wage, middle-class jobs to a broad swath of individuals that we used to associate with corporate success,\u201d Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, said of Amazon and other high-flying tech firms. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not the sharing of the productivity benefits that we used to see in the past. And that may be even more galling than the concentration of wealth.\u201dThose ideas strike me as unlikely; Mr. Bezos is a far-thinking innovator, but he has expressed little interest in near-term political questions.On the other hand, Mr. Bezos\u2019 most attractive quality, as a businessman, is his capacity for patience and surprise.\u201cThis is guy who was willing to buck what everyone else thought for so long,\u201d Mr. Giridharadas said. \u201cIf he brings that same irreverence to the question of how to give, he has the potential to interrogate himself about why it is that we need so many billionaires to save us in the first place \u2014 and what we could do to build a society that would not require Jeff Bezos to help us so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Administration Aims to Sharply Restrict New Green Cards for Those on Public Aid", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Trump administration officials announced Saturday that immigrants who legally use public benefits like food assistance and Section 8 housing vouchers could be denied green cards under new rules aimed at keeping out people the administration deems a drain on the country.The move could force millions of poor immigrants who rely on public assistance for food and shelter to make a difficult choice between accepting financial help and seeking a green card to live and work legally in the United States.Older immigrants, many of whom get low-cost prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program, could also be forced to stop participating in the popular benefits program or risk being deemed a \u201cpublic charge\u201d who is ineligible for legal resident status.The move is not intended to affect most immigrants who have already been granted green cards, but advocates have said they fear that those with legal resident status will stop using public benefits to protect their status. The regulation, which the administration said would affect about 382,000 people a year, is the latest in a series of aggressive crackdowns by President Trump and his hard-line aides on legal and illegal immigration.Federal law has always required those seeking green cards to prove they will not be a burden and has taken into consideration the acceptance of cash benefits. But the government has never before considered the use of other public benefits, like assistance for food.Now, the new regulation \u2014 announced on the Department of Homeland Security website \u2014 will require that immigration caseworkers consider the use of public benefits to be \u201cheavily weighed negative factors\u201d for those who are applying to remain legally in the country on a permanent basis. Those who are deemed likely to become dependent on government assistance will probably be denied.The rule would affect people seeking to immigrate to the United States permanently and others who are in the country on temporary visas \u2014 including students and workers \u2014 who seek to stay permanently.Immigrants could be asked in limited cases to post cash bonds of at least $10,000 to avoid being denied green cards under the new regulation, which does not need congressional approval but must still go through a public review process before it becomes final. Officials said they expected the regulation to become final after being posted to the Federal Register in the coming weeks and undergoing the 60-day review period.In a news release, the Department of Homeland Security said the new rule would \u201censure that those seeking to enter and remain in the United States either temporarily or permanently can support themselves financially and will not be reliant on public benefits.\u201dThe 447-page rule, titled \u201cInadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds,\u201d will not apply to families making less than 15 percent of the official poverty designation, officials said.Pro-immigrant activists predict that poor immigrants will immediately begin withdrawing from public assistance programs \u2014 even at the risk of losing needed assistance for food, shelter and medicine \u2014 out of a fear that they will be denied green cards and will be deported.\u201cThis is an attack on immigrant families and an attempt to make our immigration system a pay-to-play system where only the wealthy need apply,\u201d said Jackie Vimo, a policy analyst with the National Immigration Law Center, a Washington-based group that defends low-income immigrants. \u201cThis is a radical transformation of our immigration, and does a runaround on Congress.\u201dThere are political implications to the move, which comes less than two months before the midterm elections, which will determine who controls the House and the Senate for the next two years of Mr. Trump\u2019s tenure.Focusing on the use of public benefits is often an effective way to galvanize conservative supporters. Drawing attention to the use of those benefits by immigrants could be especially persuasive in turning out Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters across the country.Stephen Miller, the president\u2019s top immigration adviser, has long believed that being tough on immigrants is a winning tactic for Republican candidates who too often \u2014 in Mr. Miller\u2019s view \u2014 have compromised with Democrats on the issue. He has pushed hard for the new rule during the past several months.They said the children of immigrants who are in the United States legally could be the most vulnerable. Indeed, immigrant parents who work low-wage jobs and rely on assistance may need to remove their children from the programs to keep their families together in the United States. Unauthorized immigrants are ineligible for nearly all public benefits.Trump administration officials say the rule is intended to promote fiscal responsibility.\u201cSelf-sufficiency has been a basic principle of United States immigration law since this country\u2019s earliest immigration statutes,\u201d the proposal says. It remains United States policy that \u201cthe availability of public benefits not constitute an incentive for immigration to the United States.\u201dThe government has traditionally considered someone who relies on government cash assistance for more than half of his or her income a public charge. Now, however, officials will take into account whether an individual or a family has received any of an assortment of noncash public benefits, such as aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps; the Section 8 program, which provides housing assistance; or the Medicare prescription drug program for older adults.\u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, whose research supports decreased immigration. \u201cThis country has defined public charge in a fictional way in order to facilitate high levels of low-skilled immigration. But this is simply a 21st-century definition of what public charge is.\u201dOfficials said that the new rule did not apply to refugees or asylum seekers who enter the country, or to legal immigrants who serve in the military. Cash or other assistance given to the immigrant victims of natural disasters would not be counted against them.Critics of the new rule argue that it deviates from longstanding precedent and from Congress\u2019s original intent for the public-charge statute. They also say it violates states\u2019 rights to provide benefits to children and immigrants experiencing short-term crises.In addition to the use of public benefits, the proposed rule also deems certain health conditions \u2014 like mental health disorders, heart disease and cancer \u2014 to be among the heavily weighed factors. The proposal states that \u201can alien is at high risk of becoming a public charge if he or she has a medical condition and is unable to show evidence of unsubsidized health insurance.\u201dIt is a Catch-22, said Shawn Fremstad, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. Poor immigrants with health conditions must prove that they are insured, but they cannot use the available benefits to enroll.Mr. Krikorian does not contest that view.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a moral issue,\u201d he said. \u201cA Honduran with a sixth-grade education level isn\u2019t morally flawed, but he works three jobs and still can\u2019t feed his family. Immigrants with low levels of skill are a mismatch for a modern society like ours.\u201dThe complex web of technicalities surrounding the new rule are difficult to understand, said Charles Wheeler, a legal expert at the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, so the number of immigrants who withdraw from programs could exceed even the number who are subject to the rule.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Harvard Is Vaulting Workers Into the Middle Class With High Pay. Can Anyone Else Follow Its Lead?", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMartha Bonilla is not your typical middle-class worker. And it\u2019s not just that she was born in a backwater of El Salvador and crossed Mexico hidden among a pile of bananas in the back of a truck to make her way illegally into the United States at age 20.Like millions of Americans lacking a college degree, the 44-year-old mother of three works on the bottom rungs of the service sector, in a kitchen run by the food-service contractor Restaurant Associates in Cambridge, Mass. Food preparation and service is the lowest-paid occupational group in the economy; even in Boston, it typically pays less than $27,000 for a full-time, year-round job.Yet there Ms. Bonilla sits at her kitchen table in the solidly middle-class neighborhood of West Roxbury. She and her husband, Felipe Villatoro, both legal residents, bought the house 12 years ago for $350,000. It\u2019s their second; she rents the first to members of her extended family. The vacations in Florida, the 401(k), the $1,700 a month they pay for their daughter\u2019s college tuition and fees \u2014 all speak of America\u2019s dream.\u201cComing to the United States was the best decision I ever made,\u201d Ms. Bonilla said.What\u2019s the trick? Ms. Bonilla\u2019s job with Restaurant Associates is to make breakfast and lunch for executives pursuing extension courses at Harvard Business School. At the university, service workers on the payroll of an outside contractor earn the same pay and benefits they would get as direct university employees \u2014 including health insurance and pension benefits, paid vacation and child care assistance.This parity policy was formally adopted across the university 16 years ago by Lawrence H. Summers, then Harvard\u2019s president. At a stroke, it ended the practice of outsourcing dining, security and other such services simply to save on labor costs. \u201cThe effect of this policy is to remove some of the economic incentives to contract out those positions,\u201d said Michael Kramer, organizing director at the Cambridge area local of Unite Here, the union covering food service workers.To be sure, Harvard\u2019s employment policies affect a limited population. Only 275 dining workers, 404 security guards and the 370 custodial workers are employed by subcontractors, and another 1,105 work for the university. It\u2019s an open question whether larger organizations, or those without multibillion-dollar endowments, can follow its lead.\u201cThis is an important private-sector policy innovation \u2014 a very good template for a socially minded organization,\u201d said Mr. Summers, whose tenure was sandwiched between his service as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and his time heading the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama. But he acknowledged that the experiment carries trade-offs.Even if the goal is laudable \u2014 lifting workers from the bottom of the labor market into the middle class, stimulating the economy and pushing against the country\u2019s widening wage inequality \u2014 Mr. Summers noted that policies like these \u201cmake it more expensive to do the things you do.\u201d Setting too high a pay floor could force businesses to hire fewer people, making many worse off.Still, some 45 million Americans work in low-end service jobs \u2014 personal care aides, cooks, janitors, sales reps \u2014 typically earning less than $30,000 a year. By 2026, the government projects, the number will be 50 million. Outsourcing is one of the main dynamics keeping their wages down, and the Harvard experiment is a useful case study of how institutions can use their clout to force a remedy.That concern is on the mind of David Weil, who headed the wage and hour division of the Department of Labor during the Obama administration and is now dean of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. \u201cThe question is can we re-establish some normative minimum that is presumably above what sheer market forces would drive wages down to,\u201d Mr. Weil said. \u201cThe idea is to set a wage norm through a contracting standard.\u201d\u201cAfter three days we escalated,\u201d said Benjamin McKean, an undergraduate founder of Harvard\u2019s Living Wage movement. \u201cWe had 100 people sleeping in tents in Harvard Yard.\u201d Senator Edward M. Kennedy joined in the sit-in. Senator John Kerry also came by. The protest was covered in The Boston Globe and The New York Times. By the third week, the Harvard president at the time, Neil Rudenstine, yielded and asked a committee to report on how to improve workers\u2019 lot.The disparity in wages between workers with college degrees and those with less education has continued to widen over the past 40 years. Real wages for a worker with less than a high school education have dropped significantly.Average weekly full-time wage, by education levelIn 2017 dollars$1,500Bachelor\u2019s degreeor higher$1,250$1,000Some college$750High school$500Less thanhigh school$250$0\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201917Average weekly full-time wage, by education levelIn 2017 dollars$1,500$1,250Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher$1,000Some college$750High school$500Less than high school$250$0\u201980\u201990\u201900\u201910\u201917By The New York Times | Source: Bureau of Labor StatisticsCustodians proved a useful case study. In 1980, Harvard directly employed nearly 1,000 of them. By 1996, the figure was just 260, and their compensation had suffered. What happened in the interim? The university pushed the Service Employees International Union to accept a contract with lower pay to better compete with outsiders.\u201cThere are good reasons for outsourcing,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cBut we identified outsourcing to get around labor obligations as the source of the problem.\u201d The committee he led did not recommend banning the use of contractors, as the living-wage advocates demanded. Nor did it accept their recommendation of setting a wage floor. Instead, by calling for wage and benefits parity for all campus workers, regardless of employer, it sought to remove outsourcing as a cost-cutting tool.These days, a service position at Harvard is not a bad job. A janitor\u2019s starting wage of $22.69 beats that of 75 percent of janitors in the area. A grill cook \u2014 the food-service worker with the lowest pay \u2014 gets $21.27, more than almost 90 percent of food preparation workers in the Cambridge-Boston area.Doris Landaverde, 39, got her high school diploma only last June. She cleans offices at Harvard\u2019s Extension School, making more than $23 an hour, plus she has access to benefits including holidays, sick leave, paid vacations, health insurance, a pension, tuition assistance and help with child care. As a result, she\u2019s a little skeptical about the value of going to college. \u201cThere are jobs that require a college degree and pay less than what I make,\u201d she said.In San Francisco, to take another example, airport authorities have set minimum wage and training standards for screeners, baggage handlers, cleaners, fuelers, skycaps, customer service agents and other workers with access to secure areas. Now, the union is waiting for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to vote on a wage floor of $19 an hour by 2023, a move expected by late September.But the Port Authority worries that airlines \u2014 which outsource everything from the cleaning of planes to their on-flight meals \u2014 will sue. The agency\u2019s chairman, Kevin O\u2019Toole, said at hearings in July that officials \u201cwant to make sure when we vote for this minimum wage that it is bulletproof\u201d against any judicial review.Ayr Muir, Clover\u2019s founder and owner, told me that to get the deal to work \u201crequired a lot of flexibility on Harvard\u2019s part.\u201d He couldn\u2019t jack up the price of his sandwiches at the Science Center to pay for the higher wages when his shop on Harvard Square was just 1,000 feet away. To make ends meet, he needed Harvard to give him a discount on rent. A \u201cnormal\u201d restaurant paying an entry wage of $24, he said, \u201cwould go out of business.\u201dThe university doesn\u2019t calculate how much it might save if the parity policy were not in place. But the committee appointed to study the issue in 2001 came up with a rough estimate of $2.4 million to $3.7 million a year. This is pocket change for an institution like Harvard, whose operating expenses last year approached $5 billion.But as Mr. Summers pointed out, across the economy, better jobs may mean fewer jobs. If, say, Massachusetts were to introduce a similar policy for public services, it would need to find the money. Taxpayers could provide it \u2014 or the state could scale back services and cut jobs. And employers forced to pay more may attract better-trained workers, displacing less-educated ones.Over the last 40 years, the earnings of workers in the middle of the distribution \u2014 half earn more, half less \u2014 have increased by an average of 0.16 percent per year, after inflation. That is very close to nothing. Workers without a college degree make about $20 less a week, in today\u2019s money, than they did at the millennium. With a labor movement dwindling into insignificance \u2014 only 6.5 percent of private-sector workers are unionized \u2014 economists like Mr. Weil and Mr. Katz suggest that new institutions are needed to hold up the bottom half.Alan B. Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr. Obama, argues that the costs of introducing a parity policy like Harvard\u2019s in other workplaces would be \u201cprobably second order\u201d \u2014 too small to matter. Higher pay, he noted, brings about efficiency gains: Workers who are paid well are more loyal. They will exert more effort for the company. It\u2019s worth it even if they are more expensive.Indeed, Mr. Krueger argues, \u201cthis kind of policy is pushing firms to a better equilibrium.\u201d From the standpoint of Massachusetts, he adds, think of all the new tax revenue that higher wages would bring about. By that reasoning, considering the consequences of low wages across society \u2014 poverty and its contingent ills, family instability, addiction \u2014 policies to set a floor on the price of labor could well justify their cost.Email: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardoAdvertisement"}

People sometimes choose the wrong path when they\u2019ve lost confidence in the old answers.To ignore this fear of the future is to invite even greater economic dislocation, and all the anger and alienation it entails. Our institutions depend on the public\u2019s trust, and regaining that trust must be priority No. 1.Today, at home and abroad, our next steps are not set. They never have been. But rather than talk about whether democracy is dying and the liberal order is decaying, we must embrace activism and action to ensure that neither of those outcomes becomes real, let alone irreversible. Otherwise, our reflexive defense of the liberal order will only contribute to its defeat.The American experiment itself didn\u2019t emerge from gauzy parlor talk; it was earned the hard way \u2014 by people willing to put themselves on the line for a powerful vision strengthened year by year, mile by mile, since 1776. Hundreds of millions of people didn\u2019t just one day sign up for some great theory because they\u2019d read a policy white paper. They did it because they\u2019d lived and felt the devastating failure of the alternative, and they wanted peace, freedom and opportunity.We need to make democracy and the international liberal order relevant to people\u2019s lives in actions, not in words.A few critical issues must be tackled if we are to make our leaders accountable and make them work for people.Nothing can be fixed if we don\u2019t first deconstruct the gridlock that is choking governments everywhere. That starts by recognizing that healthy democracies rest on the firm foundation of civil discourse and reasoned debate. Both, however, are in diminishing supply today, and a decision will never be effective if even the facts it\u2019s based on are a point of contention.But history tells us that we must open ourselves up if we are to restore faith in government or empower Americans to compete in a world that\u2019s changing faster and becoming more vulnerable to reactionary forces, not less.Just as important, we must strengthen our collective response to violent extremism and to forces that seek the return of a world in which might makes right and the strong bully the weak. Resurgent authoritarian powers like Russia and nonstate actors like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda are waging war against the very principles the United Nations and NATO were founded to protect. Effective leadership requires that we do more to deter immediate threats even as we shore up the global institutions that provide security in the long term.We must also create an environment where innovation can flourish and the benefits are widely shared. Education for people of all ages, combined with apprenticeship programs, makes up the foundation of fair, inclusive economic growth. Governments need to support entrepreneurs while also helping them to absorb the disruptions that come with rapid advances in such fields as artificial intelligence, robotics and 3-D printing. The gig economy is a reality of 21st-century work. We need to make sure workers are protected and empowered to take risks, pursue flexible arrangements and change jobs without losing their benefits.The challenges are real, but there is every reason for optimism. History has proved time and again that adapting to big changes in technology and society is stamped in the American DNA.Our global system demands renewal and reform, not rejection and recrimination. If we treat it as a relic of decades past, it will rust away and future generations will pay the price. Nostalgia won\u2019t defeat neo-populism; progress will.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "McKinsey Advises Puerto Rico on Debt. It May Profit on the Outcome.", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMcKinsey & Company is advising the Puerto Rican government on a financial overhaul to lighten its crippling debts \u2014 a process that will determine how much money the bankrupt territory\u2019s creditors recoup on their investments.The giant consulting firm has millions of dollars riding on the outcome. The reason: McKinsey owns bonds issued by Puerto Rico.That creates a potential conflict of interest between McKinsey\u2019s client, which wants to save as much money as possible, and McKinsey itself, which wants to make as much money as possible on the bonds.Affiliates of McKinsey revealed their investments in filings in federal court in Puerto Rico\u2019s capital, San Juan. The filings were not made under McKinsey\u2019s name, and were among nearly 165,000 bankruptcy claims.McKinsey so far has received $50 million in fees to advise Puerto Rico\u2019s federal oversight board on drafting a blueprint for the island\u2019s fiscal affairs over the next decade. That plan projected how Puerto Rico\u2019s economy would respond to the changes.It also determined how much money the island could afford to pay back to its bond holders. But the decision about which investors will receive how much was left to other institutions.McKinsey, according to regulatory filings and court documents, is one of those bondholders. It owns at least $20 million \u2014 and possibly considerably more \u2014 of such securities.\u201cIt\u2019s a conflict of interest,\u201d said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the founder of the school\u2019s Bankruptcy Research Database. \u201cThey are making decisions that will determine how much money is given to themselves.\u201dA spokesman for McKinsey, D. J. Carella, said the firm had fully complied with all legal requirements, \u201cincluding those regarding potential conflicts, and we will continue to do so.\u201dAfter The New York Times contacted McKinsey with questions about its investments, the federal oversight board became aware of the firm\u2019s bond holdings, according to a board spokeswoman. The oversight board then requested that an outside ethics firm conduct a review of the situation, she said. The review found that McKinsey\u2019s investment unit operated independently of its consulting business.The Treasury Department asked during the Obama administration that the disclosure provision be left out of Puerto Rico\u2019s restructuring law, said Kristina Baum, a spokeswoman for the House Committee on Natural Resources. No one considered the request controversial.Traditionally, a key aim of filing for bankruptcy is to reduce the amount of money the borrower owes, in bonds or in loans, to outside parties. That often means that people and institutions owning bonds issued by the now-bankrupt entity get back only a fraction of what they had originally lent.\u201cWhoever\u2019s doing the numbers has tremendous power,\u201d including over how much money will ultimately flow to McKinsey itself, Mr. LoPucki said.The biggest battle so far has been over some bonds that were marketed as nearly risk-free because they were backed by expected revenue from Puerto Rico\u2019s sales tax. Holders of those bonds argued that they deserved almost all of their money back, but that meant that owners of other Puerto Rican bonds would get less.In August, the dispute was resolved. The outcome was surprisingly generous to the owners of those sales-tax bonds. They were offered new bonds that would be valued at either 93 percent or 56 percent of what the old ones originally were worth, depending on the terms of the old bonds. (The amounts that investors in many other bonds will receive haven\u2019t yet been settled.)That was a boon for many investors, given that the bonds were trading for as little as 9 percent of their face value as recently as December.McKinsey owns some of those bonds.The investments were made through a subsidiary of the consulting firm, MIO Partners. MIO manages roughly $25 billion for McKinsey\u2019s thousands of employees, alumni and retirees. MIO, in turn, runs three hedge funds \u2014 Compass CSS High Yield, Compass ESMA and Compass TSMA \u2014 that have reported owning the sales-tax bonds and are seeking $20 million in repayments, according to regulatory filings and bankruptcy claims in San Juan\u2019s federal court.Even if all of those $20 million in bonds were redeemed at the lower amount of 56 percent, that would be an $11.2 million payment for McKinsey. The actual amount will probably be bigger. Filings by Compass CSS indicate that it stood to recoup about $10 million of its $16.3 million claim. Compass CSS originally paid $4.5 million for its bonds, the filings show, so the McKinsey-owned hedge fund could more than double its investment.Mr. Carella, the McKinsey spokesman, said its internal investments were managed by an independent unit, \u201cseparate from McKinsey\u2019s consulting operations.\u201dAnother McKinsey investment in Puerto Rico appears to be through a company called Whitebox Advisors, which as of 2016 managed about $100 million for McKinsey\u2019s retirement plans, according to regulatory filings.Whitebox, through various investment funds, holds more than $140 million of Puerto Rican bonds. One of those funds is called Pandora Select, which as of 2016 held money on behalf of McKinsey.In most other bankruptcies, McKinsey would have been required to disclose any Puerto Rican investments it had via Whitebox.Whitebox manages money for a number of clients, and court records do not show how much of its Puerto Rican assets are held for McKinsey. A Whitebox spokesman, Gregory Marose, said the firm had properly disclosed its investments.Mr. Carella acknowledged that McKinsey had attended some meetings with creditors. Over all, though, the consulting firm\u2019s role is to \u201cdesign a comprehensive fiscal plan\u201d for Puerto Rico, he said. He noted that other companies were handling the negotiations that would determine how much creditors, including McKinsey, recovered.In many other American bankruptcies, a potential conflict of interest like McKinsey\u2019s \u2014 no matter how innocuous \u2014 would have to be disclosed to the public, the court and the Justice Department. The purpose of such disclosures is to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process and avoid the appearance of inside dealing or cheating.If a judge finds that the disclosed conflicts of interest could influence the proceedings, the judge can remove parties, such as consulting firms, from the case or force them to relinquish their fees.When it won the job advising the oversight board, McKinsey signed a three-page Vendor Conflict of Interest Disclosure Certification. It states that McKinsey is not separately working with any people on the oversight board or any branch of the Puerto Rican government. But it says nothing about McKinsey\u2019s own investments or other potential conflicts of interest.To comply with disclosure requirements, banks, law firms, appraisers, accounting firms and consultants that work for creditors have had to file more than 15,000 pages of paperwork about potential conflicts of interest.Aside from the three-page certification, McKinsey has filed nothing.That\u2019s because Congress, as it wrote Puerto Rico\u2019s restructuring law, excluded advisers to the territory\u2019s oversight board from the disclosure requirements that applied to everyone else. It\u2019s unclear why lawmakers created that exemption.This month, four members of Mr. Alix\u2019s legal team \u2014 two academic experts on bankruptcy law and two retired bankruptcy judges \u2014 filed a sworn declaration in the case, calling McKinsey\u2019s alleged evasion of disclosure rules \u201cunprecedented.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From the Director of \u2018Call Me by Your Name,\u2019 a New Project: A House", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "Luca Guadagnino has long dreamed of being an interior designer. Inside a former silk mill on Lake Como, he got his shot.Supported by11 PhotosInside, the couple sought a harmonious retreat. Guadagnino started with a psychologically detailed questionnaire: What colors do they like? What time of the day do they prefer? How do they see themselves in a room? Answers in hand \u2014 bright jewel tones, mornings, playing board games with their 7-year-old daughter, Margherita \u2014 the director began composing a storyboard in the form of a workbook, a thick volume that encompassed a minutely detailed inventory of the exemplary collection of 20th-century furniture that Marchetti had been amassing for years. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller,\u201d Guadagnino says. \u201cThat\u2019s my first job.\u201dTHOUGH SKILLED AT creating sumptuous movie sets, the director is neither a trained architect nor an interior designer. Along with a general contractor, the 150 Italian craftspeople Guadagnino assembled like a crew executed his design for the brass-trimmed, ribbed oak paneling used on the lower part of some walls (inspired by, Guadagnino says, \u201ca very precious wood box, the kind you can find in Japan\u201d); upholstered those same walls above the dado with Kvadrat wool fabrics in geometric panels in reference to both the structure\u2019s origins as a textile factory and its mid-20th century Modernist design; and applied in stucco at the cornices a motif of double-ended ogives, a vaguely maritime style that alludes to the lake visible beyond the brass window frames. Still, La Filanda isn\u2019t baldly literal in its references. While it is tempting to think of the place as engineered with the taut economy of a yacht interior, the house more accurately evokes a puzzle, one whose interlocking pieces seamlessly, and seemingly inevitably, fit together.Before Guadagnino began, the couple had already gutted the building, which was constructed more than a century ago during a boom in an industry first begun at Como in the 1400s, when Ludovico Sforza (then the Duke of Milan) commanded that the lakeside be planted with mulberry trees for the delectation of silkworms. (Until as recently as the 1970s \u2014 when the industry migrated to China \u2014 silk remained the area\u2019s most important commercial export.) In the decades after the shuttlecocks stopped clacking through looms at La Filanda, the mill was used as a tennis racket factory, then as an auto repair shop and, finally, as a depot for boat motors before sinking at last into pigeon-haunted desuetude. It was the building\u2019s shoe-box shape that inspired Marchetti and Olsen to acquire it five years ago, after having spotted it on strolls from their nearby rental.If executing their vision would prove complex, the impetus for the home\u2019s purchase was simple: \u201cMy dream was always to have a pool,\u201d Marchetti says. Originally intended for the ground floor, it was relocated to the basement after workers discovered that the soil beneath the building was contaminated with lead and would need to be removed. After the subterranean bathing pavilion was completed, the house\u2019s transformation picked up pace, Guadagnino filling the home with treasures accumulated by the couple as well as pieces he found for them.Guests enter La Filanda at the structure\u2019s midpoint, a sunlit foyer dominated by an immense Claude Lalanne Bagatelle mirror framed in looping bronze tendrils and hung above a matching Lalanne console. For Marchetti, the pair of bronze mice he specified to scurry up the table\u2019s struts are as much a source of pleasure as the Giorgio Morandi still life from the 1950s that he impulsively purchased from an online auction and that now hangs in the ground-floor powder room.AS WITH HIS films, a second take was sometimes required. At the core of the house is an oak stairway resembling the interior of a chambered nautilus that links all three floors. Built once in its entirety, it was torn out and recreated after the original curve was judged to be clumsy. In keeping with the house\u2019s palette, the treads are covered in a bespoke rainbow ombr\u00e9 carpet from France\u2019s La Manufacture Cogolin, the colors of which increase or diminish in intensity \u2014 yellow to orange to red to blue to green \u2014 as you ascend to the bedroom floor or descend to the screening and changing rooms at the pool level. \u201cEven though the house is contemporary, it\u2019s also meant to be a sensual place,\u201d Guadagnino says.An earlier version of this article misidentified the maker of the rainbow ombr\u00e9 carpet on the stairs; it is La Manufacture Cogolin, not the Gobelins Manufactory.Advertisement"}

He was so optimistic the region would be selected that he invested in three real estate companies he thought would benefit if Amazon chose the area. Then he thought he got an HQ2 crumb when he heard from a recruiter for Amazon\u2019s retail division, which doesn\u2019t have a large engineering presence locally. \u201cSome people do fantasy football,\u201d Mr. Fidler said. \u201cI prefer to speculate on Amazon.\u201dA tenuous connection, indeed.

The Trump administration has blocked the reappointment of judges to the W.T.O.\u2019s dispute resolution panel, threatening to cripple it.\u201cThe E.U., along with many partners, wishes to see political support from the G20 to strengthen the W.T.O.\u2019s negotiating, monitoring and dispute settlement functions,\u201d the European Commission said in a statement Friday.The Trump administration broke with the longstanding international consensus on free trade soon after Mr. Trump took office, when G20 finance ministers and central bankers met in Germany.At the insistence of Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, the communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of that meeting in March 2017 did not include the usually commonplace commitment to open trade. The statement also omitted boilerplate language condemning protectionism that was used in the past.That was the beginning of a steady deterioration in the tone of summit meetings that culminated in June when Mr. Trump refused to sign a joint statement with American allies after a meeting of the more exclusive Group of 7 in Canada. As he flew away from the meeting, Mr. Trump tweeted that Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, was \u201cvery dishonest and weak.\u201dMost countries sent cabinet-level officials this week to Mar del Plata, but the United States was represented by Dennis Shea, the deputy United States trade representative.The event in Mar del Plata was one of several issue-specific meetings taking place in Argentina ahead of a November summit meeting of G20 leaders in Buenos Aires.Daniel Politi reported from Buenos Aires and Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

This year he\u2019s giving some $20 million to Democrats.Ms. Weiss is a staff writer and editor for the Opinion section. BOSTON \u2014 The first page of Seth Klarman\u2019s most recent 25-page investor letter does not inspire confidence. There are quotes about truth and justice from George Orwell, Reinhold Niebuhr and Mark Twain. But the kicker is a line from Ramsay Bolton, a character from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d: \u201cIf you think this has a happy ending, you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\u201d It\u2019s not because people aren\u2019t interested in what he has to say.\u201cI\u2019m kind of a loner,\u201d Mr. Klarman said last week in his 17th-floor office close to the Boston Common. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m willing to come out of my shell and talk to you is because I think democracy is at stake. And maybe I\u2019ll be able to convince some other people of that. And get them to support Democrats in 2018.\u201dThe F.E.C. filings that will come out on Sept. 20 will show that Mr. Klarman is now giving almost exclusively Democrats \u2014 and donating far more money than he ever has.For Mr. Klarman, the logic is plain: \u201cWe need to turn the House and Senate as a check on Donald Trump and his runaway presidency.\u201dHe referred to what\u2019s going on in Washington as an \u201cemergency\u201d multiple times and suggested that the question patriots should ask themselves about the midterms is: What\u2019s the price tag for democracy? If you knew your donation would give your grandchildren a better chance of growing up in one, how much would you contribute? \u201cIt seems like the answer should be a huge amount,\u201d he said.How far? \u201cBy the election I think I\u2019ll have spent between $18 and $20 million.\u201dThat would put him among the very top Democratic donors. Brendan Quinn of the Center for Responsive Politics said: \u201cThink of it this way: As of August, George Soros has given $12 million. I have no way of knowing how much more he\u2019ll contribute this cycle, but it\u2019s entirely possible that Klarman could end up giving more than him.\u201dThere are many people who are similarly situated to Seth Klarman \u2014 wealthy, hawkish, socially liberal, fiscally conservative types who felt politically homeless long before Mr. Trump came onto the scene. Many of them, like Mr. Klarman, were alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. Many of them, like Mr. Klarman, spoke out forcefully during the campaign.But these days, thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, his Supreme Court picks and the roaring economy, they are far more inclined to dump on the president over crudo with their friends than to say anything publicly, let alone change their giving. After all, is life not better for them under this president?Mr. Klarman is mystified by this behavior.\u201cPeople should be asking themselves: Why are we writing checks to these same people who are cowards?\u201d His message to such people: \u201cPlease join me.\u201d Is Mr. Klarman concerned that he\u2019s helping the Democratic Party even as it moves well to the left of his political comfort zone? \u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019m actually excited about somebody like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez coming along because it\u2019s a way of younger people and people of color and people who are different finding their voice and being part of the process,\u201d he said. But he waved off the idea that democratic socialism is on the march. \u201cPeople call themselves democratic socialists. I don\u2019t even know what that means,\u201d he said. \u201cSocialism is not the answer to anyone\u2019s problems.\u201dAs for Republicans, he said, they \u201cwere supposed to be the fiscally responsible party.\u201d But they\u2019re running a trillion-dollar deficit and have given a huge tax cut \u201clargely to rich people.\u201d He added, \u201cWhatever irresponsible fiscal things the Democrats do won\u2019t be worse than what the Republicans have already done.\u201dWhat if it came down to a choice between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders? While a President Sanders would be \u201cappalling,\u201d he says Mr. Sanders is \u201cnot unhinged\u201d and so he would pull the lever for him.Mr. Klarman\u2019s hoping, though, the Democrats hew close to the center.\u201cThe Republicans have abandoned the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats should seize that and plant their flags right there and win.\u201dWinning is the thing that matters to Mr. Klarman more than anything. Including his business. \u201cMe giving this interview could conceivably upset a few of my clients,\u201d he told me. \u201cI love all my clients. I want them to stay as clients.

But Is It Ready for the Fight?", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, faster than many in either nation expected, that has all changed.As the acrimony and rivalry with the United States have intensified, the immediate worry in Beijing is how the Chinese public, accustomed to a fast-expanding economy, will handle the trade war, and what impact it might have on the ruling Communist Party\u2019s overriding concern of domestic stability.The government has sought to project confidence.\u201cMaybe the growth rate will slow 1 percent. We can accept it. That\u2019s not terrible for us,\u201d said Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of The Global Times, a state-run newspaper known for its nationalist tone. He added that Washington would soon realize that its mobile phone and auto manufacturers could not survive without Chinese customers.\u201cAs long as our market is expanding economically and growing, China will win the trade war,\u201d he said.Charles S. Y. Liu, a private equity investor who sometimes advises the government, said the Chinese people were prepared to endure a protracted trade conflict.\u201cThe Chinese are more tolerant of pain because we have been poor for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cWealth has only arrived in the last decade.\u201dBut many others are worried, and some have urged the Chinese leadership to seize the moment and shift the economy even further toward open markets and private enterprise rather than allowing an inefficient state sector to dig in.\u201cA closed approach will lead to a decline in the rate of national competitiveness,\u201d wrote Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, in a recent paper. He warned that China risked returning to the stagnation it suffered in isolation during the Mao era.\u201cWhen Trump adopts a protectionist strategy, China should have an open door and force the state-owned enterprises to reform,\u201d Professor Yan added in an interview. But he said his advice was being ignored. \u201cI get no reaction. Nobody listens to me.\u201d\u201cThe same things can be done without such arrogance,\u201d said Yun Sun, an analyst at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington. \u201cI believe the Chinese policy community does wish to see more actions and more assertiveness but Xi went too far.\u201dThe party has sought to censor criticism of Mr. Xi but there have been glimpses of anxiety online about the potential impact of the trade war as well as anger at the Belt and Road Initiative, which has earmarked hundreds of billions of dollars for overseas projects intended to lift China\u2019s clout abroad.Echoing a popular opinion on social media, a retired economics professor, Sun Wenguang, has argued that it is wrong to spend so much money in other countries given the problems that China faces at home.\u201cSome are too poor to see a doctor, some are too poor to have pensions after retirement, and some too poor to go to school,\u201d Professor Sun said in an interview on the Voice of America last month. \u201cUnder such circumstances, if you still choose to throw money at other countries, domestic backlash is almost guaranteed.\u201dProfessor Sun\u2019s criticism reflects a broader concern in China about the government\u2019s efforts to win over allies. The subject is important because the United States has long touted its alliances as key to its national strength generally and its ability to counter China\u2019s rise in Asia in particular.China enjoys significant advantages in the region. It is the largest trading partner of almost every country in Asia while President Trump has strained relations with allies around the world. Even Japan, America\u2019s most important ally in Asia, appears to be drifting closer to China as Mr. Trump threatens the nation with tariffs.In a rapprochement between the two Asian rivals, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to travel to Beijing next month, the first visit to China by a Japanese leader since 2011.\u201cTrump said recently, \u2018Japan, you\u2019re next for tariffs,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Liu, the private equity manager. \u201cThank you, Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cI recall a topic hotly debated on line by young internet users: Who is really China\u2019s enemy? Is it America? Japan? Russia?\u201d wrote the scholar, Luo Jianbo, head of the China Foreign Policy Center at the Central Party School. \u201cIf we think about things coolly, perhaps none of them are. China\u2019s enemy is itself.\u201dIn many ways, the Chinese political elite has been caught off guard by how quickly relations have deteriorated with the United States, which has long been a source of envy and inspiration for many Chinese as well as a leading destination for education and immigration.Chinese scholars often observe that new American presidents usually take a hard line against China but seek cooperation after realizing how the two nations need each other. President Trump has stunned them by defying that pattern.\u201cI personally feel surprised by the fact that Trump is taking such radical measures,\u201d said Mr. Hu, the newspaper editor. \u201cI initially thought it was a joke, but it turns out to be a real policy, putting tariffs on all these products.\u201dSome Chinese analysts have sought to explain the escalating conflict with the United States by focusing on the personal qualities of the nation\u2019s two leaders. Mr. Trump is a viewed as a fickle, transactional businessman who may retreat after the midterm elections in November. They note he has repeatedly spoken out against China\u2019s trade practices but said little about human rights or military issues.Mr. Xi, on the other hand, is said to have invested too much politically in his signature programs to back down under foreign pressure.\u201cPersonality matters in this relationship,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, the director of the American Studies Center at Fudan University. \u201cThe biggest problem is Trump\u2019s credibility.\u201dThough Beijing devotes tremendous resources to studying the United States, there seems to be little understanding that the hostility against China in Washington is bipartisan, that trade concessions alone may be insufficient and that many frustrated business leaders, once defenders of good ties with China, now favor tougher measures against it as well.Teng Jianqun, director of American studies at the China Institute for International Studies, said the government needed to accept the new reality and tell the Chinese public that the coming struggle could be the beginning of a long fight for the country\u2019s survival as a great power.\u201cWe should let our people fully know that this trade war is not a short-term contest,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a contest that will determine the future of the Chinese nation.\u201dLuz Ding contributed research.Advertisement"}

But it is stubborn and adaptable.Opinion ColumnistATHENS \u2014 Gazing at the Acropolis the other day from an Athens rooftop, I was reminded of Samuel Beckett\u2019s words: \u201cEver tried. Ever failed. No Matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\u201dTry again. Fail again. Fail better.It\u2019s important to put our current democratic travails in perspective. At its best, democracy is a culture that empowers free citizens to participate in shaping their fates. At its worst, it is a charade in which civic bonds erode, power accrues to the few, self-aggrandizement becomes the norm, and tolerance and restraint are consumed by the howling mob. Then the very word becomes a sham, a disguise deployed by autocrats like Vladimir Putin.The Parthenon exhorts us to be stubborn about the sacredness of truth.At the Athens Democracy Forum, hosted by this newspaper, I listened to the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, allude to \u201cundemocratic liberalism\u201d as a catalyst to the current wave of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d in places like Poland and Hungary. The voter is wise. Voters have been telling us something about failure these past several years. To ignore those failures \u2014 involving impunity, arrogance, inequality and remoteness \u2014 is to invite ruin.People think differently. Representative democracy provides a means to mediate these differences for the greater good. It depends on the recognition, not the trampling, of disparate views.Democracy in danger has become a buzzword. Let\u2019s not forget that Greece and South Africa, resilient through crises, and Malaysia and Indonesia, suggest otherwise. The human urge to be free is not about to die in the 21st century.But, yes, Western democracy is in upheaval. Of late, it has concentrated, but not spread, wealth, suggesting that it\u2019s no more than a vehicle for injustice.Technology, twin-souled like Goethe\u2019s Faust, has changed the world for good and ill. We like. We dislike. We follow. We unfollow. We broadcast our lives. We fall silent. Adrenaline surges. Status anxiety follows. Contemporary life is a restless experiment in global direct democracy. We are networked. Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly active users. So do we really need representative democracy? Is it not just a means for rich globalized insiders to control our lives?Yascha Mounk, a lecturer on government at Harvard University, said the anti-democratic fires raging should not be underestimated. Each civic act, he suggested, is a glass of water that may help extinguish the flames.Which brings me to President Trump, the flamethrower who makes headlines even by falling silent. A joke is making the rounds. When Putin and Trump met in Helsinki, Finland, they shook hands. \u201cI\u2019m Vladimir Putin, president of Russia,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI\u2019m Donald J. Trump, president of the United States,\u201d Trump said.\u201cOh,\u201d said Putin, \u201cwhat does the J stand for?\u201d\u201cJenius!\u201d said Trump.This is the Age of the Genius.The Genius has little time for democratic checks and balances. The New York Times is \u201cfake news.\u201d The Genius mocks the architecture of postwar stability underwritten by American power. \u201cAmerica First!\u201d he declaims. He believes in \u201cthe will of the people,\u201d a dangerous phrase, as Angie Hobbs, a British philosopher, noted.If Trump is a fascist, Marx was right: History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. I wonder.Certainly, it\u2019s easy to lose your bearings in the president\u2019s torrent of lies. It\u2019s easy to shrug. The ugliest chapters of history are littered with bystanders.So, what am I worried about? Truth, above all; please protect it. Arrogance, as in the overuse of the word populism, a word freighted with contempt. I worry about atomization, the reduction of human beings to extensions of their devices. I worry about the insidiousness of Trump\u2019s moral depravity. I worry about the value of America\u2019s word, the glue to alliances that have upheld the free world.Still, I am an optimist. Democracy is stubborn. It raises our gaze. It is the system that best enshrines the unshakable human desire to be free. Athens reminds us of that. America reminds us of that. It fails. It falls short of John Winthrop\u2019s \u201ccity upon a hill.\u201d It strives still to fail better.Perhaps you know the story of the old man on his deathbed who was approached by his children.\u201cDad,\u201d they say. \u201cWe were afraid to ask you but perhaps the time has come.

Polls show the two in a statistical tie, and the outcome could be critical in determining who controls the Senate, where Republicans hold a 51-to-49 edge.But the event, like all of the campaign stops the president has held across the country in the run-up to the midterm elections, looked and sounded more like a boisterous re-election pep rally for Mr. Trump himself than a well-coordinated effort to lift the candidate.\u201cGet out in 2018, because you\u2019re voting for me in 2018,\u201d Mr. Trump told thousands of supporters in the JQH Arena, on the campus of Missouri State University. \u201cThey aren\u2019t just extreme,\u201d he said of Democrats. \u201cThey are frankly dangerous, and they are crazy.\u201d\u201cWhen he makes a promise, he keeps it,\u201d Mr. Hawley said of Mr. Trump. \u201cWhen he makes a commitment, he delivers.\u201d\u201cIn 2016, this man and you made history,\u201d Mr. Hawley told the crowd, adding that in his race, \u201ceverything that you voted for is on the line.\u201dThe president noted that Ms. McCaskill had opposed Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, calling him \u201ca fantastic man,\u201d and saying that he was confident the judge would be confirmed because he had been groomed for the position his whole life.\u201cHe was born for the United States Supreme Court \u2014 he was born for it \u2014 and it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Thousands of supporters waved cardboard signs and wore hats bearing Mr. Trump\u2019s election slogans \u2014 \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d \u201cKeep America Great\u201d and \u201cDrain the Swamp\u201d \u2014 while two large placards bracketing a giant American flag declared \u201cPromises Made\u201d and \u201cPromises Kept,\u201d the argument the president has been making about his first two years in office.Signs in support of Mr. Hawley were few and far between, and the digital banner around the arena directed people to send a text to Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, not Mr. Hawley\u2019s, to sign up as supporters.The president spoke at length about how his candidacy and electoral victory in 2016 had defied predictions, inviting his cheering audience to relive the night of the election with him. He imitated news anchors calling states in his favor, and described his election as \u201cone of the greatest nights in the history of our country, but far less importantly, one of the greatest nights in the history of television.\u201d\u201cIf he was on the ballot, there would be no question we would win both\u201d the House and Senate, Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, told the crowd as he warmed up the arena before Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance. \u201cWithout it, we need your support.\u201dMr. Trump acknowledged the challenge and the historic trend against the president\u2019s party holding Congress in midterm elections, saying: \u201cI know that the votes are sort of against us, but I don\u2019t know why. We have the greatest economy in history.\u201dPraising Mr. Hawley as a star, Mr. Trump criticized Ms. McCaskill as a slave to Democratic leaders who had opposed his agenda at every turn, charging that she wanted to give undocumented immigrants health care and education benefits.\u201cDemocrats even want to give welfare and free health care to illegal aliens, all paid for by you, the great American taxpayer,\u201d Mr. Trump said, twisting their position. \u201cRepublicans want to protect the safety net for truly needy Americans, not for illegal aliens.\u201dMr. Trump argued that Democrats sought to undercut the legitimacy of his presidency, casting the coming elections as a culture war in which his supporters must fight to protect their way of life.\u201cThe so-called resistance doesn\u2019t accept the will of the American people, they don\u2019t believe you have the right to run your own country, control your own lives, or defend the country\u2019s borders, traditions and heritage,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThis November, you will make your voice heard just like you did two Novembers ago, in the most exciting evening ever.\u201dAs he recited a litany of warnings about Democrats, charging they would destroy Medicare, throw open American borders to criminal immigrants and erode financial gains, Mr. Trump only rarely paused to remember the man for whom he was ostensibly campaigning.\u201cAnd Josh,\u201d he remarked at one point, as if out of the blue. \u201cJosh will help a lot.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mediterranean Death Rate Is Highest Since 2015 Migration Crisis", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor every 18 migrants who reached Italy by boat during the first seven months of 2018, one person drowned attempting that voyage. The toll is nearly triple the death rate during the period in 2015, and roughly double the rate in 2016, when a record number of migrants landed without authorization in Italy, which for most of the 21st century has been the main port of entry for people hoping to reach Europe by boat.That higher rate was around 80 percent below the levels during the peak of the crisis.Unauthorized migration between Libya and Italy fell markedly last summer, thanks to controversial negotiations between Marco Minniti, Mr. Salvini\u2019s predecessor, and Libyan militias that control the southern Mediterranean smuggling trade. But the death rate did not rise, largely because of the continued presence off the Libyan coast of private rescue boats run by nongovernmental organizations.Mr. Minniti\u2019s government introduced protocols that deterred those boats from working close to the Libyan coast, and empowered the Libyan Coast Guard to intercept and return more migrants to Libya. But the private boats could still deliver rescued migrants to Italian ports.That changed in June, days after Mr. Salvini\u2019s appointment, when a boat run by Doctors Without Borders and SOS Mediterranean was forced to sail to Spain after being denied entry to ports in Sicily. Merchant vessels and Italian Navy ships have since also been refused permission to disembark rescued migrants in Italy.This has left rescue responsibilities almost solely to the Libyan Coast Guard, an informal alliance of badly resourced and poorly trained sailors drawn from competing Libyan militias.\u201cA major factor contributing to the increased death rate is the decreased search and rescue capacity off the Libyan coast this year compared to the same period last year,\u201d the United Nations refugee agency said in its report.Mr. Villa described the situation as \u201ca cautionary tale\u201d for European officials who seek to justify countermigration measures with an argument that they are trying to save lives by stopping the smuggling trade.\u201cIf your objective is to reduce the death rate, then you should be very wary of delegating rescue to the Libyan Coast Guard, because they are clearly unable to deal with levels of more than 3,000 departures per month,\u201d Mr. Villa said.Migration specialists and rights activists have also criticized the policy of returning migrants to Libya, where civil war and the breakdown of law and order have created dangerous conditions for migrants, who are sometimes held for ransom or put to work in slaverylike conditions by the militias who have nominally rescued them.\u201cMany of the detention centers in Tripoli are on the front line of the fighting, and the latest escalation of violence has left people trapped for days in appalling conditions without food,\u201d Ibrahim Younis, the organization\u2019s head of mission in Libya, wrote in an email.\u201cThose that have recently managed to escape the detention centers to nearby neighborhoods are at risk of being caught in the crossfire,\u201d Mr. Younis said, adding that local hospitals where the organization refers migrants for secondary care \u201chave stopped discharging patients due to the fact that conditions outside are too dangerous, leaving less and less beds available for new patients.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The first World Happiness Report was published in 2012 by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, a project of the United Nations.Emotional States is the theme selected by organizers of this year\u2019s London Design Biennale, which takes over Somerset House on Sept. 4. During the Biennale, 40 pavilions representing nations, territories and cities will explore the relationship among design, social needs and our emotional responses.\u201cAt its core, the Biennale is about how design can create emotions, play off emotions and learn from emotions,\u201d said John Sorrell, president of the event. \u201cI want to make people think about the challenge that designers have to try and make things better, and how emotional response fits within this.\u201dThe result is a broad interpretation across design disciplines. While some participants examine emotional response at its most visceral, such as the Latvian pavilion\u2019s interactive exhibit exploring the joy of doodling in condensation, many participants take a more intellectual tack, creating immersive experiences that deal with heavy-duty political and social issues. Design is viewed as an agent for positive change, rather than simply the process of creating objects.The British representative is Forensic Architecture, a Turner Prize-nominated organization that gathers architectural evidence in cases of war crimes or other human rights abuses. Brazil offers a poignant and visually arresting snapshot of the effects of deforestation. Israel\u2019s offering will take the form of a \u201crapid response\u201d design studio called Exposed Nerves, intended to show the challenges faced by designers working in Israel. Everyday life is characterized by a lack of security, and political and social upheaval. The result is \u201cfast, ever-changing with sometimes unfinished outputs,\u201d explained the curator, Hila Shaltieli. \u201cThis is all as a result of the emotional, stressful and complicated everyday reality in Israel.\u201dAt the Biennale many contributions have been produced by collectives and interdisciplinary teams rather than by star brand names. The power of community activism and a citizen-centered approach to design recurs throughout the pavilions. Mr. Sorrell said he believed that there was a discernible shift away from the idea of the designer who commands singular authorship. \u201cEngaging a community in the design process is important to creating a positive emotional response \u2014 you can give them a sense of identity through design for the community, for civil society,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat designers need to be really good at is understanding the minds and the desires of the people they are ultimately designing for.\u201dBut this does not mean endless focus groups and market research. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of saying to people \u2018what do you want?\u2019 because often they won\u2019t know what\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is something the designer must understand in the conversation \u2014 that\u2019s where great creativity comes.\u201dGuatemala\u2019s pavilion showcases a handmade textile installation that represents Santa Catarina Palop\u00f3, a community where inhabitants use art and design to improve their physical environment by painting dazzling murals inspired by nearby Lake Atitl\u00e1n on their houses. Initially spearheaded by the CNN correspondent Harris Whitbeck in 2017, the aim of the project is to make residents feel more at home. It has been credited with a reduction in crime and a rise in tourism, which has improved the economy. The project offers a direct, visual example of design as a force for social and economic change.Austria\u2019s pavilion, After Abundance, tackles climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s not about presenting a complete solved problem, but using design practices as a way to investigate complex social, political and cultural issues,\u201d according to the project\u2019s curator, Thomas Geisler. \u201cWe are interested in issues that confront the future generations of designers.\u201dThe pavilion offers a glimpse of a future Alpine landscape, where the natural and human worlds are inseparable. Visitors are transported to a traditional Austrian farmhouse where a future local community tackles climate change by combining new technology and traditional crafts. Members share renewable energy and genetically modify their own corn to survive. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to create a linear emotional response,\u201d said the project\u2019s leader, Anab Jain, professor of industrial design at the University in Applied Arts in Vienna. \u201cSome might find it dystopian but there is hope \u2014 we have the tools, tactics, resilience and ingenuity to address these challenges.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that designers will stop designing products, but the new generation of designers is much more socially aware,\u201d Ms. Jain added. \u201cDesigners are uniquely placed to explore complex issues.\u201dDesigning products that generate long-term happiness is a focus for Paul Hekkert, head of Industrial Design at Delft University of Technology. Creating a happy moment is easy, he said, but designing for sustained, prolonged happiness presents a greater challenge.Mr. Hekkert said that he believed that in the last five to 10 years, the Western world consumerist reliance on instant gratification \u2014 the belief that buying new shiny stuff made us happy \u2014 was losing its luster. \u201cThe whole well-being movement has made us more aware that what truly makes us happiest is to have good relationships, to be healthy and to be mindful.\u201dExercise, enjoying an active social life and having a sense of purpose are all important to long-term happiness, he added. \u201cWe know the general mechanisms that create long-term happiness, so the question is, how can we design services and products that will ultimately make people more happy?\u201dThe car industry is quickly adapting to this shift in consumer mind-set, Mr. Hekkert said: \u201cPeople buy an electric car because it makes them feel good, they are contributing to a bigger purpose, they are creating a cleaner world.\u201d The sharing economy \u2014 another trend triggering huge change \u2014 has also shifted the role of design, he added, because ownership of products is no longer an aspiration. \u201cProducts are increasingly a means to an end, and if your end is no longer showing off and having status, you start to see the design in a totally different light.\u201dMalpass said \u201cnormal\u201d product designs jobs \u2014 such as consumer electronics or furniture \u2014 were all but disappearing. \u201cMany of my students say, \u2018I am never going to design industrial products, I\u2019m going to use my design practice as a form of social commentary, political critique or activism,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c We are in a very complex moment so there are lots of problems to solve \u2014 and designers love a problem.\u201dThis, in part, is the purpose of the Biennale. \u201cI want to dispel the idea that design is simply about how things look,\u201d Mr. Sorrell said. \u201cWhat we need right now is designers in the Civil Service,\u201d members of Parliaments and \u201con boards of businesses.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.America shouldn\u2019t be in the coup business. Period.It\u2019s a relief, then, to learn that the Trump administration chose not to aid rebellious leaders in Venezuela seeking to overthrow President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But it\u2019s worrisome to think that President Trump and his advisers made the right call for the wrong reason \u2014 lack of confidence in the plotters to succeed in a risky operation rather than principled concern about intervention.Given the turmoil in Venezuela, it is not unreasonable for American diplomats to meet with all factions, including mutinous military officers, to learn their thinking. For instance, who would be in charge in a political transition process? What kind of government do they aim for? But holding multiple meetings with the plotters begins to look like collaboration. The news was bound to leak out, as it has. For much of the past century, the United States compiled a sordid history in Latin America, using force and cunning to install and support military regimes and other brutal thugs with little interest in democracy. Gunboat diplomacy in the early 20th century saw American Marines invading Cuba, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and elsewhere to set up governments of Washington\u2019s choosing.A vanishing few of these interventions came to anything that could be considered a good end.Here\u2019s the right way to put pressure on Venezuela\u2019s regime: Mr. Trump and other leaders need to keep trying to encourage a transition deal by tightening targeted sanctions on Mr. Maduro and his cronies who undergird an autocratic, corrupt system. Cuba, which is dependent on Venezuela for oil and has close relations with Mr. Maduro, should be encouraged to use its leverage. Mr. Trump and other leaders also need to coordinate and expand assistance for Venezuela\u2019s suffering people.It\u2019s heartening that the White House sent a diplomat to the meetings, rather than a C.I.A. officer, which would have been a more incendiary signal. Clearly a diplomatic path is better than having the United States meddle in yet another country, an enterprise certain to fail miserably. As a result, although democracy has spread to most governments in Latin America over the past quarter-century, few people or leaders in the region would protest if Mr. Maduro were forced out. It\u2019s difficult to be optimistic about Venezuela, which many experts predict will collapse into anarchy. Still, backing a coup would also make it harder for Americans to advocate credibly on behalf of democracy around the world, an effort that is already compromised by President Trump\u2019s own trampling of democratic norms at home, and his enthusiasm for foreign tyrants.Advertisement"}

The economy is growing, companies are hiring, and the housing market is hot, with this suburban enclave spreading farther into the Mojave Desert.But the recovery has been uneven.Steady growth across the country has lifted the stock market and corporate profits. Those gains, though, haven\u2019t filtered down to most workers. Incomes have barely budged, and consumer debt is increasing again.Housing prices in North Las Vegas are rising so fast that many communities are no longer affordable.

Not when you\u2019ve alienated the whole world.Opinion ColumnistThere are so many issues breaking right now that it\u2019s hard to keep track \u2014 and focusing on any one leads to feelings of guilt about neglecting the others. But it\u2019s worth remembering that the Trump trade war still seems to be on track, and important to have a sense of its effects.The view within the Trump administration is, of course, that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d Where does this view come from? Actually, it involves two propositions.First, it takes the mercantilist view under which trade as a zero-sum game in which whoever sells more wins. Because the U.S. runs a trade deficit, we\u2019re losers, and anything that reduces that trade deficit is good.Second, it takes for granted the proposition that precisely because the U.S. exports less to other countries than we buy in return, a trade war will hurt them more than it hurts us, reducing U.S. imports more than it reduces U.S. exports.Now, anyone who looks at the actual effects of international trade knows that the first proposition is wrong: trade isn\u2019t just about selling stuff, it\u2019s about getting better, cheaper stuff both to consume and to use as inputs in production. But you might assume that at least the second proposition is true: a round of tariff retaliation should reduce foreign exports to the U.S. more than it reduces U.S. exports to the rest of the world, simply because those foreign exports are bigger to start with.Let\u2019s be clear: these are the results of models, not actual experience, and could be wrong. But it\u2019s still worth asking why the modelers are getting this result. The short answer is the phenomenon known in the field as \u201ctrade diversion.\u201dFor simplicity, think of the world as three economies: America, China, and Europe. Both the ECB and the BOE are assuming scenarios in which America raises tariffs on China and Europe, with China and Europe retaliating. But China and Europe don\u2019t raise tariffs on each other.Such a scenario gives both foreign consumers and foreign producers a lot of options to diversify away from America. Chinese producers, facing U.S. tariffs, can sell more to Europe instead; Chinese consumers, instead of paying tariffs on goods imported from America, can seek substitutes from Europe. The story for Europe is the same. But U.S. consumers and businesses won\u2019t have comparable flexibility.The difference in ability to switch partners means that both U.S. exports and U.S. businesses that depend on imported components etc. will be hit harder for any given level of tariffs than their counterparts abroad.But why assume that it\u2019s a unilateral U.S. trade war against everyone? Because that\u2019s what is happening. The Trump administration has isolated America on many fronts, and trade policy is very much one of them. Under different leadership, America and Europe might be working together to put pressure on China over things like intellectual property, but given who\u2019s actually in charge, we\u2019re on our own.As Trump just found out at the U.N., the world is literally laughing at us. And it certainly doesn\u2019t trust us, in fact is looking for ways to cut us out of various loops. This matters for a lot of things \u2014 and trade war, it turns out, is one area where go-it-alone will be costly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Way Australia Funds the Arts a Recipe for Mediocrity?", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySYDNEY, Australia \u2014 In a rehearsal room here earlier this year, actors were doing a walk-through of the stage adaptation of \u201cThe 91-Story Treehouse,\u201d a best-selling children\u2019s book. In the magical world the play creates, two well-meaning, if haphazard, protagonists live in a multistory treehouse where they try to write a story, but keep getting distracted by villains.Australia is a global leader in theater for young audiences \u2014 delivering experiences that don\u2019t just educate, but also entertain, with often dark and provocative source material that doesn\u2019t patronize its viewers.Yet as a for-profit company, C.D.P. is not eligible for government funding for its core costs. And despite Australia\u2019s role as a trendsetter in youth theater, funding from government is generally scarce.The problem is not isolated to youth theater, said Andrew Threlfall, C.D.P.\u2019s director. He and a growing number of artistic leaders in Australia have come to believe that government funding for all the performing arts is simply not enough, nor is it as well spent as it could be.The arts in Australia are running \u201con an emptying petrol tank,\u201d Julian Meyrick, a professor of creative arts at Flinders University, said in an interview.Worse in many ways, experts say, arts funding is running the same way it has for years \u2014 as an insiders\u2019 game.The vast majority of funding for the performing arts is awarded from the federal government through an agency called the Australia Council. Some grants from the Australia Council are based on assessments by panels of artists, arts workers and industry experts known as peer assessments; the council describes itself as operating on an \u201carm\u2019s-length\u201d principle, meaning the government can provide policy directions but can\u2019t instruct individual funding decisions.Still, more than half of the Australia Council\u2019s funding goes to a group of 28 large organizations that are not subject to the same system of peer assessment. Referred to as \u201cthe majors,\u201d the group includes theaters, orchestras and ballet and opera companies that have relied on government money for years.Smaller groups shut out of the club of 28 are becoming increasingly vocal in criticizing the structure. Though state and local grants sometimes help, many smaller groups argue that Australia\u2019s support for the performing arts is based not on merit, but outdated ideas about what makes some art forms more worthy than others.\u201cThe fact that there hasn\u2019t been any change in the group of companies seen as national cultural leaders has been frustrating for many,\u201d said Rachel Healy, joint artistic director of the Adelaide Festival.Cultural cringe \u2014 in part, the tendency to overvalue the culture of Europe and North America and undervalue Australia\u2019s own \u2014 lingers, many Australians in the arts argue. This, they say, plays into why the 28 majors, who mostly concentrate on traditional art forms and repertoire, are still so revered by those who manage government funding.Professor Meyrick said that cultural cringe has lessened over the years, as Australia gained more confidence on the global stage. Yet this attitude is \u201cstill hard-wired into the administration of culture.\u201dOne example is programming. When he was the literary manager at the Melbourne Theatre Company (one of the majors) from 2002 to 2007, Professor Meyrick said the company regularly looked to Britain and the United States for inspiration \u201crather than thinking what drama of our own can we revive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophesy: if you\u2019re not putting it on, then you\u2019re not encouraging the supply. And if you\u2019re not encouraging the supply, you\u2019ve got nothing to put on,\u201d he said.Some of the majors \u2014 such as the pioneering Indigenous dance company Bangarra and the Australian Ballet, both of which regularly create new works \u2014 are celebrated globally. Others, critics say, routinely underperform, staging artistically stagnant productions despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 their privileged standing.Yaron Lifschitz, artistic director of Brisbane-based circus company Circa, said that the government is entrenching a culture in the Australian performing arts of \u201coverfunding mediocrity.\u201dCirca has received around $1.4 million in government grants this year. Other money, the vast majority, is raised through ticket sales, fee-based consultancy work and a circus training center.\u201cI see a young vibrant culture with stories to tell and things to offer the world \u2014 and I see a group of extraordinarily courageous and hardworking artists,\u201d Mr. Lifschitz said in a recent interview during one of the company\u2019s rehearsals. Onstage, a man was balancing on a woman\u2019s calves while Mozart blared. \u201cBut I see them not having the resources to do that to their full capacity,\u201d he added.In a speech last year at Sydney\u2019s Museum of Contempoary Art, Mr. Lifschitz put it more bluntly, implicitly comparing Australia\u2019s arts policies to the thickening of artery walls that occur before a heart attack. Many of the majors, he said, are \u201carteriosclerotic \u2014 playing heritage works to aging audiences.\u201dBy contrast, some Australians regard the arts with suspicion, said Christopher Tooher, executive director of the annual Sydney Festival. Fifteen years ago, he said, the newly elected head of the government in the state of New South Wales felt the need to reassure the public that he was \u201ca footy man,\u201d referring to Australian Rules football, the national sport, \u201cnot an opera man.\u201dHis message was that the arts \u201cwere something that \u2018the other\u2019 did,\u201d Mr. Tooher said.\u201cAustralians like to think of themselves as sportsmen,\u201d David McAllister, artistic director of the Australian Ballet, said in an interview at the Sydney Opera House. \u201cWe don\u2019t revere people for their intellect or their artistic pursuits,\u201d he added. \u201cBut if they win a gold medal we want to put them on the front of everything.\u201dBut instead of removing Opera Queensland from the list of major performing arts companies, Australia Council funding has been increased. In February, the government in the state of Queensland also committed an extra $1.6 million over four years.\u201cYou think: That\u2019s nuts!\u201d said Jo Caust, an associate professor at the University of Melbourne who researches arts funding. She questioned why the Australia Council did not remove Opera Queensland from the list of major performing arts companies \u201cand put in another company that is doing really well.\u201dMs. Caust put this down to entrenched ideas about what is artistically valuable, namely traditional forms such as the ballet or opera, which are often at odds with more popular art forms. \u201cFunding of the arts is seen then as rewarding elite arts practices,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWhile it is evident that arts practice is generally embraced by the majority of the population, the \u2018high\u2019 arts are not necessarily understood as the kind of arts practice that the majority support.\u201d\u201cIt assumes a certain type of cultural hierarchy. There are big questions that are never asked because they are too hard and to change the pattern of funding is extremely difficult. There are also forces that will fight it to the death,\u201d Ms. Caust said.Patrick Nolan, who became artistic director of Opera Queensland last year, is adamant that the company should still receive funding as one of the major performing arts companies, despite its patchy record. In an interview, he said Opera Queensland responded to the review with an \u201cextensive process of investigating our funding structure and the way the company is operating. As a result of that process, we received an uplift in our funding.\u201d One of the goals of the extra funding, he added, is to build audience numbers and to put on more productions.\u201cI have a lot of issues with this whole \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them\u2019 \u201d Mr. Nolan said, noting that Opera Queensland collaborates with other small and medium-sized performing arts companies, including Brisbane\u2019s Expressions Dance Company and the Blue Roo Theatre Company.\u201cIf you do dismantle the majors, it is going to have a really detrimental effect on the entire ecosystem of the arts,\u201d Mr. Nolan added, pointing out that for each production, Opera Queensland hires up to 200 artists and crew members.But for Mr. Lifschitz, the system is fundamentally unjust: \u201cIf you\u2019re in one of the major companies, if you run up a deficit, you run up a deficit. If we run up a deficit we don\u2019t exist \u2014 no one is going to bail us out.\u201dSo what are the alternatives? One is a system of philanthropy and private funding, as favored in the United States.Wesley Enoch, director of the Sydney Festival, said he thought some of the country\u2019s major companies could go commercial. The Australian Ballet, for instance, receives only 10 percent of its operational cost through federal funding.That funding provides a cushion that allows the Australian Ballet to take risks, said Mr. McAllister, the company\u2019s artistic director.\u201cThat sense of being able to afford failure\u201d allowed the company to produce the best works, he added. Funding should be allocated on merit and individual companies should add to it by raising donations and commercial sponsorship, and selling tickets, he said.Arena Theatre is following a different model: In March, the youth theater company relocated from Melbourne to become a resident company in Bendigo, a small city about 100 miles from Melbourne. A grant from the state of Victoria provided assistance for the relocation and the Australia Council gave $75,000 to support a year of programming. In return, Arena Theatre will run programs with young people in the city, and will also create new work to take on tour.\u201cThe sector is viewing this with a great deal of interest \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty bold move for a company that tours nationally and internationally to make its home in a regional area,\u201d said Arena Theatre\u2019s former executive producer Sheah Sutton.The lizard is one of forty puppets created for their critically acclaimed production about Charles Darwin \u201cThe Wider Earth.\u201dDead Puppet Society relies on one-off grants from government for individual projects. It also partners with larger organizations (Queensland Theatre in \u201cThe Wider Earth\u2019s\u201d case), and runs an educational program that brings in money for the company.It hasn\u2019t applied for continuing funding from the Australia Council, a decision Mr. Paine described as \u201cstrategic.\u201d\u201cWe love how nimble we can be,\u201d he said. \u201cWith constant shifts in cultural policy and organizations losing core funding, we like knowing that we are able to operate by drawing on a variety of support rather than relying on government only.\u201d\u201cIt is invigorating,\u201d Mr. Morton said. \u201cThe game is always on, there is no pattern to fall into.\u201dWithout state funding, Dead Puppet Society has had to build strong partnerships: \u201cThe Wider Earth\u201d was developed in Cape Town at Handspring Puppet Company, known for \u201cWar Horse,\u201d and at St. Ann\u2019s Warehouse, the performing arts center in Brooklyn, New York. That opens doors, particularly in a geographically isolated country like Australia.\u201cThe Wider Earth,\u201d for example, will start a six-month run in London\u2019s Natural History Museum in October \u2014 the first time a theater of its size has ever been erected in the institution.\u201cWe were hoping to make a work that could have an international appeal,\u201d said Mr. Morton, who added that in Australia there is a tendency to \u201crely on an \u2018art class\u2019 \u201d of wealthy, educated patrons at the expense of the wider populace.In this environment, support for government funding of the arts is declining. A survey by the Australia Council found that the number who backed public funding had declined 19 percent between 2009 and 2016, from 85 percent to 66.Wesley Enoch from the Sydney Festival said that this was because many of the major companies mounted productions that appeal to well-educated, wealthy, white audiences. \u201cWhere are the strong working-class voices?\u201d Mr. Enoch asked.\u201cIndigenous voices or political voices\u201d were also neglected, added Mr. Enoch, who is Indigenous. \u201cWe can sometimes have a very narrow bandwidth for cultural expression,\u201d he said. Funding should go to a broader range of companies, he added, to allow groups to \u201cexplore new and interesting stories.\u201dMr. Morton said that \u201cthere is a degree of heritage that is important to preserve,\u201d when it comes to supporting the 28 majors. On the other hand, \u201cmaybe it does not provoke innovation \u2014 if there is an expectation or a degree of comfort, there\u2019s no need to struggle.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Detained by Russian security forces, tortured and told she would be executed.None of this was enough to stop Anna Politkovskaya from reporting on the second Chechen War.A director turned playwright based in Tuscany, Mr. Massini, 43, is known for finding tragic grandeur in an eclectic array of real-life subjects.In an email correspondence, Mr. Massini talked about his artistic interest in historical figures and why he is hopes to visit New York. Edited excerpts follow. How soon after Politkovskaya\u2019s murder did you begin working on this play?I remember very well: I began writing immediately. And do you know why? Because I was struck by the fact that by killing Anna, someone thought they were solving a big problem. It was simple: Is there a journalist who tells uncomfortable truths? Good: We kill her. So who will ever realize it? Who will ever remember her, once she is buried? She will end up forgotten. This is why I decided to write.Rather than a naturalistic play, you have three actresses, who all play Anna at times, address the audience directly. Why this form for this story?I have always written in this form. My plays are strange, I recognize it. Something halfway between the epic, the screenplay, the ancient tragedy. Do you remember the anatomical table? Here it is: the theater is the biopsy of reality. At least it is for me.\u201cThe Lehman Trilogy\u201d is also a three-actor play. Is this just a coincidence?Almost all of \u201cIntractable Woman\u201d is told in Politkovskaya\u2019s voice. How much of the text is taken from her work and how much is your own invention?I rely on truth, on facts. But I rewrote it completely. Is it true that Anna found herself in Grozny on the site of an explosion? Of course, it\u2019s true. But I invented the way she tells it, her images, her sensations. My task is this: to recreate the real.What about real-life figures interests you as a playwright?Every day I read the newspapers. I read them deeply. Because that\u2019s where my works are born. The theater has always been born there. I wrote theatrical pieces on the economy, on wars, on precariousness in the world of jobs. One of my monologues tells the true story of an old immigrant who walked 5,000 kilometers from the Iraqi desert to the ice of Sweden.When it comes to freedom of expression, how do you think conditions have changed since you wrote \u201cIntractable Woman\u201d? The distortion of truth is continuous, gigantic. We are not given the facts. We are all maneuvered. Anna was the opposite of this; she was a witness, she saw, she lived something, and she told us about it.Why do you think there\u2019s been a surge of interest in your work in the United States?The themes of our time must land on the stage. You love this contemporary theater, and I am with you. For example, I can give you a great preview: Another play of mine, the title is \u201cState Versus Nolan,\u201d will become a Hollywood movie. But it was born as a theatrical text which tells a whole trial. Witnesses, accusation, defense. Popular jurors. And the cause has to do with the media, and their arousing fears in readers.I think it\u2019s the opposite of the play about Anna. Here I describe the excesses of freedom of the press. Freedom of the press does not mean being allowed to use newspapers to terrorize people.Will you come to New York for \u201cThe Lehman Trilogy\u201d?I hope. I would like to go back to that little hotel among the Korean florists. The smell was strong: headache! But it seemed to be in earthly paradise: flowers everywhere.Advertisement"}

Art is a new financial asset class, and this has altered the perspective of the more modest buyer.\u201dFileman is a 120-year-old family dealership specializing in antique glass and chandeliers, based in Sussex, in southern England. Nowadays, with domestic demand reduced, virtually all purchases of more than 10,000 pounds, or about $13,200, are made by foreign buyers, usually for chandeliers and usually via the internet, Mr. Fileman said.Prices on his booth ranged from \u00a3320 for an engraved 18th-century drinking glass, to \u00a3120,000 for a George III chandelier. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird atmosphere,\u201d Mr. Fileman said on the Sunday of the fair. \u201cPeople are walking round, but they\u2019re not really buying.\u201dYet the lower end of the market also remains a cause for concern in more fashionable areas.\u201cBut if you\u2019re middle class, \u20ac5,000 is a lot,\u201d Mr. Dooney said. \u201cYou want to know if it\u2019s going to hold its value.\u201dThis lower-value segment of the market is under pressure. Would-be collectors in the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d have become as concerned about investment as everyone else, and art and antiques in the $500 to $5,000 range offer uncertain returns.Then why not simply enjoy owning art that you like? Well, even the concept of ownership has become problematic.\u201cPeople, particularly younger people, have much less desire to own stuff,\u201d said Mr. Bayley, the cultural critic. \u201cThere\u2019s consumer fatigue. And if you\u2019re never going to be able to afford to buy a house, what\u2019s the point of buying the stuff that goes in a house?\u201dAnd yet dealers and auction houses keep plugging away, coming up with new initiatives and strategies to keep the grass roots of the market alive, if not verdantly green.Enigmatic drawings of tech-inspired tarot cards by Mieke Marple (who also formerly co-owned Los Angeles\u2019s trendy Night Gallery) are currently among Mr. McClintock\u2019s best sellers in the $3,000 to $10,000 range, he said, adding that younger collectors were encouraged by flexible payment plans and invoices payable in cryptocurrency. \u201cGallerists need to start thinking of themselves as entrepreneurs, not sit around waiting for a client to walk in the door,\u201d Mr. McClintock said.And then there is Bonhams, a London-based international auction house whose business model has (so far) relied on traditional lower and middle range art and antiques, plus classic cars, rather than the celebrity end of the contemporary market. Last year, Bonhams took \u00a3450 million, or about $600 million, in sales, according to a spokeswoman. Christie\u2019s raised $6.6 billion.Owen Wilson, a partner at Epiris, was more upbeat. \u201cBonhams is a global business operating in a market with long-term structural growth and high barriers to entry,\u201d Mr. Wilson said in a statement. \u201cIt is a platform with extensive scope for transformation through investment.\u201dA spokeswoman for Epiris declined to comment further.But for would-be middle class collectors, the \u201cbarriers to entry\u201d at Bonhams and other businesses trying to sell art and collectibles valued at less than $20,000 \u2014 or even less than $5,000 \u2014 remain relatively low.

{"Headline": "Cynthia Nixon Would Double New York\u2019s Budget. Is That a Good Thing?", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAbout New YorkNo serious candidate in modern times has proposed an increase in the size of New York state government that comes close to Cynthia Nixon\u2019s platform in the Democratic primary for governor.Adding up each of her plans, Ms. Nixon would at least double state spending in the first year they took effect.\u201cIt\u2019s beyond any increase we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said E. J. McMahon, the founder of the Empire Center for Public Policy, an Albany think tank that has been critical of state spending and tax policies. \u201cWhen you put them all together, you\u2019re taking an elevator to the International Space Station.\u201dThough she does not have firm plans on how to raise most of the money, Ms. Nixon makes no apologies for the total. Rising health care costs, a weakened mass transit system and extreme weather will worsen the state\u2019s problems, her campaign said.\u201cWe are the most unequal state in the nation in terms of income,\u201d said Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for Ms. Nixon. \u201cThese are big problems, and they\u2019re not going to fix themselves. They\u2019re going to require real investment.\u201dHere\u2019s what some of it looks like.Because so few of us have personal experience with the colossal numbers in government budgets, the figures can seem abstract. Who has any reason to know the difference between a million dollars and a billion?By thinking about those numbers as something other than money, the scale of spending comes into range.For instance, instead of dollars, look at the numbers as time.So: 1,000 seconds is nearly 17 minutes.One million seconds is the length of 11 days and 14 hours.And a billion seconds passes in 31 years and eight months.New York State will spend $170 billion this year.If the Nixon expenditures were added to the existing budget, New York would spend at least $345 billion annually \u2014 almost four times as much as New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania combined.The RAND study estimated the state\u2019s cost at $139 billion in the first year, rising to more than $200 billion.The Nixon campaign proposes a \u201cpolluters\u201d tax on carbon that the study says would raise an average of $7 billion annually. That leaves a balance of $18 billion. The study suggested that money could come from private investment, rather than the state, Ms. Nixon\u2019s campaign said. Those investments would be paid for by customers of the electricity utilities.Many parts of Ms. Nixon\u2019s plans rely on the misnamed \u201cmillionaires\u201d tax. Rates would rise on people making $300,000 and up. One pitfall is that such revenue is not reliable: The wealthiest New Yorkers make much of their money on capital gains \u2014 not salary \u2014 which rise and fall with stock prices. That income dropped by 75 percent after the recession of 2008.A governor can\u2019t do much unless the legislature goes along. Ms. Nixon says she\u2019ll get more sympathetic Democrats in the State Senate, a body where party intrigues and betrayals are practically written into the legislative calendar.The practicality of the Nixon platform trails far behind its aspirations, as great as the difference between a thousand seconds (17 minutes) and a billion (31 years). \u201cA state budget is as much a moral document as a fiscal statement,\u201d Ms. Nixon\u2019s platform says.Yet arithmetic gets the last word in many human affairs.Follow Jim Dwyer on Twitter: @jimdwyernytAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Displaced Turks, Promised New Homes, Can Only Protest on an Empty Lot ", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe economy has stalled Turkey\u2019s grand renewal plans for cities like Istanbul. Residents whose properties were razed are tired of waiting. They sit on plastic chairs beside a couple of tents. New high-rise buildings surround them, but stagnant water has pooled on this site, and weeds sprout from the mounds of earth. Around 300 homes were demolished as part of an urban development program in the district of Fikirtepe on Istanbul\u2019s increasingly fashionable Asian shore. The families have been living in rented accommodations until their residential block is built. Urban transformation has been one of the much-vaunted achievements of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s 16 years in power. Whole sections of Istanbul, and many other cities, have been pulled down to be replaced with modern office buildings and homes. The redevelopment has spurred rapid economic growth in Turkey, generating employment and providing housing for Mr. Erdogan\u2019s voter base.The Fikirtepe project was an ambitious effort to transform a central working-class district into an upmarket residential area. It was designated a Special Town Planning Area, which allowed contractors to build high-rise apartments.Prime Minister Binali Yildirim presided over the groundbreaking ceremony in 2017. He promised an entirely new city in Fikirtepe of \u201cbeautiful, sparkling living spaces.\u201d One block was to be called Brooklyn Dream.Some residents never wanted to sign up for the plan, which would demolish their homes, said Engin Akguzel, the son of Ms. Akguzel who is a driver and a spokesman for the group of protesters. Under the deal, the company offered to pay for rented accommodations for up to 42 months until they could move into the new apartment building.The 25 homeowners who had been resisting agreed to join the plan after a new law threatened to take their property for less compensation than the construction company was offering. The bulldozers moved in during the summer of 2016.The first sign of trouble came a year later, in June 2017, when the developer failed to pay the money for the landowners\u2019 rent. \u201cThe owner got out of it, and now the man who serves the tea is the owner of the company,\u201d said Yasin Bektas, a resident who runs a local online news site and leads a separate protest group, which has sued the developers.The original investors have pulled out of the project and are involved in a lawsuit with their contractor. Mahir Sasmaz, the former head of construction for Pana Construction, the main developer, blamed rising costs and an inability to sell apartments for the company\u2019s difficulties.\u201cCosts increased, and the number of flats sold did not reach to the expected numbers,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf sales remain at those levels, none of the contractors there will make a profit.\u201d Lawsuits take years in Turkey, and the families are worried about waiting that long. Most of his group are pensioners and cannot pay their rent, Mr. Akguzel said.He complained that officials at the ministry that oversees urban planning were unsympathetic even though they had pushed the residents to accept the project in the first place. Officials visited them before the June elections, promising assistance, but have avoided them since, Mr. Akguzel added.The protesters are demanding that the government step in and ensure the block is built. \u201cThe state has the power,\u201d said Erol Torpil, an insurance adviser, who had opposed the plan from the start because he owned a block of five flats and lived off the rent from them. \u201cThe only thing we want is for the houses to be built immediately.\u201d\u201cWe are not angry with the president,\u201d Mr. Akguzel said. \u201cBut I am personally heartbroken. I was thinking that the only person who could intervene was the president.\u201dThe attitude of officials since the elections had made his mother lose confidence. \u201cI would lie if I said I still have hope,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

I would argue otherwise: More and more leaders from business as well as government, trade unions and civil society are coming around to the belief that doing good while doing well is not just desirable, it\u2019s a matter of survival.The writer is the head of media content for the World Economic Forum.\u2666To the Editor:Brian Stauffer\u2019s illustration for the review of \u201cWinners Take All\u201d has it all wrong.

There are laughs, which become increasingly uncomfortable as \u2026\u201cI had an idea of something I thought could work as a play and not a movie \u2014 I don\u2019t even know if I can explain how and why, it just felt like a play,\u201d Mr. Solondz, 58, said in an interview. \u201cAnd I thought it would be a kind of adventure, see what kinds of doors it would open, what kind of experiences it might provide.\u201dAt one, \u201csome actors pointed out that he\u2019s somehow zeroed in on this black experience of loving whiteness, and that\u2019s something the culture hasn\u2019t talked about in any major ways,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Wow, this is incendiary.\u2019\u201dAnd now, about a year and a half after the script went out, \u201cEmma and Max\u201d is having its first preview, on Oct. 1, with Mr. Solondz also at the helm.Throughout, Mr. Solondz was in the peculiar position of being a beginner with considerable experience. It helped that he gradually found helpful equivalencies between his old and new worlds.Working with the actors came naturally. Zonya Love, who plays Britney, recalled that during rehearsal Mr. Solondz would get scenes started by saying, \u201cAction,\u201d and end them with \u201cCut.\u201dMs. Love, 37, bears much of the show\u2019s emotional burden, which at times feels like a literal one. \u201cOne of the things I have to do after we rehearse is stretch my back because the weight of who she is pulled me down,\u201d she said in a telephone interview.Like much of Mr. Solondz\u2019s work, \u201cEmma and Max\u201d (named after Brooke and Jay\u2019s children, who appear in the show only as projections) tiptoes between pathos and satire, between tragedy and the banality of urban life \u2014 sprinkled with his acidic humor. During casting, he was particularly receptive to actors who were naturally funny, but when working with them later, he ensured that they did not actively set out to draw laughs.\u201cMost of my career, I\u2019ve been asked to do comedy, and it\u2019s wonderful, but Todd doesn\u2019t want my bag of tricks,\u201d said Ilana Becker, who plays Brooke, by telephone. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t want Neil Simon, I want Fassbinder.\u2019 \u201dUnderstatement, even a certain detachment have always been key to Mr. Solondz, and they may be the best ways to make the hot-button material he often deals with palatable. \u201cThere is a directness and economy of storytelling that\u2019s always present in his work,\u201d Mr. Bradshaw said in an email. \u201cHe\u2019s also quite interested in juxtaposing the public faces of his characters and the turmoil of their inner lives.\u201dThat difference is what is fascinating about the enigmatic Britney, a worthy addition to Mr. Solondz\u2019s gallery of complicated misfits, outsiders and so-called losers \u2014 characters who challenge an audience\u2019s expectations of who, and what, deserves sympathy.\u201cSmugness is lethal,\u201d said the affable Mr. Solondz (who, in the show, makes the entitled parents the targets of his most pointed satire). \u201cWhen I go to a movie, I do want to be provoked. Not in a sensationalistic way, but in the sense that you become more connected to the world. The movies and plays that touch me the most remind me and reassure me of perhaps the illusion that I am not alone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not looking for people to argue about my stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cFrankly, some people are of the mind that it\u2019s important to have people hate you, that it means you\u2019ve done something important.\u201d He laughed. \u201cBut I prefer people don\u2019t hate me, O.K.?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The interior walls of the house are still gone. Without electricity, the family relies on small solar-powered lamps at night.\u201cI try my best to not get stressed about it,\u201d Ms. Penn said. \u201cI need to keep strong for my children.\u201dMany here also see Irma and Maria as signs of what\u2019s to come, and the rebuilding effort as an existential race against the clock \u2014 they know these vulnerable and isolated islands are at the forefront of climate change.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see more and more of these weather pattern events, whether they\u2019re hurricanes or cyclones,\u201d said Paul Bayly, the chief executive of the Recovery and Development Agency, which was created to oversee the territory\u2019s long-term reconstruction.The hurricanes severely damaged all major marinas and hotels of the British Virgin Islands, a vacation getaway 60 miles east of Puerto Rico known as a playground for the wealthy and the sailing capital of the world. The storms also destroyed 70 percent of homes on the islands, which have a population of about 30,000.\u201cIt absolutely breaks my heart that there are still people living in houses that are very destroyed,\u201d said Gov. Augustus Jaspert.\u201cMs. Irma decided to take them, so she did,\u201d Ms. Nibbs, 60, said.\u201cTerrible, terrible, terrible,\u201d said Mr. Nibbs, 73, who worked all his life for the famed Peter Island Resort, which hasn\u2019t opened since the hurricanes. \u201cOne tough year.\u201dMr. Nibbs said the local government planned to rebuild his home as part of a $15 million loan and grant program aimed at helping vulnerable families. But he is unsure when that would be or how he would afford the repairs. Mr. Nibbs is paying off an old loan; Ms. Nibbs uses most of her Social Security payments to buy medicine.Still, the British Virgin Islands are expected to borrow heavily to finance the long-term recovery, which officials say will include greener, more resilient infrastructure.Britain has committed to provide $13 million in grants and guarantee close to $400 million in loans to allow the local government to borrow at cheaper rates. Early estimates show the territory could need up to $700 million in loans, said Orlando Smith, the premier and top locally elected official.\u201cI\u2019m feeling very optimistic,\u201d said Mr. Smith. \u201cThe rebuild is in full force. We are ready to receive visitors.\u201dConstruction was initially delayed by the difficulty of importing supplies like lumber and roofing from Florida and Puerto Rico, which were also rebuilding. Many residents waited months for new doors and windows. Others gave up altogether.But construction has picked up and wooden scaffolds have begun to cover the facades of government buildings, businesses and hotels across the island.The efforts are bearing fruit: Electricity was largely restored within six months. Roads are clear of debris. Coastlines are clean and iconic beach bars, like Foxy\u2019s and the Soggy Dollar on Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the four islands, have roared back to life.Disney Cruise Line returned earlier this month and Norwegian Cruise Line is expected to follow later this year. The charter and sailing industry rebounded quickly after the storms, and close to 3,000 berths are available throughout the territory for motorized boats and sailboats, according to tourism officials.The government expects about a half-million cruise passengers to visit this winter, around 30 percent fewer than usual. And more than 1,000 rooms \u2014 about one-third of the islands\u2019 hotel inventory \u2014 are expected to be available for booking.Yet some of the most popular resorts, like the Bitter End Yacht Club and Rosewood Little Dix Bay, on Virgin Gorda, the third-largest island, won\u2019t reopen until late 2019. And more than 300 wrecked boats remain strewn on bays and beaches.\u201cWe wish that these things would happen quickly and overnight, but the damage was so much,\u201d Mark Vanterpool, the minister of communication and works, said from his temporary office above tourist shops on Tortola\u2019s main cruise ship pier. \u201cWe are pleased that we have made good progress.\u201dEven so, the scars of the hurricane linger.On the western part of Tortola, the customs office is still rubble, and elementary school students attended class in tents until recently. Repairs have not begun at the territory\u2019s largest public high school. Its 1,280 students will resume classes this month on a half-day schedule in what used to be a home supplies store.And a handful of people, like Travis Smith, still live in tents.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a depressing state,\u201d said Mr. Smith, 38, a sanitation worker who has been living in a donated white tent on the front lawn of his ruined house since December. He bathes with buckets of water, cooks in a fire pit and keeps his clothes in trash bags. Rats recently poked holes into his tent and the mosquitoes are a torment at night.He had been in touch with the government about rebuilding his house, he said, but \u201cthere\u2019s some kind of red tape holding it up.\u201dOn the anniversary of Hurricane Irma\u2019s landfall earlier this month, residents gathered in churches, government buildings and beach bars to mark the date.At Nanny Cay \u2014 a complex with a hotel, marina and condominiums \u2014 the occasion brought together shipyard workers, hotel employees, boat owners and the community of American and European expats who live there.\u201cYour life has been impacted by Irma,\u201d Miles Sutherland-Pilch, the general manager, said in a speech. \u201cTo some there has been bigger and worse impact.\u201dThen Mr. Sutherland-Pilch proposed a minute of silence to remember the four people who died as a result of the hurricane and to honor the less fortunate who are still piecing their lives back together.One by one everyone closed their eyes, lowered their heads and fell silent until only the sound of waves crashing on the shore filled the air.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E. Coli Found at Hotel in Egypt Where British Couple Died", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn apparently healthy British couple who suddenly fell ill and died at a Red Sea resort in Egypt last month may have been exposed to high levels of E. coli and staphylococcus bacteria in the food supply at their hotel, according to test results released on Wednesday by the tour operator they used to book their vacation.But the tour company, Thomas Cook, said it did not believe that the tests, conducted by an independent hygiene specialist and air quality specialist, \u201cshed any light on the still unexplained cause of death\u201d of its customers, John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan Cooper, 64, on Aug. 21.The sudden deaths shook Egypt\u2019s ailing tourism industry and prompted Thomas Cook, one of the best-known package tour companies in Britain, to evacuate hundreds of its customers from the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada. The company said autopsies by the Egyptian government might determine their cause of death.\u201cIt is clear from these results that something went wrong in August at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada and that standards fell below what we expect from our hotel partners,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cIt is likely that the presence of E. coli and staphylococcus would explain the raised level of illness reported among guests at the hotel during this time, supporting Thomas Cook\u2019s decision to remove our 300 customers.\u201dMr. Cooper, an English construction worker, and his wife, an employee of Thomas Cook in Lancashire, traveled to Hurghada with their daughter, Kelly Ormerod, and three grandchildren.Ms. Ormerod told Sky News that her parents appeared to be in \u201cperfect health\u201d when they went to bed on Monday, but were \u201cextremely ill and needed help\u201d when she found them in their hotel room the next morning.Her father died soon after paramedics arrived, and her mother died after she was taken to a hospital five hours later, Ms. Ormerod told Sky News.\u201cI watched them die before my very eyes and they had exactly the same symptoms,\u201d Ms. Ormerod told the broadcaster. She said she thought their deaths were \u201csuspicious\u201d and that something \u201chappened in that room and caused them to be taken away from us.\u201dThomas Cook said it would offer compensation packages to customers who fell ill after staying at the hotel and that it would stop booking tours at the resort \u201cuntil further notice.\u201dThe company said its tests had found normal air and water quality at the resort, typical chlorine levels in its swimming pools and no evidence of carbon monoxide, elevated carbon dioxide levels or the presence of shigella, listeria or salmonella. The results were reviewed by Vanya Gant, a specialist in microbiology and infection at University College London Hospitals.Egyptian officials have argued that the couple died of natural causes. Nabil Sadek, Egypt\u2019s attorney general, said last month that an inspection of the Coopers\u2019 hotel room found no evidence of toxic or harmful gas emissions or leaks. But Thomas Cook said on Wednesday that Egyptian officials did not allow its independent investigators to examine the hotel room.The deaths of the Coopers and the tourist evacuation that followed were a blow to Egypt\u2019s tourism industry, a onetime pillar of the country\u2019s economy that has been battered in recent years by political instability, violence and a series of plane crashes that killed more than 200 travelers.Mohamed Ezz contributed reporting from Cairo.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Threatens Tariffs on All Imports From China, Escalating Trade Feud", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump threatened China with another round of punishing tariffs on Friday, saying he was prepared to tax essentially all Chinese goods imported into the United States if Beijing did not change its trade practices.The threat comes as the administration prepares to move forward with another round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including many everyday consumer products like electronics and housewares.His comments, made aboard Air Force One on his way to Fargo, N.D., signal that the trade dispute with China is unlikely to reach a quick resolution, despite concerns from many businesses that the tariffs could have devastating effects. The White House has already imposed tariffs on $50 billon worth of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with a similar amount of tariffs on American products. Mr. Trump hinted on Friday that the next round of tariffs was guaranteed unless China agreed to his demands to more freely open its markets to American companies.\u201cNobody has ever done what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThe $200 billion we\u2019re talking about could take place very soon, depending what happens with them. To a certain extent, it\u2019s going to be up to China.\u201dMr. Trump added: \u201cAnd I hate to say that, but behind that, there\u2019s another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want. That totally changes the equation.\u201dThe White House is waging several trade wars at once and continues to threaten tariffs on both allies and adversaries alike. The president spoke as his administration continued its tense negotiations with Canada over the North American Free Trade Agreement and as the United States trade representative prepared to meet with European leaders on Monday to ease a simmering trade dispute with that bloc.Mr. Trump said again on Friday that he would be willing to hit Canada with auto tariffs if it did not concede to United States demands for a rewrite of Nafta.\u201cIn Canada, the tax on cars would be the ruination of the country,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Still, Mr. Trump said that China was a cut above the rest of America\u2019s trading partners when it came to unfair trade practices.\u201cChina, right now, is a far bigger problem,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m being strong on China because I have to be.\u201dThe administration is now deciding which Chinese goods to tax as part of its next round of tariffs. A public comment period on a proposed list of products, from fish to feathers to fitness trackers, ended on Thursday, and officials said they planned to take the comments, plus those made during six days of hearings, into account before deciding which products to hit.\u201cOur concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers,\u201d the company wrote in a letter to Robert E. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, that was made public on Friday.The imposition of new tariffs is supposed to go through a rigorous government investigation into whether the levies are warranted, including public feedback on how the move would affect American industry. But Mr. Trump continues to dangle the prospect of additional duties in a casual manner.\u201cThe notion that the president is going to add an extra $267 billion worth of tariffs is grossly irresponsible and possibly illegal,\u201d said Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for the Information Technology Industry Council, suggesting that the administration had not conducted the necessary investigation to justify such a decision.Mr. Trump has previously said he is prepared to tax nearly all Chinese goods that come into the United States. Still, the threat of further tariffs rattled stock markets, in part because China has said it plans to retaliate against any American trade barriers.For now, talks between the world\u2019s two largest economies remain stalled.\u201cTrump has a strong incentive to strike some sort of deal with China that will allow him to claim victory as a deal maker,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University. \u201cHowever, notwithstanding any negative blowback from Trump\u2019s domestic constituents, it increasingly looks like the off-ramp from this trade war is unlikely to materialize before the midterm elections in the U.S.\u201d\u201cThe word that continues to block the deal is M-I-L-K,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, said on the Fox Business Network. \u201cMilk, dairy, drop the barriers, give our farmers a break, and we can fix some other things.\u201dThe Trump administration last week notified Congress that it was planning to move ahead with a bilateral trade deal with Mexico if it could not reach an agreement to incorporate Canada into the three-country pact. However, the United States and Canada have until the end of September to mend their differences before the text of the treaty with Mexico is made public.Mr. Trump on Friday said that his coarse tone toward Canada was necessary to close the deal.\u201cPeople have been saying I\u2019m too tough on Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, Canada has been ripping us off for a long time.\u201dHe added: \u201cNow they\u2019ve got to treat us fairly.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the Democrats Rise Above?", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a lot of pressure on their coalition coming from within.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.As the Democratic electorate has bifurcated along economic and racial lines, intraparty tension is rising.The countychanged its paradigm about whom the special schools should serve: not the students with the highest abilities across the county, but rather, those students who are outliers at their neighborhood schools, with fewer than 20 peers with similar abilities.The new policies are not universally welcome. As Goldstein writes,The changes have left some parents, mostly Asian and white and living in the county\u2019s more affluent areas, anxious. They worry their children will be excluded from selective programs, or that the level of instruction at the magnet schools will fall as students are accepted from lower-performing elementary schools.At the same time, Kimberly Petrola, a teacher at Fox Chapel Elementary School in Germantown, one of the local Centers for Enriched Studies, told Goldstein:It\u2019s good for the community to see that the gifted students are not just the typical students that you think of when you think of gifted and talented. Anybody from any diverse background can be gifted.The prestigious high schools make 5,000 admissions offers to incoming ninth-graders. Yet, this year just 172 black students and 298 Latino students received offers. This happened in a city where two out of every three eighth-graders in our public schools are Latino or black.This may seem like only an educational issue, but the political ramifications are significant.Let\u2019s take a look at another divisive issue that Democrats have struggled to address.Virtually every prospective Democratic presidential candidate has singled out the broader problem of inequality as one of the most serious facing the country.All this, and we haven\u2019t even gotten to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.What would once have been an attractive solution to the problem of inequality, increasing taxes on the rich, now poses a potential problem for a Democratic Party that has made huge gains among the affluent.Who are the prime beneficiaries of surging incomes at the top? Simple answer: predominately high-income Democratic professionals in technology, finance and law who now outnumber Republicans in presidential voting in the top income brackets.Who, in turn, are the losers in an economy where the top 20 percent gains far more than those at the bottom, whose wages have hardly budged? Service workers, who are disproportionately people of color.A majority of those at the bottom, with annual household incomes under $30,000, backed Clinton over Trump, 51-43. So too did the economic winners: those making more than $100,000 a year. Voters from households making $100,000 to $199,999 annually voted 50-44 for Clinton; among those making $200,000 to $249,999, she won 56-41; at the very top, those making $250,000 or more, Clinton won by a landslide margin, 62-34.In other words, reviving the high tax rates of the past is no longer a clean shot for the Democratic Party.Income inequality and school reform both point to another core Democratic problem: the party can, and does, win elections, but it struggles when it is in power because it faces competing policy demands. Those policy demands often pose zero-sum choices for rival constituencies: what one group gains, another loses.This was apparent at the start of the administrations of both President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama.Clinton and Obama were elected alongside solid Democratic congressional majorities. The top priority for each president was universal health care, an initiative disproportionately beneficial to low-income minorities.Within two years of taking office, support for health care reform collapsed for both Obama and Clinton.The first off-year congressional elections in the two administrations, in 1994 and 2010, were Republican wave elections \u2014 spurred in part by public opposition to health care reform \u2014 that swept out Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. Those two outcomes stymied both Clinton and Obama and limited their ability to govern. They had hit the wall that often confronts Democratic policymakers: race.By 1994, however, as the benefits of the Clinton proposal to racial and ethnic minorities became more widely known, the numbers were reversed. A plurality of whites, 41 percent, said health care should be provided privately, as opposed to the 32 percent who still supported government health insurance.There was a clear precedent for the opposition Clinton and Obama encountered on health care that goes back to the mid-1960s, when the issue of civil rights (and white racism) knocked the support out from under the liberal New Deal coalition.In 1956, 1958 and 1960, before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, solid majorities of whites ranging from 54 to 56 percent agreed that jobs and a good standard of living were the responsibility of the federal government. By 1968, that figure fell to 27 percent.For the period extending roughly from 1970 to 2008, many of the nation\u2019s racial and economic conflicts pitted Democrats on the left against Republicans on the right.Since then, with the growth of an educated, culturally liberal class of Democratic voters, the partisan aspect of these conflicts has changed. In addition to a struggle between the two parties, a struggle has emerged between the two wings of the Democratic Party.Americans in the top fifth of the income distribution \u2014 broadly households with incomes above the $112,000 mark \u2014 are separating from the rest. This separation is economic, visible in bank balances and salaries. But it can also be seen in education, family structure, health and longevity, even in civic and community life.Reeves calls for sacrifice from the liberal elite, himself included, because \u201cmuch of the criticism of our class is true.\u201d\u201cRight now,\u201d he goes on to argue,there is something of a culture of entitlement among America\u2019s upper middle class. It is about time those of us in the favored fifth recognized our privileged position. Some humility and generosity is required.The problem with Reeves\u2019s argument, of course, is that many of the white and Asian parents in reliably liberal New York and Montgomery County are not prepared to compromise the education of their own children, as they see it, in support of a social goal, no matter how laudable.Nor are well-to-do Democratic homeowners from the West Coast to Westchester County willing to risk a decline in property values by opening their communities to affordable housing.The \u201cmy gain is your loss\u201d problems of the Democratic Party are further complicated by research showing that as inequality has grown, support for liberal redistribution policies has declined.The authors described the \u201cmost important message\u201d flowing from their analysis as \u201chigh and low-income groups respond in remarkably similar ways to shifts in economic inequality.\u201dI emailed Kelly to ask if he had developed additional interpretations of the findings since the article was published.Kelly emailed back thatAmong those with inegalitarian racial attitudes, higher levels of inequality are associated with somewhat less support for redistribution. That relationship is reversed for those who are racial egalitarians, with these folks more supportive of redistribution when inequality is higher. Economic inequality and racial attitudes work in tandem with each other. Where there is racism, rising inequality undermines support for redistribution.In other words, race and racism help mold the views of many Americans toward inequality and income and wealth redistribution.The authors, Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren, both economists at Harvard, and Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, of the Census Bureau, found that between 1989 and 2015Hispanic Americans are moving up significantly in the income distribution across generations because they have relatively high rates of intergenerational income mobility. In contrast, black Americans have substantially lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to large income disparities that persist across generations.Their adverse finding \u201cremains true even among children born to parents in the top 1 percent,\u201d Chetty and his collaborators write: Indeed, a black child born to parents in the top quintile is roughly as likely to fall to the bottom family income quintile as he or she is to remain in the top quintile; in contrast, white children are nearly five times as likely to remain in the top quintile as they are to fall to the bottom quintile.Despite their pessimism, Chetty and his co-authors offer a ray of hope. \u201cThe black-white gap,\u201d they write,is significantly smaller for boys who grow up in certain neighborhoods \u2014 those with low poverty rates, low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among low-income blacks. Black boys who move to such areas at younger ages have significantly better outcomes, demonstrating that racial disparities can be narrowed.To create such an environment for even a modest percentage of poor black families, the financial, cultural and social commitment of resources would be huge. Such a commitment might include a willingness to frame the argument in terms of pressing more explicitly and strenuously for a focus on this target: that \u201cwhite and black Americans are roughly equal in their economic and social resources\u201d \u2014 a goal that Chetty, Hendren, Jones and Porter argue is linked to \u201cfather presence,\u201d however unpopular such stands are in segments of the liberal community.Despite the tremendous costs and political obstacles of such a large initiative, this objective \u2014 making the economic lives of white and black Americans \u201croughly equal\u201d \u2014 should command more serious attention from Democrats if they want to restore and strengthen a liberal coalition that will have staying power over the long term.Advertisement"}

Both of them.Never mind that the nation\u2019s economic fortunes depend on more than the occupant of the Oval Office and his policies, driven as well by interest rates, technological innovation and the health of the global economy \u2014 trends beyond the control of any president. Voters and historians nonetheless assign credit and blame to presidents for the state of the economy. When it comes to economics, presidents would rather be remembered as Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton than Herbert Hoover.With midterm elections coming, the economy is Mr. Trump\u2019s trump card, the most unalloyed note of success in an otherwise herky-jerky presidency. Plagued by scandal, investigations, dysfunction in the West Wing and stalemate on Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump is making the surge of new jobs and business activity his most powerful argument for keeping Congress in Republican hands. Even with his own popularity low, consumer confidence and voter faith in the economy are on the rise.\u201cThe Trump economy so far has reached a real inflection point,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s national economics adviser, said in an interview on Sunday. \u201cTrump has ended the war on business and he\u2019s ended the war on success, and he\u2019s been urging people to go out and start a new company and go back to work.\u201dMr. Trump made clear he does not plan to surrender to his predecessor easily. \u201cHe was trying to take credit for this incredible thing that\u2019s happening,\u201d Mr. Trump told supporters in his own appearance in Fargo, N.D., shortly after Mr. Obama\u2019s televised speech. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him.\u201d He added that the recovery under Mr. Obama was the weakest in history.In the 19 months starting after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration, the economy has created 3.58 million new jobs \u2014 but that is still shy of the 3.96 million created in the last 19 months of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency. The nation\u2019s economy has grown at a steadily higher pace in the past year than it did during the end of Mr. Obama\u2019s term, reaching an annualized rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter of this year. But the last time it was that high was in 2014 \u2014 when Mr. Obama was in charge.Moreover, even the faster growth under Mr. Obama or Mr. Trump remains modest compared with some previous recoveries. During the first half of this year, the economy grew at a 3.3 percent annualized pace, slower than every year of the Reagan recovery, which averaged 4.4 percent between 1983 and 1989.Mr. Trump has some particularly compelling bragging points, though. Unemployment is now at 3.9 percent, close to the lowest it has been in a half-century, and joblessness among African-Americans and other minorities has also fallen to historically low rates. The stock markets have reached record highs as well. All of these trends began when Mr. Obama was president. Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters argue that he turbocharged them with his tax cuts and deregulation, defying critics\u2019 predictions that he would wreck the economy.\u201cI can say that the economy was in fine shape at the end of the Obama administration, despite what President Trump sometimes asserts,\u201d said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist and chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush. \u201cThe tax cuts likely made it stronger, while worsening the long-term fiscal imbalance. Reasonable economists can and do disagree about how much impact the tax plan has had.\u201dMr. Obama\u2019s former advisers note that their boss inherited what was widely seen as the worst economy in generations and took enormous political risks by making unpopular decisions to turn it around, while Mr. Trump inherited a growing economy and made an easy decision to cut taxes.\u201cA buffoon could have kept the recovery going,\u201d said Jen Psaki, who was Mr. Obama\u2019s White House communications director, \u201cand in fact one has so far.\u201dChristina D. Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who headed Mr. Obama\u2019s council of advisers, said the former president \u201cwas fundamentally correct to claim much of the credit for the current health of the economy.\u201d\u201cThat said,\u201d she added, \u201cI suspect that some of the current growth is being spurred by the Trump tax cut.\u201d She said the reduction in taxes had produced a stimulus much like the extra spending Mr. Obama enacted in 2009. The difference, she said, was that Mr. Obama\u2019s stimulus was undertaken when the economy needed it, while Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cut was not needed in an already growing economy.Mr. Kudlow, however, pointed out that while growth was higher in 2014, it had slowed by the time Mr. Obama left office. \u201cPresident Obama really let an anti-business attitude seep through,\u201d he said. He said business investment had increased since Mr. Trump took office, encouraging spending on new factories and creation of new businesses that would continue to pay off.One way that even Mr. Obama\u2019s former advisers say Mr. Trump has done better than his predecessor has been in trumpeting the economy. Where Mr. Obama was always measured in his descriptions of the recovery for fear of being accused of exaggerating his case or ignoring the very real pain many still felt, Mr. Trump does not bother with caveats or subtlety.His skill as a salesman may help explain why the consumer confidence index has shot up significantly since his election. According to Gallup, 54 percent of Americans rated the condition of the economy as good or excellent last month, up from 25 percent in April 2016. When Mr. Obama took over, it was just 7 percent.\u201cThere\u2019s a linkage between taxes, regulation, confidence, business investment and wages,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s changed the thinking of people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Consumers Will Increasingly Feel Pain From Trump\u2019s Trade War. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe administration has tried to shield popular products from tariffs. That gets harder with each new round. The Trump administration seems confident that consumers will not feel pain from its escalating trade war with China. \u201cBecause it\u2019s spread over thousands and thousands of products, nobody\u2019s going to actually notice it at the end of the day,\u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told CNBC on Tuesday, when asked about the administration\u2019s latest round of tariffs on Chinese imports.It is true, as Mr. Ross noted earlier in his CNBC interview, that the administration has thus far devised such tariffs to minimize sticker shock on retail store shelves for American customers. The list of imports set to be \u201ctariffed,\u201d as President Trump proclaimed on Monday, still does not include T-shirts, smartphones or many other popular products that American stores import from China. The $200 billion list unveiled on Monday will start with a tax of 10 percent and rise to 25 percent in the New Year, a move that should mute the effect of this round of tariffs on holiday shoppers.\u201cChina has been taking advantage of the United States for a long time, and that's not happening anymore,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cWe can't let that happen.\u201dTariffs are ultimately a tax on businesses and consumers, and with each new round, the administration is bringing them closer to home for the typical American.Tariffs on thousands of products are \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts,\u201d said David French, the senior vice president for government relations for the National Retail Federation, which opposes the administration\u2019s approach. \u201cIn the aggregate, household budgets will feel the impact.\u201dChina\u2019s trade practices have long been a source of frustration for American companies, which are not able to gain access to parts of China\u2019s market and are forced to hand over valuable technology and trade secrets to Chinese partners in exchange for operating there.In June, the Trump administration said talks to change China\u2019s trade behavior \u2014 which had spanned decades \u2014 were going nowhere and announced duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.The first round was intended to minimize pain on American consumers: Chinese aircraft engine parts, bulldozers, ball bearings, motorcycles and industrial and agricultural machinery were among the products targeted initially. China hit back with tariffs of its own on $50 billion of American products and focused on the agriculture sector \u2014 punishing industries whose workers largely supported Mr. Trump. The initial effect of the new $200 billion round of tariffs will be felt just ahead of the holiday shopping season in the United States, when Americans will be looking to stock up on gifts. Higher prices for imported materials such as cotton, nylon, polyester and yarn means that clothing companies will have to pass additional costs onto consumers.Then there are accessories. The tariffs will apply to imported purses, golf bags, ski gloves and mittens. Retailers are not sure how fast the price increases will make their way to store shelves but they are bracing for the worst. Mr. French, of the retail federation, said many buyers are more likely to see big price effects next year than during the holidays.Food could be an exception and consumers could start to see higher prices in the grocery aisles. A wide variety of fish, including sea bass and sturgeon, as well as nuts, fruit, vegetables, rice and cereal did not escape the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. Mr. Trump isn\u2019t done punishing China and has threatened to tax another $267 billion worth of goods if China retaliates against the United States \u2014 which would mean America taxes nearly everything that enters from China. On Tuesday, China said it would impose tariffs of its own on an additional $60 billion in American goods. Walmart\u2019s chief financial officer, Brett Biggs, said last month that \u201cWhile we know questions persist about tariffs, the potential future impact is difficult to quantify.\u201d \u201cWe are closely monitoring the tariff discussions and are actively working on mitigation strategies, particularly in light of potentially escalating duties,\u201d he added.The tariff list includes popular consumer items that line the aisles of department and big box stores, including bicycles, baseball gloves, sleeping bags and rain jackets.The steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed earlier this year prompted a wave of lobbying from countries, trade groups and corporations that wanted their individual products exempted from the levies.A similar exclusion process has been established for the China tariffs, with one key difference: If one company wins an exclusion to import, say, ski gloves, then any company that imports ski gloves receives the same exemption. To date, the administration has not ruled on any of those exclusion requests.Mr. Ross\u2019s best case on prices might be that, even if consumers notice them on individual products, the increases will not add up to runaway inflation.Tariffs tend to increase consumer prices, but analysts say the increase in prices from Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs is likely to be small, at least for now. Economists at TD Securities said in a research note Tuesday that they expected the tariffs to add 0.1 percentage points to the inflation rate over the next year. They added that countervailing consequences, like a stronger dollar, could easily offset the effect on prices.Analysts also expect a small reduction in economic growth. Economists at JPMorgan Chase estimated economic output would fall by about 0.1 percentage points.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Michigan Became the Epicenter of the Modernist Experiment", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA perfect storm of manufacturing money, ample space and robust industry created one of Modernism\u2019s most fertile and important outposts in and around Detroit.Kahn came from humble means. He was a Jewish immigrant from the former Kingdom of Prussia whose family had settled in Detroit in 1881. He founded his eponymous firm in the city in 1895, at the age of 26. Early in his career, with the 1904 design for Building 10 of the city\u2019s Packard automotive plant, Kahn revolutionized industrial architecture by replacing wood materials with reinforced concrete, a safer alternative that also allowed for more dramatic structures. The Packard plant was a small city unto itself that at its height employed 40,000 workers in a 3.5-million-square-foot complex with vast rows of windows. (Kahn, who designed the entire complex, was, according to a 1956 article in the Detroit Free Press, \u201can apostle of sunlight,\u201d someone who \u201cdidn\u2019t think much of windowless factories.\u201d) Ford would hire Kahn on the basis of Building 10 and other similar factories he worked on, which pulled American design into the 20th century.The same year Kahn submitted his designs for the Highland Park plant, he completed work on a manor home about 20 miles north of the city, in what would become the suburb of Bloomfield Hills but was at the time still farmland. The commission came from George Gough Booth, the publisher of The Detroit News. Booth and Ford could not have been more different. During the 1920s, Ford, who once said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to read books,\u201d also owned a newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, which ran a year-and-a-half-long series of anti-Semitic articles that began with a piece titled \u201cThe International Jew: The World\u2019s Problem\u201d; a connoisseur of Asian art and literature, Booth was scholarly, and a proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement.Related: What to See, and Where to Eat Square Pizza, in DetroitWright\u2019s mantra is as good as any at summing up the Modern era \u2014 constant toil in the name of progress. If Michigan isn\u2019t the first place that comes to mind when considering this period \u2014 unlike, say, Germany or France in the 1920s \u2014 it should be. The presence of Ford in the city and Booth in the country was enough to make Michigan ground zero for the Modernist experiment, which was, on an aesthetic level, concerned with clarity and flexibility: Ford wanted all the messy components of manufacturing to be housed under one enormous roof, and Kahn made it so. But ideologically, architectural Modernism was more complicated, rooted in the idea that if one were to reshape an environment in a kind of magnificent, functional order, then that environment would encourage a level of social harmony and cohesion. This experiment failed, of course, but its remnants still stand throughout Michigan, making the state home to perhaps the most diverse and best-preserved collection of early Modernist experiments in the world.10 PhotosTHERE IS NO greater testament to Michigan\u2019s role in Modernist design than Cranbrook. Eliel Saarinen \u2014 who arrived in America in 1923 from Helsinki and taught for a year at the University of Michigan, where Booth\u2019s son Henry was one of his students \u2014 was soon poached by Booth to design and run his art school. Saarinen\u2019s campus home, which he designed in 1928, is one of the great structures of its time. Here was something altogether new, hidden in the Michigan countryside. Inside, every corner, every angle was considered in masterful detail to such an extent that Saarinen even had a paperback copy of Jack London\u2019s \u201cThe Sea-Wolf\u201d bound in leather so that it would blend better with the surroundings. The house became Saarinen\u2019s studio, where, at least as much as Ford\u2019s factories, a new direction for American design was conceptualized.Yamasaki won the commission for New York\u2019s World Trade Center in 1962 and appeared on the cover of Time magazine a few months later \u2014 an honor afforded to only about a dozen other architects, Eero Saarinen and Frank Lloyd Wright among them. In 1972, he completed work on his own home, near Cranbrook, which had by now transformed from wilderness into suburban sprawl. As an architect, Yamasaki took the Modernist project more literally than any of his contemporaries \u2014 he truly believed he would improve people\u2019s lives through his work, and that his buildings were monuments to \u201cman\u2019s belief in humanity.\u201dAnd so here we are again, back at the notion of endless progress, no matter the cost. But progress for whom? It is not only a quintessentially American idea but a Modernist one: Knock down the low-income neighborhood to build the factory or the condo tower or the sports stadium, and let history record it as human achievement. This was the case a century ago, and the whole country saw what happened the first time around. Michigan\u2019s Modernist heritage is more than just history now up for grabs; it is also a cautionary tale.The day before I left Michigan, I drove to the suburb of Southfield to see the former Reynolds Metals Regional Sales Office, designed by Yamasaki. Completed in 1959, it is an elaborate monument to aluminum in a city whose fortunes once depended on the material. The building sits directly off the freeway in a drab and mostly deserted office park. The late afternoon sun bounced off Yamasaki\u2019s grille \u2014 a woven pattern of gold-anodized aluminum rings. In 1959, the building would have been surrounded by a pool that reflected the glassed-in lobby, with its white concrete floors and marble-and-aluminum reception desk. But Reynolds had long since departed. Most recently, the building was home to an LA Fitness, but it has sat vacant for several years. I got out of my car and walked up the steps to the front entrance. Someone had wrapped the railing with streams of Christmas tinsel. The front door was boarded up with rotting plywood. The decaying art piece off the freeway was for sale for $900,000. I got back in my car and left.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unlikely, Obvious Solution to the Trade War", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Huang is an economist focusing on China.The stalemate also is unnecessary: There are better options to address the White House\u2019s concerns \u2014 including by turning to the World Trade Organization (W.T.O.). The idea may seem like a nonstarter at the moment, but its appeal will increase as the conflict drags on.Here are two great powers, roughly matched in resources, competing for technological and strategic supremacy. America is experiencing an economic upturn, and the Trump administration believes that it can weather any fallout from the standoff.China\u2019s growth rate is declining and the country is more dependent on trade than the United States. But its government, being authoritarian, can more readily mobilize public support and make the country absorb short-term costs in the name of long-term development.The problems that the American government complains about are partly a matter of optics. What makes China\u2019s practices seem unfair is, at bottom, the role of the state in driving the economy and the scale of its activities. Together those factors appear to give Chinese firms an unfair advantage in negotiations with foreign companies, especially those eager to get into China\u2019s huge market.But altering China\u2019s behavior on that front will require new international rules and some form of independent monitoring.One obstacle, of course, is that Mr. Trump seems dead set against any such institution or arrangement. His administration has prematurely killed off the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as well as prospects for a bilateral investment treaty with China. And it is trying to do in the W.T.O.So the W.T.O. needs to be revamped and strengthened, including with new rules to clarify what constitutes noncommercial assistance to state-owned enterprises and what conditions governments can impose on foreign participation in joint ventures.Enter Europe: It is uniquely positioned to lead such reforms thanks to its longstanding strategic alliance with the United States, its growing economic connections with China and its steadfast support for the W.T.O.Economic links between the United States and China are pervasive, but those between Europe and China are deeper. The total of Europe\u2019s investment flows to China were more than twice those of the United States between 2005 and 2016, according to United Nations agencies.If Europe develops a common understanding with China on how to revamp the organization, the option will become more difficult for the United States to ignore.As the costs of this trade war add up in the United States, too, more rational minds may prevail in Washington. And they will see that the way out of the impasse runs through the W.T.O., whether Mr. Trump likes it or not.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What China Can Teach the U.S. About Artificial Intelligence ", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVisionary research is no longer the most important element of progress.Mr. Lee is a venture capitalist and former artificial intelligence researcher.Every technology goes through an age of discovery and an age of implementation. During the age of discovery, the critical work takes place in research laboratories, where scientists make the breakthroughs that move the field forward. During the age of implementation, the technology reaches a point of practical utility and begins spilling out of the lab and into the world.Over the past decade, I\u2019ve watched firsthand as the field of artificial intelligence has transitioned from one phase to the other. The 1980s and 1990s were a period of discovery in A.I., one that I participated in through my research on speech recognition at Carnegie Mellon University and Apple. More recently, I participated in the implementation phase through my work as the head of Google China and as an early investor in the Chinese mobile internet.This movement from discovery to implementation marks a significant shift in A.I.\u2019s center of gravity \u2014 away from the United States and toward China. The age of discovery relied heavily on innovation coming out of the United States, which excels at visionary research and moonshot projects. The country\u2019s freewheeling intellectual environment, unparalleled network of research universities and traditional openness to immigrants (such as myself) have for decades made it an incubator for big ideas in A.I.A.I. implementation, however, plays to a different set of strengths, many of which are manifested in China: abundant data, a hypercompetitive business landscape and a government that actively adapts public infrastructure with A.I. in mind. China also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products. This process, which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge, has driven the market capitalization of many Chinese tech companies far beyond that of the American peers they were once accused of \u201ccopying.\u201dVisionary research will always be important to A.I., which means that China still has much to learn from the United States. But as practical implementation increasingly becomes the name of the game, the United States now has much to learn from China, too.What emerges from these enormous data flows is a multidimensional picture of each Chinese user, which allows A.I. companies to better tailor their services. Silicon Valley companies are working on similar products, but the data at their disposal is largely limited to online activities: Google searches, YouTube views, Amazon purchases and Facebook likes.With regard to its competitive business ecosystem for A.I., China\u2019s advantage is frequently mischaracterized by Western analysts who view Chinese technology as built largely on intellectual property theft. This misunderstanding reflects a difference in cultural attitudes over a perfectly legal form of copying: imitating a successful business model and then tweaking it.In Silicon Valley, there is substantial stigma attached to imitating the business models or features of other companies. Doing so violates the \u201cthink different\u201d ethos associated with innovators like Steve Jobs. The result is that pioneers often go unchallenged for long periods, allowed to dominate the industry even though they don\u2019t explore or exploit all of their technology\u2019s possibilities.In contrast, Chinese entrepreneurs have few qualms about imitating what works. Once a concept is proved to have traction, dozens or even hundreds of other companies rush into the industry, setting off a ferocious fight for survival. The result is analogous to natural selection in evolution: All the companies start from the same branch on the family tree, but they make mutations in their product or business model to gain an edge. The companies with tweaked products that work well survive and grow, while businesses that are slow to adapt perish.You can see this clearly in how the sharing economy developed in China. After companies like Uber and DiDi proved the viability of ride sharing, China\u2019s start-up world tried out every possible iteration of it: shared basketballs, shared umbrellas, shared bicycles, shared mobile phone chargers. Most of these efforts died quickly, but those that survived \u2014 including a handful of the strongest shared-bike start-ups \u2014 turned into multibillion-dollar companies and revolutionized urban transport in just a couple of years.Finally, there is the question of the Chinese government\u2019s support of A.I. In the simplistic story often told in the United States, Chinese bureaucrats in the central government pick winners among the companies, load them up with enormous subsidies and then protect them from foreign competition. But this account fundamentally misunderstands how the Chinese government is encouraging A.I. implementation.The Chinese government understands that as A.I. moves from affecting the purely digital world to the physical one, public infrastructure and institutions will have to change. If we want autonomous cars to reduce accidents, we may need to embed sensors in our roads. If we want A.I.-powered diagnosis to spot cancer earlier, we may need hospital administrators to develop data-sharing agreements that protect privacy while also allowing research to be conducted. These are decisions that entail a degree of risk for public actors, particularly in a highly combative political environment where every misstep becomes fodder for the opposition.In declaring A.I. to be a top national priority, Beijing has sent a signal to local officials that they will be rewarded for fostering this kind of A.I. infrastructure. The Chinese model isn\u2019t based on top-down orders or limitless subsidies; it\u2019s based on encouraging local officials to make the changes needed in their area so that private A.I. companies can develop products that can actually be used.Am I arguing that China now has the recipe for A.I. success? Not at all. The fact that the field is shifting from discovery to implementation does not mean that discovery no longer matters. Indeed, with many problems in A.I., it is unclear which approach is best.Consider an A.I.-powered product like fully autonomous vehicles. Technology companies in both countries are still feverishly chasing the dream of the large-scale deployment of cars that drive themselves far better than any human could. Who wins this race is likely to depend on whether the main obstacle turns out to be a matter of core technology or simply execution details. If it\u2019s technical \u2014 major improvements in core algorithms \u2014 then the advantage goes to the United States. If it\u2019s implementation \u2014 smart infrastructure or policy adaptation \u2014 then the advantage goes to China.At this point, we don\u2019t know which it will be, but we do know that each country can improve its odds of success by learning from the other\u2019s strengths. Chinese researchers, start-ups and A.I. companies should let their imaginations run a little wilder, placing long-term bets that give them a chance of breaking new ground rather than playing catch-up. At the same time, American companies should embrace the less glamorous business of relentlessly developing variations on a proven concept. And American policymakers could move away from a hands-off stance toward A.I., looking instead to actively adapt the nation\u2019s physical structures and public institutions to better mesh with new technology.If both countries can make these shifts in perspective, then what might look like a zero-sum battle for A.I. supremacy between China and the United States will begin to resemble something totally different: an opportunity to learn across cultures and collectively advance the global project of building A.I. that improves human lives.Advertisement"}

And the F.B.I. declined to comment on the status of the investigation or any theories.The microwave idea teems with unanswered questions. Who fired the beams? The Russian government? The Cuban government? A rogue Cuban faction sympathetic to Moscow? And, if so, where did the attackers get the unconventional arms?\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d he said at his kitchen table. \u201cIn dictatorships, you often have factions that think nothing of going against the general policy if it suits their needs. I think that\u2019s a perfectly viable explanation.\u201dWhile radio broadcasting can employ waves a mile or more in length, microwaves range in size from roughly a foot to a tiny fraction of an inch. They\u2019re seen as harmless in such everyday uses as microwaving foods. But their diminutive size also enables tight focusing, as when dish antennas turn disorganized rays into concentrated beams.\u201cThey had me visiting the various labs and discussing the problems,\u201d including the neural impacts of microwaves, Mr. Frey recalled. \u201cI got an inside look at their classified program.\u201dFurtively, globally, the threat grew.Washington, too, foresaw new kinds of arms. Russia, China and many European states are seen as having the know-how to make basic microwave weapons that can debilitate, sow noise or even kill. Advanced powers, experts say, might accomplish more nuanced aims such as beaming spoken words into people\u2019s heads. Only intelligence agencies know which nations actually possess and use such unfamiliar arms. The basic weapon might look like a satellite dish. In theory, such a device might be hand-held or mounted in a van, car, boat or helicopter. Microwave arms are seen as typically working over relatively short distances \u2014 across the length of a few rooms or blocks. High-powered ones might be able to fire beams across several football fields, or even for several miles. Rex W. Tillerson, who was then the secretary of state, said the embassy\u2019s staff had been targeted deliberately. But he refrained from blaming Cuba, and federal officials held out the possibility that a third party may have been responsible.In his paper, he said high-intensity beams of microwaves could have caused the diplomats to experience not just loud noises but nausea, headaches and vertigo, as well as possible brain-tissue injury. The beams, he added, could be fired covertly, hitting \u201conly the intended target.\u201dA dish antenna could fit easily into a small van. In closing, she argued that \u201cnumerous highly specific features\u201d of the diplomatic incidents \u201cfit the hypothesis\u201d of a microwave attack, including the Frey-type production of disturbing sounds. But Mr. Zaid, the Washington lawyer, who represents eight of the diplomats and family members, said microwave attacks may have injured his clients. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of na\u00efve to think this just started now,\u201d he said. Globally, he added, covert strikes with the potent beams appear to have been going on for decades. \u201cThat is a very good question,\u201d Mr. Palmieri replied.

The immense \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d (1,168 pages) was famous even before it was published \u2014 the fruit of 13 years of intense work \u2014 with amphetamine-driven live readings for her entranced circle, or cult, of young acolytes, who gathered at her apartment in Manhattan.Devotees of \u201cAtlas Shrugged,\u201d then and now, thrill to its \u00fcber-size heroes \u2014 the inventor-genius Hank Rearden, the svelte, steely Dagny Taggart, who talk at exhausting length about the holiness of the profit-motive \u2014 \u201cmoney demands of you the highest virtues\u201d \u2014 and then clang together in steamy sex scenes (\u201cHe held the length of her body pressed to his, as if their bodies were two currents rising upward together, each to a single point, each carrying the whole of their consciousness to the meeting of their lips\u201d). Rand\u2019s libertarian followers exulted in her rogues\u2019 gallery of evil statists, who are dragging America into a condition of primitive decline: greedy labor bosses, \u201cmodern college-infected parasites who assumed a sickening air of moral self-righteousness,\u201d conformist \u201cwatchdogs\u201d at the \u201cBureau of Economic Planning and National Resources,\u201d \u201cState Science Institute\u201d and \u201cConsumers\u2019 Protection,\u201d who have created a permanent proletariat of \u201cmoochers and looters,\u201d \u201cloafers\u201d and \u201cbums.\u201dTo many in the late 1950s this sounded crazily off-key. These were peak years of the \u201caffluent society\u201d and a golden age for entrepreneurs. President Eisenhower had stocked his cabinet with captains of industry like Charles Wilson, brought in from General Motors to run the Defense Department. The Cold War battle for the heavens soon yielded a billion-dollar-a-year \u201cspace industry,\u201d with lucrative government contracts showered on businesses large and small \u2014 from giant aircraft companies like Lockheed to Waste King, a maker of garbage disposals.But Rand sensed something else. America\u2019s great industrialists were becoming clients of the state. The advance guard of Cold War planners, space and weapons theorists like J. Robert Oppenheimer, John von Neumann and James R. Killian, the president of M.I.T., chosen by Eisenhower to oversee the creation of NASA, were administrators rather than doers, unlike the executives at New York Central Railroad and Kaiser Steel whom Rand had interviewed while writing \u201cAtlas Shrugged.\u201d The Promethean Hank Rearden is a throwback, a metal engineer who helps develop \u201ca motor that would draw static electricity from the atmosphere, convert it and create its own power,\u201d making possible a \u201cbrand-new locomotive half the size of a single Diesel unit, and with 10 times the power.\u201d In the emerging era of the R-7 missile and the multistage rocket, this motor (actually the invention of John Galt, the novel\u2019s mysterious hero) seemed archaic \u2014 a \u201cSwiftian device,\u201d The New Yorker\u2019s critic wrote. \u201cI am speaking, of course, of Tom Swift,\u201d the young inventor in the series of books for boys.But that was exactly what Rand meant to do, to reawaken respect for what one character calls \u201cthe highest type of human being \u2014 the self-made man \u2014 the American industrialist.\u201d And Rand\u2019s readers were intensely grateful. \u201cFor 25 years I\u2019ve been yelling my head off about the little realized fact that eggheads, socialists, Communists, professors and so-called liberals do not understand how goods are produced,\u201d wrote one, the owner of the Standard Slag Company in Youngstown, Ohio.And if those useful goods weren\u2019t produced, hard times would come. Rand\u2019s dystopian picture feels prescient \u2014 \u201cthe slovenly dilapidation of slum hovels,\u201d the \u201ccommand\u201d economy that overwhelms ordinary citizens \u201cwho never looked beyond the span of one week,\u201d and were pacified by the \u201clarge new television set in the lighted room of a house with a sagging roof and cracking walls.\u201d Rand\u2019s prevision of American carnage drew on memories of her Russian girlhood, first of the Bolshevik Revolution and then of the \u201ctransition period under Lenin from a primitive capitalism to a brutal Communism,\u201d Anne C. Heller writes in \u201cAyn Rand and the World She Made.\u201dAmericans, Rand suggested, were listening for the wrong signals \u2014 seduced by the metal orb speeding across the sky, and the organized miracle of the Soviet \u201cVirgin Lands\u201d program and its otherworldly grain yields. Rand\u2019s novel called attention to very different facts of life in the Soviet empire: chronic meat shortages, inadequate housing, oppressed populations in revolt (including the recent Hungarian uprising, quashed by Soviet tanks). \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d is a nightmare picture not of America as it was in 1957, but of the ersatz Soviet Union it might become.Never was so conventional a novel so rapturously received, at least in the West, especially after the Russians refused to publish it, and then, when smuggled translations began selling in vast numbers abroad, heaped abuse on Pasternak and made him turn down the 1958 Nobel Prize. The \u201ctraitor Boris Pasternak\u201d was officially urged to \u201cbecome a real emigrant\u201d \u2014 instead of an internal one \u2014 \u201cand go to his capitalist paradise.\u201d In a country where nearly 1,500 writers had either been killed or had died in labor camps, this was not a subtle hint. But Pasternak, a revered poet and a courageous one, didn\u2019t give in. He stubbornly stayed in Russia, in a bungalow outside Moscow, though he would have been welcome as a hero anywhere in the West. At an anti-Communist rally in Vienna sponsored by Roman Catholic student and youth organizations, a montage of photos \u201cmade him appear to be standing behind barbed wire,\u201d The Times reported. \u201cFrom a distance he seemed to be wearing a crown of thorns.\u201d By this time sales of his novel in the United States alone had reached 850,000 copies.It wasn\u2019t just Cold War politics that excited readers. On the contrary, Pasternak\u2019s subjects were faith and redemption, death and resurrection. He discussed Communism as Western ex-Communists did, as the romantic \u201cgod that failed.\u201d Zhivago laments how the original Marxist ideal \u2014 \u201cyoung men dying on the barricades, writers racking their brains in an effort to curb the brute insolence of money, to save the human dignity of the poor\u201d \u2014 is betrayed by the rigid dogma of the Soviet state and so was flawed all along, as any dream of salvation through politics must be. The only answer, Zhivago realizes, is to escape politics altogether and seek a \u201cnew way of living and new form of society, which is born of the heart, and which is called the Kingdom of Heaven,\u201d and rests in the truth of Christ\u2019s timeless parables. \u201cThe idea that underlies this,\u201d Zhivago explains, \u201cis that communion between mortals is immortal, and that the whole of life is symbolic because it is meaningful.\u201dZhivago and Lara\u2019s \u201cconversations, however casual, were as full of meaning as the dialogues of Plato,\u201d Pasternak writes. Perhaps. But his own homilies read less like Tolstoy than like the mock-Russian hilarities in Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cLove and Death.\u201d At the time, however, astute and august critics were mesmerized. One of them, Edmund Wilson, argued that Pasternak presented a \u201cradical criticism of all our supposedly democratic but more and more centralized societies.\u201d William F. Buckley Jr., praising \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d from the right, wrote, \u201cThe elaborate edifice of Marxism-Leninism crumbles before the poet\u2019s eye of Boris Pasternak.\u201d The secret genius of \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d was that it gave comfort to everyone, even the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev when he finally got around to reading it. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have banned it,\u201d he conceded. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing anti-Soviet in it.\u201dThey were surprised by what they found. Sexual sin was a familiar subject in the late 1950s. The period\u2019s best sellers included \u201cPeyton Place,\u201d \u201cBy Love Possessed\u201d and \u201cAnatomy of a Murder.\u201d But these were all conventional middlebrow novels. Nabokov was a highbrow genre-changer, an originator of postmodern techniques: wordplay, stories constructed like puzzles, layers of allusion, tricks of misdirection.If Rand and Pasternak were fabulists dabbling in realism, Nabokov was the opposite, a literary magician, with a dandy\u2019s lush prose style, whose story was based on a shockingly thorough knowledge of facts on the ground. In her new book, \u201cThe Real Lolita,\u201d Sarah Weinman maps the parallels between Humbert\u2019s case and one true-crime episode mentioned in \u201cLolita,\u201d the abduction of a fifth grader by a 50-year-old pedophile in Camden, N.J., who fled with her on a cross-country spree. But that was just one story among many in what later came to be called the \u201cpostwar sex crime panic.\u201d Ordinary readers were well-versed in such stories. They were staples of the so-called family magazines. A cover story in The American Magazine in 1947 \u2014 when much of \u201cLolita\u201d takes place \u2014 was \u201cHow Safe Is Your Daughter?\u201d Not safe at all, according to the author, the F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover. \u201cThe most rapidly increasing type of crime is that perpetrated by degenerate sex offenders,\u201d he wrote, going on to offer a selection, complete with lurid details, of a nationwide binge of rape and pedophilia, a \u201ccriminal assault every 43 minutes, day and night, across the United States.\u201d There was, for instance, the case of the 17-year-old jailed on a sex charge who \u201cthree weeks after his release lured an 11-year-old girl to an open field, where his brutal attacks ended in the murder of the child.\u201d Another family magazine, Collier\u2019s, published a series, \u201cTerror in Our Cities.\u201d And there was more in the daily press \u2014 tales of grown men who plied underage girls with \u201csodas and sundaes,\u201d teenage sex rings involving girls as young as 13 (all \u201csaid to be from good families\u201d).Nabokov was an accomplished butterfly collector, well versed in scientific jargon, real and fake. In a mock foreword to \u201cLolita,\u201d Humbert\u2019s story is described, in pitch-perfect Kinsey-ese, as the \u201cconfession of a White Widowed Male.\u201d His story, the author adds, \u201cshould make all of us \u2014 parents, social workers, educators \u2014 apply ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the task of bringing up a better generation in a safer world.\u201d It was easy to feel in on the joke, just as it was easy to share in the snobbery when Nabokov wrote, \u201cNothing is more exhilarating than philistine vulgarity.\u201d But you could also miss what he was really saying, that America had mass-produced its own version of Old World decadence. The same consumer culture that infantilized adults \u2014 with \u201ccute paper napkins and cottage-cheese crested salads\u201d and \u201c\u2018raid-the-icebox\u2019 midnight snacks\u201d \u2014 was also sexualizing their children and making them prey to pedophiles. Grown-ups and \u201cbobby-soxers\u201d alike were in thrall to the \u201cluminous globules of gonadal glow that travel up the opalescent sides of jukeboxes,\u201d and also huddled together in the \u201cdim, impossibly garnet-red light that in Europe years ago went with low haunts, but here meant a bit of atmosphere in a family hotel.\u201d Humbert, posing as Lolita\u2019s father, is a sinister parody of the overprotective \u201chelicopter\u201d parent, rebuked by Lolita\u2019s teachers for being an \u201cold-fashioned Continental father\u201d who forbids his \u201cdaughter\u201d to mix with boys her own age. Viktor Komarovsky, the sexual predator in \u201cDoctor Zhivago,\u201d would have had an easy time of it in Nabokov\u2019s America.Each of these three novels has had a remarkable afterlife. \u201cLolita\u201d is a virtual guidebook to the abuses exposed by the #MeToo movement \u2014 the secret predations of the mentor and teacher who operates in a free zone of \u201cenlightened\u201d complicity. \u201cDoctor Zhivago\u201d endures less as a novel than as a peak episode in the cultural Cold War. Publishers in America and Britain recently paid large advances to a young novelist who has told the story again, drawing on declassified documents on the secret C.I.A. operation that smuggled the manuscript back into Russia. And \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d remains a free market Bible on the right. What one of its most scathing early critics, the ex-Communist journalist Whittaker Chambers, identified as Rand\u2019s appetite for \u201csmashing up the house\u201d has become the stated cause of several generations of Republicans and libertarians. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, with his mission to undo the Affordable Care Act and its coddling of \u201ctakers,\u201d while slashing taxes on high-income \u201cmakers, \u201d is a devout Randian, as are members of the Trump cabinet. Silicon Valley abounds with Randians, too.Meanwhile Russian cyberhackers have reportedly begun to disrupt the 2018 midterm elections. More than a quarter-century after the Soviet Union dissolved, Russia remains in many respects our doppelg\u00e4nger, and the cry is heard, in ever more plaintive tones, \u201cwhere is the collusion?\u201d The answer \u2014 as all three of the great post-Sputnik prophets of the novel tried to tell us \u2014 is everywhere.Sam Tanenhaus, a former editor of the Book Review, is writing a biography of William F.

{"Headline": "Deborah Eisenberg, Chronicler of American Insanity", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "FeatureOver three decades of short fiction, the writer has managed to capture, with hilarious tenderness, the dysfunction of daily life in this country.Supported byIt takes Deborah Eisenberg about a year to write a short story. She works at a desk overlooking the gently curving stairwell in her spacious, light-soaked Chelsea apartment. A small painting of a brick wall, suspended from the high ceiling by two slender cables, hangs at eye level in front of the desk, a sardonic reminder of the nature of her task. For Eisenberg, coming up against a brick wall is what writing often feels like. At 72, she has been conducting her siege on the ineffable for more than four decades, and yet the creative process remains almost totally opaque to her. \u201cYou work and you work and you work and you work,\u201d she told me recently, her delicate, quavering voice an audible testament to the endless hours of labor. \u201cAnd for months or years on end, you\u2019re just a total dray horse, and then you finally finish something, and the next day you look at it and you think, How did that get there? What is that? Why were those the things that I seemed to need to say?\u201dBehind her desk is a wrought-iron daybed on which she takes frequent breaks to read; while she\u2019s in the early stages of working on a new story, two hours of writing a day is usually as much as she can manage. When I asked her what she does with the rest of her time, a puzzled look came across her face, as though she were trying to decipher some hidden message in the ceiling moldings. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d she eventually conceded. For the past 40 years she has lived with the playwright and actor Wallace Shawn, whom Eisenberg refers to as \u201cmy boyfriend\u201d and \u201cmy sweetheart.\u201d (They have never married.) \u201cI don\u2019t like to cook, and I\u2019m not a good cook, but I like to keep Wally fed,\u201d she added. I waited a moment longer to see if she would say anything else. Then I changed the subject.In spite of her desultory M.O., Eisenberg has somehow managed to produce one of the most original and accomplished bodies of work in contemporary literature. With the exception of a play, a book about the painter Jennifer Bartlett and a handful of critical essays, her output consists entirely of short stories, and yet as a portraitist and interpreter of the moral and political chaos of American life she is the equal of any novelist of the past 30 years. Her stories rove from the Midwest, where she was born, to the metropolitan centers and foreign outposts of American power and concern the fate of artists and intellectuals, bankers, movie stars and C.I.A. apparatchiks, as well as drifters, dropouts and dead-enders, the politically displaced and the existentially homeless. Like their creator, her dramatis personae are beings of an almost extraterrestrial sensitivity and confusion; they look at the world with a kind of radical na\u00efvet\u00e9, as though they had never before encountered cars, buildings, trees or clouds, let alone the ambiguous workings of human social life. Just how strange it is to be that lost and lonely creature, oneself, is a realization that Eisenberg\u2019s world-dazed men and women arrive at time and again.Naturally, Eisenberg is a master of the requisite short-story skill set: observation, pacing, surprise and economy. (Consider the hyperefficient characterization that occurs in these two short sentences: \u201cCaroline had never cared what things were really like. He\u2019d once heard her say thank you to a recorded message.\u201d) At the same time, she has always been thrillingly heedless of the rules by which so many contemporary practitioners seem bound. \u201cThe confines of the short story never confine her,\u201d Lorrie Moore told me in an email. Her work bristles with dreams, memory tangents, cognitive non sequiturs \u2014 the rough edges of life that most writers are eager to smooth away in their pursuit of formal elegance. \u201cHow else, except in the clarity of dreams, are you supposed to see the world all around you that\u2019s hidden by the light of day?\u201d one character asks, succinctly formulating one of the metaphysical paradoxes that underwrites all of Eisenberg\u2019s work.In person, Eisenberg can also be hard to anticipate, her conversational manner shifting between assertive lucidity and groggy self-deprecation. \u201cI go through my life in a fog, not understanding anything, so anything I tell you is questionable,\u201d she warned me. Eisenberg and Shawn live in a narrow beige rowhouse with a black cornice and a lightly peeling facade, which give the place, its exorbitant property value notwithstanding, an air of mild bohemian dilapidation. From the roof deck, its potted hydrangeas and wisteria bursting with rude health, you can see the High Line, the disused stretch of elevated railroad spur that was converted into a public park in 2009. \u201cIt looks like a metaphor, like a morality play: all of humanity marching in one direction,\u201d Eisenberg told me as we took in the view one sweltering July afternoon. She and Shawn sometimes walk there in the evenings. \u201cThe lighting is beautiful, the vegetation is beautiful,\u201d Eisenberg continued. \u201cPeople are lying around basically having sex \u2014 just doing whatever they want. It\u2019s really nice.\u201dWith her intense pallor, hectic gray hair and deep-set brown eyes, Eisenberg looks a bit like a figure from a lost Tim Burton film. Each time we met, she wore black jeans and a black boat-neck shirt that hung loosely from her diminutive frame. She is slender, petite, brittle-looking; walking around Midtown with her a few days later, I kept worrying that she was about to be knocked over and trampled by the onrushing crowds. This feeling may have stemmed in part from an immersion in Eisenberg\u2019s work, which is suffused with a sense of the brittleness, not just of bodies but also of communities and nations, even reality itself. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, one character in \u201cTwilight of the Superheroes,\u201d the title story from her fourth collection, comes to think of reality as \u201ca curtain painted with the map of the earth, its oceans and continents, with Lucien\u2019s delightful city,\u201d through which the planes tore a hole, exposing the dark world behind it.A story a year translates to roughly a book a decade, and this month marks the publication of \u201cYour Duck Is My Duck,\u201d Eisenberg\u2019s first collection in 12 years and her fifth in total. As a record of what American life feels like right now, of the effects of the current American insanity on the central nervous system, it is unlikely to be bettered this year. Eisenberg is especially shrewd about the way in which emotions are dictated from above and public events spread like a stain through our private lives. In the magisterial title story, a struggling middle-aged artist with chronic insomnia visits her doctor. The doctor suggests pills. \u201cI\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll blunt my affect,\u201d the artist says. Irritated, the doctor replies that in that case her best bet is to figure out why she isn\u2019t sleeping. \u201cWhat\u2019s to figure out?\u201d the artist says. \u201cI\u2019m hurtling through time, strapped to an explosive device, my life. Plus, it\u2019s beginning to look like a photo finish \u2014 me first, or the world. It\u2019s not so hard to figure out why I\u2019m not sleeping. What I can\u2019t figure out is why everybody else is sleeping.\u201d (\u201cEverybody else is sleeping because everybody else is taking pills,\u201d the doctor says.)The story, one of Eisenberg\u2019s finest to date, is a fugue of misunderstanding. After the narrator\u2019s ex-husband sells one of her paintings to a volatile couple with money to burn, they invite her to stay with them in their holiday home in an unidentified foreign country. There she meets a reclusive puppeteer, another guest, who is developing his next show, a political allegory about an insurrection of serfs, bats and donkeys against a corrupt king and queen. (Working title: \u201cState of Emergency.\u201d) One night, still struggling with insomnia, the narrator accepts a few sleeping pills from her hostess. The next morning she wakes up \u201cnot exactly refreshed, more sort of blank really, as if the night had been not just dreamless but expunged.\u201d She is excited to see she has an email from her ex-husband, whom she has been missing acutely. The email, however, appears to be gibberish: \u201cPrisoner? The world is large. You\u2019re only a prisoner of your own fears. If you don\u2019t like it in the prison of your fears, go somewhere else.\u201d After a moment of concern for his mental health, the narrator realizes, to her horror, that the email is a response to a message she sent the previous night, under the influence of the sleeping medication, a garbled pr\u00e9cis of \u201cState of Emergency\u201d that doubles as an account of her desperate life situation: \u201cYour support for their corrupt regime has cost you more than it has cost me! Yes I am a prisoner now, but your soul has turned to dust, these are the facts.\u201d Then she finishes reading his response, in which he tells her that the new life he tried to start in Europe has not been going as planned: \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come back to the States just to regroup for a bit, though god knows it\u2019s finished there, isn\u2019t it \u2014 really, truly finished.\u201dThe story doesn\u2019t dwell on this remark, but in its offhand way, it serves as a kind of thesis statement for the book \u2014 or, indeed, for Eisenberg\u2019s work as a whole, which has traced the arc of America\u2019s descent into a politics of tribalism and demagogy with alarming clearsightedness. \u201cI just fall over guffawing when people say, \u2018This isn\u2019t who we are,\u2019\u2009\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s policies in a tone of weary clarity, settling herself on the daybed. \u201cWho are you other than what you do?\u201dEisenberg was disabused of any city-on-a-hill mythology when she was still a teenager. In 1963, the year of the Birmingham campaign and George Wallace\u2019s stand in the schoolhouse door, she heard from a school friend about a racially integrated social-justice summer camp near the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. It was a perfect opportunity to put some distance between herself and her mother, who seemed only too happy to let Eisenberg go. One night, the campsite was raided by local police officers. At first, Eisenberg recalled, the officers joked about shooting the camp leaders along with their young wards right there. Instead, they tried to make a legal example of them. Eisenberg was charged with \u201clewd behavior\u201d \u2014 that is, interracial sex (\u201cI can assure you I was having sex with no one,\u201d she clarified) \u2014 and, after spending the night in jail, was sequestered for several days in the basement of a local church. Thanks to the efforts of a courageous local lawyer, Eisenberg and her fellow campers were released. The case eventually fell apart.The greatest shock, however, came after she returned home. \u201cNo one said, \u2018You\u2019re lying!\u2019\u2009\u201d she explained. \u201cIt was just sort of: \u2018Oh ha-ha, dear, of course! You\u2019re a teenage hysteric!\u2019 That was the subtext. And I was a teenage hysteric, but I knew what was happening.\u201d The realization that, as she put it, \u201cit\u2019s very, very, very difficult for people, particularly people with a certain level of comfort or privilege, to take in the reality of a situation\u201d was, in a sense, all she needed; artistically, she has been living off the interest of this insight ever since.As a young woman, Eisenberg\u2019s commitment to underachievement was ironclad. After two years at Marlboro College, in Vermont, she dropped out and hitchhiked around the country with a boyfriend, whom she described as a \u201chippie prince.\u201d Eventually she found her way to New York (minus the boyfriend, who had absconded to Canada to avoid military service), where she completed her undergraduate degree at the New School and embarked on more than a decade of waitressing and secretarial jobs, including a stint at The New York Review of Books.In the early 1970s, Eisenberg was introduced to Shawn, an up-and-coming playwright whose father, William, was the famously reticent editor of The New Yorker. At first it seemed as though they had little in common. Eisenberg had embraced the counterculture of the \u201960s, marching against the Vietnam War, experimenting with drugs and in general living a life of high-minded dissipation; Shawn was a liberal centrist who had revered President Kennedy and still wore the same kind of Brooks Brothers jackets his mother dressed him in as a child. \u201cShe didn\u2019t hang with people who believed in the American system, who believed that America was basically a benevolent power in the world,\u201d Shawn told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think she really hung with anybody who even knew people like that.\u201d Nevertheless, a bond was quickly formed. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting feature of human life that one shrinks and expands according to whom one is talking to,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cTalking to Wally, I discovered in myself large reserves of mental and emotional activity that had simply been unavailable to me before.\u201d Shawn, who was still living with his parents on the Upper East Side, began staying at Eisenberg\u2019s apartment on Leroy Street in the West Village, though they had no plans for a long-term future together. \u201cWe were very careful about not buying a large tube of toothpaste,\u201d Eisenberg told me. Shawn added, \u201cIf someone had said at that time, \u2018You\u2019re still gonna be living together when you\u2019re in your 70s,\u2019 it would have seemed like a joke.\u201dBy the time she turned 30, Eisenberg was smoking three packs of Gauloises a day; prompted in part by the fact that Shawn is asthmatic, she resolved to stop and began working out at the 23rd Street Y. The experience of quitting was physically and emotionally ravaging. Seeing what a hard time she was having, Shawn suggested she write about it. Over the course of three years, Eisenberg produced several drafts of what would become \u201cDays,\u201d her first short story, each of which Shawn responded to with constructive notes. \u201cShe had to overcome a mountainous obstacle,\u201d Shawn told me. \u201cHer plan to do nothing.\u201d Eisenberg claims she would never have become a writer had it not been for Shawn\u2019s encouragement; Shawn, a fierce champion of her work and talent, finds this hard to believe. No magazine would publish \u201cDays,\u201d but it finally appeared in her first collection, \u201cTransactions in a Foreign Currency,\u201d in 1986. Eisenberg was so nervous about the book\u2019s publication that she left the country and holed up in a Venetian hotel for three months. Shawn attended the celebratory lunch in her stead and passed on news of the book\u2019s (modest but mostly favorable) reception.\u201cTransactions in a Foreign Currency\u201d appeared at a moment when minimalism, with its verbal and emotional austerity, was the dominant mode in American fiction. Eisenberg\u2019s work could not have gone more against the grain. While her contemporaries sought a scaled-down perfection, she produced stories of amplitude and ambition, form-breaking narratives that swung thrillingly between the domestic and the political, the mundane and the visionary. George Saunders wrote to me that what he loves about her work is the feeling that \u201cher narratives could go anywhere, which, given the country and time in which we live, is important.\u201dEisenberg is intensely, if somewhat narrowly, revered, a darling of critics and other practitioners, but not much known beyond the literary world. Still, the label \u201cwriter\u2019s writer,\u201d with its connotations of mere technical prowess, doesn\u2019t fit. Like Saul Bellow or Cynthia Ozick, she is an American writer with a Russian soul, an artist of moral and intellectual fervor, driven by a desire to make windows into people\u2019s souls. She sees her characters under the aspect of both history and eternity, fixing the essence of a life with remorseless precision. In \u201cSomeone to Talk To,\u201d from her third collection, \u201cAll Around Atlantis\u201d (1997), a gifted American pianist, coming to the understanding that he is simply not gifted enough to sustain the concert career he had dreamed of as a young man, makes a devil\u2019s bargain with a corrupt foreign regime. Eisenberg can be a writer of severe judgment, but it is with the utmost tenderness that she renders this broken man\u2019s acceptance of the reality that, \u201clike most humans,\u201d hewas an experiment that had never been expected to succeed, a little padding around some evolutionary thrust, a scattershot nubbin of DNA. It was a matter of huge biological importance, for some reason, that he be desperate to meet the demands of his life, but it was a matter of no biological importance whatever that he be able to meet them.Note those three sad, seemingly throwaway words, \u201cfor some reason,\u201d into which a whole lifetime of fumbling aspiration and baffled regret have been compressed.As the 1980s wore on, both of them became increasingly appalled by their government\u2019s actions in Central America, where the Reagan administration, ostensibly fearful of Soviet encroachment in America\u2019s backyard, was violently subverting the socialist revolution in Nicaragua and propping up the repressive right-wing client states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. To get a better sense, as they put it, of where their tax dollars were going, Eisenberg and Shawn took a series of trips to the region, where they met with journalists, activists, politicians and ordinary civilians, who were experiencing the effects of American policy firsthand. In El Salvador, where American-trained death squads were roaming the countryside in search of leftist guerrillas and in some cases massacring entire villages, they saw spray-painted on the side of the United States Embassy the words: \u201cIn this building is planned the murder and torture of the Salvadoran people.\u201d Another time, Eisenberg and Shawn attended a service at the church of Oscar Romero, the former archbishop of San Salvador who spoke out against the government\u2019s campaign of terror against its own people and was murdered by a right-wing assassin while saying Mass in 1980. After the service, a number of congregants stayed to speak to the American couple about life in El Salvador and the dangers they faced on a daily basis. \u201cThey were putting their lives in our hands,\u201d Eisenberg said. \u201cWe both thought, Well, we have a responsibility now.\u201dBack in New York, Eisenberg and Shawn had trouble persuading people of the full extent of what they\u2019d seen. \u201cThere was no faster way to shut down a dinner party,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was called all the things women are called: na\u00efve, shrill, ignorant.\u201d It was much worse than returning to Winnetka from the South as a teenager, she said, \u201cbecause then I was coming back into a culture of nice, well-meaning suburbanites. From Central America, I was coming back into a culture of elite, powerful people with vested interests who were close to centers of power.\u201dEisenberg had not traveled to the region with the intention of writing about it \u2014 she took no notes while she was there \u2014 but the experience clearly had a galvanizing effect on her imagination. In \u201cHoly Week,\u201d from her second collection, \u201cUnder the 82nd Airborne\u201d (1992), a former banker turned travel writer visits a Guatemala devastated by civil war with his younger girlfriend. His notebook entries about the imperfectly concealed horrors they witness are interspersed with snippets of the breezy article he has been sent there to report. (\u201cOf the many beautiful restaurants in town, perhaps the loveliest is Buen Pastor. Enjoy a cocktail of platonic perfection outside in the moonlit garden.\u201d) The story is a study in the psychology of evasion and rationalization, the narrator doing all he can to assuage his girlfriend\u2019s growing social conscience. \u201cYes, the lives some people lead are horrifying,\u201d he tells her in an outburst of spectacular bad faith, \u201cbut if you accept the idea that it\u2019s better for some people to be fortunate than for no people to be fortunate, then it\u2019s preposterous to make yourself miserable just because you happen to be one of those fortunate people.\u201dThose with whom Eisenberg first shared the story found it overbearing. \u201cI know! I know! Don\u2019t tell me!\u201d is how she characterized their response. Critics were similarly resistant, and yet the book has outlasted these objections and feels especially prescient at a moment when America\u2019s willful ignorance on every matter from climate change to its own racial history poses a civilizational threat. \u201cI was born at a moment when the world thought, O.K., this is the end of fascism,\u201d she told me. \u201cI mean, it was a bit of a stupid thing to think, obviously, but I never believed that we would be seeing such a resurgence of it, let alone that America would be joining exuberantly in.\u201dEisenberg and Shawn do not have children, and it is tempting to draw a connection between this fact and their pronounced anti-curmudgeonliness: Perhaps those without a direct personal link to the next generation are naturally more interested in the perspective of the young. \u201cYour Duck Is My Duck,\u201d as you would expect of a book by a writer of 70-plus, is full of a sense of impending expiration; several of its aging characters, struck by the realization that very soon no one will remember the things that they remember, have become ardent students of their own pasts, sifting the years for a faithful account of what their lives will have meant. At the same time, it is also a book about the future and a yearning for, as Eisenberg puts it, \u201cwhat was just about to be the world\u2019s very latest moment,\u201d a phrase that nicely captures the minute-by-minute anticipation with which ordinary life has been imbued.These countercurrents merge in the collection\u2019s final story, \u201cRecalculating,\u201d another late-career masterpiece. At a memorial service in London, a middle-aged dance instructor named Vivian encounters the nephew of her deceased former lover and later goes to bed with him. In lesser hands, the one-night stand might have been presented as a desperate and pathetic bid to recapture the past. Instead, Eisenberg shows us how Adam, the nephew, is equally drawn to Vivian, who embodies the world of his uncle, a man who escaped the stifling world of his Midwestern childhood, as Adam himself is now trying to do, and made a new life of sexual and artistic freedom abroad.Vivian, who does not have children and whose early ambitions to become a dancer were never realized, is full of retrospective longing: \u201cThere was always the feeling that one would get around to being young again. And that when one was young again, life would resume the course from which it had so shockingly deviated.\u201d But this sense of loss never curdles into resentment at those with more time than her. On the contrary, she recognizes that her young students, for all their vitality, harbor \u201csorrows that might still be reversed or at least compensated for.\u201d In a shrewd twist, when Vivian and Adam meet again decades later, it is she who feels a twinge of pity for him, with his potbelly and thinning hair.Eisenberg and Shawn were thrilled by the performance. After it was over, they stayed to praise and congratulate the young cast and continued to enthuse about it as they made their way to a nearby restaurant in the pouring rain. As they were approaching their destination, Eisenberg, who was wearing a black Issey Miyake trench coat she bought two decades ago (and for which she\u2019d received several compliments that evening), stepped over a rain-swollen gutter into the path of an oncoming car. Shawn reached out to pull her back. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been ironic,\u201d she said a bit later, as though she were only now processing the incident. \u201cIf I\u2019d been run over after watching \u2018Marie and Bruce.\u2019\u2009\u201dThey made it to dinner in one piece. Eisenberg started with a martini (\u201cYou never know what you\u2019re going to get with wine\u201d); Shawn, who rarely drinks, had a seltzer. By way of the new collection they got on to the subject of aging. Eisenberg, who was well into one of the fallow periods that have punctuated her creative life, hadn\u2019t written anything for more than a year. She wondered if she would ever finish another story. Who knew what would give out first \u2014 her body or the world? Still, for someone strapped to an explosive device, she was in a buoyant mood.\u201cPeople always talk about how horrible old age is, but I couldn\u2019t disagree more,\u201d she said, the candlelight glimmering on her inclined face. \u201cI find age is as intense as adolescence. You know you could hurtle off a cliff at any second. And because of that there\u2019s a sense of destiny, of apprehending things, of love that isn\u2019t available \u2014 or wasn\u2019t available to me \u2014 earlier. You feel: I\u2019ve survived this ordeal, and now I don\u2019t have to worry. I know how my life has worked out. All the anxiety that I put into the hard questions has fallen away. I can take my satisfactions where they are.\u201d She looked down at her plate of clam toast with pancetta. \u201cI can enjoy my supper.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Are You Middle Class? This Calculator Claims to Tell You", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut in the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metro area of California, it takes about $20,000 more; households of that size must earn at least $57,443 a year to attain middle-income status, the most money required of any area in the United States.\u201cOur determination of whether or not you\u2019re in the middle class is based on income alone,\u201d said Rakesh Kochhar, a senior researcher at Pew.Pew defines the middle class as a wide range that is two-thirds to double the median household income in the United States. Those numbers are then adjusted to account for location and household size. By this standard, about half of American adults live in middle-class households.That is why the calculator, which is based on government data from 2016, says a household of three in the New York-Newark-Jersey City metro area that earns between $55,138 and $165,413, before taxes, is considered middle income. A household earning more than $165,413 is upper income and anything below $55,183 is lower income.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about twice the median,\u201d Elliot B. Weininger, a sociology professor at SUNY Brockport, said. \u201cThere\u2019s no consensus about this.\u201dAlthough income typically correlates with education, job security, the ability to own a home and saving money, it is only one of many measures that has been used to define class. That is one of the reasons research by Pew and others often refers to \u201cmiddle income\u201d instead of \u201cmiddle class.\u201d\u201cI think intuitively in people\u2019s minds, when people use class terminology it doesn\u2019t just refer to purchasing power,\u201d Dr. Weininger said. It often relates to the type of work someone does, he added. \u201cThey definitely don\u2019t imagine blue-collar work.\u201dThere was less agreement as to whether it was important to own a home or take vacations. And in 2015 a college education was seen as less relevant to middle-class status than it was in 2012.After the Great Recession, there was a big increase in the number of people who identified as being lower class, said Tom W. Smith of NORC at the University of Chicago, a public opinion research center.\u201cThis measure is at 9 percent, the highest ever,\u201d said Dr. Smith, who runs the organization\u2019s Center for the Study of Politics and Society.That may have to do with political rhetoric, he added, in particular Donald J. Trump\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d which suggests that typical Americans are not well off.Wealth, which is not part of the Pew income calculator, is yet another measure of class.\u201cIf you really want to capture someone\u2019s class position you need multiple measures of resources at their disposal,\u201d said Daniel Laurison, an assistant professor of sociology at Swarthmore College who has studied class and social inequality.It is natural to be curious about one\u2019s social class, in part because \u201cwe use these class terms in the U.S. all the time,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no agreed-upon term or definition of those terms in any arena.\u201dWhen Pew introduced its income calculator in 2015, \u201cit steadily drew traffic,\u201d Mr. Kochhar said, receiving 4.6 million visitors since its debut. \u201cThat is one reason we updated the calculator, and the background research, using 2016 income data.\u201d\u201cIt gives you some sense of where you are relative to other people,\u201d Dr. Laurison said of the income calculator. \u201cI think that is useful.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m Steve Lohr, a tech reporter for The Times, and I tend to focus on the effects of technology beyond Silicon Valley. No question, the Valley is a wellspring of innovation and home to the ascendant digital corporate giants, both feared and admired. But it\u2019s just a sliver of the $20 trillion American economy.Technology is only a tool in service of greater ends, and those ends presumably extend beyond creating billionaires and enriching investors. The larger agenda, in economic terms, includes growth, productivity, living standards and jobs.Let\u2019s take one of those economic ingredients \u2014 jobs.Forecasts of technology\u2019s impact on jobs run the spectrum from apocalyptic to sanguine, depending largely on the pace of progress in artificial intelligence. But there is a consistency to the serious research on the coming course of automation: In the near term, occupations are more likely to be transformed by digital technology than destroyed by it.The work of the future, it seems clear, is going to be digitally inflected. Software skills are increasingly essential to every field. Most tech workers no longer work in the tech industry, and that trend is accelerating.These efforts are typically not far along yet, but the ones that seem to work best are collaborations \u2014 public-private partnerships that also involve nonprofit organizations and educational institutions.A new project adopting the collaborative model was announced this month in New Haven. The goal, said Gov. Dannel Malloy, is \u201ccultivating the tech work force talent of tomorrow.\u201d The new venture aims to double the number of software engineering graduates in Connecticut over the next several years.Its educational partner is a college-alternative start-up, the Holberton School. Founded in 2015 in San Francisco, Holberton offers a two-year program to create software engineers. Its graduates now work for companies like Apple, IBM, Dropbox and Tesla. The school charges no tuition, but graduates who get jobs pay the school 17 percent of their salaries for three years.After the Connecticut announcement, I caught up with Holberton\u2019s founders, Julien Barbier and Sylvain Kalache, both alumni of Silicon Valley companies. Their school is designed around projects and peer learning with mentors, but no formal teachers.Technical skills are only part of the program. Writing white papers, project reviews and public speaking are also emphasized. Critical thinking, teamwork and learning to learn are the higher-order skills.Technology changes too fast, Mr. Barbier said, for expertise in a particular set of software tools to be a lasting asset in the labor market.\u201cIn two years, you do learn a craft that is in demand,\u201d said Mr. Barbier, Holberton\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut this is really about self-learning. If you can train yourself, you\u2019re never going to obsolete.\u201dIn San Francisco, Holberton has enrolled a total of 300 students since it opened its doors two years ago and, with added space, hopes to bring in 1,000 students a year before long. At the New Haven school, which begins next year, Holberton plans to start with 30 to 50 students and then expand rapidly.Its model has made encouraging progress. But the big question for all the experiments intended to prepare people for the future of work is whether anything can scale up to the size of the challenge that America faces.Some tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Japan Has Enough Nuclear Material to Build an Arsenal. Its Plan: Recycle.", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROKKASHO, Japan \u2014 More than 30 years ago, when its economy seemed invincible and the Sony Walkman was ubiquitous, Japan decided to build a recycling plant to turn nuclear waste into nuclear fuel. It was supposed to open in 1997, a feat of advanced engineering that would burnish its reputation for high-tech excellence and make the nation even less dependent on others for energy.Then came a series of blown deadlines as the project hit technical snags and struggled with a Sisyphean list of government-mandated safety upgrades. Seventeen prime ministers came and went, the Japanese economy slipped into a funk and the initial $6.8 billion budget ballooned into $27 billion of spending.It is a predicament with global ramifications. While waiting for the plant to be built, Japan has amassed a stockpile of 47 metric tons of plutonium, raising concerns about nuclear proliferation and Tokyo\u2019s commitment to refrain from building nuclear arms even as it joins the United States in pressing North Korea to give up its arsenal.That is because only four of Japan\u2019s working reactors are technically capable of using the new fuel, and at least a dozen more would need to be upgraded and operating to consume the plutonium that the recycling plant would extract each year from nuclear waste.Japan\u2019s neighbors, most notably China, have long objected to the stockpile of plutonium, which was extracted from the waste during tests of the recycling plant and at a government research facility, as well as by commercial recycling plants abroad. Most of this plutonium is now stored overseas, in France and Britain, but 10 metric tons remain in Japan, more than a third of it in Rokkasho, the northeastern fishing town where the recycling plant is being built.Japan says it stores its plutonium in a form that would be difficult to convert into weapons, and that it takes measures to ensure it never falls into the wrong hands. But experts are worried the sheer size of the stockpile \u2014 the largest of any country without nuclear weapons, and in theory enough to make 6,000 bombs \u2014 could be used to justify a nuclear buildup by North Korea and others in the region.Japan maintains that its plutonium is for peaceful energy purposes and that it will produce only as much as it needs for its reactors. \u201cWe are committed to nonproliferation,\u201d said Hideo Kawabuchi, an official at the Japan Atomic Energy Commission.But the launch of the Rokkasho plant has been delayed so long \u2014 and popular opposition to restarting additional nuclear reactors remains so strong \u2014 that skepticism abounds over the plan to recycle the stockpile. Critics say Japan should concede the plant will not solve the problem and start looking for a place to bury its nuclear waste.Engineers have repeatedly revised the design of the plant to address water leaks and earthquake safety, and it took years to develop a safe way to dispose of hazardous byproducts. After the Fukushima disaster, government regulators demanded even more safety measures.Giving up on the recycling plant, though, would be politically difficult, not least because Aomori Prefecture, where it is, has threatened to send the 3,000 metric tons of nuclear waste stored here back to communities around the country with nuclear plants.Pulling the plug would also deprive one of Japan\u2019s poorest regions of an economic lifeline. Over the years, the central government has awarded nearly $3 billion in incentives to the prefecture, where political leaders reliably support Japan\u2019s governing party. Even inoperative, the plant employs more than one in 10 residents in Rokkasho and accounts for more than half the town\u2019s tax revenues.\u201cIt is now indispensable for Rokkasho,\u201d said Kenji Kudo, the fourth generation to run his family\u2019s clothing distribution company, which sells uniforms and protective gear to the plant. As demand from local squid fishermen disappeared, he added, the plant \u201crescued our business.\u201dThere are small reminders that the munificence comes with some risk. A screen in the lobby of the concert hall reports the radiation level at 32 places around the prefecture, and a sign at a local nursing home warns residents not to use the baths \u201cin case of nuclear disaster.\u201dKaoru Sasaki, director of the nursing home, said she doubts the plant will ever operate, given concerns about nuclear power around the country. \u201cBut we don\u2019t talk about that among friends here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is so important to the community.\u201dThe plant itself is sprawled across nearly 1,000 acres of farmland, surrounded by fields of solar panels and wind turbines. Some 6,000 workers are now installing steel nets to protect it against tornadoes and digging ditches for pipes to carry water from a swamp into its cooling towers. Inside a large control room, workers in turquoise jumpsuits mill about computer consoles, monitoring dormant machinery.The final piece of the plant to come online will be a facility, now under construction, that will take a mix of plutonium and uranium and turn that into fuel. But no one knows what would happen if the government cannot persuade communities to reopen and upgrade more reactors to use this type of fuel.\u201cOur only plan right now is that we want to start reprocessing in 2021,\u201d said Koji Kosugi, general manager for international cooperation and nonproliferation at Japan Nuclear Fuel. \u201cBut we do not yet know how it will be consumed. This is something that has to be worked out with the utilities and the Japanese government.\u201dThomas M. Countryman, an Obama administration official who is now chairman of the nonpartisan Arms Control Association in Washington, said the Rokkasho plant is \u201cin a sense a delaying tactic in order to put off the most difficult decision that any country has to face.\u201dOne option, said Tatsujiro Suzuki, a nuclear scientist at Nagasaki University, is to turn Rokkasho itself into a nuclear waste storage facility.Nuclear plants across Japan have already sent waste that cannot be recycled to Rokkasho \u2014 steel drums full of ash, contaminated filters, steel pipes and protective clothing. Huge concrete boxes holding the drums are lined up in vast dugouts on the grounds of the plant, and canisters holding highly radioactive waste are stacked nine deep in a cavernous underground room where only their bright orange lids poke out of the floor.The government promised that the waste would be stored here only temporarily but never came up with a permanent plan. In Rokkasho, residents are still waiting for the recycling plant.\u201cIf the government had asked the village to only accept waste in the first place,\u201d said the mayor, Mamoru Toda, \u201cI don\u2019t think the village would have accepted it.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

The program\u2019s reach is vast: More than 175 million workers contribute to it with every paycheck, and about 43 million retirees collect monthly benefits. For three in five older Americans, those checks account for more than half their income.Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said in a recent interview that the administration had to be tougher on spending and would begin to consider the \u201cthe larger entitlements\u201d \u2014 Social Security and Medicare are the two biggest social insurance programs \u2014 \u201cprobably next year.\u201dSocial Security faces a projected shortfall in about 16 years, when benefits for all recipients \u2014 present and future \u2014 would be cut by roughly 20 percent.

When there is a surplus, the extra money is invested in a special type of Treasury security that pays interest to the trust fund. That is where confusion sometimes arises about how Social Security is used to pay for things unrelated to the program. But it is really no different from what happens when the government sells Treasury securities to other investors, like China.Although Social Security is considered \u201coff budget,\u201d economists and government prognosticators may also view it as part of the so-called unified budget, which includes all federal activities when evaluating everything that affects the economy. From that perspective, Social Security can make the deficit look larger.One idea that is often floated is to tax a broader base of workers\u2019 incomes. For instance, the cap on how much income is taxed could be lifted above the current $128,400. Another option would be to raise the tax rate above the 12.4 percent now split between workers and employers.

{"Headline": "Trump to Preside Over U.N. Security Council, Prompting Anxiety All Around", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three weeks from now, in New York, President Trump will find himself in the setting he most relishes: seated at the head of a polished table, calling on those seated around him, rewarding those he likes and cutting off those who displease him.It is not a revival of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d or even a meeting of his cabinet. Mr. Trump will be presiding at the United Nations Security Council, a rotating role that falls to the United States this month. His star turn is prompting anxiety among people, inside and outside the administration, who worry that the president will bring reality-TV antics to the world stage.Exercising the prerogative of the chairman, Mr. Trump plans to focus on Iran and its malign activity around the Middle East. European diplomats said they fear that this will only underscore the disunity of the West, given the unpopularity of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal.Already, the president\u2019s choice of subject has drawn objections from Russia, which said the focus of the meeting should be entirely on the nuclear deal and Mr. Trump\u2019s exit from it, and Iran, which accused Mr. Trump of abusing his leadership of the council to vilify a single country.The resistance is not limited to foreigners. At the State Department, the National Security Council and the American mission to the United Nations, there are privately voiced qualms about Mr. Trump leading a discussion on a complex, divisive subject with foreign leaders who were fiercely opposed to his handling of the nuclear deal.American officials are discussing whether to reframe the session on the broader region or a different theme to reduce the risk of things going awry, though it is unclear whether the president will be receptive.By all accounts, Mr. Trump is excited about presiding over the most exclusive club devoted to world peace and security. And he appears equally ready to shake up the customs of that club, where the last time an American leader presided \u2014 Barack Obama in 2014 \u2014 he chose a theme that the other members could readily embrace: combating foreign terrorist fighters.Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused Mr. Trump on Wednesday of using the session to \u201cblame Iran for horrors US & clients have unleashed across\u201d the Middle East. He noted that the only Security Council resolution currently in force on Iran is the nuclear deal.Under the rules of the Security Council, Mr. Zarif or even Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, is entitled to a seat at the meeting and to be called on by Mr. Trump. Administration officials said they believed it was unlikely that Mr. Rouhani would turn up, though he is scheduled to attend the General Assembly, which meets at the same time.Even if he did come, officials said Mr. Trump might leave the meeting before it was Iran\u2019s turn to speak. It would be called on only after all 15 members of the Security Council had spoken, a process that could take half a day. If Mr. Trump left early, he would most likely hand over his seat to the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ms. Haley acknowledged that some council members would find Iran an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d subject. But, she said, \u201cI personally think that when we talk about things that are uncomfortable in the Security Council, good things happen.\u201d\u201cPresident Trump is very adamant that we have to start making sure that Iran is falling in line with international order,\u201d Ms. Haley added. \u201cAnd we continue to see them engage in things that are not helpful, whether it\u2019s in Lebanon, whether it\u2019s in Yemen, whether we\u2019re looking at Syria.\u201dThat is one of the primary arguments for Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to focus on Iran, other American officials said. The furor over the nuclear deal, they said, had crowded out discussion of Iran\u2019s other activities.The United States is warning allies, for example, that Iranian missiles pose a threat to civilian aircraft in the Persian Gulf. But particularly among Europeans, officials said, those dangers often get subsumed in the continuing discussion of why Mr. Trump abandoned the deal.Some officials played down the risks of Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance. Diplomatic protocol almost guarantees that the meeting will be a series of canned speeches rather than a freewheeling debate, in which Mr. Trump could either be rattled or be seen as bullying other leaders.In any event, Mr. Trump has shown himself to be gleefully unconcerned with bruising feelings.In his first visit to the General Assembly last year, he declared, \u201cI will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first\u201d \u2014 a call for sovereignty at odds with the mission of the United Nations as a body created to deal collectively with problems that transcend borders.He referred to the country of one African leader as \u201cNambia,\u201d prompting questions about whether he had conflated Namibia with Gambia or Zambia (the White House later clarified that he meant Namibia). From the rostrum of the General Assembly, he said of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, \u201cRocket Man is on a suicide mission.\u201dMr. Trump returns to the United Nations after having launched an audacious diplomatic overture to Mr. Kim. While in New York, Ms. Haley said, he planned to meet President Moon Jae-in of South Korea to discuss the nuclear negotiations, which have stalled in recent weeks.Mr. Trump can also claim progress in his efforts to isolate Iran, however unpopular they have been. The country\u2019s currency, the rial, plummeted to record lows this week amid fears that the sanctions Mr. Trump is reimposing will cripple its oil exports and broader economy.Beyond faulting Iran\u2019s behavior, though, it is not clear what Mr. Trump hopes to accomplish when he sits at the horseshoe-shaped table in the Security Council\u2019s chamber. With so much resistance to his Iran policy from Russia, China and other veto-wielding members, there is no prospect of winning support for any kind of resolution.When Mr. Obama first led a council meeting in 2009, the United States won passage of a resolution that promised tougher scrutiny of countries that proliferated nuclear weapons. Days later, the White House revealed intelligence showing that Iran had built a secret uranium enrichment facility in a mountain near the holy city of Qum.In 2014, with the Islamic State terrorizing Iraq and Syria, Mr. Obama pushed a resolution in the council to crack down on the financing, and movement of people signing up to fight for foreign terrorist organizations.While an American-led military campaign largely vanquished the Islamic State, Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 nonproliferation resolution did nothing to prevent North Korea from making new nuclear bombs, although he did negotiate the deal that blocked Iran\u2019s ability to do so.For Mr. Trump, marshaling global support against Iran seems less of a priority in New York than defiantly advancing his own get-tough policy. Aides said the decision to focus on Iran was very much the president\u2019s \u2014 and no one actively pushed back on it, whatever their qualms.For a president who hushed dissent in his reality-TV days with a simple \u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d the question is, how will he react if the would-be apprentices from Iran and Russia refuse to go quietly?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Rich Nations Vowed Billions for Climate Change. Poor Countries Are Waiting.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 When industrialized nations pledged in 2009 to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help the poorest countries deal with climate change, it won over some skeptics in the developing world who had argued that rich nations should pay up for contributing so much to the problem.At a climate change conference in Thailand this past week, some delegates reached by telephone said that the setting \u2014 the heart of Southeast Asia, a region where challenges relating to warming are readily apparent \u2014 was grimly fitting. They described the United Nations program\u2019s shortcomings as a symbol of a broken promise.Some observers say the fund\u2019s funding shortfall and bureaucratic malaise have dimmed expectations for the talks in Poland, which were already bound to be difficult.\u201cCertainly, the richer countries should bear more of the burden in the G.C.F. because they have more means and more at stake,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, referring to the fund by its initials. \u201cRicher countries also have benefited from wealth accumulated over decades when climate issues were not at the forefront.\u201dMs. Raman said that while she still hoped to see other developed nations \u201cstep up\u201d by contributing more to the fund, they had not yet made their exact commitments clear.\u201cWe\u2019re very horrified by the stance taken by the United States, but it\u2019s not the only one,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the developed countries are united around the United States in not making any progress on finance.\u201dBut even critics of the fund worry about the shortfall, saying it poses risks for people in poor regions where governments are either unable or unwilling to spend more on climate mitigation and adaptation.Southeast Asia is a case in point.Of 74 approved Green Climate Fund projects worth $3.5 billion, three are in Southeast Asia and they have a combined value of nearly $156 million, according to data provided by the program. Nineteen others in the program\u2019s pipeline directly target the region and are worth $904 million.Ms. Nacpil said climate finance was important in Southeast Asia partly because so many cities are in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea-level rise and must adapt. And because the number of coal-fired power plants in the region is expected to increase, she added, governments should be encouraged to bend national policies toward investments in renewable energy.Jenty Kirsch-Wood, a climate specialist with the United Nations Development Program, defended the Green Climate Fund by pointing to its benefits in Vietnam, where part of a $30 million grant from the program has funded the distribution of free, storm-resistant housing to people in typhoon-prone coastal areas.\u201cThe Green Climate Fund has revitalized hope for countries like Vietnam that they can meet their Paris agreement targets \u2014 embracing the green energy revolution, but also helping their citizens to adapt to climate change,\u201d Ms. Kirsch-Wood said.\u201cFor its part, G.C.F.\u2019s pipeline of climate projects in developing countries shows that demand for climate finance already exceeds supply,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "India Hunts Man-Eating Tiger Blamed for 13 Deaths", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "In a way, India\u2019s effort to protect tigers has become a victim of its own success. Their numbers are growing, and they\u2019re coming into contact with people more often.Supported byPANDHARKAWADA, India \u2014 The first victim was an older woman, discovered facedown in a cotton field with huge claw marks dug into her back. The next was an older male farmer, his left leg completely torn off.The killings have gone on for more than two years, sowing panic in the hills around Pandharkawada, a town in central India. In mid-August, the mauled body of Vaghuji Kanadhari Raut, a threadbare cattle herder, was found near a rural highway. He was victim No. 12.DNA tests, camera traps, numerous spottings and pugmarks \u2014 tiger footprints \u2014 have pinned at least 13 human killings on a single, 5-year-old tigress that seems to have developed a taste for human flesh and has evaded capture several times.At night, young men in the nearby villages carry torches and bamboo sticks and go on patrol. They have roughed up forest guards, furious that the authorities can\u2019t stop the killings.Forest rangers are now gearing up for a complex military-style operation to deploy sharpshooters with tranquilizer guns on the backs of half a dozen elephants to surround the tiger, capture her and send her to a zoo.But the elephants have yet to arrive, held up by intense bureaucratic infighting among India\u2019s myriad overlapping government agencies that cover wildlife but, between all of them, still don\u2019t seem to have enough resources.As the death count rises \u2014 three villagers were killed in August \u2014 several politicians are demanding that the rangers simply shoot the tiger. But that might not be legal. A wildlife activist seeking to block any such order has taken the matter all the way to India\u2019s Supreme Court, which may hear the case soon.In the meantime, rangers have been posted on rickety wooden stands built into jungle trees, ordered to keep their eyes peeled for the tiger. But they don\u2019t even have binoculars.\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill this beautiful animal,\u201d said K. M. Abharna, a top forestry official in the Pandharkawada area, which lies near the borders of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh states. \u201cBut there\u2019s a hell of a lot of political pressure and a hell of a lot of public pressure.\u201dA crafty man-eating tiger on the loose sounds like something out of a Rudyard Kipling tale. But it\u2019s a real and growing problem in today\u2019s India.India\u2019s human population and its economy have been rapidly growing as well, steadily filling in rural areas with farms, roads and mushrooming towns like Pandharkawada. Many tigers are now running out of space.They are spilling out of their dedicated reserves, roaming along smooth new asphalt highways and skulking through crowded farmland on a search for territory, mates and prey \u2014 such as antelope, wild pigs, stray cattle and sometimes people.All across India, islands of forest are shrinking, and the thin green tendrils on the map \u2014 tiger corridors \u2014 are being cut by more roads and more farms. Tigers are intensely territorial: A male tiger, once it gets big enough, might kill its own mother over turf.Each tiger needs miles of thick forest; the size of its territory depends on the availability of prey. In the past decade, India has created nearly two dozen more tiger reserves, bringing the total to 50. But many of them are surrounded by human development on all sides.Tejani5 milesINDIA44236BoratiLoniVedshiSaratiCHINAZotingdharaPAKISTANVihirgaonSakhiNEPALKhairgaonNew DelhiMSH6INDIAJiraMeeraArea of detailMumbaiSakhi210930MAHARASHTRA44Bay ofBengalArabianSeaMAHARASHTRASRI LANKAPandharkawada500 milesTejani5 milesINDIA23644BoratiLoniVedshiSaratiCHINAZotingdharaPAKISTANVihirgaonSakhiNEPALKhairgaonNew DelhiMSH6INDIAJiraMeeraArea of detail210MumbaiSakhi930MAHARASHTRA44Bay ofBengalMAHARASHTRAArabianSeaPandharkawadaSRI LANKA500 milesTejani5 miles23644INDIABoratiLoniVedshiSaratiCHINAZotingdharaPAKISTANVihirgaonNEPALSakhiKhairgaonNew DelhiMSH6INDIAJiraMeeraArea of detail210MumbaiSakhi930MAHARASHTRABay ofBengalMAHARASHTRAArabianSea44SRI LANKAPandharkawada500 miles44236MSH6210930445 milesCHINAPAKISTANNEPALNew DelhiINDIAArea of detailMumbaiMAHARASHTRABay ofBengalArabianSeaSRI LANKA500 milesBy The New York Times\u201cOur tiger situation is not a success story, it\u2019s a mess,\u201d said Valmik Thapar, one of India\u2019s most renowned tiger experts. \u201cWe have a whole bunch of islands, and the corridors in between are wiped out or degraded. Many tiger reserves are nonstarters, with less than five tigers or none at all. And we\u2019re too arrogant to learn from anywhere else.\u201dThe restrictions on the beef industry in many parts of India could be making the situation even more dangerous. India\u2019s Hindu nationalist governing party, the B.J.P., has cracked down like no other Indian government on the slaughter of cows, an animal Hindus revere.This has created enormous herds of mangy, unproductive, unwanted cattle that herders don\u2019t dare to kill, either because of specific cow protection laws that vary state by state or because they are terrified of being lynched by Hindu extremists.In several tiger areas, more prey now lives outside the dedicated tiger reserve than inside. That may be luring tigers out.\u201cAs soon as the tiger comes out, he sees a lot of cattle,\u201d explained Bilal Habib, an ecology professor and tiger researcher. So the tiger decides to stick around, Mr. Bilal said, catalyzing a whole cycle of conflict and death.In the case of the man-eating tiger, researchers are at a loss to explain why she started attacking humans. She has also killed some cows and horses.The rangers call her T-1. They have been keeping track of her since she was a cub; when she was young, they say, her mother was electrocuted. This is another growing problem, as farmers all over India string up crude electric fences to keep wild pigs out of their crops.T-1 never lived in a dedicated tiger reserve; 30 percent of India\u2019s tigers don\u2019t. Instead, they inhabit forested areas that are somewhat protected (for example, people are not supposed to build villages inside them).Her first victims were farmers weeding their fields at the forest\u2019s edge. In this part of India, everything is so packed together that even the people who live here aren\u2019t sure where the agricultural land ends and the protected forests begin.According to charts that forestry officials have been keeping, T-1 has eaten the flesh of about half of her victims. She gnawed off one woman\u2019s legs cleanly at the knees, almost like a chain saw. She chewed into one man\u2019s back, leaving his spinal column exposed.The rangers took swabs of tiger saliva from the wounds and sent them to labs for DNA analysis. Over several months, as the results came in, they began to piece together what they were facing.In January, forestry officials applied for what is called a shoot order. But an animal-rights activist from Mumbai who objected to killing T-1 helped to block it. Then T-1 gave birth to two fuzzy tiger cubs, which meant any action taken against her could jeopardize them, too.So the rangers equipped themselves with nets and tranquilizer guns and fanned out into the jungles, full of pungent lantana bushes, old gnarled teak trees and clouds of dragonflies hovering in the thick, humid air. Four times, they tried to capture T-1.\u201cBut she\u2019s very wild,\u201d said Mrs. Abharna, the forestry official. \u201cAnd she\u2019s very clever.\u201dEach time, she either hid in the tangle of lantana bushes or raced away.The villagers who live in T-1\u2019s area, which covers about 60 square miles, haven\u2019t been especially helpful. Furious that the rangers won\u2019t simply shoot the tiger, they have blocked access to the jungle. Others devised disturbing plans of their own.During a capture operation, an older man who could barely walk positioned himself right next to a cage that the rangers had baited with fresh buffalo meat.\u201cWhen we asked him what in the world he was doing,\u201d said Mrs. Abharna, he replied: \u201cIf I die, will you give my family the money?\u201dMeanwhile, the elephants, which rangers say are better for such an operation than any four-wheel-drive truck, are expected to arrive any day. The people living near Pandharkawada are losing patience. And they are becoming increasingly terrified.\u201cJust kill it,\u201d said Rashika Vishal, the daughter of the herder who was mauled by the highway. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing beautiful about this animal. It ate my father and we need to kill it before it kills someone else.\u201dAs she spoke, tears in her eyes, a dozen other people crowded into the family\u2019s dark little shack and nodded vigorously in agreement. Tiger attacks, they said, were never an issue in the past.\u201cWhen I was a kid, we used to walk around the jungle at night, no problem,\u201d said C.S. Meshram, a village elder. \u201cI don\u2019t know where these tigers are coming from. But they keep coming.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Ryan, the House speaker, who also attended, expressed another concern \u2014 that the president\u2019s talk with his supporters of a \u201cred wave\u201d in November was unfounded. All agreed that he should instead be sounding the alarm about the possibility of big Democratic gains.The two congressional leaders were only echoing the worries of many Republican strategists and Mr. Trump\u2019s own advisers.They say these \u201cdistractions\u201d \u2014 everything from the president\u2019s angry response to criticism about hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico to his continuing willingness to do battle with any number of opponents on Twitter \u2014 mean that Republican candidates spend too much time answering questions about what the leader of their party is saying or tweeting instead of focusing on the economic news that should be the real story of the election.And Mr. Trump\u2019s confidence in inevitable Republican success, they say, has prevented him from focusing on the need for a coherent message, and his own supporters from understanding the very real possibility that Democrats could retake the House and even the Senate.A spokesman for Mr. Ryan did not respond to an email seeking comment about the speaker\u2019s remarks at the chamber, and Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Mr. McConnell, said this account of what the majority leader said was \u201cinaccurate.\u201dBut in the last week, Mr. Trump seems to have heeded some of the warnings, forging common cause with Senate Republicans to work toward the confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In a pleasant surprise to Mr. Trump\u2019s aides and Republicans on Capitol Hill, the president avoided attacking Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser, and endorsed a Senate hearing where the allegations could be aired.But that discipline did not fully hold. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump expressed sympathy for Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s family rather than the woman who says she was abused by him when they were teenagers. He complained in an interview that \u201cI don\u2019t have an attorney general.\u201d He also demanded funding for the border wall \u2014 another topic many Republican leaders would rather avoid heading into the midterms.Republican pollsters have reinforced the concerns of the party\u2019s congressional leaders that the White House is not always helping when it comes to the midterms.\u201cThey have spent way too much time yelling about investigations and not enough time educating about the economy,\u201d Frank Luntz, a longtime Republican pollster, said in an interview. The president, he added, \u201cdeserves a lot more credit than he has been given, but he\u2019s also somewhat responsible because he hasn\u2019t been so focused and attentive to the changes that have really happened\u201d in the economy.Neil Newhouse, another pollster, has made clear his worries that too many Republicans are taking the midterms for granted.\u201cWe need to make real the threat that Democrats have a good shot of winning control of Congress,\u201d he said in a presentation for the Republican National Committee at the end of August that was recently shared with the president.Voters who are not die-hard Trump supporters may not \u201cbelieve there\u2019s anything at stake in this election,\u201d Mr. Newhouse wrote. \u201cPut simply, they don\u2019t believe that Democrats will win the House. (Why should they believe the same prognosticators that told them that Hillary was going to be elected president?).\u201dMr. Trump has alternately acknowledged to aides and supporters that the climate is troublesome and insisted that the worst will never happen. It is not clear that he actually believes his talk of a \u201cred wave,\u201d or if he is trying to will it into existence, advisers and allies say.But the potential for an electoral disaster on Nov. 6 has certainly not been lost on White House officials, who say it has added to existing anxiety about what will come next in the president\u2019s term. According to interviews with over half a dozen current and former White House aides and campaign officials, they are girding for the possibility of a political landscape \u2014 and, possibly, a West Wing \u2014 that could look very different after Election Day.\u201cThis is a White House that is achieving very large things,\u201d Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, said in an interview, but \u201csometimes in very clumsy ways.\u201d\u201cI believe the president understands that this midterm is hard,\u201d Mr. Gingrich said, \u201cthat historically the midterm is against him, but that it\u2019s doable.\u201dThe president\u2019s aides are trying to focus Mr. Trump on the next seven weeks by painting a picture of what it would look like if Democrats retook the House \u2014 an avalanche of subpoenas, a halt to his legislative agenda and, potentially, an impeachment proceeding.Other aides \u2014 some of whom were in elementary school the last time a president was impeached \u2014 have started listening to \u201cSlow Burn,\u201d a podcast about the events surrounding the Nixon and Clinton impeachment efforts.Mr. Gingrich said that the White House was likely to be preparing to play defense against the House and offense with the Senate.\u201cThey raise the 2020 campaign on \u2018what future do you want?\u2019\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \u201cSanctuary cities could be the future. You too could have an MS-13 gang in your neighborhood.\u201dEven as the White House looks to keep the president\u2019s focus on the election\u2019s final stretch, officials there recognize the risks to their own job security. Many anticipate a potential wipeout of the West Wing staff if things go badly, given that Mr. Trump often blames aides for any of his troubles.Some of the president\u2019s closest aides in the West Wing remain wary of the influence of outside advisers to the president, particularly Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, former campaign advisers who still have contact and influence with the president.Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Bossie are planning to publish a book three weeks after the midterms. The timing has provoked anxiety among some Trump aides, who worry it will be explicit in assigning blame to the White House political operation and other advisers if Republicans lose badly.Four advisers to the president said they saw the book and its title \u2014 \u201cTrump\u2019s Enemies: How the Deep State Is Undermining the Presidency\u201d \u2014 hanging over them as the midterms approach. Officials close to Ronna McDaniel, the party chairwoman, say that some of those close to Mr. Trump have begun to agitate for a change in leadership if there are significant midterm losses.\u201cOur book is not a problem for anybody who\u2019s not an enemy of the president,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said.In a recent interview with the radio host John Fredericks, Mr. Lewandowski made clear that he believes the president has been ill-served by those who were characters in \u201cFear,\u201d Bob Woodward\u2019s book about dysfunction in the Trump White House.\u201cHe\u2019s fighting his own staff,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski said, adding that he hoped for a \u201cwholesale fundamental change\u201d inside the White House.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nicaraguan Migrants Fleeing Turmoil Test Costa Rica\u2019s Good Will", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPE\u00d1AS BLANCAS, Costa Rica \u2014 The three men, fearing for their lives, left their homes in western Nicaragua under the cover of night. A taxi drove them south for hours. At a bend in a road, they got out, walked through scrubland and forest in darkness, passed through a gap in a low fence \u2014 and emerged in Costa Rica.\u201cWe felt relief,\u201d one of the men, Octavio Robleto, 57, a lawyer, recounted later that morning as he waited with the other two, both relatives, outside a Costa Rican immigration office where they planned to request asylum.In Nicaragua, he said, \u201cwe live completely in terror.\u201dSince mid-April, when Nicaragua erupted in a violent political crisis that has left hundreds dead and crippled the economy, Nicaraguans have been leaving their country en masse \u2014 some fleeing a crackdown by President Daniel Ortega against his opponents, others \u2014 newly unemployed \u2014 desperately looking for work. Many thousands have headed to Costa Rica, Nicaragua\u2019s neighbor to the south.They have streamed across the border, some through legal crossings but many more along clandestine routes to sidestep Nicaraguan security forces. Thousands have applied for asylum in Costa Rica, overwhelming the government\u2019s migration bureaucracy, while others have simply melted into the broader population.The Nicaraguan influx has posed an enormous challenge to the administration of President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, which is also wrestling with a gathering economic crisis and rising violence related to drug trafficking.The migration challenge has also tested Costa Rica\u2019s celebrated and carefully cultivated ethos of hospitality and positivity, causing flare-ups of xenophobia and exposing undercurrents of anti-Nicaraguan prejudice.Late last month in the capital, San Jos\u00e9, protesters \u2014 some carrying Molotov cocktails and baseball bats \u2014 descended on a park that has become a popular gathering place for Nicaraguans. Yelling anti-Nicaraguan invectives, they clashed with opponents, resulting in dozens of arrests.\u201cI call for calm, for peace,\u201d Mr. Alvarado Quesada said in a televised speech. \u201cIn the face of calls for hatred or violence, sanity, prudence, intelligence and solidarity must prevail.\u201dEpsy Campbell Barr, Costa Rica\u2019s foreign minister and first vice president, said the government was preparing for the political situation in Nicaragua to worsen as the year draws to a close, possibly pushing many more migrants into Costa Rica, one of the region\u2019s most politically stable and peaceful nations.The Nicaraguan crisis is threatening to become \u201ctoo big for a country with the conditions of Costa Rica,\u201d she said during an interview in her office in the presidential palace in San Jos\u00e9.\u201cSadly,\u201d she added, \u201cit\u2019s not clear when the crisis will end.\u201dThe migration of people fleeing violence, political upheaval, poverty and natural disasters has for years tested the political resolve and good will of governments and populations throughout Latin America.Hundreds of thousands of Central Americans, mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have in recent years left their homes seeking sanctuary and better lives elsewhere, mostly in the United States. More than two million Venezuelans have left their country, scattering throughout the Americas and Europe.While it is unclear how many Nicaraguans have fled since the unrest started in April, the exodus does not compare in size to those mass movements, officials said. Still, it has had an unsettling effect on countries in the region, particularly Costa Rica, which has received the biggest influx of Nicaraguans.The current surge is just the latest in decades of Nicaraguan immigration to Costa Rica, whose Nicaraguan \u00e9migr\u00e9 population numbers roughly 500,000, or about a tenth of the country\u2019s overall population, government officials said.The Costa Rican government has been applauded \u2014 by international migration officials and other advocates, and by migrants and refugees themselves \u2014 for its handling of the migration crisis, even if its migration bureaucracy is threatening to collapse under the strain.This year, more than 24,000 Nicaraguans have formally expressed a desire to apply for asylum in Costa Rica, a sharp increase over last year, when about 6,300 people from all nations sought asylum.The backlog is such that new appointments for asylum interviews are being scheduled for next spring, and the Alvarado Quesada administration has appealed to the international community for help. United Nations agencies have agreed to provide additional office space and salaries for more migration officials to speed up the work.Administration officials and their allies worry that the longer the migration crisis persists, the greater the likelihood that Mr. Alvarado Quesada\u2019s opponents will use it as a wedge issue to turn public opinion against him and what he hopes to accomplish.\u201cIt could complicate the work of the president,\u201d said Victor Barrantes, Costa Rica\u2019s vice minister of the interior.Already, some local politicians representing border precincts have raised the specter of an influx of Nicaraguan criminals to demand more police officers and greater financial assistance from the federal government, officials said.The Alvarado Quesada administration responded by assuring the country that it was taking adequate security measures, including developing a plan to toughen border vigilance.But some officials also acknowledge that the border police are overwhelmed, that the border is highly porous and that there is little to stop Nicaraguans \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 from entering the country unchecked.On a recent morning, the ease of illegal passage across the border was evident here in the settlement of Pe\u00f1as Blancas, in the extreme northwest of Costa Rica. Hour after hour, a steady stream of people made their way through a mixture of forests and savanna on the Nicaraguan side, through various breaks in a low, flimsy fence line that marked the border, across scraggly lots behind homes and businesses on the Costa Rican side, finally emerging at the main road \u2014 within several hundred yards of the official crossing.Their journey was unimpeded by the authorities on either side of the border.Most Nicaraguans who have crossed into Costa Rica since the spring have moved in with relatives or friends.Others have ended up in de facto shelters set up in cheap hotels, some in San Jos\u00e9\u2019s red light district, their rooms paid for by religious groups and other community-based organizations. And still others have slept in parks and on the street, or have been taken in by private citizens.Nicaraguan leaders of the street protests, who are among the most wanted by the Ortega administration, have sought sanctuary in safe houses. They fear that the Nicaraguan government has sent spies to Costa Rica to hunt down protesters in exile.\u201cNobody wants to be here,\u201d said Alejandro Bravo, an opposition leader from the Nicaraguan town of Masaya, a resistance stronghold, who is seeking asylum in Costa Rica along with scores of comrades.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I want to stay alive.\u201dThe nuns at Casa de Maria Auxiliadora, a church in San Jos\u00e9 that has been providing meals and social services to Nicaraguan migrants, said they had had to kick out patrons they suspected of being \u201cinfiltrators\u201d working on behalf of the Ortega administration.Some of the greatest outpouring of generosity has come from long-established Nicaraguan residents in Costa Rica who, during earlier waves of migration, found themselves in similar straits.Johana Francisca Jim\u00e9nez Lumbi, a community activist in Upala, a small city near the Nicaraguan border, said she suffered a lot of discrimination when she migrated to Costa Rica two decades ago.\u201cI don\u2019t want to have happen to them what happened to me,\u201d she said.She has tapped her network of neighbors and friends to find temporary housing and support for newly arrived Nicaraguans.In recent months, thousands of newcomers have ended up in La Carpio, a poor, densely populated neighborhood in the capital with many Nicaraguans.Alicia Avil\u00e9s Avil\u00e9s, a civic leader in the neighborhood, fled to Costa Rica from Nicaragua in the 1990s amid government persecution for her participation in a teachers\u2019 strike. But she said she worried that the sudden influx of newcomers would overtax the scarce public utilities in La Carpio.The stress is already being felt at the neighborhood\u2019s public school, where about 430 Nicaraguan children have enrolled since February, more than a quarter of them in August alone, and class sizes have grown by about a third.For now, she said, the neighborhood can handle it.But, Ms. Avil\u00e9s wondered, what would happen if this crisis persisted for many more months? Would household sizes double, or even triple? Would residents lose patience and start kicking their relatives out on the street? Would the long-term unemployed turn to crime?\u201cHuman survival would become more demanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThis could be a hard explosion.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "H.I.V. Drugs Cost $75 in Africa, $39,000 in the U.S. Does It Matter? ", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesIn the United States, pharmaceutical companies have built a system which supports high costs for H.I.V. drugs. But that may be starting to change.First of two articlesThe high cost of drugs contributes to this failure. Our big problem in America is that too many people with H.I.V. don\u2019t know they have it. Drugs can\u2019t solve that. It requires humans \u2014 to find people, win their trust, bring them into the health care system and help them deal with other issues (such as substance abuse) so they can handle getting tested. \u201cWe have a trade-off,\u201d said Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner for disease control in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. \u201cNew York City and New York State are a bit of a wonderland \u2014 we\u2019re resourced very well compared to other places. But even we have limits to what we can do \u2014 because of spending on drugs.\u201d\u201cWhenever I hear that, I pretty much have a seizure,\u201d said Dr. Daskalakis. \u201cThat we are going to be able to scale up all over the world is amazing. But in the meanwhile, people in the U.S. have problems staying on medicines because of our crazy system.\u201dThe crazy system exists because until very recently, there has been virtually no price competition in H.I.V. drugs. But we are seeing the first attempts to control the galloping cost of treating H.I.V.UnitedHealthcare, one of the biggest insurance companies in America, is experimenting with a different way to control costs. Beginning this fall, it will encourage patients it covers to choose a less expensive H.I.V. therapy. In its My ScriptRewards program, patients who choose the cheaper H.I.V. regimen will have no co-pay or co-insurance costs, and can get $500 in gift cards to use for other health care expenses.Why now? \u201cThere are new options in the market,\u201d according to Lida Etemad, who is vice president for pharmacy management services at UnitedHealthcare. \u201cThere are recommended regimes at a lower cost than we\u2019ve seen.\u201dShe\u2019s talking about new drugs from Mylan \u2014 the generic manufacturer that achieved infamy for the $600 EpiPen in 2016. Mylan is the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of generic H.I.V. drugs. This year the company brought out three new H.I.V. medicines in the United States, with prices pegged at 40 percent below the equivalent brand-name drugs.Mylan also makes three-drug combos, Symfi (equivalent to Atripla, which costs $32,000) and lower-dose Symfi Lo. At 40 percent less, the two Symfi combinations cost $19,200.\u201cLower cost\u201d is relative \u2014 obviously, these prices are pretty far from $75. But generic competition slashes prices only when there are many competitors. The usual price drop with the first generic is small \u2014 15 percent or less. (The Mylan drugs are not technically generics, because they are new single-pill combinations of existing generic drugs, not exact copies of existing drugs.)The United States spends about $20 billion a year on H.I.V. drugs. Anil Soni, the head of global infectious diseases for Mylan, said that if generics and lower-cost H.I.V. medicines \u2014 made by Mylan and other companies \u2014 were incorporated into treatment regimens, America could save between $3 billion and $5 billion, with about $1 billion of that savings accruing to Medicare and Medicaid.Mr. Soni has experience in public health unusual for a drug company executive. He was the chief of staff to the first leader of the Global Fund and later chief executive of the Clinton Health Access Initiative. At Mylan, he negotiated the agreement to supply the $75 therapy in low-income countries.Someone might say: Let\u2019s prescribe both generics and we\u2019ll save $18,000 off the cost of Truvada!The same is true for Mylan\u2019s three-drug combos. The cost of the three generic drugs in Symfi and Symfi Lo is $12,000. Prescribing those individual drugs instead of Atripla would mean taking three pills instead of one \u2014 and saving $20,000.No one has.Pharmaceutical companies have built a system in which no one in a position to limit costs wants to do so.The federal panel on antiretroviral guidelines now does include references to drug costs, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a guidelines panel member. \u201cBut the first-line regimens recommended still favor the absolute best \u2014 and often most expensive \u2014 drugs available. It\u2019s \u2018if this were my dad, what would I want him to have?\u2019\u201d she said.Insurers should care about price. But it\u2019s hard for them to refuse to cover a recommended drug, and they can pass their costs along in the form of higher premiums.Taxpayers should care about price; after all, health care represents 18 percent of the national economy. But the industry has proved too powerful.Drugmakers have designed a system in which parties that would otherwise campaign for cheaper drugs actually have an interest in high prices. For example, clinics that serve H.I.V. patients also, perversely, benefit from high prices. Their pharmacies can buy drugs at Medicaid prices. But if a patient has commercial insurance, they can bill the insurer at commercial prices.Most important are the distorted incentives for patients. Super-organized, savvy patient groups all over the world banded together to make H.I.V. medicines affordable in poor countries.But in the United States, virtually no one on antiretrovirals has to pay for them. For those without private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, the Ryan White AIDS Drug Assistance Program steps in. No other disease has such a program.If patients have high out-of-pocket costs, such as co-pays and co-insurances, makers of brand-name H.I.V. drugs help patients. (Mylan is doing this, too, with its new drugs.) It\u2019s smart business \u2014 small payments that increase sales of very expensive drugs.Generic medicines don\u2019t normally come with co-pay assistance. So patients could end up paying more out of pocket for a $1,000 generic than for a $30,000 brand-name drug. Along with the inconvenience of multiple-pill regimens, this is a big reason generics aren\u2019t much used.Mr. Horn believes things are changing. \u201cCost considerations are becoming considerable factors in H.I.V. care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s high time. We\u2019re on the cusp of something.\u201dThat something, however, carries perils, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a complex patchwork in place. We want to make sure everybody continues to have access to prescription drugs and services.\u201dNext week: I\u2019ll report on how some places have been able to keep H.I.V. drug costs in check while doing right by patients.

{"Headline": "The Credit Crunch and the Great Recession (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBen Bernanke argues that it was mainly about finance. I have (friendly) questions.Opinion ColumnistOK, this is weird. There\u2019s an economic dispute underway about the causes of the Great Recession \u2014 but that\u2019s not what\u2019s weird. What\u2019s so strange in these days and times is that it is being carried out among well-informed people who actually look at data and argue in good faith. Hey, guys, don\u2019t you know that sort of thing went out a couple of decades ago?This isn\u2019t quite a head-on debate, since Bernanke is mainly focused on the first year or so after Lehman, while both Baker and I are more focused on the multiyear depressed economy that lasted long after the financial disruption ended. (Bernanke\u2019s measures show the same spike and fast recovery as other stress indexes.) But there\u2019s still a clear difference.Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be at the Brookings panel where Bernanke\u2019s paper is discussed. But maybe I can raise the big question I have about his conclusions.What Bernanke does is, as I see it, a kind of reduced-form analysis, identifying factors in the credit markets and using time series to estimate their impact on output. What Baker does, and I largely follow, is more of an accounting-based structural analysis: look at the components of aggregate demand, and ask what their behavior seems to imply about causes. In principle, these approaches should be consistent.My problem with Bernanke\u2019s paper, on a first read, is that I don\u2019t quite see how that consistency can work. Specifically, I have trouble seeing the \u201ctransmission mechanism\u201d \u2014 the way in which the financial shock is supposed to have affected actual spending to the extent necessary to justify a finance-first account of the slump.Let me focus specifically on investment, which is what you\u2019d expect a credit crunch to depress \u2014 and which did indeed plunge in the Great Recession. First, there was the housing bust, which led to a huge decline in residential investment, directly subtracting around 4 points from GDP:So can we attribute this decline to credit conditions? If so, why did residential investment remain depressed five years after credit markets normalized?Meanwhile, there was also a sharp decline in nonresidential, i.e., business investment:But this decline was only about the same size as the decline in the early 2000s slump \u2014 which, admittedly, was partly because of the collapse in telecom spending, but still. And it seems pretty easy to explain simply by the accelerator effect: business investment always plunges when the economy is shrinking, which it was doing mainly because of the housing bust.So when I look at these two key drivers of the Great Recession and subsequent depressed period, I don\u2019t see an obvious role for financial disruption. Bernanke\u2019s VARs tell a different story; but I generally don\u2019t trust VARs unless I can relate them to phenomena we see from other perspectives.Could Bernanke be right while Baker and I are wrong? Of course. But I really, really want to see the transmission mechanism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quebec Election Looms but a Traditional Issue Doesn\u2019t: Independence", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONTREAL \u2014 Rosalie Pelchat is typical of the younger generation of Quebecers here. She switches effortlessly from French to English. She spends hours each day surfing Facebook or watching Netflix in the language of Shakespeare.And, like many of her generation, she is uninterested in fighting for an independent Quebec.\u201cWe don\u2019t feel the same insecurity about language as our parents\u2019 generation did,\u201d Ms. Pelchat, a 17-year-old science student, said in the cafeteria at Coll\u00e8ge de Maisonneuve, a Francophone college. \u201cWe are better off economically in Canada and open to the world. Talk of independence is a total turnoff.\u201dAs Quebecers prepare to go to the polls on Oct. 1 in provincial elections, the polarizing issue of whether the province should secede from Canada has been sidelined for the first time in decades. It underscores how the culture wars of the past have shifted in this Francophone province where language and culture are deeply bound up with identity.Instead of focusing on Quebec\u2019s independence, the campaign has been dominated by talk of education, health care and, especially, immigration. The center-right party is trying to appeal to Quebecers by proposing that the province\u2019s autonomy be preserved by limiting immigration and imposing a \u201cvalues test\u201d and a \u201cFrench language test\u201d on newcomers.Even the nationalist, independence-seeking Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has vowed that it would not hold a referendum on independence until after 2022, a tacit acknowledgment that the subject, at least for now, is not a vote winner.For the younger generation, aspirations of becoming a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Bill Gates appear to have pushed the constitutional preoccupations of the past to the background.In a more than two-hour debate among party leaders this month, the independence issue barely registered while the leaders clashed over Mr. Legault\u2019s proposals to expel immigrants who fail to pass a French language test after three years in the province.\u201cIf you look at what is happening in Spain, we see powers being stripped away from Catalonia, whereas in Quebec, the province has mastered more and more areas of decision-making,\u201d Mr. Cardinal said. \u201cThe fight for independence is no longer seen as worth fighting for.\u201dIt is hard to overstate how far attitudes in Quebec have changed.The province was ceded to Britain in the 18th century, but Francophones can trace their roots to 17th-century French settlers who sailed up the St. Lawrence River. During the heady years of the 1970s and early 1980s, Quebec was bubbling with agitation for independence. In those years, Francophones who spoke French in public could still be heckled with \u201cSpeak white!\u201d or English.But the balance of power gradually shifted after the governing Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois passed Bill 101 in 1977, a measure requiring that French be the language of government, the courts and commerce. Fearful that the country could be ripped apart, dozens of companies, including the Bank of Montreal, moved their headquarters to Toronto.The first referendum on whether Quebec should secede from Canada was in 1980; the \u201cno\u201d side won by nearly 20 percentage points. Then, in 1995, Quebecers voted by a tiny majority, 50.58 percent, to remain in Canada.By that time, Bill 101 had been in force for nearly 20 years. Though the law may have unnerved many investors, it engendered feelings of cultural confidence, Mr. L\u00e9ger said, making many Quebecers feel more secure living in English-majority Canada.Still, however much the issue has faded from the debate, secession is supported by a vocal minority.If an independent Quebec was able to keep the nearly $60 billion in taxes it sent each year to the federal government, he contended, Quebecers would, on the whole, be better off.\u201cCanada has far more cultural similarities with the United States than Quebec has with Canada,\u201d he said in fluent English. \u201cBut Canada wouldn\u2019t want to merge with the U.S. and have the U.S. decide its destiny. In the same manner, we don\u2019t want Quebec to be subordinate to Canada.\u201d\u201cLook at NAFTA negotiations: We have to beg Justin Trudeau, who\u2019s in thrall to big business, to keep Quebec\u2019s interests in mind on agriculture and environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could better safeguard Quebec\u2019s interests if we were independent and had our own seat at the table.\u201dBut even those seeking independence acknowledge that independence-seekers are faltering.M\u00e9lissa G\u00e9linas, 32, a postdoctoral student in Indigenous studies at Montreal\u2019s Concordia University, studied in Britain and Toronto, loves Margaret Atwood and prides herself on speaking excellent English. She also dreams of an independent Quebec.\u201cWe are a nation of Francophones in North America that can function quite well on its own,\u201d she explained before quickly adding: \u201cRealistically, I don\u2019t think it will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If they succeed, it will be a result of an unlikely alliance as they seek common ground amid the rockiest relations between the United States and Canada in decades.\u201cBob and I joke sometimes that we could switch chairs, we know each other\u2019s positions so well,\u201d Ms. Freeland said this month in between meetings with Mr. Lighthizer.Ms. Freeland, who has spent the past several weeks commuting between Canada and Washington, arrived here on Wednesday in a T-shirt that read \u201cKeep Calm and Negotiate Nafta.\u201d As has become the norm, she departed on Thursday night with no deal in hand. After two long days of talks with Mr. Lighthizer, Ms. Freeland said that they were working through \u201ctough issues\u201d and maintained that striking a fair deal for Canada, not an end-of-the-month deadline, was the driving force behind the discussions.But negotiations, tense from the start, have become increasingly strained, with both sides fighting to win concessions and to protect themselves from the appearance of caving politically.To the chagrin of Canadians, Mr. Trump has publicly \u2014 and at times gleefully \u2014 berated their country over its treatment of the United States, particularly its dairy farmers, and rebuked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d after the Group of 7 summit meeting in June. He has slapped steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, claiming their metal imports threaten the United States\u2019 national security.Mr. Trudeau has openly questioned whether Mr. Trump\u2019s promises are to be believed while Ms. Freeland has angered administration officials by giving speeches lamenting the decline of Democratic values in the West \u2014 a thinly veiled barb at Mr. Trump \u2014 and courting free-trade lawmakers on Capitol Hill.After being promoted to foreign minister last year, Ms. Freeland gave a high-profile speech in Parliament playing up Canada\u2019s prominent role internationally in upholding human rights, multilateralism, democracy and free trade. Ms. Freeland suggested Canada was needed to fill the breach as the United States retreated from its role in world leadership. She echoed that theme again during a June speech in Washington, warning, \u201cIf history tells us one thing, it is that no one nation\u2019s pre-eminence is eternal.\u201dMs. Freeland told reporters that she gave a version of her speech to Mr. Lighthizer, though she did not characterize his response. Administration officials, who had already begun to sour on Ms. Freeland for her courtship of free-trade oriented members of Congress, were taken aback by what was seen as a direct attack on the president, according to people familiar with the matter.Ms. Freeland recently received a standing ovation in Canada for her stance, yet opponents called the speech politically na\u00efve, aimed at scoring points domestically when the country\u2019s economy is on the line given the United States is its biggest trading partner. They also questioned the \u201cprogressive trade agenda\u201d she presented at the outset of the Nafta negotiations, declaring that Canada would be looking for new chapters on women and indigenous rights as well as climate change.\u201cThat was not a smart move. We\u2019d already seen the president withdraw from the Paris climate change accord and the TPP,\u201d said Erin O\u2019Toole, a Conservative foreign affairs critic in Canada, referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cDid we really think he\u2019d bake in carbon pricing into Nafta?\u201dDiscussions between Ms. Freeland and Mr. Lighthizer have been described by those in meetings with them as cordial, yet punctuated with disagreements over Canada\u2019s dairy protections, a Nafta dispute mechanism and Canadian intellectual property.Their negotiating styles differ markedly, those people also say. Mr. Lighthizer, who comes to meetings steeped with a historical understanding of how Canada\u2019s trade barriers came into existence, is blunt, delivering statements with a gravelly voice. Ms. Freeland asks probing questions and lays out her country\u2019s positions with a friendly Canadian lilt.Ms. Freeland is also Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s polar opposite in public. Chatty and outspoken, Ms. Freeland holds numerous briefings with reporters waiting outside the offices of the United States trade representative each day. One morning this month, she handed out Popsicles to the news media. Mr. Lighthizer usually takes the opposite approach, dashing briskly between the offices and the White House, gaze averted.\u201cActually I do enjoy hot weather,\u201d he said outside his office, in a rare demonstration of small talk.Those who have known Mr. Lighthizer for decades say he prefers to do his work behind the scenes.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s seeking press or looking for some larger opportunity \u2014 his job is to do what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said William E. Brock, who was the United States trade representative under President Ronald Reagan.\u201cI think he probably feels that he can get more done by just working on the task,\u201d said Mr. Brock, a former Republican senator of Tennessee.Ms. Freeland, by contrast, has become a popular public figure in Canada. She is known for bicycling to events and slipping into bathrooms to change out of her cycling gear before taking the podium. Together with her husband, Graham Bowley, a New York Times reporter, she juggles three children with help from a rotation of aunts and is known to have meetings at her house that turn into working dinners.\u201cShe\u2019s super comfortable in her own skin and very genuine always,\u201d says Lawrence Summers, President Barack Obama\u2019s top economic adviser, who was a professor of Ms. Freeland\u2019s at Harvard and has kept in touch ever since.He added, \u201cThe way she is so diametrically opposite to the cultural characteristics of the current U.S. leadership makes her a very strong voice of the international community at the moment.\u201dMs. Freeland, 50, grew up in northern Alberta on a canola farm and in a feminist, Ukrainian housing cooperative.She entered Canadian politics with no experience in brokering international trade deals. The revised version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Canada signed onto was based on negotiations that took place under the previous Conservative government.But Ms. Freeland is credited with salvaging a trade pact with the European Union, which took years to negotiate. In 2016, Ms. Freeland, visibly frustrated, walked out of last-minute talks after a regional parliament in Belgium objected to some of the terms under discussion. Her departure helped galvanize Europe, which relented, and the deal was signed shortly afterward.Mr. Lighthizer, 70, has a far longer history in cutting trade deals. In the 1970s, he worked on trade and tax issues as the chief of staff to Senator Bob Dole on the Finance Committee and later went on to become the deputy trade representative under President Reagan. There he focused on agricultural and industrial issues and in the execution of bilateral trade deals \u2014 an experience that has served him well under Mr. Trump.When he left government, Mr. Lighthizer put his legal expertise to work defending companies in the steel industry, which had been decimated by globalization and the offshoring of manufacturing. He filed lawsuits on behalf of corporations like United States Steel that sought government protection in the face of an onslaught of competition from abroad.During his confirmation hearing in 2017, Mr. Lighthizer said that he subscribed to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade policy.Mr. De Arment said that Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s quiet public persona belies a wry sense of humor and of adventure. In the 1980s, Mr. Lighthizer drove a Ferrari and Porsche, which he would occasionally race. A fitness buff with a gym in the basement of his 200-year-old Georgetown townhouse, he is also known to play pranks on the golf course, drawing laughs by stealthily filling his partner\u2019s bags with golf balls so they suddenly cannot reach their clubs.\u201cWhen he goes into a meeting, nobody is going to know it better than him,\u201d Jim Lighthizer said of his younger brother. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get outprepared.\u201dJim Lighthizer said that his brother has found a rare kindred trade spirit in Mr. Trump, one who has empowered the trade representative to make the kinds of changes to the balance of international commerce that he always dreamed of. After decades as a Republican \u201cvoice in the wilderness,\u201d he has now embraced his role as a blunt-talking \u201cbulldog\u201d who is empowered to carry out the president\u2019s goals of pressuring countries to lower their trade barriers.Although Mr. Lighthizer does not traffic in the bombast of his boss, he is well schooled in the art of the deal. In the 1980s, during a deadlock in negotiations with Russia over wheat policy, he presented his counterparts with a tally of the costs of traveling to and from Moscow and told them that if a deal could not be reached, he would not return. At that point, they came to terms.That approach could come into play as the United States and Canada struggle to hash out their remaining differences.\u201cIn negotiations, you\u2019ve got to be willing to pull the trigger and blow it up,\u201d said Jim Lighthizer, a former Democrat in the Maryland State Legislature, who communicates almost daily with his brother. \u201cIf he tells you he\u2019s going to do something, expect it to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "She Dropped Out of High School. Now She\u2019s President of the San Francisco Fed.", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has installed Mary C. Daly, a labor economist who currently serves as the head of research, as the institution\u2019s new president beginning Oct. 1.Ms. Daly, 55, will succeed John C. Williams, who became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York this year.She is a widely respected expert on labor markets with an unusual breadth of personal experience. Ms. Daly dropped out of high school at the age of 15, working in a doughnut shop and at Target before a friend persuaded her to earn a general education diploma. She worked her way through college at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, then earned a doctorate from Syracuse University before joining the Fed in 1996.As president of the San Francisco Fed, she will immediately become a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which decides monetary policy, including whether to raise or lower interest rates. She will vote in November and December as part of a regular rotation of Fed presidents. After that, she will not vote again until 2021.Ms. Daly will also serve as chief executive of an institution with hundreds of employees, including economic researchers and bank regulators. The San Francisco Fed oversees a sprawling territory encompassing much of the Western United States, with branch offices in Los Angeles, Portland, Salt Lake City and Seattle.Tim Duy, an economist at the University of Oregon, said that Ms. Daly\u2019s expertise in the economics of labor markets was a good fit for the challenges confronting the Fed, which is struggling to figure out how much slack remains in the labor market and why wage growth remains so weak.\u201cShe is an excellent pick for the position,\u201d Mr. Duy said. \u201cHer empirical focus is especially important for the kind of applied policymaking that is the Fed\u2019s responsibility.\u201dIn a statement issued by the San Francisco Fed, Ms. Daly described herself as \u201ctruly honored.\u201d\u201cI believe very strongly in the Federal Reserve\u2019s mission and in the important role we play in helping to create strong, stable economic conditions in all corners of the country that allow individuals and businesses to prosper,\u201d she said.Ms. Daly will not be directly involved in overseeing Wells Fargo, the largest bank in the San Francisco region. While the bank\u2019s regulators are on the San Francisco Fed\u2019s payroll, regulation of large banks is under the supervision of the Fed\u2019s board of governors in Washington.Ms. Daly joined the San Francisco Fed in 1996, and rose through the ranks of its research department.\u201cJust by interacting with her, answering questions, thinking about issues the way she did, I learned to do macroeconomics and labor economics simultaneously,\u201d Ms. Daly said.Ms. Yellen, for her part, said she was delighted by Ms. Daly\u2019s appointment.\u201cMary is an outstanding economist whose research illuminates the operation of labor markets and the impacts of the Great Recession,\u201d Ms. Yellen said.The San Francisco Fed named Ms. Daly as head of research in December 2016. After Mr. Williams left for the New York Fed earlier this year, she was widely championed as a top candidate to succeed him.\u201cMary is one of our nation\u2019s leading authorities on labor market dynamics,\u201d said Alexander R. Mehran, a developer in California who led the San Francisco Fed\u2019s search committee. \u201cHer research in this area reflects her deep commitment to understanding the impacts of monetary and fiscal policy on communities and businesses at a local, regional and national level.\u201dFollow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Michigan, Female Candidates Target a Key Trump Bloc: Union Voters", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONROE, Mich. \u2014 It\u2019s not the smokestacks that mark this part of southeast Michigan as a labor stronghold, or even the boxy union halls.To Michelle LaVoy, a city treasurer running for the State Legislature, it\u2019s the way people say \u201cunion\u201d as shorthand for \u201cdecent job.\u201dMs. LaVoy, strait-laced in affect and business casual in dress, doesn\u2019t present as a working-class hero. But she is trying, hard, and her pitch has a distinctly Norma Rae vibe.\u201cWe should be getting our fair share,\u201d Ms. LaVoy told Ms. Ricci, echoing a refrain that many Americans are using this election year. She wants more money for roads. More money for unions. More money in workers\u2019 paychecks.The area proved to be the leading edge of a historic labor defection from Democrats that played out across Michigan and several other Midwestern states where unions have long enjoyed outsize influence. Just over one out of every two voters from union households supported Hillary Clinton in Michigan, down from nearly three out of four who backed the Democratic candidate for governor (who lost as well) in 2014.Ms. LaVoy and other Michigan Democrats, like the party\u2019s nominee for governor, Gretchen Whitmer, are determined to recapture union voters in 2018, and in so doing show national Democrats how to retake the state\u2019s critical electoral votes in 2020. For unions, the fall election provides a test of political strength after years of decline, and of the power of economic issues to drive their members\u2019 votes.Union leaders say Mrs. Clinton was a flawed champion in part because voters viewed her as a symbol of the status quo, while Mr. Trump exploited her vulnerabilities by swiping their economic message. \u201cHe came in and seduced a lot of people,\u201d said Ron Bieber, president of the state\u2019s labor federation.Michigan Democrats are now on the offensive on the economy, proposing hundreds of millions in spending on infrastructure: \u201cFix the damn roads!\u201d thunders Ms. Whitmer. They rail against new taxes on pensions and vow to stand up to scofflaw corporations. They insist, \u00e0 la Mr. Trump, that the state can once again produce good blue-collar jobs.Mr. Trump also exploited cultural divisions against Mrs. Clinton, and Michigan Democrats are mindful of that. Ms. LaVoy introduces herself as a \u201cMonroe Democrat,\u201d by which she means a god-fearing, gun-wielding moderate who distrusts trade deals and companies that ship jobs overseas.Even before many Monroe Democrats abandoned Mrs. Clinton \u2014 be it over policy, trust, gender or other reasons \u2014 they had a conflicted relationship with President Obama, who carried the county by a single point in 2012. While Mr. Obama is largely credited in the Midwest for saving the auto industry, Monroe\u2019s Ford plant shut down just before his presidency and the county didn\u2019t fully share in the industry\u2019s recovery. Privately, some Democrats in the area also hinted at Mr. Obama\u2019s race as a factor in their disillusionment.As for Republicans, they argue that Democrats are alienating culturally conservative voters as the party drifts leftward in the Trump era \u2014 and that Ms. Whitmer and others will pay a price.\u201cI don\u2019t think the average person knows how liberal Gretchen is,\u201d said Randy Richardville, a former Republican senate majority leader from Monroe, who did battle with Ms. Whitmer during her days in the legislature. \u201c I don\u2019t think it will be a cakewalk for her at all.\u201dStill, these Monroe voters say they are amenable to politicians who appreciate the union way of life and genuinely seem to want to protect it.\u201cI\u2019m union all the way,\u201d said Darryl Sims, a United Automobile Workers member from Monroe County who retired last year as a forklift driver at Detroit Diesel. \u201cI\u2019m very appreciative when I walk out every month and my pension is in the mail.Mr. Sims has a favorable view of Mr. Trump, citing the president\u2019s approach to trade and \u201chis philosophy that we should take care of our own people.\u201d His wife, Michele, a teacher, believes the president has done a good job as well.But they are quick to distinguish between Mr. Trump and Michigan Republicans like the outgoing governor, Rick Snyder, whom they criticize for deciding to tax their pensions and enacting right-to-work legislation, allowing workers to benefit from unions without paying dues or fees.\u201cThey swore up and down they wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Mr. Sims said.A voter outreach project last fall by the Service Employees International Union, which canvassed thousands of pro-union white working class voters in Michigan and Wisconsin, showed that voters like Mr. Sims are very much in play. The top issues, even among many who vote Republican, were good-paying jobs and expanded access to health care.Unions in the state are trying to seize this opportunity by increasing field workers, volunteers and campaign spending \u2014 in some cases, even at greater levels than during the last presidential race.\u201cIn 2016 I think I had two people working with me on politics,\u201d said Lisa Canada, the political and legislative director for the state carpenters union, referring to paid staffers. \u201cWe have 20 this year.\u201dThere is something different about the Democratic candidates and message aimed at union voters this time around. Call it populism with a female face.All four Democratic nominees for statewide office are women, as are three of the party\u2019s five nominees in competitive congressional races, and they are showing a knack for trying to increase the return on the labor investment in their races. Many of the candidates lighten their populist overtures with an empathy that often evades Mr. Trump \u2014 and, some Democrats say, evaded Mrs. Clinton, too.When Ms. LaVoy first introduced herself to Daniel Moran, a Trump-supporting union member, he told her to \u201cGet out.\u201d But 30 minutes later they were still talking about his son and the job he said he recently lost. The conversation ended with a hug.\u201cDid I come across harder than anyone you talked to today?\u201d Mr. Moran asked.\u201cInitially you were a little scary,\u201d Ms. LaVoy confessed.She has discussed spending billions on infrastructure and pointedly contrasts her proposals \u2014 which draw inspiration from the epic Mackinac suspension bridge \u2014 with the president\u2019s. \u201cAt a time when some people want to build walls,\u201d she says in her Grand Rapids lilt, \u201cwe in Michigan are going to get back to building bridges.\u201dOn Labor Day, Ms. Whitmer circulated energetically through Detroit\u2019s holiday cookouts, telling voters that November represented a \u201conce in a generation opportunity\u201d because the state had not \u201chad a pro-labor governor and a good economy in 25 years.\u201d\u201cIn the last election some of these people were just frustrated with the whole world, and voted for the person that looked least familiar,\u201d Ms. Whitmer said in an interview.Mrs. Clinton\u2019s connection to her husband\u2019s New Democrat administration may have fed a certain mistrust, but many Clinton skeptics appear willing to back other female candidates.\u201cWe got a lot of pushback on Hillary,\u201d said Bill Black, the political and legislative director for the Teamsters union in Michigan, which saw more than 40 percent of its members vote for President Trump, according to internal polling. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing that with Gretchen.\u201d\u201cI think she\u2019s resonated because she\u2019s invited labor to the table,\u201d said Jon Brown, a construction worker and member of a local laborer\u2019s union, citing Ms. Whitmer\u2019s infrastructure plan.Kevin Hertel, a Democratic state representative leading the party\u2019s campaign to retake the chamber, said that having credible female candidates dwell on practical economic concerns has the advantage of appealing to two types of swing voters: those in affluent areas like Oakland County and western Wayne County, where women are in open revolt against the president. And those in blue-collar areas like Monroe, one of the party\u2019s top takeover targets.Labor leaders, like Mary Kay Henry, the S.E.I.U. president, say that a message focused on jobs, wages and health care has a shot at motivating voters, including many union members, who didn\u2019t feel inspired to turn out for the last election.\u201cThe most urgent problems in Michigan in working-class communities \u2014 whether white, black or brown \u2014 felt completely ignored in 2016,\u201d Ms. Henry said. \u201cIt resulted in 10,000 votes left on the table just in Detroit.\u201dMichigan Republicans appear to sense that they\u2019re losing some economic arguments, even though the state\u2019s unemployment rate is low by historical standards. Earlier this month the Republican-controlled legislature passed bills phasing in a $12-per-hour minimum wage and requiring employers to provide paid sick leave, two labor priorities that would otherwise have appeared on the ballot this fall.\u201cThey are going to come back and gut it,\u201d predicted Mr. Hertel, adding that Democrats plan to make an issue out of such maneuvering. \u201cI think voters are extremely intelligent. They can see a political game for what it is.\u201dMs. LaVoy\u2019s district is in many respects a case study of the Trump phenomenon. In 2012, her husband, Bill, also a Democrat, won the seat by more than 20 points with backing from labor. He was re-elected by a similar margin.\u201cIt hit me,\u201d Mr. LaVoy said. \u201cWhy is the president here? Shouldn\u2019t he be in Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio? Anywhere but Michigan.\u201d He briefly thought about turning around and knocking on 100 doors, but discarded the idea. \u201cIf I\u2019m in trouble, I\u2019m going to be in big trouble,\u201d he concluded.He turned out to be in big trouble. His opponent, Joseph Bellino, rode the Trump wave to a comfortable eight-point win. After the election, Mr. LaVoy thought back to earlier in the year, when union voters would periodically ask what he thought of Mr. Trump. \u201cI said, \u2018You know, I don\u2019t even know. I want you to vote for me,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut they loved him.\u201d (Mr. LaVoy is attempting his comeback in a State Senate race.)In defending the seat this year, Mr. Bellino enjoys some of the same advantages that helped President Trump. He is a well-known local businessman who many voters see as independent from the G.O.P. Jacob Goins, a manager at a pizzeria, told Ms. LaVoy he voted for Mr. Bellino after chatting him up at the wine and liquor store that Mr. Bellino and his wife have owned for years. (\u201cMy blood kind of runs cold when I hear that,\u201d admitted Ms. LaVoy, bemoaning her opponent\u2019s prom king-like appeal.)Mr. Bellino also has a certain blunt-spoken authenticity.At a recent town-hall meeting on the opioid epidemic, which has hit Monroe County like a modern-day plague, Mr. Bellino talked openly about his own struggle with addiction. \u201cI was lucky to be a cocaine addict,\u201d he said. \u201cThe healing in my brain happened a little easier.\u201dIn a possible foreshadowing of a strategy that Democrats may deploy in 2020, the unions targeting Mr. Bellino hope to dampen his appeal by making him answer for the Republicans\u2019 agenda.Exhibit A is the controversial repeal of the state\u2019s prevailing wage law, which mandated that contractors pay union-level wages and benefits to construction workers on state projects. Republicans undid the law earlier this year despite intense lobbying from labor.Mr. Bellino voted against the repeal, but a text message from one of his Republican colleagues indicated that he had offered to support it until the last minute. The colleague said Mr. Bellino only changed his position after party leaders secured enough votes to pass the repeal and wanted him to cover his political flank at home. The carpenters union promptly withdrew an earlier endorsement. It has taken to circulating fliers of Mr. Bellino with a Pinocchio schnoz.Mr. Bellino waves off the controversy. \u201cI voted the way I told them I was going to,\u201d he said.But Ms. LaVoy is quick to invoke the un-endorsement, and the issue appears to have emotional currency in Monroe, where many voters make their living in the building and construction trades.William Bentley, a millwright and union member who assembles and maintains mechanical equipment at a steel mill, said he considers himself a conservative \u2014 \u201cmy daughter\u2019s name is Reagan, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d He voted for Mr. Trump, and says he is pleased that the president is \u201cputting us back to work.\u201dBut asked how he felt about Michigan Republicans, and Mr. Bentley became noticeably cool. He said that he liked the effort Mr. Snyder made to balance the budget, but took a dim view of right-to-work and the repeal of the prevailing wage law, both of which Republicans passed on the governor\u2019s watch.\u201cRick Snyder has done stuff against the unions,\u201d Mr. Bentley said. \u201cI\u2019m no longer with you. Now you\u2019re affecting my paycheck.\u201dNoam Scheiber reported from Monroe and Astead W. Herndon from Detroit.Advertisement"}

You\u2019re in a New York City that looks like today\u2019s New York but isn\u2019t. A winged \u201cStatue of Extra Liberty\u201d towers in the harbor. Humans rent themselves out in a turbocharged gig economy, while Muppet-like robots hustle chess games in the park. Tiny wheeled \u201cpoop bots\u201d trudge the sidewalks cleaning up dog waste. (The subways \u2014 well, the subways are still recognizably lousy.)On these retro-techno streets (basically, the future as imagined in 1980) we find Owen (Jonah Hill) and Annie (Emma Stone), two strangers who meet as subjects in a dodgy trial for psychiatric medication that promises to give its users\u2019 subconsciouses a deep cleaning by inducing dangerous, therapeutic dreams.Owen, the disdained younger son of a plutocrat family (they made their fortune in poop bots), is scraping by on temp jobs and haunted by hallucinations. The street-savvy Annie has gotten hooked on illicit samples from the drug trial that allow her to re-experience a defining trauma. He joins the experiment to earn cash; she joins to get a fix.The first episode mostly follows Owen\u2019s story, the weaker of the two. His humiliation by his family of entitled bros (with Gabriel Byrne as the pushy paterfamilias) plays like \u201cSuccession\u201d with extra psychosis. Mr. Hill is so subdued and mumble-mouthed he seems to be performing under local anesthesia.In Episode 2, Annie crashes the narrative, driven by guilt over the disintegration of her family and a generalized rage at the world. Ms. Stone plays her like she\u2019s packed with gunpowder. She blackmails her way into the trial, telling her unfortunate target that she\u2019s not crazy, \u201cI\u2019m just goal-oriented.\u201d In the lab, she and Owen are assigned honeycomb-like pods and set to the job of dreaming.The experiment is itself a family drama. Dr. James Mantleray (a wonderfully pompous Justin Theroux, in a Warhol moptop) has a long-simmering resentment of his mother, Greta (Sally Field), a best-selling pop-psych author, and he\u2019s channeled his issues into his anthropomorphized computer. The machine \u2014 revealingly named GRTA \u2014 inevitably glitches, threatening both science and subjects: My Mother, the HAL 9000.Based on a Norwegian series about the Walter Mitty delusions of a psychiatric patient, \u201cManiac\u201d was created by Patrick Somerville, a former writer for \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d You can catch echoes of that metaphysical drama\u2019s cosmic oddball moments here.But the real surprise is Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directs all 10 episodes and is known for shooting Season 1 of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d \u201cManiac\u201d is as playful and vibrant as that series was gothic and dark, lit in neon pink and electric blue, borrowing aesthetics from Japanese design and the \u201clate \u201970s electronic toys\u201d section of eBay.Much of the action takes place in Annie and Owen\u2019s shared dreams, where they must combat their personal demons, often with small-arms fire. Mr. Fukunaga jumps genres ably in these segments. One, involving the heist of a lemur, is like a Coen Brothers screwball caper; another is convincing \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d high fantasy. (Their computer-engineered phantasms are less like chaotic actual dreams and more like a sampler of the Netflix recommendations menu.)But for all its invention, \u201cManiac\u201d keeps the \u201cInception\u201d convolutions to a minimum, toggling intelligibly between the lab and the flights of fancy in Annie and Owen\u2019s heads.In dreamspace, he\u2019s freed of his meekness, she of her self-flagellation.

{"Headline": "Is Merkel to Blame for Brexit?", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHer mixed messages on labor mobility and refugees drove Britain away. Now she has a chance to fix things.Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit.HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 Angela Merkel is the chancellor of Germany, not the prime minister of Britain, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that she played a critical, if indirect, role in Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. If not for her decision not long before the vote to allow for uncontrolled mass immigration into the heart of Europe, the pro-Brexit forces might have lost. Remember that, like President Trump\u2019s election that same year, Brexit was dismissed as an impossibility, until it happened. But unlike in the United States, Europe has not done much in the way of asking what happened, and why.In late 2015, the Leave campaign started putting up placards which showed the exodus of refugees from Syria and other countries through the Balkans, and adorned them with slogans like \u201cBreaking Point\u201d and \u201cTake Back Control.\u201d With Ms. Merkel declaring an open-door policy, the message hit home for millions of worried Britons and Europeans. Not coincidentally, it was around this time that support for Brexit began to tick up.If members of the chancellor\u2019s government recognize her complicity, they don\u2019t show it. Ms. Merkel\u2019s diplomats in Berlin treat the looming farewell of the second-biggest economy in the European Union as if it were merely another tiresome bureaucratic process that needs to be handled according to the treaty rules. If they consider the bigger picture at all, it is to think of ways to scare off other union members from following Britain\u2019s lead.There is, in other words, a near total lack of strategic thinking in the face of the most severe blow the European Union has ever suffered. Britain is not just another member, something officials in Berlin tell themselves repeatedly. Its exit will remove a good part of the union\u2019s international clout. London is not just a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, it has significant military and diplomatic forces, as well as Europe\u2019s best intelligence service. And, as a frequent outlier on European Union debates, it was always an important dissenting voice at the table in Brussels. Strangely, while other member states listened (often grudgingly) to Britain while it sat at that table, they are paying no attention to the message being sent by its departure. Britain is leaving because too many of its people became unhappy with one of the union\u2019s governing principles, namely the free movement of workers. In a healthy, functioning organization, such a departure would lead the remaining members to revisit that principle. This is especially true if other member states have exempted themselves from that rule in the past.A bit of background: When the European Union took in 10 mostly central European states in 2004, the German government sought the right to restrict free movement of laborers for a period of up to seven years. Ms. Merkel, then the opposition leader, thought those restrictions did not go far enough to protect the German labor market against an feared influx of low-wage workers from Poland and the Czech Republic. The government should have installed an even \u201cbetter protection mechanism,\u201d Ms. Merkel insisted in spring 2005.Britain\u2019s prime minister at the time, Tony Blair, did nothing of this sort; he left his country\u2019s borders open to internal immigrants from every member state, old or new. As a result, over the next decade, around two million people from Central and Eastern Europe migrated to Britain. While they integrated well into the labor market, the influx strained public services like schools, health care and transport.In other words, Germany has no excuse not to lead a period of union-wide introspection into its own failure to keep Britain in the group, and whether the union should revisit its principles in light of that failure. The union is not just lacking in vision, its hardball approach to Brexit is likely to backfire. Has anyone in Berlin or Paris thought about the consequences of an economic downturn in Britain after a Brexit, or, much worse, after a \u201chard,\u201d no-deal Brexit that could entail a customs barrier across the English Channel? It does not take much imagination to realize on whom the Murdoch yellow press outlets (and not only them) will pin the blame for the downfall: stubborn, egoistic, Anglophobic Europeans.Given what is at stake, Brussels and Berlin are gambling with far too poor a hand. What, after all, is to be gained from a stumbling, humiliated, angry and alienated Britain?For those of us who still want to see a vibrant, unified Europe, our best hope for the moment is the faint chance for a second referendum on Brexit. If Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plan on how to leave does not find approval in Westminster, the question of whether to leave with no deal at all could be put to the British people: Look, is this really what you want?It is a remote possibility, yet it offers Ms. Merkel her own second chance \u2014 an opportunity to do everything she can to show British voters that the European Union is worth keeping. She could begin by endorsing limits \u2014 even slight ones \u2014 on the free internal movement of labor. Done right, it would send a signal that Brussels and Berlin are listening to voters, while doing minimal harm to Europe\u2019s labor markets.This would not hurt the principle of free movement as such. It would also be a move that the Germans themselves might find attractive, given that a new batch of countries \u2014 this time in the western Balkans \u2014 are lining up for membership. Whatever her answer, the choice is pretty clear for the European Union: reform, or face the next revolt.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Looking for a Backup Job?", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Giuseppe Conte, finding himself in a traditionally precarious job, sought to avoid putting all his eggs in one professional basket by pursuing a fallback position as a teacher in a Rome university.The twist: The basket in question is the Italian government. And Mr. Conte is its prime minister.The news this past week that Mr. Conte was continuing to pursue a contingency gig \u2014 despite having become prime minister of Europe\u2019s fourth largest economy \u2014 did not exactly inspire confidence in a populist and anti-establishment government that many here see as a grave threat to European Union. And Mr. Conte\u2019s back-to-school backup plan was only the latest episode in a bumpy few weeks for the governing coalition.On Thursday, Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star leader and the minister of labor and economic development, agreed to a deal to keep open what critics call an environmentally toxic steel plant \u2014 after spending years campaigning to close it.The Five Star Movement had talked about turning the factory into a park or a source of green energy. Instead, Mr. Di Maio signed essentially the exact deal brokered by his predecessors in the center-left government led by the Democratic Party to sell the ILVA steel plant in the Puglia region to an Indian billionaire who would keep the plant running.\u201cA great day for Italian industry and the south,\u201d his predecessor as economic development minister, Carlo Calenda, wrote on Twitter. Mr. Calenda added that for two years Mr. Di Maio and his party \u201chad it in for and promised to close\u201d the plant, but congratulated them for changing their minds.Also last week, a hacker broke into Five Star\u2019s most sacred web platform, Rousseau, once again raising questions about the security of a portal used by the political party for internal votes to decide on candidates and policies.And last week a Genoa court issued a ruling to freeze and confiscate the funds of the League, a party led by Italy\u2019s most powerful politician, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, as part of a corruption investigation.Prosecutors have been looking for state funds of 49 million euros, or about $57 million, provided to the party between 2008 and 2010, before Mr. Salvini took control, that have vanished from its coffers. The decision to approve the freezing of the League\u2019s accounts, which would prevent political expenditures and payroll operations, presents a significant threat to Mr. Salvini\u2019s party.Even critics of the League say the move would represent a remarkable intervention by the judiciary into the nation\u2019s politics.\u201cThis is a decision that can jeopardize the very existence of the League,\u201d said Sergio Fabbrini, a professor of political science and director of the school of government at Luiss university in Rome.Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, said in interview that he had told Mr. Salvini in a meeting on Friday that the investigations were a move by the political establishment to protect itself from the necessary upheaval Mr. Salvini promoted. Mr. Bannon said Mr. Salvini had agreed with him.But the interior minister may have a way to sidestep prosecutors looking for his party\u2019s missing funds: He could simply change the party\u2019s name.If the League folded and then regrouped under a different name \u2014 \u201cLeague for Salvini\u201d and \u201cItalians First\u201d have been batted about in the Italian press \u2014 it could avoid the court-ordered seizure of funds.For now, Mr. Salvini has said that he won\u2019t change the party\u2019s name, that he has hardly given any thought to the issue and that he is concentrating on his job.But Mr. Conte \u2014 the prime minister who many here believe is controlled by Mr. Salvini and Mr. Di Maio \u2014 has been focusing on career building of a different kind.In continuing to pursue the job at Sapienza, which he applied for before becoming prime minister, Mr. Conte drew criticism from political opponents and good governance advocates who suggested that he was breaking laws blocking top government officials from competing for positions at publicly funded institutions.Amid the backlash, Mr. Conte said in a news conference on Thursday night that he would skip the test and would consider taking his name out of the running. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that this new role forces me to reconsider,\u201d said Mr. Conte, who cited \u201cinstitutional engagements\u201d preventing his participation in Monday\u2019s exam.He added that \u201cas a jurist\u201d he did not see any conflict of interest issues, and said he found risible the idea that he would need to sit for an English exam despite having conducted top-level meetings in English \u2014 including, he said, \u201chaving spoken with Trump.\u201dThe government\u2019s political opponents found it laughable, too.Some former government officials suggested that Mr. Conte was already job hunting. Others noted that the prime minister was pursuing a prestigious job at a public university in the same week that Five Star had hired a former television personality \u2014 known for using hidden cameras to investigate officials on a satirical show \u2014 to root out corruption in the university system\u2019s appointment process.Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, at a party meeting, called Mr. Conte \u201ca part-time prime minister\u201d \u2014 and added that he was perhaps missing cabinet meetings because \u201che was busy studying for a legal English exam these days.\u201dEmma Johanningsmeier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Erdogan Changes His Tune, Seeking Support and Cooperation in Germany", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 A year ago, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey told Germans of Turkish origin not to vote for Chancellor Angela Merkel, branding her governing coalition \u201cenemies of Turkey.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Erdogan arrived in Berlin for a three-day state visit, complete with military honors, a state banquet and a lunch with Ms. Merkel.The rapprochement is striking and no coincidence: With Turkey suffering the aftershocks of its worst economic crisis in 15 years, Mr. Erdogan has radically changed tune and toned down his anti-Western rhetoric.\u201cWe want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany just like it used to be,\u201d he said earlier this week.For Germany, the aim of this week\u2019s state visit in Berlin, officials say, is to normalize prickly relations with an important NATO partner on Europe\u2019s southeastern flank. For Turkey, indirectly, one goal is to repair relations with the United States, which imposed sanctions this summer over the continued detention of an American pastor.But the visit has also underscored that, like him or not, Europe has to deal with Mr. Erdogan and the reality of a budding dictator on its border. Turkey\u2019s stability \u2014 both economic and geopolitical \u2014 remains a strategic priority for Germany and Europe.It is a tough pill, and the realities surrounding the divergent trajectories of the two leaders only make it harder to swallow.Fifteen years in power already, Mr. Erdogan, his country\u2019s economic troubles notwithstanding, is secure since his re-election in June to a newly expanded presidency that has given him sultan-like powers. Ms. Merkel, now in her 13th year as chancellor and increasingly weakened at home and abroad, is considered a lame duck.Absent a common understanding on democratic necessities, the relationship is increasingly transactional, even as the two nations remain intimately entwined, as Germany is home to about 3 million people with roots in Turkey.What Mr. Erdogan needs is economic buttressing, and what Ms. Merkel needs is for Turkey to remain economically stable and for the Turkish leader to continue to stem the tide of refugees and migrants that pass through his country from war-torn nations \u2014 be they Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan \u2014 an issue that has become the chancellor\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s economy is teetering. The Turkish lira has come under heavy pressure \u2014 losing nearly 40 percent of its value this year \u2014 amid high inflation and spiraling foreign debt. Turkish private sector debt amounts to more than $200 billion, and as the lira has fallen in value Turkish companies have struggled to meet payments.If he is not quite coming to Germany chastened, with cap in hand, Mr. Erdogan is certainly looking to reassure financial markets, improve business ties and seek political support.Exasperated with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s jibes, and detentions of German citizens and threats to a list of its businesses in Turkey, Germany last summer announced a policy change that curtailed European economic assistance to Turkey.Analysts say the policy has worked, though Turkish officials insist the mood has calmed because German and Turkish elections are now out of the way.\u201cThat\u2019s the language that Erdogan understands \u2014 but you have to be willing to speak it,\u201d said Cem Ozdemir, a prominent Turkish-German lawmaker and member of the Green Party who has been a vocal critic both of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian politics and Germany\u2019s longtime caution in countering it.As prime minister, Mr. Erdogan had visited Germany several times in recent years. But the three-day visit this week is his first full-blown state visit as president.The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial, had extended the invitation after Mr. Erdogan won elections in June, prompting a wave of criticism.Ms. Merkel will attempt to make the best of it, but she is conspicuously not attending the state dinner, even as the chancellery insists the snub is not a breach of protocol.Several German lawmakers have said they would boycott proceedings by not attending the banquet as well, and by taking part in protests instead.Bijan Djir-Sarai, the foreign policy speaker of the Free Democrats, said he could not dine with Mr. Erdogan \u201cwhile German citizens sit in Turkish prisons.\u201dThe visit comes after a recent confidence-building trip by the Turkish finance minister, Berat Albayrak \u2014 Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser \u2014 who sent the right messages about fiscal stability, raising interest rates and curbing expenditure.\u201cVery positive developments may happen soon and that will bring positive outcomes in the economy,\u201d Cemil Ertem, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s chief economic adviser, predicted of the German visits in the daily newspaper Milliyet on Tuesday.Turkish analysts, too, noted that there has been a sudden improvement in German-Turkish relations in the last two months, including the release of Germans imprisoned under Mr. Erdogan\u2019s crackdown against political opponents and critics.Germany\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Adebahr, said another German citizen had been released on Sept. 20, bringing the number of arrested Germans down to five.Turkey\u2019s relations with the United States have worsened over the detention of the American pastor Andrew Brunson and a dozen other Turkish-Americans and consular employees. President Trump announced sanctions against Turkey early this summer, precipitating the plunge of the lira.Though it has taken its own tough line against Turkey, Germany voiced support for Ankara, in part fearful of the effects of a teetering Turkish economy on Europe.Still, \u201cGermany will not and cannot bail out Turkey,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization.There is little chance of reinvigorating Turkey\u2019s accession process to European Union membership. That demands unanimity among European Union members and Turkey\u2019s backsliding on democratic standards has gone too far for European leaders to overlook it, he said.But Germany can offer political support at a critical time. \u201cTurkey seeks German support in fixing its relationship with the United States and fixing its economy,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.Both sides also have an interest in continuing, or reinforcing, an agreement under which Turkey has curbed the flow of refugees through Turkey into Europe. The arrival of more than one million migrants into Germany since 2015 continues to reverberate politically.Despite its differences with Turkey, Germany has no interest in seeing the Turkish economy slide. German companies have also suffered from the downturn in the Turkish economy and the fall of the lira.\u201cWe have no interest in the situation in Turkey escalating,\u201d said Mr. \u00d6zdemir, the Turkish-German lawmaker, who is attending the banquet with Mr. Erdogan, who, as he put it, would have to \u201csuffer him.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t always choose your guests,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Erdogans and Putins and Trumps of this world are a reality and we have to talk to them.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s important that we get more out of this visit than nice pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cErdogan wants money. We need to be clear what we want: democracy, human rights, press freedom and no interference into the German-Turkish community in Germany.\u201dChristopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Lives of the Wealthy Were Enriched Most After Lehman\u2019s Bust", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe impact of the easy money that followed Lehman Brothers\u2019 demise shows that inequality takes off when interest rates are maintained at artificially low levels.This is what happened in the U.K., where the Bank of England followed the Fed\u2019s playbook. A 2012 study by the bank found that quantitative easing had boosted household wealth by more than 600 billion pounds (around $775 billion), but that nearly two-thirds of these gains had gone to the richest 10 percent of households. Another study by S.&P. Capital IQ found that in the aftermath of the crisis the wealthiest decile of UK households had increased their share of financial assets at the expense of the poorest. As the former U.K. financial regulator Adair Turner wrote: \u201cquantitative easing has been good for the rich, and ultra-easy monetary policy thus exacerbates inequality.\u201d Few would disagree with this conclusion.American income inequality has been especially aggravated by the Fed\u2019s interest-rate policy. Most executive pay is linked to share-price performance. When easy money gooses the stock market, as it did in the years after the Lehman bust, corporate chieftains and their extended retinue receive an unearned windfall. Management has also used cheap debt to repurchase shares rather than invest in new plant and equipment, as the Fed intended. Since 2013, companies in the S.&P. 500 Index bought back approximately $2.4 trillion of stock, helping boost share prices, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s. The executive pay bonanza got even bigger.Easy money has particularly aided Wall Street as it recovered from the Lehman shock. The financial sector, including insurance and real estate, soon regained its position as a U.S. economic powerhouse, accounting for nearly a third of G.D.P. growth between 2010 to 2015, up from 14 percent between 1998 and 2008, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Bankers\u2019 bonuses returned with a vengeance \u2014 with the average payout rising to the highest level since 2006, New York state\u2019s comptroller estimates. These bonuses derive largely from fees levied on securities issuance, corporate-finance activity and on assets under management.U.S. corporate-debt levels doubled since 2008, says Goldman Sachs. M.&A. activity soared to a record $2.5 trillion in the first half of 2018, according to Thomson Reuters. AT&T\u2019s recent $85 billion takeover of Time Warner could generate up to $390 million in bank fees, Freeman & Co. has said. Investment-management fees also picked up as the stock market rebounded after 2009. Activists have pushed venerable companies from Procter & Gamble to Campbell Soup to engage in financial engineering to increase shareholder returns, and thereby justify their management fees.Life has been particularly sweet for the private-equity world. The current leveraged-buyout boom has been spurred by some of the cheapest financing in history. Private-equity firms even used low-cost debt to snap up repossessed properties after the housing bust. Blackstone\u2019s residential business, Invitation Homes, has become one of the country\u2019s largest landlords. The buyout barons have never had it so good. Over the past five years, Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman is estimated by The Wall Street Journal to have earned more than $3.2 billion in dividends and fund payouts.But consider how easy money has treated the not-so-privileged. The financial crisis hit them hard. As many as 10 million homes were repossessed, according to the St. Louis Fed. Since the middle classes have most of their wealth tied up in their houses, they experienced the greatest proportionate losses in the downturn. New York University economist Edward Wolff estimated that median wealth fell by 47 percent between 2007 and 2010. The surge in unemployment after the financial crisis and a weak jobs market in the subsequent years further contributed to income inequality.Nor did the poor benefit directly from the Fed\u2019s zero interest rates. In fact, interest charges for \u201csubprime\u201d households actually rose as banks tightened lending standards. Because the less well-off maintain a higher proportion of their liquid assets in cash, they have also suffered most from deposit rates being held below the level of inflation.Most workers own financial assets indirectly through their pensions or retirement plans. The decline in long-term rates has pushed up the value of pension liabilities, more than offsetting gains from investments. A pensions crisis, affecting both private and public pension plans, looms on both sides of the Atlantic. Ultralow rates have sounded the death knell for the defined-benefit pensions which enabled the postwar generations to enjoy a secure retirement.Commentators, from the Greek philosopher Aristotle to the French economist Thomas Piketty, have argued that high interest rates aggravate inequality. Yet the ultralow rates of recent years have made it harder for the \u201chave-nots\u201d to accumulate the resources to buy a home or build a nest egg. The \u201chaves\u201d have enjoyed soaring wealth gains. The chief beneficiaries of easy money have been those on Wall Street with access to cheap loans.Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, puts it this way: \u201cNever in the field of monetary policy was so much gained by so few at the expense of so many.\u201d And he\u2019s right.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The U.S. Stock Market Towers Over the Others. But at What Cost?", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesMuch of the world has recovered from the global financial crisis of a decade ago, but one market has prospered above virtually all others: the United States stock market.In addition to outpacing other major markets, the American market has outstripped the growth of the United States economy to such an extent that it is a global outlier. Whether the surge \u2014 which has helped fuel economic inequality in the United States \u2014 can continue, and what the domestic and global consequences might be, are unresolved questions.\u201cThere has been a disconnection between stock markets and economies around the world, with stock markets generally outperforming their economies,\u201d Professor Prasad, a former International Monetary Fund official, said in an interview. \u201cBut the United States stands out. There\u2019s a much greater degree of outperformance and disconnection from domestic economic growth. And you don\u2019t typically see a disconnect like this for such a long period.\u201dThe Brookings survey shows, for example, that while the two biggest emerging market economies \u2014 those of China and India \u2014 have grown far faster than America\u2019s in the past decade, those countries\u2019 stock markets have not fared as well as their American counterpart. India\u2019s stock gains were substantial in its local currency, the rupee, but were almost eliminated when translated into dollars. The Chinese stock market has actually lost value since the financial crisis.Since the end of 2007 through June of this year, the survey says, gross domestic product in the United States grew by 18 percent, after adjusting for inflation. \u201cThe U.S. leads the pack among major advanced economies,\u201d the report says, while noting that the American economy\u2019s growth trailed that of emerging market economies like those of China and India.In nominal terms, without the inflation adjustment, gross domestic product in the United States grew more: 38 percent. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index nearly doubled from December 2007 through August 2018, a better return than other major stock markets experienced.This trend \u2014 stock markets growing much faster than domestic economies \u2014 also appeared in advanced economies like those of Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, but it was much more extreme in the United States, the report says.The American stock market\u2019s outperformance can be explained by factors like the rising share of corporate profits in the domestic economy and by the sheer force of American financial power on a global scale, Professor Prasad said.Although the United States contributed mightily to the global financial crisis, it has been a source of financial stability for most of the last 10 years, attracting investments from around the world. The dollar has strengthened against most other currencies in that time, becoming, if anything, an even more central part of the world financial system, he added.What\u2019s more, the dollar\u2019s strength has magnified the outperformance of the American stock market when compared against markets in most other countries.India outpaced the United States in economic growth, and its stock market rose roughly 90 percent from December 2007 through last month, almost as much as the American stock market did, when both are tracked in their domestic currencies. But the Indian rupee lost ground against the dollar, and its weakness has wiped out most of the value of its stock market\u2019s gains: When converted into dollars, the Indian stock market rose only 6 percent.China is the rare country whose currency, the renminbi, actually has strengthened modestly against the dollar since the end of 2007. But that was not enough to offset the decline of the Shanghai stock market, which fell 48 percent in renminbi and 45 percent in dollar terms.The Chinese stock market, like the United States market, is an outlier, Professor Prasad said, but in a radically different dimension: The Chinese market has significantly trailed other markets as well as the Chinese economy.One reason is that the Chinese stock market, to an even greater degree than the United States stock market, represents only a small slice of the country\u2019s overall economy. Publicly listed Chinese corporations, Professor Prasad said, tend to suffer from endemic structural problems: high debt levels, poor accounting disclosure and weak governance. Until these problems are solved, China may be risky for global stock investors.The United States stock market, which has been a global magnet, is rife with its own anomalies. For one thing, Professor Prasad said, stock market growth has exceeded G.D.P. growth by so much and for so long that it bears close attention. \u201cOver long periods there is typically a close correlation between stock market growth and economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is already a long period.\u201dThat does not mean that the American stock market will necessarily fall soon. It is being supported by several macroeconomic factors, aside from cash inflows from foreigners. Corporate profits, supported in part by tax cuts and relaxed regulation and low interest rates, have been rising more rapidly than the G.D.P., while wage growth has been constrained.Because stock ownership is concentrated among richer people, the rising market wealth has exacerbated economic inequality in the United States. \u201cMost of the stock market wealth has been going to those who are already very rich rather than to the poor,\u201d Professor Prasad said. \u201cThe disconnect between the stock market and the real economy is manifest in the disconnect between corporate profits and real wages. It has potential sociopolitical implications.\u201dIn short, the American stock market could well keep rising for some time. But that might increase domestic political tensions, if increasing corporate and stock market riches are not accompanied by broad-based growth in wages.From a global perspective, the American stock market appears to be attracting capital that might otherwise bolster other markets and economies. The United States market is exceptional and it has enriched stock investors. But the decade of outperformance has incurred mounting costs.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Jerry Brown Can Seal His Legacy as a Climate Champion", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe governor should sign legislation that commits California to a 100 percent clean electricity grid by 2045.Mr. Gillis is a former New York Times environmental reporter and a contributing opinion writer.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This is a message, and a plea, for Gov. Jerry Brown of California. Please sign the bill.The measure, known as Senate Bill 100, passed the California Legislature last week. It commits the state to a 100 percent clean electricity grid by 2045. Rumors are swirling in Sacramento that the governor might veto that bill. His office has not said what he will do, which is ominous.This bill could well be the most important piece of climate legislation ever passed by any government. Putting the nation\u2019s largest state on a path to a clean electric grid would send an unmistakable signal to the rest of world that the odious Trump administration is not going to stop climate progress in the United States. It would encourage other states and countries to follow California\u2019s lead.  Governor Brown has been one of the world\u2019s most important voices on climate action. So why would he conceivably want to veto this bill?Alas, nothing is ever simple in Sacramento. The author of the bill was Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a state senator from Los Angeles who has long butted heads with Governor Brown. Mr. de Le\u00f3n is running this fall against Senator Dianne Feinstein, a longtime Brown ally (the two, both Democrats, were the top finishers in a nonpartisan primary in June). Vetoing the bill would have the effect, if not the intent, of denying Mr. de Le\u00f3n a big victory on which to run.The bigger issue, though, is that the governor had his own priorities in the legislative session that just ended. He wanted lawmakers to pass a bill that would have linked California\u2019s electric grid more closely to that of other Western states. That would have made it easier for California to import clean electricity from, say, wind farms in Wyoming, and to export the state\u2019s surplus of solar power. Senator de Le\u00f3n fought to keep the issues separate, and he won. The legislature declined to act on the governor\u2019s requests, though it is expected to revisit the issue next year, after he leaves office.So it is understandable that the governor is perturbed. I thought he had a good argument about expanding the grid, but some environmental groups feared that bill would open the door to mischief, allowing the fossil-fuel puppets in the Trump administration to force California to take more dirty coal power. This is not a crazy fear, since the federal government has some jurisdiction over interstate power sales.The sausage-making played out as it did, and now we have what the governor likely sees as an uncooked sausage sitting on his desk. Yet to veto the legislation that passed would be a black mark on his remarkable record of climate leadership.The bill is clever. It commits California to procuring more renewable energy from wind and solar farms, which will have to supply 60 percent of the state\u2019s power by 2030. But the bill recognizes that other sources of clean energy will likely be needed to drive emissions to zero.So for the remaining 40 percent, the bill allows any low-emissions source to compete. California will, I hope, set up a robust market in which new types of power plants can win a share, so long as they offer a reasonable price. The potential options include advanced nuclear reactors, geothermal plants tapping the earth\u2019s interior heat, floating offshore wind turbines, and gas-burning power plants that capture and bury their emissions.In other words, California could well be the place where the electric grid of the future gets invented. Building these new-age power plants will ultimately be a huge global business, and the bill will likely help California win more than its share of the jobs and economic growth.Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor who signed one of California\u2019s most important climate bills, made this point the other day on Twitter.\u201cWe are Californians,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t wait. We build the future economy here.\u201dRecall that Jerry Brown has been the governor twice. He started pushing for clean energy during his first term back in the 1970s, when most people thought his starry-eyed talk about solar and wind power was crazy. Those and other exploits earned him the sobriquet \u201cGovernor Moonbeam.\u201dNow we know he was not a moonstruck hippie; he was a visionary. The state simply would not be in a position to make a 100 percent commitment if Governor Brown had not risked scorn to start California down this path so many decades ago, when Mr. de Le\u00f3n was still in elementary school.I write these words with admiration for Senator de Le\u00f3n\u2019s work \u2014 and with even deeper admiration for everything the governor has accomplished for California. He is not just a brilliant political tactician; he is a former seminary student who wrestles with the moral questions embedded in our messy politics.This is a time, Governor, to look past the messiness and the rivalries. I hope your ethical compass will tell you there is only one thing to do. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Workers Overdose on the Job, and Employers Struggle to Respond", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJimmy Sullivan prepared for his job as a bricklayer the same way every morning for years: injecting a shot of heroin before leaving his car.The first time he overdosed on the job, in 2013 at a Virginia construction site, a co-worker who is his cousin stealthily injected a dose of Narcan, an opioid antidote, into Mr. Sullivan\u2019s leg. He woke up and went straight back to work.The second time, in 2014, his cousin revived him again, and after resting for an hour in his car, Mr. Sullivan was back on the job. His boss told him not to let it happen again. But within a month, Mr. Sullivan had again overdosed on the job site. This time, another worker called 911. After a few hours at the hospital, he went back to work.But despite the growing problem, many employers have turned a blind eye to addiction within their work force, ill-equipped or unwilling to confront a complicated issue they do not know how to address, according to researchers and business executives.The National Safety Council survey, which was based on interviews with 501 managers at businesses with 50 or more employees, found that fewer than one in five companies felt extremely well-prepared to combat the opioid crisis. Just 13 percent were very confident they could identify risky use. And a little more than half said they screened all employees for drugs, but 40 percent of those had failed to screen for synthetic opioids like oxycodone and fentanyl.\u201cEmployers have been asleep at the wheel,\u201d said Dave Chase, co-founder of Health Rosetta, a company that certifies employer health benefits, and author of \u201cThe Opioid Crisis Wake-Up Call.\u201d Some companies are \u201ckey, unwitting enablers,\u201d he added.Yet, many managers are unwilling to acknowledge drug use at their businesses.\u201cIf you ask them if they believe they have an opioid problem within their population, a very high percentage of them would say, \u2018No, we don\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Pat Sullivan, executive vice president of employee benefits at Hylant, a large insurance broker in Indiana that manages benefit plans for more than 19,000 businesses. \u201cAnd yet we have access to prescription reports that are absolutely telling me there\u2019s abuse happening\u201d among their workers.Jimmy Sullivan, now 39, is slender and serious. He wears a heavy silver cross around his neck and has a half-finished tattoo of two barracudas, teeth gnashing, on his arm.A bricklayer for more than two decades, he is proud of his skills. \u201cI love my job. All over the city I drive around and say, \u2018Hey, I built that,\u2019\u201d he said over lunch in Portland, Ore., where he grew up and now lives. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough work and not too many people can do it.\u201dMr. Sullivan said he worked nonstop as a bricklayer in Portland during the 2000s, despite a serious drug habit \u2014 in those days, crystal meth. By 2011, he was a father of three girls and often so strung out that he didn\u2019t recognize himself.Alarmed by his descent, he moved across the country to Newport News, Va., where he would be far from his dealers and drug-using friends. Though he readily found a job in Virginia, he also quickly got hooked \u2014 this time to opioids. That part of the country was awash in cheap heroin, which he augmented with Dilaudid, a semi-synthetic opioid prescribed by a doctor for back pain.He\u2019s certain that several of his employers knew he was using, but they seemed not to care as long as he didn\u2019t get caught. \u201cI was so productive that a lot of crews just swept it under the rug,\u201d he said. His employers did not respond to requests for comment.At times he contemplated going into rehab at the suggestion of his family, but he did not seek treatment.Mr. Sullivan said no employer asked him to take a drug test, even though he had a criminal history that included arrests for drug possession and distribution in Portland.It was an open secret on job sites that many workers were using drugs, he said. They were the ones who disappeared for long lunches, isolated themselves and occasionally nodded off. \u201cIf you drug-tested everyone, you wouldn\u2019t find many people to work with you,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said.In theory, employers are in a unique position to confront opioid misuse, through random testing and spotting erratic behavior or absenteeism, said Mr. Chase, the author of \u201cThe Opioid Crisis Wake-Up Call.\u201d They could change their health insurance policies to limit opioid prescriptions to five days and waive deductibles for addiction treatment \u2014 an option that is often not available to construction firms because they typically do not provide health insurance.But many employers have been slow to act.The Nord Family Foundation, a charity in northern Ohio, hosted an event in May in Elyria, near Cleveland, that was designed to teach employers how to identify and treat employees with substance use problems. Dr. Donald S. Sheldon, a trustee at the foundation and a former hospital president, advertised in local newspapers and reserved a room at the local community college that would seat 200.Just 30 people showed up, he said.Of the 10 companies whose employees\u2019 suspected opioid overdose deaths were detailed in O.S.H.A. reports since 2014, most did not respond or refused to address specific incidents.Sam\u2019s Club, a division of Walmart, said in a statement that it provided mental health and substance abuse coverage to employees and offered an employee assistance program. Fiat Chrysler said in an email that it had adopted more stringent opioid prescribing guidelines in its health plan and supported the use of medication-assisted addiction treatment.Just one employer, Giovanna Painting in Spencerport, N.Y., agreed to an interview. Alan Hart, the company\u2019s president, said he was shocked when one of his employees was discovered dead from a heroin overdose in a port-a-potty on a job site in 2017.A recovered addict himself, Mr. Hart said he tries to be sympathetic and help workers get into rehab, though he does not provide health insurance.\u201cWe\u2019re much, much stricter now,\u201d since the 2017 overdose death, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot more drug testing. I\u2019m on the sites a great deal more. I\u2019m walking and talking, and I pull the guys aside and look in their eyes.\u201dThis summer, Mr. Hart fired 12 of his 50 employees for suspected drug abuse. It pained him to do it, he said, and it was difficult to lose so many workers in his busiest season. But he said the risk of keeping someone on who was using drugs was too high.After his third overdose on the job for the same contractor in Virginia, Mr. Sullivan was fired. In 2015, he returned to Portland, which was in the throes of its own heroin crisis. Amid clusters of homeless encampments that dot downtown Portland, users can be spotted leaning against buildings, heads nodding back, needles in arms.Back in his hometown, enticed by union retirement benefits, Mr. Sullivan joined the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers Local 1, Oregon in 2016, which turned out to be a turning point for him.Shortly after he joined the union, Mr. Sullivan was laid off for erratic behavior and his local learned he was abusing drugs. But unlike his previous employers, the union had a plan to get him back to work.Having seen many of its members struggle with addiction, officials at the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers had over several years come up with a suite of programs to prevent substance abuse, to identify affected workers and to steer them into treatment.Matthew Eleazer, the president of Mr. Sullivan\u2019s local, said at least 10 of his approximately 650 members had recently struggled with opioid use disorders, some with lethal outcomes. One was a single father prescribed opioids for a back injury who accidentally took too many pills. Another was a promising young apprentice found by the side of the road with a needle in his arm on his way to a wedding.Mr. Eleazer said the union tests all members when they join and randomly after that; he often gets reports from employers when a member doesn\u2019t show up for work or is repeatedly tardy.The union told Mr. Sullivan he could return to work if he went into rehab, but there was a problem: He had an arrest warrant out for violating parole from a prior arrest, and the treatment centers would not accept him until he served his jail term.Mr. Sullivan was unwilling to go to jail and disappeared. Union officials tracked him down and called the police to arrest him when he was passed out in his car. The union persuaded a parole officer who helped convince a judge to let him serve his time at a drug treatment facility instead of jail, and union representatives called him several times a week.As promised, they found him a job when he was released in 2017, but this year he was laid off at the end of a construction project and relapsed again. Weeks later, Mr. Sullivan called to say he was living in his two-door Honda, claiming to have been clean for a couple of weeks.\u201cDo you remember what I told you to do when you were in that situation? That I was your first phone call?\u201d Mike Titus, a union official, said to him when they met up at a bar. \u201cCould you pass a drug test right now?\u201dIf so, the union had a job for him and he could shower at the union hall until he found a place to live. \u201cMatt and Mike were the first ones who cared enough,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cNone of my employers gave a [expletive] enough to even ask.\u201dA month later, Mr. Sullivan was back to work on a union job, living in a new home and clean once again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is California a Good Role Model?", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDepending on how you look at it, it\u2019s one of the richest states or one of the most unequal.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Conservatives argue that California\u2019s liberal politics have failed. They point out that by one key measure the state now has the highest poverty rate in the nation and they argue that its liberal minimum wage and restrictive housing codes have more than a hundred thousand people homeless, more than a million unemployed and millions more stuck on the bottom rungs of the socioeconomic ladder.\u201cThis is a topsy-turvy debate,\u201d Jonathan Rodden, a political scientist at Stanford, told me by email. \u201cThe left celebrates California\u2019s rapid growth while turning a blind eye to its inequality. The right decries poverty and inequality while discounting rapid economic growth.\u201dThe dispute raises three basic questions.Are the huge disparities in income, education, housing and wealth inevitable in a state that is simultaneously home to hugely profitable high-skill industries and a surging minority population, many of them low-skilled immigrants?Conservatives, especially in essays published in the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal, have led the charge, but some of this criticism also comes from the left and center.Its political leaders and a credulous national media present California as the \u201cwoke\u201d state, creating an economically just, post-racial reality. Yet in terms of opportunity, California is evolving into something more like apartheid South Africa or the pre-civil rights South.Jackson writes:California state and local governments spent nearly $958 billion from 1992 through 2015 on public welfare programs, including cash-assistance payments, vendor payments, and \u2018other public welfare,\u2019 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Unfortunately, California, with 12 percent of the American population, is home today to roughly one in three of the nation\u2019s welfare recipients.Michael Shellenberger, the president of Environmental Progress, a group that supports nuclear power and challenges the tenets of the traditional environmental movement, noted that by some measures \u201cthe Golden State is also number one in poverty and inequality in America.\u201dThese attacks have prompted angry retorts in some quarters.Manuel Pastor, a sociologist at the University of Southern California, sharply disputed the allegations of racism in the Kotkin and Shellenberger essays. Pastor shot back in an email:The notion that California has become like apartheid South Africa is over-the-top rhetoric. Consider whether as an immigrant you would like to be in a state that fully cooperates with ICE or one that has passed a \u201cCalifornia Values Act\u201d that has us labeled a \u201csanctuary state.\u201d Consider whether you want to be in a state that is cutting back on education \u2014 say, Arizona, until the recent teachers\u2019 strike \u2014 or one that has a Local Control Funding Formula that is now directing more money to districts and schools with more English learners, poor children, and foster youth.There\u2019s a whole cottage industry on the right dedicated to the proposition that California is a hellhole. Why? Because California is the most liberal state in the nation, and the existence of a high-tax, high-service state that nonetheless has a great economy is an affront to their principles. And yet, California\u2019s economy is doing fine.Richard Florida, director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto, argued in an email that California is better described as a crucial proving ground in a country undergoing exceptional structural change in its economy and demography.\u201cI think warts and all that California remains a bright spot and innovative force in the US political economy,\u201d Florida told me by email:I am not sure these are California problems. They are symptoms of the more general structural transformation of the economy and the bifurcation of the labor market into a small share (say 33 percent) of knowledge jobs and a much larger share of low wage service jobs (say half).California, Florida noted, \u201cleads on just about every measure I\u2019ve seen of innovation (patents, start-ups etc.) and talent (college grads). So the nature of its economy produces this kind of divide.\u201dThe actual economic data can be used to make the case for either side.The state has prospered and economic mobility is relatively high. At the same time, if Democrats\u2019 top goals are to reduce poverty, lessen inequality, get a roof over everyone\u2019s head and close the education gap, the party has a long way to go.\u201cThe odds of reaching the top fifth of the income distribution for children who are born in the bottom fifth in California is just over 10 percent,\u201d Nathaniel Hendren, a professor of economics at Harvard and one of the study\u2019s authors, said by email. \u201cThere are not many states with higher rates of this measure of upward mobility.\u201dWhat stands out is the concentration of high rates of mobility in Democratic areas of the state.Of the 26 California counties with higher than average levels of mobility, 18 \u2014 with a total population of 11-and-a-half million \u2014 voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, most by decisive margins. Eight high-mobility counties, with a total population of roughly 891,000, voted for Trump.\u201cIt is very clear that it is housing costs that drive up poverty in California,\u201d Hoynes said by email. Using another poverty measurewhere the poverty threshold is constant across all parts of the United States, California is an average poverty state. With the Supplemental Poverty Measure that adjusts the poverty threshold at the state level using housing costs, California is a very high poverty state. This doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a problem, but it tells you the problem is not wages and incomes \u2014 at least relative to the rest of the United States \u2014 but instead is about the cost of housing.Homelessness by any standard is a severe problem in the state.Now let\u2019s take a look at inequality. There are a number of ways to measure inequality, and California does not do well according to any of them.Families with children headed by adults with a high school education led the charge out of the state, many of them unable to afford California\u2019s high housing costs. Dominating those coming into the state were those with high incomes and college-educated 18-to-35 year olds.What to make of the conflicting statistics? I went back to Jonathan Rodden, who argued that both the strengths and weaknesses of California are less political than structural.What Rodden calls \u201cCalifornia\u2019s locational advantages in technology and entertainment\u201d empower the stateThe result? \u201cA mix of high taxes, rapid growth and high inequality.\u201dKenneth Miller, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College, described California as \u201ca paradox.\u201d On the one hand, Miller wrote, the stateis succeeding on many dimensions \u2014 job growth, personal income, state revenues, and more \u2014 but failing on others. It ranks top in the nation on the Census Bureau\u2019s supplemental poverty measure and homelessness measures. Its high housing and other costs are also forcing many working and middle class residents to exit for other states.Miller was unwilling to assign blame, but his comments revealed both concern and regret:California is not yet as socially and economically stratified as South Africa or Latin American countries, but one does feel the growing divide between the highly educated, wealthy, upper class and the growing underclass, while the formerly dominant middle class hollows out.In terms of taxing and spending, however, they represent very different choices, California higher on both counts, Texas lower.California may presage America\u2019s political future in another sense.\u201cThe Democrats are essentially an urban party, which means they are a coalition of low-income service workers and high-income knowledge-economy workers,\u201d Rodden told me.

{"Headline": "Trump Speech at U.N.: Scorn for Iran, Praise for Kim", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Trump thrust his commitment to an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy back onto the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. But in his second address on this diplomatic stage, he sounded as eager to claim credit for his achievements after 20 months in office, as he was to disrupt the world order.If Mr. Trump had changed, so had his audience \u2014 no longer as daunted by the insurgent figure who left them slack-jawed last year when he vowed to \u201ccrush loser terrorists,\u201d mocked North Korea\u2019s leader as \u201cRocket Man\u201d and declared that parts of the world \u201care going to hell.\u201dThis time, emissaries from around the world listened quietly as Mr. Trump fulminated at foes like Iran and failing states like Venezuela. They nodded as he singled out an enemy-turned-partner, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, expressing optimism for a diplomatic opening that would have seemed far-fetched even a year ago.But when Mr. Trump declared, \u201cIn less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,\u201d the crowd broke into murmurs and laughter.Briefly disconcerted, the president smiled and said, \u201cI did not expect that reaction, but that\u2019s O.K.\u201dIt was a jarring moment for a leader who usually speaks to adoring crowds at \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies, where his use of superlatives to describe his success draws reliable cheers. Mr. Trump still commands the world stage and he is still capable of upending American foreign policy with a single tweet. But after a year of such bombast, many in the audience at the United Nations treated him almost as a source of levity, not fear.There is also evidence that foreign leaders are more willing to push back. Speaking after Mr. Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France said the Paris climate accord had survived despite America\u2019s decision to pull out. In a not-so-subtle slap at Mr. Trump, he proposed that countries refuse to sign trade deals with those who do not comply with the accord.On Monday, France joined Germany and Britain \u2014 as well as the other signatories, Russia, China, and Iran \u2014 in recommitting to the Iran nuclear accord, repudiated by Mr. Trump in May. They did so even as Mr. Trump urged Europe to isolate Iran and warned of draconian new sanctions that would penalize America\u2019s allies for not cutting off commercial ties with the Iranians.President Hassan Rouhani of Iran criticized Mr. Trump for quitting the agreement and made clear he thought the president\u2019s offer to talk with Iran\u2019s leaders was disingenuous (earlier in the day, Mr. Trump insisted it was the Iranians who had wanted to talk).\u201cIt is ironic that the United States government does not even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said.Mr. Trump, for his part, condemned Iran\u2019s government as a \u201ccorrupt dictatorship\u201d that had looted its people and used the windfall from the nuclear deal to finance what he described as a terrorist campaign that is destabilizing the entire Middle East.\u201cIran\u2019s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey do not respect their neighbors or borders, or the sovereign rights of nations.\u201d\u201cNot good,\u201d he added.Shifting gears, Mr. Trump lavished praise on his efforts to shake up the established order, pointing to his withdrawal from trade deals and international organizations, his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and his meeting last June with Mr. Kim of North Korea, which he said had produced far more than anyone expected.\u201cThe missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNuclear testing has stopped. Some military facilities are already being dismantled. Our hostages have been released.\u201d\u201cI would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cmuch work needs to be done.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s speech showed a president at once fickle and set in his ways. His emphasis on sovereignty was a repeat of the big theme of last year\u2019s General Assembly address, and it showed that on the core principles of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, Mr. Trump is not budging.Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s warm words for Mr. Kim were a 180-degree shift from 2017, when he said the North Korean leader was on a suicidal collision course with the United States. That showed he is open to radical shifts in approach, based on his idiosyncratic view of personal diplomacy and his self-avowed skill as a dealmaker in spotting opportunities.As he did last year, Mr. Trump relied on his senior domestic adviser, Stephen Miller, for much of the speechwriting. Mr. Miller has spearheaded the White House\u2019s immigration policy and its recent decision to cut significantly the number of refugees the United States will accept.The national security adviser, John R. Bolton, an even more ardent proponent than Mr. Trump of the virtues of sovereignty, also injected themes. In his own speech at a conference on Tuesday, Mr. Bolton alluded to the frequent description in Iran of the United States as the \u201cGreat Satan.\u201d\u201cIf you cross us, our allies, or our partners,\u201d Mr. Bolton said, \u201cif you harm our citizens, if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay.\u201dFor presidents, General Assembly speeches are a good guide to the evolution of their thinking. In 2009, his first year in office, Barack Obama delivered a soaring paean to the need for diplomacy and collective action. By 2014, Mr. Obama had cast off some early ambitions and dwelt instead on the threat from the Islamic State \u2014 an enemy Mr. Trump said Tuesday had been \u201cdriven out from the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria.\u201dMr. Trump has not yet faced a major foreign policy crisis, and his speech reflected his good fortune. He still spoke mostly about actions he had taken to unwind the legacy of Mr. Obama.But he also promoted his record in the Middle East, where he said his closer ties to Saudi Arabia had helped the fight against extremism, and to Israel, where he said the United States was no longer \u201cheld hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies, and so-called experts who have been proven wrong, over the years, time and time again.\u201dCritics said Mr. Trump\u2019s triumphalist tone provoked the derisive reaction. \u201cIf you\u2019re boastful, and in the most improbable ways, it\u2019s just becomes outlandish,\u201d said Nicholas Burns, a senior diplomat under President George W. Bush. \u201cIt was a sad moment for American leadership.\u201dThe president expressed resentment toward a familiar array of perceived malefactors: allies, who he said did not pay their fair share for military defense; trading partners, who he said exploited unfair agreements that harmed American workers; and oil producers, whom he accused of gouging the United States and other customers.\u201cOPEC and OPEC nations are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNobody should like it.\u201dMr. Trump also assailed countries, like China, that use industrial planning in their economies to undercut competitors on trade. The United States, he said, was systematically renegotiating what he called unfair trade deals and striking back against China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, predatory licensing agreements and the dumping of goods in the American market under President Xi Jinping.\u201cI have great respect and affection for my friend President Xi, but I have made clear that our trade imbalance is just not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s market distortions, and the way they deal, cannot be tolerated.\u201dAmerica\u2019s other great strategic rival, Russia, went unmentioned by Mr. Trump, except for a reference to what he described as Germany\u2019s dependence on Russian energy. That was also Mr. Trump\u2019s only mention of Germany, a staunch ally, though he praised its neighbor, Poland, which has an increasingly autocratic government, for its construction of a pipeline in the Baltic Sea to diversify its energy supply.After his speech, Mr. Trump took credit for a change in Iran\u2019s behavior since he withdrew from the nuclear deal. He claimed, without evidence, that Iran had abandoned its ambitions to build a land bridge to the Mediterranean Sea. At some point, he predicted, the United States and Iran would have \u201cmeaningful negotiations and probably do a deal.\u201d\u201cIran is a much different country today than it was a year ago,\u201d he said before meeting Colombia\u2019s president, Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez. \u201cThey have riots in the street. They have horrible inflation, the worst in the world. Their currency is a disaster. Everything in Iran is failing right now.\u201dAside from Iran, Venezuela drew Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest critique. He described the political tumult roiling the country as a \u201chuman tragedy\u201d and said the United States would impose new sanctions on the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Socialism, he said, had squandered Venezuela\u2019s oil resources and \u201cdriven its people into abject poverty.\u201dMr. Trump spoke of the great potential of the United Nations, but expressed little regard for any other international bodies. The United States, he said, had rightfully exited the Human Rights Council, refused to take part in the Global Compact on Migration or to recognize the authority of the International Criminal Court, which has recently considered investigating the conduct of American troops in Afghanistan.The president singled out India, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Poland as worthy partners: nations that he said had distinctive traditions and cultures, patriotic societies and a fierce commitment to independence.\u201cSovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured or peace has ever prospered,\u201d Mr. Trump declared. \u201cAnd so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all.\u201dRick Gladstone and Megan Specia contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Economy Roars, Army Falls Thousands Short of Recruiting Goals", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOLORADO SPRINGS \u2014 The Army fell thousands of troops short of its recruiting goals this year, the first time it has done so since the height of the Iraq war 13 years ago.The shortfall is due in part to a hot job market that has lured away many recruits at a time that President Trump and Congress seek to expand the military, and have raised the number the Army needs to meet.The Army hoped to bring in about 76,500 new soldiers this year. But with the fiscal year ending this month, it is still 6,500 troops short, even after spending an extra $200 million on bonuses and lowering standards to let in more troops with conduct or health issues.On top of having to compete with a robust economy, with an unemployment rate below 4 percent, the Army must pick from what it says is a shrinking pool of eligible recruits. More than two-thirds of young adults do not qualify for military service because of poor physical fitness or other issues such as drug use, according to the Army.\u201cYou have fewer people who can serve, they have more opportunities in the job market, that makes it very hard on the Army,\u201d said Beth Asch, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation who studies military recruiting.The shortfall will not leave the Army paralyzed, representing only about 1 percent of the force. But it is a sign of growing cultural and economic changes that, if not addressed, could hollow out the Army from within.The Army has invested in more recruiters and advertising, Dr. Asch said, and sweetened the deal for prospective soldiers with bonuses and other benefits. It has also had to soften admissions. This year it gave hundreds more waivers for past drug use than it did a few years ago.In a statement, the Army said the shortfall was evidence that it was not settling for lower-quality recruits, but was instead trying to \u201craise the quality of our recruits despite the tough recruiting environment.\u201d\u201cAs we look to 2019 and beyond, we have laid the foundation to improve recruiting for the Army while maintaining an emphasis on quality over quantity,\u201d Lt. Col. Emanuel L. Ortiz said. \u201cOur leaders remain confident we will achieve the Army Vision of growing the regular Army above 500,000 soldiers.\u201dThe Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps met their recruiting goals for 2018, but the Army, which is by far the biggest branch of the military, had to recruit more than twice as many troops as other branches. Initially, the Army planned to recruit 80,000 soldiers in 2018, but lowered its goal to 76,500 in April because it was able to retain more soldiers already in the force. That still left a much larger-than-normal task for Army recruiters amid a roaring economy.At an urgent care center in the suburbs of Denver on Friday, Josh Griffin, a high school senior, had just finished taking a drug test for a new job at a discount tire company down the road. He said that recruiters had talked to him in high school, and that the military sounded appealing at first: money for college, a steady job and a way to give back to his country.But now he sees better options, he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t have any doubt in my mind about finding a job.\u201dThe military\u2019s promise of college tuition and other benefits has less of a draw, said Sgt. First Class Michael T. Peppers, the commander of a strip mall recruiting station next to a Subway and a Tasty Tacos in Urbandale, Iowa.The military also says it has to pick from young adults who are increasingly unqualified to serve because of mental health issues, criminal convictions or obesity.\u201cThat\u2019s our biggest obstacle,\u201d Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Snow, who until recently was the head of Army recruiting, said in November. He said natural disasters that led to the closing of several recruiting stations, including in the reliably rich recruiting ground of Puerto Rico, also contributed to shortfalls.Similar measures are in effect today, Dr. Asch, the RAND economist, said. Troops who cannot pass a body-mass test may still get in on a strength test. Troops without a diploma are more likely to get a second chance if they do well on an Army aptitude test. And those with criminal convictions or other misconduct in their past can get waivers if they can show they have overcome past troubles.Jackson Barnett contributed reporting from Westminster, Colo., and Ann Klein from Urbandale, Iowa.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Ethiopia\u2019s New Leader, a Political Insider, Change It From the Inside Out?", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 On the morning of his first day of school, when he was 7, Abiy Ahmed heard his mother whispering into his ears.\u201c\u2018You\u2019re unique, my son,\u2019\u201d he recalled her saying. \u201cYou will end up in the palace. So when you go to school, bear in mind that one day you\u2019ll be someone which will serve the nation.\u201dWith that preposterous prophesy for a boy growing up in a house without electricity in a tiny Ethiopian village, she kissed him on his head and sent him on his way.The task is enormous. Ethiopia is Africa\u2019s second most populous nation, with more than 100 million people, in a part of the continent where world powers are scrambling for influence.So are the risks: millions of disaffected youth, widespread poverty, a violent struggle over resources among Ethiopia\u2019s competing ethnic groups and a range of detractors from inside and outside the government who are either threatened by too much change \u2014 or angry that it\u2019s not enough.Mr. Abiy\u2019s changes are a major departure for Ethiopia, which has long relied on a government model that resembles China\u2019s, emphasizing state-led economic growth and a suppression of political dissent.But Mr. Abiy knows his country is overwhelmingly young, with a median age of 18 and a thirst for economic and political freedom.\u201cClosing the door is the worst approach,\u201d he told The New York Times in Los Angeles in between bridge-building meetings with Ethiopians living in the United States.Many of Mr. Abiy\u2019s promises remain just that. He has yet to lift restrictions on civil society, and it\u2019s unclear how multiparty elections can be held, as he has promised, in a country where the governing coalition and its allies have sweeping control over almost all institutions \u2014 and hold every seat in Parliament.Representative Karen Bass, a California Democrat, who met with Mr. Abiy in late August, lauded his changes but warned of the risks of soaring demands.\u201cHe has delivered, but if life doesn\u2019t change for everyone, people get impatient,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople have unrealistic expectations.\u201dMore than just changing the way Ethiopia is run, Mr. Abiy says he wants to change the way Ethiopians see themselves.\u201cBuild bridges, break down walls,\u201d is a constant refrain in his speeches, urging Ethiopians to step across religious and ethnic fault lines to view one another as compatriots, instead of rivals.\u201cWe just blame each other,\u201d he said in the interview, barely concealing his distress. \u201cWe just hate each other.\u201d He calls it \u201cgroup thinking.\u201dMr. Abiy embodies Ethiopia\u2019s mixture. His father was Muslim and Oromo. It is the nation\u2019s largest ethnic group, but has long been marginalized. His mother was Amhara and Orthodox Christian, and she converted to Islam when she married.\u201cIt\u2019s not political language. It\u2019s religious language,\u201d observed Ephraim Isaac, an Ethiopian religious studies scholar who met with Mr. Abiy shortly after he took office.Politically, Mr. Abiy is a consummate insider. He joined the army at age 13 and went on to create the government cybersecurity agency in a country with a tight leash on the internet. He also joined the governing coalition that overthrew military rule in 1991 and that has run Ethiopia ever since. His party, the Oromo People\u2019s Democratic Front, has played something of an internal opposition role within the coalition.Rather than hiding his mother\u2019s whispers, he says he advertised them.\u201cOne day I\u2019ll be your boss,\u201d he recalls saying to senior officials, even when he was a midlevel government functionary.Peace with Eritrea was a priority. He asked those who had contact with Eritrea \u2014 one of the most diplomatically isolated countries in the world \u2014 to reach out on his behalf. He wanted to talk.Mr. Abiy said help came from many foreign leaders, including the de facto leader of the United Arab Emirates, Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed, who enjoys great influence in Asmara, the Eritrean capital.Mr. Abiy said one of the biggest priorities for the crown prince was peace between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and he was careful to add that he had also spoken to several African leaders.The breakthrough in the standoff came from Mr. Abiy\u2019s side. In early June, he agreed to hand over a disputed border town to Eritrea, a sticking point for 20 years.Mr. Abiy says he does not want to remain in the palace forever. He has promised competitive elections plus term limits for the prime minister.\u201cI\u2019m not a king,\u201d Mr. Abiy said. \u201cMy ultimate objective is to see democratic elections in Ethiopia. If that happened, I\u2019ll feel I fulfilled my objective.\u201dOpposition political parties are now free to operate, but Mr. Abiy has not said when and how he will lift laws that restrict how civil society groups function.\u201cWe\u2019ll give them rights to operate in our country. Also we will give them responsibility because group thinking is there, emotion is there,\u201d he said. \u201cOur door is open, but we will watch our door.\u201dLeenco Lata, a political dissident who returned to Ethiopia recently after a quarter century in self-imposed exile in Oslo, credited the new prime minister for trying to change the system from inside \u2014 something he has never seen in the country before.\u201cThere is a struggle within the government, and the pro-reform wing is having the upper hand,\u201d said Mr. Lata, who heads a political organization called the Oromo Democratic Front.\u201cI believe in this government\u2019s commitment to institute democratic order in this country. But I\u2019m worried because the obstacles are huge,\u201d he added. \u201cThe country\u2019s deep seated autocratic culture needs to be reformed.\u201dMr. Abiy faces entrenched resistance at home \u2014 in the security services and the political parties that have long held power. But he came to the United States to remove a longtime thorn in the side of Ethiopia\u2019s leaders: its exiles.\u201cThe chaos, the crisis, the conflict in the nation, somehow, it is related to the diaspora,\u201d he said. \u201cThat negative energy operates in destroying our country.\u201dTo win over dissidents abroad, he is appealing to their homesickness.Around 23,000 Ethiopians abroad were effectively barred from going home because of their political activities. Mr. Abiy lifted those restrictions.In a sign of that new openness, he said that Ethiopians abroad \u2014 thousands of whom hadn\u2019t set foot in the country in years for fear of arrest \u2014 would be able to go home visa free for the Ethiopian new year.\u201cThe diaspora, most of them, they live here physically but their soul is there. Virtually day and night they are in Ethiopia,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never expect to come to Ethiopia, to be invited to Ethiopia.\u201dHe then headed to a rally to address them in a basketball arena at the University of Southern California, part of his three-city tour of the United States.The bleachers were packed. Some wore his face on their T-shirts. One woman had inserted two flags into her hair \u2014 one Ethiopian, the other Eritrean. They ululated when Mr. Abiy approached the dais. \u201cAbiy, Abiy,\u201d they chanted in unison.The prime minister beamed in a white blazer with lapels embroidered in black. He waved, touched his heart with his hand, preached.\u201cInstead of hating and holding grudges, we need to come together in peace and love,\u201d he told the crowd.\u201cWhen are you going to help Ethiopia?\u201d he asked and them urged them to contribute what he called their \u201cmacchiato money\u201d \u2014 at least a dollar every day \u2014 to help Ethiopia prosper.And then he listened.One after another, dozens of Ethiopians came forward to pour out their grievances. Abraham Agonafer, a shuttle driver from Vancouver who had flown here to demand answers, took the mic, wearing the pictures of four young men on his T-shirt. They were students who had disappeared many years ago, he said. He wanted the prime minister to find out what happened.\u201cThat\u2019s why I came all this way,\u201d the man said later. \u201cHis reforms, they give me hope.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "About 2 Million Low-Income Americans Would Lose Benefits Under House Farm Bill, Study Says", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly two million low-income Americans, including 469,000 households with young children, would be stripped of benefits under the House version of the farm bill being considered this week by congressional negotiators, according to an analysis by a nonpartisan research firm.The bill, a multiyear spending measure that narrowly passed the House in June, includes a proposal to reformulate income and expense criteria for the 42 million recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.Under the bill, states could remove about 8 percent of those receiving aid from the rolls, according to the research firm, Mathematica, which used data from the Agriculture Department\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service.About 34 percent of seniors in the program, or 677,000 households, would lose benefits under the proposal, according to the study. More than one in 10 people with a disability, another 214,000 households, would also lose eligibility.By contrast, the Senate\u2019s version of the farm bill, which had bipartisan support, did not include tougher work requirements or the new benefit formula, and negotiators are struggling to reconcile such differences.President Trump favors imposing stricter requirements on adult recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as food stamps, and has disparagingly described beneficiaries as \u201cwelfare\u201d recipients.On Wednesday, he called for lawmakers to adopt the House version of the bill, which also includes billions in subsidies for agricultural states in the Midwest.Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, who serves as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has been noncommital about the House version of the bill, telling reporters this week that while he supported work requirements and an overhaul to the nutrition program, passing the measure quickly was his \u201cparamount\u201d priority.The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas, expressed impatience with the progress of talks, urging the Senate to \u201cpick up the pace\u201d to address a growing agricultural slump in the farm belt that has been exacerbated by Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China.\u201cToday my colleagues in the House and Senate highlighted the urgency in farm and ranch country and just how desperate times are as net farm income is slated to fall again this year,\u201d he said.The focus on agricultural subsidies, Senate staff members said, makes it less likely that the House proposals will be part of a final deal. But advocates for the poor were concerned that some, if not all, of the cuts could make it into the final version.\u201cThose who rely on SNAP \u2014 two-thirds of whom are children, older adults and people with disabilities \u2014 should have access to benefits without undue barriers,\u201d said Jasmine Hall Ratliff, a program officer for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which funded the Mathematica study.\u201cWe must not accept mass deprivation in the wealthiest nation in world history as any sort of \u2018new normal,\u2019\u201d said Joel Berg, the chief executive of Hunger Free America, a nationwide advocacy group. \u201cHunger is unacceptable in any society, but it\u2019s particularly outrageous in the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His move to buy most of Fox forced Disney to raise its bid for those assets so much that when it came time to compete for Sky, Disney had a hard time bidding against Comcast without overleveraging itself. Time will tell whether the Sky deal proves successful \u2014 but if scored simply on the dark arts of deal making, Mr. Roberts already won.We\u2019ll see whether Disney ends up selling Fox\u2019s stake in Sky to Comcast.

{"Headline": "Airlines Are Raising the Cost of Checked Bags", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGet ready to pay even more the next time you fly with checked baggage.Just before Labor Day, JetBlue and United Airlines raised the bag fee for most travelers to $30 from $25. Delta Air Lines followed suit on Wednesday, and American Airlines said on Thursday that it, too, was raising its bag charges.Airlines continue to see the much-maligned bag fees as a way to protect their bottom lines from rising fuel and labor costs.\u201cWhat the airlines are facing right now is that their costs are rising at about twice the rate of revenue,\u201d said Samuel Engel, the senior vice president of aviation at the consulting group ICF. As a result, he said, airlines are looking for ways to increase revenues that entice their competitors to follow their lead.\u201cThe baggage fee is an easy target, and the nice thing about the baggage fee is it\u2019s a way to isolate that increase onto your least loyal customer,\u201d Mr. Engel said. \u201cAirlines have carved out exceptions to baggage fees for their elite frequent fliers, so the pool of people who represent the airlines\u2019 most valuable revenue will not see this increase.\u201dMr. Engel also noted that bag fees were a good way to get passengers to pay more without raising fares. Lower fares get more attention on flight search engines like Kayak and Expedia, and bag fees are not a factor in the price that is displayed.In a statement, United insisted that the higher fees, which affect flights only within the Caribbean and North and Central America, were a way to maintain its current level of service.\u201cThese changes allow us to continue investing in the overall customer experience in today\u2019s marketplace,\u201d the airline said.JetBlue similarly defended its new pricing. In a statement, the airline said, \u201cAs a matter of good business, we routinely review and adjust our ancillary pricing to ensure a healthy business so we can continue offering the best customer experience of any U.S. airline.\u201d Delta also said it regularly adjusted its fees.Airlines remain profitable, but rising fuel prices and labor costs are tightening their margins.\u201cThe increase in fuel prices from the first half of last year to the first half of this year was 31 percent, which represented approximately a 7.5 percent increase in total operating costs,\u201d Mr. Engel said. \u201cThat\u2019s really big.\u201dRaising bag fees, he said, is not the only way that airlines have been dealing with higher costs. United also announced last month that it would introduce a fee for economy seats closer to the front of the plane.Southwest stands out by still allowing passengers to check two bags free. And Alaska Airlines has so far kept its fee at $25 for the first checked bag.\u201cWe\u2019re not going back to the dark days of the mid-2000s anytime soon,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "OPEC Signals No Rush to Increase Oil Output", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOil producers led by Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled on Sunday that they did not see any rush to increase output, despite pressure from President Trump to pump more oil and hold down prices.Meeting in Algiers, officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied governments, including Russia, said that after having increased production in recent months, customers now have adequate supplies. \u201cSince June, Saudi Arabia has met the demand for every barrel that has been requested,\u201d the Saudi oil minister, Khalid al-Falih, said at a news conference after the meeting.The Saudis and their allies appear to be trying to walk a fine line between accommodating Mr. Trump and not putting so much oil into the market that prices crash \u2014 as they did in 2014, damaging their petroleum-dependent economies. \u201cThey are trying to assuage Trump while keeping internal OPEC division from blowing up in the open,\u201d said Antoine Halff, a founding partner of Kayrros, a research firm based in Paris.With oil prices recently hovering at around $80 a barrel for Brent crude, Mr. Trump has used Twitter and other means to lean on OPEC to increase oil supplies. His messages have mainly been directed at Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC producer. Last week, Mr. Trump renewed his pressure. \u201cWe protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices!\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Thursday. \u201cThe OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!\u201dAnalysts say Mr. Trump wants to try to head off higher gasoline prices in the United States that could hurt Republican candidates in the coming midterm elections. \u201cSitting presidents in an election year have a proverbial fear of high oil prices,\u201d Mr. Halff said.The agreement by OPEC and Russia in late 2016 to restrain oil production has contributed to a nearly 20 percent rise in Brent crude prices this year. Mr. Trump\u2019s decision this year to reimpose sanctions on Iran has also helped push up prices, analysts say.Traders are calculating that exports from Iran, a major producer, may dry up in the coming months. The full sanctions do not kick in until November, but analysts say Iranian sales are already falling as buyers in Europe and Asia cut orders because they fear being hit with financial penalties by Washington.Analysts say that with the full impact of the sanctions on Iranian exports unknown, the Saudis and other OPEC producers are trying to avoid unnecessarily stoking tensions with Iran, a fellow OPEC member. The Iranians are resentful over the prospect that the Saudis and other OPEC members would gain market share at their expense.\u201cIf the U.S., for the sake of argument, were to succeed in reducing Iranian shipments to zero, that would be extremely challenging indeed,\u201d said Neil Atkinson, a senior analyst at the International Energy Agency, based in Paris.While the markets may be adequately supplied now, they could be tested in the coming months, analysts say. Iran is not the only worry. Output from troubled Venezuela continues to decline, and fighting in Libya is raising doubt on whether that country can maintain its current high levels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "North Korea\u2019s New Nuclear Promises Fall Short of U.S. Demands", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u2019s leader, told South Korea\u2019s president on Wednesday that he would commit to some concrete steps toward denuclearization \u2014 including an offer to \u201cpermanently dismantle\u201d facilities central to fuel production for nuclear warheads. But he made no promises to relinquish his nuclear weapons or missiles.Mr. Kim\u2019s commitments fell far short of what American officials have demanded \u2014 a complete abandonment of the North\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. Nonetheless, President Trump welcomed the agreements, reached during Mr. Kim\u2019s summit meeting in North Korea with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, as \u201cvery exciting.\u201dSpeaking on the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Trump told reporters that when he came into office \u201cpeople thought we were going \u2014 it was inevitable \u2014 we were going to war with North Korea.\u201dDespite Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence that he remained tough on North Korea, three outcomes from the meeting between Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim suggested the White House had softened its position.Mr. Moon is pushing toward a peace declaration \u2014 a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War \u2014 that the United States will almost certainly join.Mr. Kim, only in his mid-30s but clearly a canny negotiator, has used the relationship with Mr. Moon to sidestep the American demand that he surrender all his nuclear capabilities first, and then negotiate. Instead, he is demanding reciprocal, step-by-step concessions from Mr. Trump \u2014 so far unspecified \u2014 and holding on to his nuclear weapons at least until he gets those allowances.And finally, the Trump administration seems resigned to the idea that the \u201ccomplete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization\u201d that it once deemed as necessary in the next year is more likely to take at least a few years.The agreements signed on Wednesday by Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim seemed aimed more at reducing tensions along their shared border than moving quickly toward denuclearization.Mr. Kim also promised to visit Seoul, the South Korean capital his government has often threatened to destroy in a \u201csea of fire.\u2019\u2019 He would be the first North Korean leader to make such a trip.More significant was his promise to dismantle a missile engine-test facility and missile launchpad essential to the country\u2019s development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The North said it would also invite outside experts to watch.But those facilities were used to develop the technology. The missiles are produced elsewhere.Before he agrees to go further, Mr. Kim has demanded \u201ccorresponding\u201d measures from the United States, presumably starting with a formal declaration ending a war halted by a truce 65 years ago.It is unclear what else he may demand, including a permanent end to military exercises with South Korea or a withdrawal of American forces.\u201cWhat Kim is offering so far is to shutter sites that are pretty costless \u2014 doing enough to keep Trump appeased,\u2019\u2019 said Vipin Narang, a political-science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who follows North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cHe\u2019s avoiding giving up anything meaningful \u2014 actual weapons, fissile material and missiles.\u201dBut Mr. Kim did propose to \u201cpermanently dismantle\u201d the Yongbyon nuclear complex, the heart of his country\u2019s nuclear program for the past four decades, among other steps \u2014 if his other conditions are met.The Yongbyon offer could prove significant. North Korea is believed to have produced its plutonium there. Yongbyon also houses a centrifuge plant that produces highly enriched uranium, an alternative fuel for atomic bombs, though Western analysts suspect that North Korea has centrifuge plants elsewhere.North Korea has mothballed Yongbyon before, only to restart it when negotiations with Washington stalled.But the offers say little about his existing arsenal. Mr. Kim\u2019s ultimate goal, analysts say, is to make the Trump administration complacent enough to ease sanctions in return for a freeze \u2014 not dismantlement \u2014 of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programs.\u201cNo matter how hard I look, I can find no real progress in denuclearization in today\u2019s announcements,\u201d said Cheon Seong-whun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.South Korean officials cautioned that Mr. Kim and Mr. Moon excluded from their official agreements some ideas they had discussed, leaving them for negotiations between the North and the United States.\u201cBased on the discussions we had here, the leaders of South Korea and the United States will be able to discuss ways of expediting denuclearization talks between the North and the United States,\u201d Chung Eui-yong, Mr. Moon\u2019s national security adviser, told South Korean reporters in Pyongyang. \u201cWe hope that a summit meeting between the North and the U.S. will take place soon.\u201dMr. Moon began his three-day trip to Pyongyang on Tuesday with a complicated objective: advancing North-South ties and jump-starting stalled talks between Washington and Pyongyang.\u201cIn this summit, President Moon made great strides in advancing inter-Korean ties,\u201d said Lee Byong-chul, a senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul. \u201cIf Kim Jong-un cannot abandon his nuclear weapons outright, given the stiff opposition from his military, you have to create an environment where it becomes inevitable for the North to part with them. The Olympics might just do that.\u201dBut there was doubt that the agreements on Wednesday would mollify hard-liners in Washington who consider sanctions \u201cthe best and only tool for denuclearization,\u201d said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior analyst at the Sejong Institute in South Korea.Since then, Mr. Trump appears to have been won over by Mr. Kim\u2019s overtures, often talking about their personal relationship after their meeting in Singapore. His optimism stands in contrast to the position of top foreign policy aides, who have pushed to maintain punishing sanctions that they believe have pressured North Korea to negotiate.American officials, mindful of North Korea\u2019s past failures to honor promises, are insisting that North Korea move quickly toward denuclearization by submitting an inventory of its nuclear weapons and fissile materials. But North Korea insists on denuclearizing \u201cin phases\u201d and has demanded that Washington first take steps to prove no hostile intent.In Pyongyang this week, Mr. Moon again played mediator, trying to narrow the differences between North Korea and the United States, and working toward a second meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump.\u201cThe two Korean governments are declaring that the future of the peninsula should be decided by Koreans themselves,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.But the highlight of Mr. Moon\u2019s trip came on Wednesday evening, when he became the first South Korean leader to address a large North Korean audience.In a speech interrupted by thundering applause from 150,000 North Koreans who filled Pyongyang\u2019s May Day Stadium, Mr. Moon extolled the \u201cindomitable courage\u201d of North Koreans in overcoming the famine of the 1990s, and he praised Mr. Kim\u2019s effort to rebuild the economy.\u201cWe Koreans are exceptional, we are tenacious, we are peace-loving,\u201d Mr. Moon said. \u201cAnd we must live together.\u201dChoe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, South Korea, and David E. Sanger from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Italy\u2019s Shadow Economy", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithin a distressed labor market, thousands of low-paid home workers create luxury garments without contracts or insurance.But the woman, who asked not to be named for fear that she could lose her livelihood, receives just \u20ac1 from the factory that employs her for each meter of fabric she completes.\u201cIt takes me about one hour to sew one meter, so about four to five hours to complete an entire coat,\u201d said the woman, who works without a contract, or insurance, and is paid in cash on a monthly basis. \u201cI try to do two coats per day.\u201dThe unregulated work she completes in her apartment is outsourced to her from a local factory that also manufactures outerwear for some of the best-known names in the luxury business, including Louis Vuitton and Fendi. The most she has ever earned, she said, was \u20ac24 for an entire coat.That similar conditions exist in Italy, however, and facilitate the production of some of the most expensive wardrobe items money can buy, may shock those who see the \u201cMade in Italy\u201d label as a byword for sophisticated craftsmanship. Increased pressure from globalization and growing competition at all levels of the market mean that the assumption implicit in the luxury promise \u2014 that part of the value of such a good is that it is made in the best conditions, by highly skilled workers, who are paid fairly \u2014 is at times put under threat.Though they are not exposed to what most people would consider sweatshop conditions, the homeworkers are allotted what might seem close to sweatshop wages. Italy does not have a national minimum wage, but roughly \u20ac5-7 per hour is considered an appropriate standard by many unions and consulting firms. In extremely rare cases, a highly skilled worker can earn as much as \u20ac8-10 an hour. But the homeworkers earn significantly less, regardless of whether they are involved in leatherwork, embroidery or another artisanal task.In Ginosa, another town in Puglia, Maria Colamita, 53, said that a decade ago, when her two children were younger, she had worked from home on wedding dresses produced by local factories, embroidering gowns with pearl paillettes and appliqu\u00e9s for \u20ac1.50 to \u20ac2 per hour. Each gown took 10 to 50 hours to complete, and Ms. Colamita said she worked 16 to 18 hours a day; she was paid only when a garment was complete.\u201cI would only take breaks to take care of my children and my family members \u2014 that was it,\u201d she said, adding that she currently works as a cleaner and earns \u20ac7 per hour. \u201cNow my children have grown up, I can take on a job where I can earn a real wage.\u201dBoth women said they knew at least 15 other seamstresses in their area who produced luxury fashion garments on a piece-rate basis for local factories from their homes. All live in Puglia, the rural heel of Italy\u2019s boot that combines whitewashed fishing villages and crystal clear waters beloved by tourists with one of the country\u2019s biggest manufacturing hubs.Few were willing to risk their livelihoods to tell their tales, because for them the flexibility and opportunity to care for their families while working was worth the meager pay and lack of protections.\u201cI know I am not paid what I deserve, but salaries are very low here in Puglia and ultimately I love what I do,\u201d said another seamstress, from the attic workshop in her apartment. \u201cI have done it all my life and couldn\u2019t do anything else.\u201dAlthough she had a factory job that paid her \u20ac5 per hour, she worked an additional three hours per day off the books from home, largely on high-quality sample garments for Italian designers at roughly \u20ac50 apiece.\u201cWe all accept that this is how it is,\u201d the woman said from her sewing machine, surrounded by cloth rolls and tape measures.Few sectors are as reliant on the country\u2019s manufacturing cachet as the luxury trade, long a linchpin of Italy\u2019s economic growth. It is responsible for 5 percent of Italian gross domestic product, and an estimated 500,000 people were employed directly and indirectly by the luxury goods sector in Italy in 2017, according to data from a report from the University of Bocconi and Altagamma, an Italian luxury trade organization. Those numbers have been bolstered by the rosy fortunes of the global luxury market, expected by Bain & Company to grow by 6 to 8 percent, to \u20ac276 to \u20ac281 billion in 2018, driven in part by the appetite for \u201cMade in Italy\u201d goods from established and emerging markets.But the alleged efforts by some luxury brands and lead suppliers to lower costs without undermining quality have taken a toll on those on those operating at the very bottom of the industry. Just how many are affected is difficult to quantify.However, there is no official data on those operating with irregular contracts, and no one has attempted to quantify the group for decades. In 1973, the economist Sebastiano Brusco estimated that Italy had one million contracted home workers in apparel production, with a roughly equal figure working without contracts. Few comprehensive efforts have been made to examine the numbers since.This New York Times investigation collected evidence of about 60 women in the Puglia region alone working from home without a regular contract in the apparel sector. Tania Toffanin, the author of \u201cFabbriche Invisibili,\u201d a book on the history of home working in Italy, estimated that currently there are 2,000 to 4,000 irregular home workers in apparel production.Plenty of Puglian factory managers stressed they adhered to union regulations, treated workers fairly and paid them a living wage. Many factory owners added that almost all luxury names \u2014 like Gucci, owned by Kering, for example, or Louis Vuitton, owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton \u2014 regularly sent staff to check on working conditions and quality standards.When contacted, LVMH declined to comment for this story. A spokesman for MaxMara emailed the following statement: \u201cMaxMara considers an ethical supply chain a key component of the company\u2019s core values reflected in our business practice.\u201d He added that the company was unaware of specific allegations of its suppliers using home workers, but had started an investigation this week. According to Ms. Lucchetti, the fact that many Italian luxury brands outsource the bulk of manufacturing, rather than use their own factories, has created a status quo where exploitation can easily fester \u2014 especially for those out of union or brand sightlines. A large portion of brands hire a local supplier in a region, who will then negotiate contracts with factories in the area on their behalf.\u201cBrands commission first lead contractors at the head of the supply chain, which then commission to sub-suppliers, which in turn shift part of the production to smaller factories under the pressure of reduced lead time and squeezed prices,\u201d Ms. Lucchetti said. \u201cThat makes it very hard for there to be sufficient transparency or accountability. We know home working exists. But it is so hidden that there will be brands that have no idea orders are being made by irregular workers outside the contracted factories.\u201dHowever, she also called these problems common knowledge, and said, \u201csome brands must know they might be complicit.\u201dInitially, in 2011, Ms. Ventura began legal proceedings against only Euroshoes, saying that consistently late payments, shrinking fee rates for orders and outstanding bills owed to her by that company were making it impossible to maintain a profitable factory and pay her workers a fair wage. A local court ruled in her favor, and ordered Euroshoes to pay the debts, which, after appealing unsuccessfully, the company did.Orders dried up in the wake of those legal proceedings. Eventually, in 2014, Keope went bankrupt. Now, in a second trial, which has stretched on for years without a significant ruling, Ms. Ventura has brought another action against Euroshoes, and Tod\u2019s, which she says had direct knowledge of Euroshoes\u2019 unlawful business practices. (Tod\u2019s has said it played no role in nor had any knowledge of Euroshoes\u2019 contract issues with Keope. A lawyer for Euroshoes declined to comment for this article.)\u201cPart of the problem down here is that employees agree to forgo their rights in order to work,\u201d Mr. Romano said from his office in the town of Casarano, ahead of the next court hearing, scheduled for Sept. 26. He spoke of the \u201cSalento method,\u201d a well-known local phrase that means, essentially: \u201cBe flexible, use your methods, you know how to do it down here.\u201d The region of Salento has a high unemployment rate, which makes its work force vulnerable. And although brands would never officially suggest taking advantage of employees, some factory owners have told Mr. Romano that there is an underlying message to use a range of means, including underpaying employees and paying them to work at home. The area has long been a hub of third-party shoemakers for luxury brands including Gucci, Prada, Salvatore Ferragamo and Tod\u2019s. In 2008, Ms. Ventura entered into an exclusive agreement with Euroshoes to become a sub-supplier of shoe uppers destined for Tod\u2019s. According to Ms. Ventura\u2019s lawsuit, she then became subject to consistently late payments, as well as an unexplained reduction in prices per unit from \u20ac13.48 to \u20ac10.73 per shoe upper from 2009 to 2012.While many local factories cut corners, including having employees work from home, Ms. Ventura said she still paid full salaries and provided national insurance. Because the contract required exclusivity, other potential manufacturing deals with rival brands including Armani and Gucci, which could have balanced the books, could not be made. Production costs were no longer covered, and promises of an increased number of orders from Tod\u2019s via Euroshoes never came, according to the legal papers filed in Ms. Ventura\u2019s case.In 2012, orders from Tod\u2019s via Euroshoes stopped completely, one year after Ms. Ventura first took Euroshoes to court for her unpaid bills. Ms. Ventura said that eventually put Keope on the road to bankruptcy, according to legal documents. Ms. Ventura was declared insolvent in 2014.When asked for comment, a Tod\u2019s spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cKeope filed a lawsuit against one of our suppliers, Euroshoes, and Tod\u2019s, to recover damages related to the alleged actions or omissions of Euroshoes. Tod\u2019s has nothing to do with the facts alleged in the case and never had a direct commercial relationship with Keope. Keope is a subcontractor of Euroshoes, and Tod\u2019s is completely extraneous to their relationship.\u201dThe statement also said that Tod\u2019s had paid Euroshoes for all the amounts billed in a timely and regular manner, and was not responsible if Euroshoes failed to pay a subcontractor. Tod\u2019s said it insisted all suppliers perform their services in line with the law, and that the same standard be applied to subcontractors. \u201cTod\u2019s reserves the right to defend its reputation against the libelous attempt of Keope to involve it in issues that do not concern Tod\u2019s,\u201d the spokeswoman said.Home working textile jobs that are labor intensive or require skilled handiwork are not new to Italy. But many industry observers believe that the lack of a government-set national minimum wage has made it easier for many home workers to still be paid a pittance.Wages are generally negotiated for workers by union representatives, which vary by sector and by union. According to the Studio Rota Porta, an Italian labor consultancy, the minimum wage in the textile industry should be roughly \u20ac7.08 per hour, lower than those for other sectors including food (\u20ac8.70), construction (\u20ac8) and finance (\u20ac11.51). But workers who aren\u2019t members of unions operate outside the system and are vulnerable to exploitation, a source of frustration for many union representatives.\u201cWe do know about seamstresses working without contracts from home in Puglia, especially those that specialize in sewing appliqu\u00e9, but none of them want to approach us to talk about their conditions, and the subcontracting keeps them largely invisible,\u201d said Pietro Fiorella, a representative of the CGIL, or Italian General Confederation of Labour, the country\u2019s largest national union. Many of them are retired, Mr. Fiorella said, or want the flexibility of part-time work to care for family members or want to supplement their income, and are fearful of losing the additional money. While unemployment rates in Puglia recently dropped to 19.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from nearly 21.5 percent in the same period a year ago, jobs remain difficult to come by.A fellow union representative, Giordano Fumarola, pointed to another reason that garment and textile wages in this stretch of southern Italy have stayed so low for so long: the offshoring of production to Asia and Eastern Europe over the last two decades, which intensified local competition for fewer orders and forced factory owners to drive down prices. In recent years, some luxury companies have started to bring production back to Puglia, Mr. Fumarola said. But he believed that power is still firmly in the hands of the brands, not suppliers already operating on wafer-thin margins. The temptation for factory owners to then use sub-suppliers or home workers, or save money by defrauding their workers or the government, was hard to resist.Add to that a longstanding antipathy for regulation, high instances of irregular unemployment and fragmented systems of employment protection, and the fact that nonstandard employment has been significantly liberalized by successive labor market reforms since the mid-1990s, and the result is further isolation for those working on the margins.A national election in March swept a new populist government to power in Italy, placing power in the hands of two parties \u2014 the Five Star Movement and the League \u2014 and a proposed \u201cdignity decree\u201d aims to limit the prevalence of short-term job contracts and of firms shifting jobs abroad while simplifying some fiscal rules. For now, however, legislation around a minimum wage does not appear to be on the agenda.Indeed, for women like the unnamed seamstress in Santeramo in Colle, working away on yet another coat at her kitchen table, reform of any sort feels a long way off. Not that she really minded. She would be devastated to lose this additional income, she said, and the work allowed her to spend time with her children. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d she said with a sigh, closing her eyes and raising the palms of her hands. \u201cIt is what it is. This is Italy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Each group was advised by an expert in business or academia. Following are the topics, quotes from the panel leaders and three takeaways from each. \u201cThis whole idea of a glass ceiling is the wrong metaphor, because glass seems easily shatterable. It\u2019s more like a concrete ceiling. What has gotten us here isn\u2019t going to get us to where we want to go. We haven\u2019t yet invented the practices we need to go from here to there,\u201d Molly Anderson, founder and chief executive of Exponential Talent LLCThe importance of top leadership in this field cannot be overstated. Business leaders need to rethink what it means to take risks when advancing women to the top. It\u2019s not \u201ctaking a risk on a woman.\u201d It\u2019s making it a priority and changing the system.The risk here isn\u2019t making a mistake on one person by perhaps putting them in a role too early, the risk is losing out to other business leaders on a whole talent pool because you didn\u2019t tap into it.The only way to get policymakers to make legislative change around this is to get more women and allies to run for office. This means not only encouraging people to run but also teaching them how to do so, so they have a seat at the table.Political leaders must also get more people to vote. This means figuring out how to make it easier to vote, whether that means moving the voting day to a weekend day or encouraging voting by mail.Individuals need to have personal agency and recognize that their career and future are their own, taking an active role in it and responsibility for it. You\u2019ve got to be asking for opportunities and rethinking how you are asking for feedback. Trying new approaches if a previous approach did not work.This also means taking responsibility to support other women in the work force. This could be mentoring or sponsoring others, or rewriting the rules of what you have control over.Just because someone in that role previously traveled on weekends doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the way it has to be done. Wherever we are in the scope of management, we can change the rules and set precedents and be transparent about it.\u201cThere\u2019s a huge gap between intention and action. There are those who don\u2019t want to do the right thing. But there are people who want to do the right thing and don\u2019t get around to it, much like voting or healthy eating.\u201d Iris Bohnet, Roy E. Larsen professor, academic dean and co-director, Women and Public Policy Program, Harvard Kennedy School Don\u2019t let the work of calling out unconscious bias fall to the same people over and over: Assign a rotating role such as \u201cprocess czar\u201d in meetings so that everyone internalizes and is accountable for enforcing expectations about not interrupting colleagues or not echoing ideas without giving credit.Consider how technology can help: Once you\u2019ve established expectations for how meetings will be conducted, include those expectations or a link to them in every meeting invitation that goes out, and send immediate follow-up surveys to assess how inclusive meetings or other activities truly were. Emphasize transparency in processes, incentives and outcomes.Make sure that potential outcomes of policies are considered through a variety of diverse lenses, and eliminate or adjust policies that lead to preferential outcomes for certain groups. For example, expand definitions of family care to account for unconventional support structures. Insist on inclusive budgeting, so that resources are proportionally allocated based on outcomes. Restrict the donations you accept to groups and individuals who promote outcome-focused inclusivity.In the workplace, try to flag biased behaviors in the moment, or shortly thereafter, and support others who call out co-workers for biased behaviors. To be able to assess your own biases and recognize them in others, take responsibility for to educating yourself, rather than waiting for your employer to provide training. Taking an active role in civic life is also necessary to create systemic change. Vote in elections, run for office and lobby in favor of policies that could have a wider impact.\u201cProgress on gender equality in corporate America is slow, we desperately need more women in boardrooms. Women are needed in these positions not only to enhance corporate performance but also to advocate for equal pay, fair promotions and help safeguard against sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace.\u201d Debra L. Lee, the former chief executive and chairman emeritus of BET NetworksChief executives must make it a priority to promote diversity among their leadership and on boards. Companies should aim for women and minorities to make up half of their board members \u2014 given the makeup of the nation and most companies\u2019 consumers \u2014 and they should implement term limits, as the lack of turnover on boards is a big reason they remain so homogeneous.The search criteria for new directors should be broadened, and bigger slates featuring younger people, women and minorities should be offered over all.Individuals can urge institutional investors and companies to hold boards accountable on diversity and personally invest in companies with diverse boards. Women and minorities seeking board positions at large public companies can build their profiles by serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations, particularly on audit committees.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to think we\u2019re doing this work just for someone else but this has everything to do with you, your family, your children if they\u2019re a boy or girl. This work is about all of us.\u201d Jeff Barth, senior director of Men Advocating Real Change at CatalystWe talk often about the power of mentorship. We talk less about the importance of reverse mentorship: being open to guidance and seeking feedback from people who are junior to you on all sorts of matters, including gender equality. Accepting open and honest feedback from women or employees from underrepresented groups helps elevate their voices and promote a culture of inclusion. This process can also help in redefining the sort of qualifications and credibility that are often subconsciously shaping managers\u2019 choices for potential candidates for hire or promotion, and sometimes biasing those choices toward men.The levers of government can be a powerful tool for influencing the sort of employment policies that shape gender relations. Policymakers can do so directly through raising the bar via legislation in areas like parental leave, and indirectly, by demanding certain standards from the companies that contract with the government. A focus on mandatory paid parental leave, for men and women, would give both a chance to not have their roles defined for them.Biases aren\u2019t bad or evil. We all have them. Recognizing and embracing our biases is crucial to understanding how they influence us. Listening to others\u2019 perspectives is the first step toward confronting your own biases. This may at times put you in an uncomfortable place. Embrace that discomfort and the idea that you may have blind spots that you haven\u2019t considered. And then engage those blind spots by inviting women and underrepresented people to speak.\u201cThe sad truth about this is it\u2019s a problem where it\u2019s happening every day to too many people. I think we can make some progress, but it requires understanding. It\u2019s a really, really big problem to solve.\u201d Marianne Cooper, sociologist at Stanford University\u2019s VMware Women\u2019s Leadership Innovation LabWhen leaders take a stand, sexual harassment tends to occur less. Company leaders should establish a culture in which talking about sexual harassment is encouraged, and not punished. This does not mean simply including language in the employee manual. Every employee should understand what sexual harassment is, and there should be a system for people to immediately call out troubling behavior. For example, a \u201cred-yellow-green\u201d color system for categorizing behavior as acceptable or problematic could increase awareness and halt bad behavior in the moment.Education is crucial to changing a culture in which sexual harassment is allowed or dismissed as \u201cboys will be boys,\u201d or as girls\u2019 being seen as overly sensitive. And that training needs to happen at a young age. About half of girls report experiencing sexual harassment in school. Policymakers should establish sexual harassment education beginning as early as kindergarten and continuing through high school, based on research and what will be effective.If you see something, say something: Every person can take action by speaking up \u2014 when you experience sexual harassment or when you observe it. If you witness an incident in a meeting that strikes you as problematic, pull the woman (or man) aside afterward and ask, \u201cAre you O.K.?\u201d It\u2019s also important to understand hierarchy and be cognizant of your own privilege; the chief executive of a company will be better positioned to call out bad behavior than a first-year associate. If you are in a position of power, use it to benefit others who could face repercussions for speaking out.\u201cSometimes pay disparity happens in organizations because people really haven\u2019t even looked. You have to look at your numbers. And then, the accountability piece is, you have to explain them.\u201d Hannah Riley Bowles, co-director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School To address the gender pay gap, companies need to be transparent and accountable concerning their pay and hiring practices. But companies should not be penalized for what this data shows. Instead, they should be encouraged to make progress.Employees should also understand how their earnings compare to industry standards. They also should not be afraid to ask for transparency about how their salary compares to colleagues or face retaliation for these questions.The United States could consider adopting Britain\u2019s gender pay-gap policies. These regulations require companies with 250 or more employees to publicly disclose salary data and any wage gap based on gender. It could be beneficial to require companies to adopt flexible work policies.Individuals should have conversations with three people inside and outside their organization regarding compensation. They should seek out situations where people feel the most comfortable and are the most likely to be transparent. Then, they should use these discussions to determine, to the best of their ability, how much their peers are being paid. Additionally, they should take advantage of online databases and consult with their companies\u2019 human resources departments to determine the general salary range for their position.\u201cOur solutions have to be that every woman is not dealing with it individually. It\u2019s not only a personal issue, but a social good. We have to come up with collective solutions.\u201d Lori Nishiura Mackenzie, executive director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford UniversityTo ensure that consistent and fair opportunities are provided to parents over the course of their careers, corporate managers from the executive level down have a responsibility in recognizing that a variety of current managerial, technological and cultural norms must change. To begin, organizations must offer paid leave to all employees seeking family or medical leave.Additionally, work (including tasks, titles and organizational structure) can be structured so that it benefits working parents as well as the organization. Flexible schedules, or investments in telecommuting technologies, could assist in this.Finally, policies alone won\u2019t work. Working parents and their needs should be supported, regardless of gender \u2014 and that support should be publicly communicated \u2014 by both female and particularly male executives.Policy directed toward working parents often starts and stops at maternity leave offered immediately after a child\u2019s birth. That benefit should be expanded to both parents and primary caregivers, with added incentives to encourage parents concerned to take the time.But policymakers should also consider that parenting doesn\u2019t stop after infancy. Offering reliable universal child care, aligned with the workday, could assist in supporting working parents and working economies. Finally, policies against parental discrimination, not just gender discrimination, should be instituted and enforced.For individuals, one change of perception is vital: In the office, on the factory floor or anywhere work is done, the working parent must be considered the norm, not the exception. That is reality.If you are a parent, being open about your own joys and struggles will help normalize parenthood. It\u2019s all right to choose to prioritize your family.Finally, appreciate what skills and values a co-worker can bring as a parent, such as strong time management, flexibility and desire to build strong relationships.\u201cContinuing to admire the problem is no longer an option. These are industrywide problems and they require industrywide solutions.\u201d Barbara Whye, chief diversity and inclusion officer at IntelUse data to get know who your people are beyond gender, with an eye toward solutions for a more equitable work culture.Do not put the burden of creating a more inclusive work space on the minority employees. Instead, deploy allies to be ambassadors within their own circles. Encourage \u201cally events\u201d to expand conversation beyond identity groups.Create opportunities for safe spaces in which dialogue and open discussion can grant employees the opportunities to air issues, and for others to ask questions and learn how to be better colleagues.Rather than looking for the \u201cbest person for the job,\u201d consider the best person for the team, focusing on richer diversity of perspectives.To build a more inclusive culture, it is incumbent upon policymakers to look at each decision through an intersectional lens (one that takes into account the unique barriers to equality facing people of color, disabled people and neurodivergent people, LGBTQ+ people and those of different socioeconomic backgrounds). Advance legislation guaranteeing equality in pay and salary transparency.Political leaders must become champions of bipartisan conversations around actionable solutions to problems beyond those that affect only their own demographics. Stop expecting underrepresented people to be the change agents. We need our political leaders to take the onus off the marginalized to enact cultural change.Speak up for those whose voices are not centered in conversations having to do with power and decision-making. Be willing to learn, and from what you learn, teach. Accept that every person is on a continuum of learning about experiences beyond their own.Call out misunderstanding, stereotyping and small-minded thinking in the spaces you occupy, not with anger or irritation, but rather by providing space for a more nuanced conversation about identity. You are the best catalyst for change within your own demographics.\u201cYou do have to have a leader that is committed. It is really hard to make change unless your C.E.O. wants to make change. what we\u2019re missing is the critical gap between commitment and action.\u201d Julie Sweet, chief executive officer \u2014 North America, Accenture Accountability is key to making sure that company leaders include women, minorities and persons with disabilities in making decisions and developing strategy. This can be done through methods like regular audits or tying diversity metrics to bonuses and benefits.Company leaders should ensure that women and minorities are included in decision-making. They should consistently encourage staff members to speak up about whether or not initiatives are being implemented sufficiently, then make corrections when necessary.These conversations can be difficult, but sometimes those are the most necessary ones to have.Incentives are sometimes a necessary policy addition to promote inclusion. Benefits like tax credits or breaks for small businesses that are developing systems that successfully create a culture of inclusion can help advance the mission.Individuals can support inclusion in the workplace, by being positive role models, leading by example and embracing mentorship.Take time to welcome and meet with people who don\u2019t look like you, and attend affinity meetings for communities you aren\u2019t a part of. Your presence at these gatherings can show your commitment to working together.Take the opportunity to learn and grow from these conversations, and use your voice to amplify others in situations where they may not have the same level of privilege as yourself.It\u2019s important to know that even if you are a member of an underrepresented group, you can have blind spots. Everyone can benefit from talking to people from a diversity of backgrounds, taking stock of what stories, narratives and experiences are not represented and working to change that.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Vicenza, Italy\u2019s Capital of Gold", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVICENZA, Italy \u2014 Vicenza is quaintly medieval at its center, a dense jumble of old butter-toned dwellings along narrow byways that occasionally give way to some of the Renaissance\u2019s most elegant architecture, but these structures mask an industrial might that has made this small city Italy\u2019s most productive capital of jewelry.\u201cWe were born to do this kind of thing,\u201d said Roberto Coin, whose namesake company is one of Vicenza\u2019s most successful brands worldwide. \u201cWe were born to create beauty, we were born to create new ideas. It\u2019s in our DNA. It\u2019s what we know how to do.\u201d Nearly 10 percent of the 100,000-plus population is employed in the jewelry sector, and teenagers can replace high school with jewelry studies at the Scuola d\u2019Arte e Mestieri.The local legacy of jewelry-making predates even the cobbled streets: As far back as 600 B.C., the Vicentini were crafting clothing fasteners, called fibula, and other ornaments in bronze. But it was the 14th century, with its emphasis on craft and guilds (and a 1339 statute recognizing the goldsmiths\u2019 fraglia, or guild), that crowned Vicenza as a prominent center of the jewelry arts and made its jewelers\u2019 guild a political force among the nobles and merchants \u2014 and of city society to this day.Vicenza\u2019s heart is the Piazza dei Signori, the bustling former Roman forum whose vast, stone-paved square is home to a centuries-old weekly market, a legion of aperitivo bars where evening crowds gather in this wine-loving town, and the storefronts of 10 independent jewelry businesses.There were 15 such shops on this piazza already in the 1300s; Soprana, the house that today has been at its piazza location the longest, was founded in 1770 by the family of jewelers that had made the famed precious crown for a statue of the Virgin Mary in the Church of St. Mary of Monte Berico nearby.The piazza is dominated by the slightly leaning (but still functioning) 14th-century Bissara clock tower; by two towering columns, topped by statues of Christ the Redeemer and the winged lion that symbolizes Venice, the lagoon city about 50 miles east that ruled Vicenza in the 15th century; and by the 16th-century Basilica Palladiana, with its stately double row of white marble arches by Andrea Palladio, the most influential architect of the Renaissance and Vicenza\u2019s most illustrious resident.\u201cMore than economic value, the museum provides cultural value,\u201d Alba Cappellieri, the director, said. \u201cThe museum has enhanced the status of Vicenza as a jewelry capital, as it was intended to.\u201dAlong with help from the city (which lends the Basilica Palladiana space) and some industry sponsors, the museum is funded primarily by the Italian Exhibition Group, which holds Vicenzaoro, the local jewelry trade show that attracts more exhibitors and attendees than any other in Italy. The twice-yearly event, scheduled to open Saturday, is held at the Fiera di Vicenza fairgrounds outside the city center. It drew more than 56,000 visitors in 2017, with 18,000 of them coming in January. By comparison, the January event this year attracted 23,000.\u201cIt\u2019s not about being the largest fair,\u201d said Matteo Marzotto, the exhibition group\u2019s vice president. In 1836, his family began Marzotto Tessuti, now Italy\u2019s leading producer of fabric and one of the reasons Vicenza is also a major supplier of textiles and fashion.\u201cWhat we want to be is the most beautiful fair, to offer three days of business when visitors can experience the Italian lifestyle,\u201d he said, pointing at the charms of the Piazza dei Signori, where he was sitting at El Coq, the city\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurant. (Growth, however, is still a priority, so with exhibitor and visitor numbers increasing, construction is scheduled to begin in 2019 on a fairgrounds pavilion of almost 540,000 square feet, a 20 percent expansion.)Deeply linked to the territory\u2019s jewelry industry, Vicenzaoro is a particularly proud showcase for hometown brands such as Pesavento, Fope and Roberto Coin, although vendors come from around the world to sell.A city that suffered heavy bombings and deprivation during World War II (other Italians have taunted the townspeople as mangiagatti, or cat eaters), Vicenza never lost its connection to the goldsmith\u2019s art, and the economy revived in the 1950s and \u201960s as it combined its long jewelry tradition with industrial and technological innovation, helped along by American investment in the area, including the construction of a United States military base.By the 1970s, Vicenza was thriving amid a boom in European and American jewelry sales; the numbers of artisan ateliers surged, while factories turned out large quantities of jewelry and particularly of chains \u2014 thanks to machines invented locally, said Cristina del Mare, a jewelry historian and one of the Museo del Gioiello\u2019s curators. This combination of skilled craftspeople and technology also established the city as the workshop for some of the best-known brands, including Gucci, Tiffany & Co. and Herm\u00e8s.\u201cWe\u2019re very advanced technologically here, but what makes the difference is our manual skill,\u201d said Chiara Carli, who along with Marino Pesavento founded Pesavento 26 years ago at the Centro Orafa Vicentina, a complex on the city outskirts that houses 40 companies. The business creates dramatically Italianate jewelry with an emphasis on chains, combining the machine-made and 3-D-printed with the hand-assembled and finished.\u201cHandcraft is still 80 percent of the work here,\u201d Ms. Carli said as she leaned over a woman in a blue smock who was delicately laser-soldering a silver chain, link by link. But Pesavento also represents the latest chapter of Vicenza\u2019s story: the adjustment since the 2008 downturn to a weakened Italian economy and difficult global market.Pesavento sells jewels of plated silver, not solid gold, and many are accented with the brand\u2019s signature polveri di sogni, a dab of carbon microparticles that impart the shimmer of black diamonds at a much lower price. In general today, Vicenza\u2019s companies are marketing products that are less expensive than what they previously offered, but still reflect Italian style and know-how. \u201cWith the crisis, we were obliged to become much more business-minded about what we do,\u201d Ms. Carli said.\u201cGlobalization has killed Italy,\u201d said Mr. Coin, who says his export business remains strong despite competition from countries with lower production costs. \u201cThe bigger got bigger; the smaller got smaller or disappeared.\u201d His business falls on the bigger side, while most of Vicenza\u2019s jewelry houses have been small, family-style operations. Mr. Coin estimates that there were around 5,300 jewelry businesses in the city when he started in 1977; today, there are 851.Still, Vicenza has held on to its position better than jewelry-making outposts in France, Spain and Germany, he noted, thanks to superior craftsmanship and the standard of Italian style. \u201cVicenza must express the italianit\u00e0 it did in the past,\u201d he said, a lit cigarette in one hand as he sipped an espresso at his desk. \u201cThe world expects expressions of beauty and quality from us.\u201dIt\u2019s easy to feel the italianit\u00e0 of the past in Vicenza. Tourists flock to town to see Palladio\u2019s harmoniously symmetrical Renaissance buildings: the basilica; the Teatro Olimpico, a 1585 marvel that recreates an ancient amphitheater as an indoor playhouse; and other Unesco-protected sites.Yet visitors might easily miss one of the most resonant examples of architecture: Vicenza in miniature, circa 1577, the year the town council commissioned Palladio to design a small model of the city. Just about two feet in diameter and with 300 tiny buildings, the model was painstakingly created in sterling silver by Vicenza\u2019s jewelers, requiring more than 2,000 hours of handwork. An offering to the Virgin Mary for the cessation of the plague, it was destroyed by Napoleon\u2019s troops in 1797.But in 2011 the city had the model recreated, using its appearance in several Renaissance paintings as a guide. Today, it sits in a spotlit case at the Diocesan Museum \u2014 a silent, gleaming votive to the unending gospel of jewelry-making in Vicenza.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, Humiliated by Attack, Vow to Retaliate", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Soldiers in dress uniform lay prone in the street. Others, apparently heavily armed, faced the assailants, then threw themselves to the ground without firing back. Some just ran for their lives.Captured on video and widely shared on social media, the attack over the weekend on an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps parade in Iran was a humiliating blow. A local Arab separatist group claimed responsibility, but Iran said the perpetrators were backed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.On Monday, Iranian officials vowed revenge against all three countries and Israel.The attack has escalated tensions between Iran and the Persian Gulf states and their American allies. The Trump White House has taken a hard line against Iran, withdrawing from a nuclear agreement and imposing sanctions that have damaged Iran\u2019s flailing economy.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have clashed with Iran over Yemen, Qatar and Syria. The conflicts are expected to take center stage at the United Nations General Assembly this week.The Islamic State claimed responsibility with bulletins on its Amaq news service, which also ran the video of the fighters. But the video did not explicitly say the attackers belonged to the Islamic State, nor did they pledge allegiance to the group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as similar claims from the group have done in the past.Iranian news accounts said there had been at least four assailants, who disguised themselves in Iranian uniforms and attacked from behind the viewing bleachers at the parade. They said three of the assailants had been killed and one captured.Iranian officials provided no evidence that the countries they blamed were behind the attack. The United States and the Emirates issued statements dismissing the accusation.But the attack came at a volatile time in Iran\u2019s relations with those countries.Analysts said the Revolutionary Guards, an elite militia that operates independently of the Iranian government, were bound to react strongly to such a public humiliation.\u201cThey\u2019re going to go for a strong reaction to remedy the horrible image this attack has given them, the imagery that they are running away, falling down on the ground and so on,\u201d said Ahmad Moussalli, a regional expert and professor of political science at the American University of Beirut. \u201cThey could correct that with a heavy military blow somewhere.\u201dHe said that he doubted the Revolutionary Guards would risk a direct military confrontation with the Emirates or Saudi Arabia and that the response would more likely occur in Syria or Iraq. The attack, though embarrassing, Mr. Moussalli said, \u201cshows that the gulf and the United States is targeting Iran now, and gives Iran a pretext to flex their military power.\u201dThe Emirates were not the only regional power cheering on internal resistance to the Iranian government recently.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, suggested a year ago that it was time to turn from external pressure on Iran to internal pressure. Prince Mohammed, in repeated interviews in the United States this year, also likened Ayatollah Khamenei to Hitler, saying at one point, \u201cI believe the Iranian supreme leader makes Hitler look good.\u201dAfter attacks in Tehran last year, the Revolutionary Guards said that Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States were responsible, but most government officials blamed terrorists. This time, Iranian leaders described the attack not as terrorism, but as an act of foreign aggression \u2014 a significant difference, said Hussein Allawi, a national security analyst at Al Nahrain University in Iraq.\u201cThe Iranian authorities denied that a terrorist organization did the operation,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead it accused states in the Middle East of carrying out the operation, even though signs of terrorism in the operation were clear.\u201dDespite the bellicose language from the supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards in Iran, other officials seemed to adopt a more cautious reaction, at least initially.Speaking at the funeral for the Ahvaz victims on Monday, the deputy commander of Iran\u2019s regular army, Brig. Gen. Nozar Nemati, said it was too early to say whether Western intelligence agencies had been involved in the attack, and suggested it may have originated closer to home.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Falih Hassan from Baghdad, and Rukmini Callimachi from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Next Downturn Will Surprise Us", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn their campaign to contain the risks that caused the Great Recession, central bankers may have planted the seeds for the next global economic crisis.Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer. After the fall of Lehman Brothers 10 years ago, there was a public debate about how the leading American banks had grown \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d But that debate overlooked the larger story, about how the global markets where stocks, bonds and other financial assets are traded had grown worrisomely large. Today the markets are even larger, having grown to 360 percent of global G.D.P., a record high. And financial authorities \u2014 trained to focus more on how markets respond to economic risk than on the risks that markets pose to the economy \u2014 have been inadvertently fueling this new threat. Central bankers and other regulators have largely succeeded in containing the practice that caused disaster in 2008: risky mortgage lending by big banks. But with so much easy money sloshing around in global markets, new threats were bound to emerge \u2014 in places the regulators aren\u2019t watching as closely.Within the $290 trillion global financial markets, there are hundreds of new risks, pools of potentially troubled debt. Among the most troubling: corporate borrowers and so-called non-bank lenders all over the world.As bank lending dried up, more and more companies began raising money by selling bonds, and many of those bonds are now held by these non-bank lenders \u2014 mainly money managers such as bond funds, pension funds or insurance companies.Among corporations listed on the S.&P. 500 index, debt has tripled since 2010 to one and a half times annual earnings \u2014 near the historic peaks reached during the recessions of the early 1990s and 2000s. And in some parts of the bond markets, debt loads are much higher.One of the big corporate risks is developing largely beyond regulatory oversight. Some United States companies that were publicly traded in 2008 have since gone private, often precisely in order to avoid intensified scrutiny from regulators. Many of those companies were purchased by private equity firms, in deals that leave the companies saddled with huge debts. Right now the typical American company owned by a private equity firm has debt six times higher than its annual earnings \u2014 or twice the level that a public ratings agency would consider high-risk or \u201cjunk.\u201dAt a time when central banks are holding interest rates at record lows, the return from holding plain vanilla corporate bonds is negligible, so investors are more willing to buy junk, for the higher yields. And this hunt for higher returns has been playing out worldwide as asset managers chase higher returns anywhere they can be found, whether in United States private equity or in the bond markets of Europe and emerging economies like Argentina and Turkey.The biggest risks outside the United States are in China, which has printed by far the most money and issued by far the most debt of any country since 2008, and where regulators have had less success reining in borrowers and lenders. Easy money has fueled bubbles in everything from stocks and bonds to property in China, and it\u2019s hard to see how or when these bubbles might set off a major crisis in an opaque market where most of the borrowers and lenders are backed by the state. But if and when Beijing reaches the point where it can\u2019t print any more money, the bottom could fall out of the economy.More broadly, the trigger to watch is the United States Federal Reserve, since many other central banks in the world tend to follow the Fed\u2019s lead in setting interest rates. Over the last 50 years, every time the Fed has reined in easy money by raising interest rates, a downturn in the markets or the economy has followed eventually. It may take a while, but trouble almost inevitably does come.Many doomsayers worried that the Fed tightening that began in 2004 would help prompt a recession \u2014 and it eventually did, in 2008. Though rates are still historically low in the United States, the Federal Reserve began to raise them more than two years ago and is expected to continue tightening them into next year.If a downturn follows, it is more likely to be a normal recession than another 100-year storm, like 2008. Most economists put the probability of such a recession hitting before the end of 2020 at less than 20 percent. But economists are more often wrong than right. Professional forecasters have missed every recession since such records were first kept in 1968, and one of the many reasons for this is \u201crecency bias\u201d: using economic forecasting models that tend to give too much weight to recent events. They see, for example, that big banks are in much better shape than in 2008, and households are less encumbered by mortgage debt, and so play down the likelihood of another recession. But they are, in effect, preparing to fight the last war.To have any chance of anticipating and preventing the next downturn, regulators must look for the threats that have emerged since 2008. They need to recognize that the markets now play an outsized role in the economy, and their attempts to micromanage this vast sea of money have only pushed the risks away from big American banks and toward new lenders outside the banking system, particularly in the United States and China.Markets have grown so large in part because every time they stumbled, central bankers rescued them with easy money. When markets rose sharply \u2014 as they have in recent years \u2014 the authorities stood by, saying they are not in the business of popping bubbles. Now, the markets are so large it is hard to see how policymakers can lower the risks they pose without precipitating a sharp decline that is bound to damage the economy. It\u2019s a familiar problem: Like the big banks in 2008, the global markets have grown \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It broke a social contract between the plutocrats and everyone else. But it also broke a sense of trust, not just in financial institutions and the government that oversaw them, but in the very idea of experts and expertise. The past 10 years have seen an open revolt against the intelligentsia.Mistrust led to new political movements: the Tea Party for those who didn\u2019t trust the government and Occupy Wall Street for those who didn\u2019t trust big business. These moved Democrats and Republicans away from each other in fundamental ways, and populist attitudes on both ends of the spectrum found champions in the 2016 presidential race in Senator Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump.The depth of financial despair during the Great Recession and the invariably slow recovery have unleashed a sense of bitterness that dominates the political landscape, culminating in Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral victory.What really keeps them up at night, however, is a potential coordinated assault by the Trump administration, E.U. and Japan on their unique model of Chinese \u201cstate capitalism\u201d that has been integral to the country\u2019s economic success over the past 40 years.He\u2019s a former investment banker, and was hired to build a business that could support the red-hot Snapchat app. The result: an ads operation that is expected to produce over $1 billion in revenue this year.Obama-era policies clamped down on how much methane, one of the most powerful greenhouse gases, energy companies could release.

{"Headline": "Agreeing Democracy is Under Strain, Participants at Athens Forum See Reasons to be Optimistic About its Survival", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExcerpts From the ForumAt the Athens Democracy Forum last week, a conference convened by The New York Times in Athens from Sept. 16 to 18, international leaders and policymakers debated a wide range of issues affecting the political health of the globe. Here are excerpts from the discussions. They have been edited and condensed.When we build social media the kind of platforms that we and others build, what they essentially do is dramatically lower the cost of entry for anybody who wants to become media. And so anybody sitting in the audience today with a smartphone could decide that they are now the TV station \u201cAthens Today\u201d and they can go out and they can film stuff and broadcast it live to the world over our server, essentially at no cost to themselves, to a global audience. People have used that lower barrier to entry to create some amazing things. And if we think back over the last few years, there were moments like the Arab Spring when I think a lot of people were celebrating the political convening power of technologies like ours. They brought people together to assert themselves against repressive regimes. We\u2019re now seeing the other side of it, which is people who, I guess, people in this room would feel much more concerned about using exactly the same technology, using the low barrier of entry to come at us. The question now is how do we deal with that? We think it\u2019s a combination of ourselves and governments.What we\u2019ve seen in the last year is concerns about different elections, different countries in the world, with a common thread, which is how relatively easy it is for an organization or, indeed, even a Russian agency, to gain social media to manipulate what people see, and to promote their favorite content, and try and influence the outcome of the elections as a consequence of that. And what we should be looking at in terms of protecting our democracy against that sort of attack is a combination of things. It\u2019s about the transparency of the information that users see. I think it\u2019s about the responsibility of the companies to monitor what\u2019s going on their platform.Sri Lanka has a high literacy rate \u2014 90 percent. But when it comes to media literacy we don\u2019t think critically. When somebody sends us something on WhatsApp, for instance, we\u2019ll often, especially if it\u2019s from a friend, we\u2019ll often forward it on. So how do we get people to stop and think before blindly sharing things? I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve also been trying to do \u2014 we\u2019ve been trying to put infographics on photo and video verification, for example, and trying to push people to think more critically. And when it comes to the role of platforms like Facebook, I guess people in the audience might know that Facebook actually announced they\u2019ve ruled out this misinformation policy for Sri Lanka. So we\u2019ve been in communication with them. We\u2019ve been learning more about the community standards and things like that. So this misinformation policy for Sri Lanka is kind of different to what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world. It basically says that content will be proactively removed if it can be shown to result in real-world harm. Now this is a really progressive policy and a great step. But having said that, given how fast fake news can spread \u2014 you know, for example, it\u2019s sometimes a matter of a couple of hours when things spread on Facebook and WhatsApp. And sometimes even faster. So how effective the new policy that\u2019s going to be in place is, is an open question. But having said that, we think that this policy is really going to be useful and progressive. It\u2019s still a little early to say how successful it will be, but we think it\u2019ll help.One thing has always remained the same \u2014 this is the human soul and heart. The personal journeys of each and every one of us are different, but we do share the same human inclination: When we face somebody in need, we want to help. This is one of the informal norms on which democracies are built. Because apart from laws and institutions, that are of course the foundation of democratic governance, what holds democracies together are also these informal norms, human acts that we all know are right. It is upon these common values of social solidarity, of standing by each other, of helping those in need, that we should try and rebuild our society.I\u2019m seeing an interesting tension between business and social movements, and I do believe that there is a tangible bridge that one can build between the two. I think the core is exclusion or inclusion. If you\u2019re able to say which part of that spectrum you want to be part of, then you are part of the problem or part of the solution. Exclusion caused the Arab Spring, caused Brexit, caused all sorts of populist movements that we\u2019re seeing everywhere. I think if we\u2019re able to have businesses take that first step, if businesses are able to come forward and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the solution that I can be part of the solution? What do I need to do? Can we use these goals \u2014 zero poverty, zero net carbon emissions, zero unemployment, zero inequality \u2014 and put them into business objectives?\u201d That will make businesses really meaningful and inclusive.We are a company, so obviously we do have to make a profit. But the objective is to make a fair profit, to manufacture without harming mankind. Also, some portion of the profit should be earmarked to protect and safeguard the world. I want to try and act as a temporary guardian of these places. This is the great dream. In our business we are trying to set up not globalization, but rather the universalism of man. We want to have respect for religions, for different cultures, for places. Pericles held a very important, fascinating speech in 400 B.C., where he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the way we do things here in Athens.\u201d And then he made a list of all the things that they do in Athens. And the very last sentence is, \u201cOur city is open to the world, and we never kick out anybody.\u201d We really need to be so brave as to be open to the world. We are a company \u2014 we have to make a profit, but without harming mankind in the process. This is what really matters.I was elected to the Tunisian Confederation for Business. When I was elected, I called the general secretary of the union. I said to him: \u201cWe have to be together. We have to dialogue. We have to sit together. And we have to find solutions to all our conflicts.\u201d We had this idea of a road map, a solution for Tunisia \u2014 how we can finish the constitution, how we can have democratic elections and how we can also have answers for young people. When they took to the streets in 2011 they asked for democracy, they asked for dignity and they asked for jobs. I think we have this feeling that we have to do something for our country. We didn\u2019t do everything for our country, but I think we launched a challenge, how we can achieve democracy with dialogue.Authoritarians are working to refashion the internet from technology that promotes freedom to a tool of oppression. This is being done through the use of disinformation, internet shutdowns, arrests and the blocking of political information.A growing number of countries are manipulating content to impact elections. In most cases, it\u2019s actually governments that are trying to maintain power, or political parties that want to come into power. In order to deal with fake news and disinformation, countries are trying to legislate solutions. But these types of laws are deeply problematic. In all of these instances, the authorities are saying that they are trying to combat gossip and fake news. This becomes a problem in environments where criticism of the government is considered fake news.More and more governments are shutting down the internet completely in times of crisis, whether that be during elections or during political protests. China is building infrastructure in its neighborhood and in different African and Eurasian countries that could expose internet traffic to greater monitoring by the Chinese authorities.I still see the internet as holding an unprecedented liberating power. We\u2019ve seen it in Russia, where activists have been using YouTube to expose human rights abuses. We\u2019ve seen it in the right-to-drive movement in Saudi Arabia. We need to work together to combat emerging challenges to internet freedom.I\u2019m going to begin by saying something very shocking to some of you. I actually believe that liberal democracy is a very good thing, contrary to what some of you may think. At the same time it\u2019s very clear it\u2019s facing some challenges.But I do believe that if you look at the longer history of humanity, the directions are still very clear. Whenever societies develop a strong middle class, the middle class wants to be represented, and the best way to represent the middle class is through a liberal democratic regime. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean the history is going to go in one simple direction. If you ask me if I\u2019m optimistic that by the end of this century we\u2019ll have a world which is thriving with democracy, I say, yes, I\u2019m optimistic. But I\u2019m also going to tell you about the challenges we will face on the way.I think the problem that we are facing with liberal democracies is a result not of what we call the illiberal, but the failure of the liberal to understand the three big structural changes that have happened in the world. The full structural challenge is that we are coming to what I call the end of an artificial 200-year period of Western domination of world history. And liberalism travels on the power of its ideas, but it also travels on the back of the economic, military and political power that the West had. Now Western power is receding. So you now have got to market liberal democracy in a different way.That\u2019s structural challenge number one.Structural challenge number two: When I grew up in the poorest society in Singapore as a child in the 1960s, liberal democracies looked like Gardens of Eden. And when I was 13 years old, you had John F. Kennedy as president. And you can imagine what a source of inspiration he was. Now, today you\u2019ve gone from John F. Kennedy to Donald Trump. And you expect us to believe that liberal democracy is still as attractive as ever. So clearly you have to address this challenge, too.And third \u2014 and this is a somewhat provocative point I want to make here \u2014 the difficulties that liberals have in trying to understand the world of today and with the end of Western domination, is that liberals like to live in what I call a \u201cliberal bubble\u201d and talk to other liberals, and have a somewhat intolerance for non-liberal voices.Can you imagine a dialogue today based on mutual respect, let\u2019s say between a representative of the United States and a representative of China, without a representative of the United States condemning China for saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have our form of government now?\u201dIf a British utilitarian philosopher from the 18th century was alive today, and you asked him to name the one society that has delivered the greatest improvement of human happiness in the last 30 years, it\u2019s China.So how do you bring China into the conversation if you want to talk about the world of tomorrow? That\u2019s the problem. So the liberals have got to come out of their bubble and deal with other voices on this planet.Democracy, as you know, is when the representatives are chosen through free elections, and kept under watch by \u2014 as the president of Greece explained \u2014 by strong checks and balances, the independence of the judiciary able to protect basic human rights, like free speech, parliament, also freedom of the press, academic freedom and so on. So that\u2019s the system. And today the majority of human beings are under democratic regimes that may be very different from each other\u2019s, some more effective than others.But we had an improvement of democracy around the world, with some setbacks recently that we need to speak about.So why it\u2019s good in a nutshell, as Churchill said, is that \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.\u201dSo we need to keep this quote in mind in order to make sure that people don\u2019t have romantic hopes about democracy. It will not deliver everything, but it will do better than the other systems. So the main advantage of democracy to me, it is protecting people against two insecurities \u2014 two sources of violence: anarchy and tyranny, chaos and despotism. So if you want to be protected by both, choose a democratic system.If you look at the president of my adopted country, the United States, you may have noticed that he doesn\u2019t appear to be, let\u2019s say, overly fond of Muslims. When you look at another populist, Recep Erdogan, the president of Turkey, you might\u2019ve noticed that he doesn\u2019t appear to be overly fond of anybody who\u2019s not a Muslim.There are some populists who are very right-wing on the economy, who want to slash the welfare state and who like to serve big corporations. There are others who are very left-wing on the economy, people like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his handpicked successor, Nicolas M\u00e1duro, in Venezuela, who want to bolster the welfare state, but who rail against big corporations. They don\u2019t have that in common either.So does it make sense to speak of populists as a unitary item? I think it does. Because what they do have in common is a conception of politics in which they say the only real reason that we have problems today is because the political elite is corrupt and self-serving, and they need to be thrown out of office. But since you don\u2019t want to admit that you\u2019ve overpromised, you start to blame. You start to blame everything that goes wrong on the media, which are apparently fake news and need to be cowed and regulated. You start to blame it on the opposition, who supposedly are traitors. You start to blame it on independent institutions like law enforcement agencies or the courts, who supposedly are enemies of the people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Edgy Investors Are Retreating From Risky Economies ", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn stark contrast to the U.S., where a bull market continues, investors are pulling out of developing economies as the economic and financial risks mount. Cratering currencies, rising inflation, jumpy investors: A financial panic is again gripping some of the world\u2019s developing economies. When we\u2019ve seen this before \u2014\u00a0in the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, the Thai baht collapse of 1997 and the Russian default of 1998 \u2014 investors had to contend with spillover of trouble from one country to others, dragging down economic growth or causing market stress. ArgentinaOne of South America\u2019s largest economies, Argentina spent much of the last two decades locked out of global markets, in the aftermath of its 2001 financial meltdown.But the 2015 election of President Mauricio Macri was a turning point. He focused on returning the country to the good graces of international investors, by removing restrictions on the flow of capital in and out of the country, and reaching settlements with creditors still owed money since the 2001 collapse.Argentina was able to regain access to the bond market in April 2016, when it raised $16.5 billion from international investors. Once it did, Argentina repeatedly turned to global investors, tempting them with high bond yields and pledges to gradually bring the country\u2019s spending problems under control. TurkeyThe Turkish economy enjoyed a ripping run over the much of the last decade. Growth has averaged roughly 6.8 percent since 2010, beating the world economy\u2019s 3.9 percent and other emerging markets, according to I.M.F. data.But much of that economic pep depended on a debt-fueled bubble. Turkish companies have binged on bonds, much of them denominated in the dollar and the euro. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government has been spending, too, subsidizing big-ticket infrastructure projects. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly railed against high interest rates as the economy shows signs of slowing. And his growing control over economic policy \u2014 he installed his son-in-law as finance minister \u2014 has investors nervous about his strongman approach. President Trump\u2019s August decision to double the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports seemed a catalyst for investors to beat a rapid retreat out of the country. Now, with the lira down about 40 percent against the dollar since Mr. Erdogan\u2019s re-election, companies that are earning lira but have to repay debts in dollars are struggling. Bankruptcies of Turkish corporations are expected to rise, and many economists now think Turkey will soon to fall into a recession.South AfricaBut in recent years, it has benefited from an influx of money from foreign investors. Much of that went to the government, which has tried to offset the nation\u2019s stark inequality \u2014 it is one of the world\u2019s most unequal countries \u2014 with large-scale social spending.As a result, the country\u2019s external debts grew to roughly 50 percent of gross domestic product last year, from 37 percent in 2013. Much of that borrowing has been done via markets, making those investments much easier to dump when the going gets rough.RussiaRussia\u2019s problems with global markets are fairly idiosyncratic. Since January 2017, the Trump administration has mostly continued the Obama administration\u2019s policy of imposing sanctions on individuals with ties to the country, citing issues such as aggression in Ukraine, interference in American elections, support for Syria\u2019s Assad regime, the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter with a chemical weapon in England, and trade with North Korea.As global investors factored in the country\u2019s increased isolation from the world economy, the ruble fell 18 percent this year. (Simply put, less integration and trade with Russia mean less demand for rubles, which you need to buy Russian goods.)A weak currency makes imports more expensive. Russian inflation, while low, has picked up, and interest rates are rising, both of which could be a drag on growth. The Russian government plans to increase government spending in an effort to keep the economy grinding ahead. In theory, Russia\u2019s relatively low debt level \u2014 government debt is less than 20 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 allows it plenty of breathing room to spend more on roads, health care and social welfare, as long as it can dig up the money somewhere.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Where does all this stop? No one is sure. It could be that the countries being battered may simply suffer from unique vulnerabilities to market pressure. It\u2019s also possible that other countries will become the next focus for jittery investors eager to avoid losses. But predicting precisely where things will spread isn\u2019t simple. Sure, there are some clues for what to look for. Investors are already looking askance at countries that owe a lot of money in foreign currency, for example. Screening for that kind of vulnerability would have identified Turkey as a potential problem spot. The amount of such hard-currency debt to be paid off, however, is only part of the story. The level of interest rates, the reliance on foreign borrowers, refinancing needs, the size of government deficits and the stockpiles of foreign currency that can be used to push back market pressures all play a role. Perhaps most important, and most difficult to measure, is a country\u2019s credibility with financial markets. If investors believe a country will continue to pay its bondholders in a currency that retains its value, they will likely put up with even the ugliest-looking levels of debt. If that trust starts to fray, look out below. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sarah Lucas, Unmasked: From Perverse to Profound", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "Not widely known on this side of the Atlantic, the British sculptor has a show at the New Museum this fall that may cause jaws to drop.Supported by\u201cA rude woman is really what we need right now,\u201d a veteran of the New York art scene said to me last May, just weeks before several assertive female political candidates started to emerge and even win some primaries.Over the years, I don\u2019t think any artist\u2019s work has shocked me \u2014 mostly in good ways \u2014 as often as Ms. Lucas\u2019s. Some of her pieces have initially made me wonder if they are art or some kind of dirty joke. Their unrelentingly challenging attitude is among their strengths.A photograph taken by Ana Cuba that Ms. Lucas staged for this article alludes to these materials: A ball of white fluff is held atop her head by a bank robber\u2019s mask of pantyhose, turning her into a kind of Lucas sculpture. Whether intentionally or not, the image seems to parody the flawless Hollywood studio portraits of yore and also evokes the \u201cfascinator\u201d hats favored by British upper-class women at royal weddings.After \u201cFreeze,\u201d Ms. Lucas said she wavered in her commitment to making art. \u201cI had no idea whether I was any good,\u201d she said in June, when she was in New York, preparing her show. We were chatting in my apartment, over white wine from a bottle she had brought with her.She wasn\u2019t even sure what art was for. She said the issue bothered her quite a bit. Also, the male Y.B.A.s were getting most of the attention. \u201cI was quite reconciled to people not being so interested in me, but that freed me up,\u201d she said. \u201cI could experiment with materials, only pleasing myself.\u201d She came to realize, she added, that \u201cI could really have a lot of fun, humor, between me and me.\u201dSince then, Ms. Lucas\u2019s art has specialized in rudeness \u2014 although unvarnished honesty with a moral undertone may be more accurate. The phallus \u2014 whose depiction in Western art has been one of the most persistent taboos since the end of the Classical era \u2014 is a ubiquitous form in her work. (You might think that she wants to equal the attention male artists have lavished upon female breasts throughout history.) Intercourse is frequently intimated, and a tender sarcasm is the prevailing tone. Titles can include profanities and other slang learned on the streets of Islington, the London borough where she grew up. Her materials are cheap and familiar: old furniture, toilets, cinder blocks, underwear, cans of Spam and the stuffed pantyhose. Cars, traditionally a male obsession, also figure in: variously crushed, bisected, burned or carefully collaged with a layer of cigarettes, as are other objects. Fruits and vegetables, kebabs and whole raw chickens do double service, portraying erotic body parts.All of which may startle Americans, who tend to be more prudish than the British. Also, while Ms. Lucas\u2019s work has been seen in museums and galleries all over Europe \u2014 and represented Britain at the Venice Art Biennale in 2015 \u2014 she has had only five solo shows in this country, four of them at the Gladstone Gallery in New York.Even if you know how good Ms. Lucas is as an artist, there\u2019s a chance you don\u2019t know all the different ways she\u2019s good, how consistently tough her fusion of politics, aesthetics and the grit of life has been, and how it has deepened over the years, especially formally. Ms. Lucas speaks of \u201cthe necessity of actual boldness\u201d in art.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep that sense of necessity,\u201d she said. She has succeeded to an unusual extent, perhaps partly because she has never had a permanent studio, which may enforce an implicitly improvisatory mode that keeps her work fresh and on edge.There\u2019s also the increasing richness with which her art connects to the history of modern sculpture, beginning with Dada and Surrealism. For starters, her toilets could be seen as female rejoinders to Duchamp\u2019s urinal, and, of course, her work is riddled with variations on the ready-made. Magritte, Louise Bourgeois, Gilbert & George, Martin Kippenberger and especially the sculptor Franz West are among her influences, as well as the humble materials of Italian Arte Povera and Post-Minimalism. Her work is dotted with amused asides, including fluorescent light fixtures \u2014 a signature of the Minimalist Dan Flavin \u2014 used as penises.I\u2019d met Ms. Lucas in the early 1990s in New York, but hadn\u2019t seen her, except in passing, in 20 years. She seemed nearly unchanged: tall and thin, with slack brown hair just above her shoulders, and a lean, no-frills yet delicate British face, devoid of makeup, that she has called \u201cplain.\u201d As usual, she wore a shirt, jeans and substantial, thick-soled shoes, an ensemble that might have been determined by the age of 11 or 12 and barely altered since. This is the uniform seen in her frequent self-portraits, and is by now as familiar as Joseph Beuys\u2019s vest and hat or Andy Warhol\u2019s navy blazer and school tie.Ms. Lucas\u2019s indifference to conventional comportment is, like her art, liberating. It\u2019s a tribute to her working-class roots while also signaling her interest in androgyny and other kinds of ambiguity. She looks like what she is: an artist always ready to work and completely at ease complicating gender and age stereotypes, fusing man, woman, adolescent and child.A D.I.Y. atmosphere prevailed at home: Her family \u201cwas always making things,\u201d she said. Ms. Lucas\u2019s father, a milkman, could build cabinets. Her mother, who would later oversee art programs in primary schools, had a plot in a community garden, where she grew vegetables. She made clothes as well as toys, including stuffed animals (Ms. Lucas\u2019s introduction to fluff) and taught her daughter the basics of gardening, sewing and cooking. Ms. Lucas was, in her own words, \u201ca shy, reserved kid\u201d who read voraciously and seems to have gradually discovered her own gregariousness.\u201cIn my early teens, I found my feet with it and learned to banter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a great joy.\u201d The love of banter is reflected in her fondness for collaborating with other artists and her preference for enlisting friends to help make work. Yet one of the most resonant things she said during our talks was: \u201cMaking things is company. Like reading or cooking.\u201d\u201cIn terms of freedom of materials, techniques and attitude,\u201d Mr. Gioni wrote in an email, he considers Ms. Lucas \u201cquite unparalleled and perhaps only on the same level as Isa Genzken for pervasiveness of influence among younger artists.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t take long to get the joke: We\u2019re seeing their primary sexual characteristics, and they\u2019re ready for action. You can apprehend the couple as clearly as you might two figures in an early work by Edward Kienholz; they seem similarly seedy, given the stained yellowish mattress. Nonetheless, the still life of fruit and bucket remains equally present. As usual, Ms. Lucas makes every texture, color and shape count; the ensemble put me in mind of the lightness and delicacy of a painting by Watteau. The piece is caustic, yet joyful about the persistence of desire and connection.How will Americans respond to all this? Ms. Lucas said she sees sex as a way to make her art as accessible as possible while also getting to viewers\u2019 most interior feelings.\u201cI have a lot of empathy for a lot of people,\u201d she said, adding that she wanted her audience \u2014 at the New Museum or anywhere \u2014 to \u201cinclude people who might not go into an art gallery.\u201d\u201cI like things to make sense to plebes like myself,\u201d she observed.\u201d I can\u2019t take that out of me.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Utilities Helped Puerto Rico Fix Its Power Grid. Now They Face Hefty Tax Bills.", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen nearly the entire power grid of Puerto Rico was knocked out by a pair of ferocious hurricanes last year, utility companies from across the United States sent crews and equipment to help.It was a power emergency on a scale rarely seen before, and companies spent tens of millions of dollars to mobilize. The utility in Sacramento, Calif., sent 30 workers and a dozen trucks. Ameren, which serves over two million customers in Missouri and Illinois, sent 225 workers. New York dispatched workers on at least five deployments to repair power lines and assess damaged substations. Florida Power & Light sent more than 100 trucks, several tons of equipment and 800 employees, many of whom spent Thanksgiving and the winter holidays working 16-hour days.Though their costs are expected to be reimbursed by the federal government, the companies were not earning a profit. So it was with astonishment that, over the summer, some of the utility companies that had sent aid crews opened letters from the towns where they had worked in Puerto Rico: bills demanding millions of dollars in license and construction taxes.Florida Power & Light was given five days to pay the first $2 million, and 30 days for $333,000 more in taxes, fees, penalties and interest. Ameren and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District received bills for nearly $3 million.\u201cThe honor and humanity of your city\u2019s people stands in striking contrast to the inappropriate monetary demands,\u201d the Florida utility\u2019s chief executive, Eric Silagy, wrote in a letter to the mayor of Bayam\u00f3n.The Florida executive was not alone in his chagrin. The utilities \u201ceach fronted tens of millions of dollars for personnel, equipment, and materials to help restore power in Puerto Rico on a not-for-profit basis,\u201d said Emily Fisher, vice president for law at the Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade group which helped coordinate the agreements under which power companies joined the emergency response. \u201cAnd the thanks we got from some mayors came in the form of municipal tax bills and punitive fines.\u201dA year after Hurricane Maria, many homeowners are still living in ruinsSo far, about eight cities have forwarded tax notices, including the municipalities of Bayam\u00f3n, R\u00edo Grande and Carolina, near the capital of San Juan. City officials said such assessments are a normal part of doing business in Puerto Rico. In most cases, however, they are charged to companies engaged in profit-making business activity, not utilities making emergency repairs after a natural disaster.Such taxes are seldom levied on the mainland after an emergency. When the issue came up in New York for companies that provided relief after Hurricane Sandy, the state waived the taxes.\u201cDuring Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Nate and Florence, no other local jurisdiction sought to impose local taxes and fees directly on the workers and crews who traveled to make emergency repairs to the grid,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t normally happen.\u201dThe Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to reimburse mainland power companies for their work in Puerto Rico. Donald Caetano, a spokesman for the agency, said that companies that were \u201csavvy enough\u201d to include the taxes in their original contract language could also have the tax bills reimbursed by FEMA by submitting those expenses to Puerto Rico\u2019s public utility, Prepa.But that would leave federal taxpayers responsible for millions of dollars flowing into municipal coffers in Puerto Rico beyond the repair costs the federal government is already paying.\u201cThe short answer is yes, FEMA could pay that municipal tax,\u201d Mr. Caetano said.Companies that did not make provisions in their contracts could be \u201con the hook\u201d for paying the taxes themselves, Mr. Caetano said.Prepa\u2019s chief financial officer, Nelson Morales, said that further bills could be on the way from any of the 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that a great amount of them will be requesting payment of taxes,\u201d Mr. Morales said. \u201cThey are entitled to taxes for services or constructions performed in their jurisdictions.\u201dRandall Hakes, a senior lawyer at the Sacramento utility, whose crews were in Puerto Rico from January to March, said the work was intended to render aid to millions of Puerto Ricans who in many cases spent months without electricity after Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck in September 2017. \u201cWe are happy we were able to help, and loved seeing their joy when power was restored,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how they now seek to take advantage of our willingness to lend a hand.\u201dBoth Prepa and FEMA were criticized for waiting more than a month after the hurricanes hit before requesting help from the utilities. Such mutual aid agreements had been struck as a matter of course after recent hurricanes on the mainland, including Harvey, Florence and Sandy.Adding to their frustration with the taxes, a number of the utilities have not been reimbursed by FEMA for sending their workers and equipment to Puerto Rico in the first place. That will only take place once a careful review of the invoices is concluded, officials said. Mr. Caetano said that about $940 million of $1.8 billion invoiced for the electrical work has been reimbursed so far.How storms, missteps and an ailing grid left Puerto Rico in the darkSome analysts with long experience in the substantial economic, legal and cultural differences between Puerto Rico and the mainland said the tax laws on the island should not be taken as an affront, and that negotiations may yield positive results.The 15-year recession in Puerto Rico has left municipalities eager to collect taxes, said T\u00f3mas J. Torres, executive director of the Institute for Competitiveness and Sustainable Economy, a nonprofit in San Juan. He said that linemen from the mainland making much more than their Prepa counterparts could not help but produce an impression that the utilities could easily pay the tax \u2014 whether they made profits in Puerto Rico or not.\u201cThey should not be mad,\u201d Mr. Torres said. \u201cThis is an issue of communication and understanding Puerto Rican law more than anything else.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of sitting down at the table and sorting out any argument that they have.\u201dOmar J. Marrero D\u00edaz, Puerto Rico\u2019s chief recovery officer, appointed by Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, said he knew of \u201cseven or eight\u201d municipalities that had sent tax bills. Part of the reason they are desperate for money, he said, is that like the utilities themselves, they are still waiting for FEMA to disburse funds \u2014 in this case, most of the $3.7 billion allocated for disaster relief.\u201cWe have been trying to serve as a mediator between the companies and the municipalities,\u201d said Mr. Marrero, adding that some mayors have indicated a willingness to compromise or waive the taxes. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we feel, even though we have been complying with the overly bureaucratic process\u201d at FEMA, he said.On the time frame for payments, Mr. Caetano said, \u201cWe trust but verify. The speed of disbursement is driven in a large part by the quickness by which we receive accurate and required paperwork from our partners.\u201dThe New York Times posed queries to several of the cities that sent tax bills and received widely varying responses. The mayor of Carolina was either unavailable or simply refused to comment on the matter. Asked whether the municipality was denying a request for an interview with the mayor, Lourdes V\u00e1zquez, the media chief in Carolina, said, \u201cYou can phrase it however you want.\u201dMayor Ram\u00f3n Luis Rivera of Bayam\u00f3n, though, abruptly released a statement with good news for Florida Power & Light. The municipality had determined that companies operating on a nonprofit basis were not subject to the tax, the statement said.\u201cThat\u2019s the case of Florida Power, which is why we\u2019re sending them a notification indicating they should send a copy of the signed contract,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThat will automatically exempt them from the payment.\u201d\u00c1ngel B. Gonz\u00e1lez Damudt, mayor of R\u00edo Grande, said he believes the Sacramento utility profited from its emergency work and was still liable for taxes \u2014 an assertion the company\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Hakes, rejected immediately.\u201cThis is ridiculous that they continue to assert we\u2019ve profited in any way by their misfortune,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were there to help, and now they\u2019re trying to make a ton of money off our assistance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Retire in Your 30s With $1 Million in the Bank ", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFed up with their high-pressure jobs, some millennials are quitting and embracing the FIRE movement. (It stands for financial independence, retire early). Carl Jensen experienced what he calls \u201cthe awakening\u201d sometime around 2012. Mr. Jensen was making about $110,000 a year and had benefits, but the stress hardly seemed worth it. He couldn\u2019t unwind with his family after work; he spent days huddled over the toilet. He lost 10 pounds.After one especially brutal workday, Mr. Jensen Googled \u201cHow do I retire early?\u201d and his eyes were opened. He talked to his wife and came up with a plan: They saved a sizable portion of their income over the next five years and drastically reduced expenses, until their net worth was around $1.2 million. On Tuesday, March 10, 2017, Mr. Jensen called his boss and gave notice after 15 years at the company. He wasn\u2019t quitting, exactly. He had retired. He was 43. Although Mr. Jensen\u2019s story may seem exceptional, a more modest version of the stockbroker who makes a killing on Wall Street and sails off to the Caribbean, he is part of a growing movement of young professionals who are intently focused on quitting their jobs forever. Followers of FIRE tend to be male and work in the tech industry, left-brained engineer-types who geek out on calculating compound interest over 40 years, or the return on investment (R.O.I.) on low-fee index funds versus real estate rentals. Some practice \u201clean FIRE\u201d (extreme frugality), others \u201cfat FIRE\u201d (maintaining a more typical standard of living while saving and investing), and still others \u201cbarista FIRE\u201d (working part-time at Starbucks after retiring, for the company\u2019s health insurance). To be \u201cfiring\u201d is to slash one\u2019s expenses to maximize saving while amassing income-generating investments sufficient to support oneself. To have \u201cfired\u201d is to have achieved that goal.\u201cA lot of people think you\u2019re a new-age hippie,\u201d said Mr. Jensen, who sold his four-bedroom, four-bathroom house, downsized to a more modest home and maxed-out retirement accounts while firing. \u201cThey can\u2019t even wrap their minds around it.\u201d In retirement, Mr. Jensen and his wife and two daughters plan to live on roughly $40,000 a year generated from investments. Because his wife currently works, they have yet to draw on those accounts. But already, it\u2019s a life rich on time but short on luxuries: Groceries are bought at Costco, car and home repairs are done by him. \u201cPeople always assume there\u2019s an external circumstance: \u2018Oh, you must have received an inheritance,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jensen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just chosen to live far below our means. That itself is a radical idea.\u201dEqually radical is opting out of the work force in your 30s or early 40s, a time of life when men and women are normally leaning into their careers, or, less happily, enduring the daily grind to pay the bills until Social Security kicks in. But Mr. Long said he was deeply unhappy in his job, where over his career he witnessed drug costs skyrocketing, sick people battling with health insurers and the over-prescription of opioids and the resulting addiction crisis. His customers, angry, confused, financially stretched, often lashed out at the person behind the counter. \u201cThere were days when I had 12- or 14-hour shifts where I didn\u2019t use the restroom, where I didn\u2019t eat, because so much work was piled up on me,\u201d Mr. Long said. Like Mr. Jensen, he had been saving a sizable portion of his income over the past decade, and he and his wife had a paid-for house and an investment portfolio worth a little more than $1 million. Why stick around? \u201cThe reality is the numbers are there for me,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cTo go to a job that\u2019s making you miserable every day, it doesn\u2019t make sense to pad the bank account at that point.\u201d But Vicki Robin, who wrote that financial guide with Joe Dominguez, said the FIRE crowd is a different breed of dropout than those in the \u201990s. \u201cOur aim was not just to have a whole bunch of people quit their jobs,\u201d Ms. Robin said. \u201cOur aim was to lower consumption to save the planet. We attracted longtime simple-living people, religious people, environmentalists.\u201dThe FIRE adherents are, by contrast, \u201cvery numbers oriented, fascinated by the minutiae of taxes and accounting,\u201d Ms. Robin said. But if, as Ms. Robin said, FIRE adherents \u201cdon\u2019t have the aspirational part\u201d of earlier generations, why are they so determined to quit the work force? Many millennials haven\u2019t been working longer than a decade, if that. It\u2019s about having agency, Ms. Robin said: \u201cThe worker in this economy has very little sense of control over their existence. People are expendable. You\u2019re a young person and you look ahead and you say, \u2018What\u2019s there for me?\u2019\u201dMs. Shen\u2019s wake-up moment came when she watched a fellow I.T. colleague collapse at his desk after clocking 14-hour days and get hauled away in an ambulance. For several years before that, she and Mr. Leung, following the path laid out by their parents, had tried to buy a house in Toronto\u2019s ever-escalating real estate market. But, Ms. Shen said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how much you saved, it was a goal post that kept moving. And I was seeing people stressed out paying their mortgages.\u201dThough they had good educations and well-paying jobs in the booming tech sector, Ms. Shen and Mr. Leung faced the looming threats of outsourcing and artificial intelligence, and had no hope of a retirement pension, or even that their employers would exist in five years. At the same time, their jobs were all-consuming, their work hours basically 24-7. Rather than chain themselves to a costly mortgage, and therefore to high-pressure jobs, the couple decided to pour their money into an investment portfolio and peace out. \u201cThe rule books our parents have given us is advice that\u2019s perfect for 1970,\u201d Ms. Shen said. \u201cWe have to throw out that rule book and write a new one.\u201d Mr. Leung spoke of the challenges his generation faces more bluntly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have jobs that will take care of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to take care of ourselves.\u201dBy ditching a big city, Ms. Shen and Mr. Leung exemplify another underlying reason for the popularity of FIRE: the high price of urban life, especially in places like New York and Southern California. There\u2019s the insane housing prices, the high cost of child care, the temptations of so-called lifestyle creep.\u201cWe were spending nearly $3,000 a month on rent, and that was considered a good deal,\u201d said Scott Rieckens, 35, who, along with his wife, Taylor, 33, and their infant daughter until recently lived in Coronado, Calif., a pricey beach town across the bay from San Diego. \u201cWe made something like $160,000 between the two of us, but we didn\u2019t have a whole lot left over.\u201d But even with those lifestyle cuts, the couple couldn\u2019t increase their savings rate substantially unless they relocated to a cheaper community, a deleveraging tactic the FIRE crowd calls \u201carbitrage.\u201dThe idea, Mr. Adeney said, is \u201cto reap the high salary\u201d of a place like Silicon Valley, \u201cthen take that nest egg out to any of the thousands of nice, affordable cities and towns we have in this country and begin a second stage of life on your own terms.\u201d Ms. Rieckens, who works in recruiting, was initially reluctant to give up her BMW and beachy life and the prestige that went with it, until she saw a retirement calculator that showed they could retire in 10 years if they adopted FIRE and moved, or when they are 90 if they continued their upscale lifestyle in Coronado. \u201cI never paid attention to the finances, I thought it will all work out,\u201d Ms. Rieckens said. \u201cAfter I had a baby, I had stress around how I could spend more time with her. I was almost a slave to my job because of the way we were living.\u201dThey ended up in Bend, Ore., where there\u2019s no state sales tax and they could afford to buy a house. Gas for their used Honda CRV with 186,000 miles (they got rid of the BMW and downsized to one vehicle) is a dollar-per-gallon cheaper than in San Diego, although Mr. Rieckens often rides his bike around town. \u201cThe whole retire early thing is unimportant to me. It\u2019s more about gaining control of your time,\u201d Mr. Rieckens said. \u201cIf you dive into the definition of retirement, what you\u2019re retiring from is mandatory labor. It\u2019s not necessarily about pi\u00f1a coladas on the beach.\u201d A retirement that starts well before you go gray and lasts 40, 50 even 60 years is an anomaly in modern life. How do you fill all those days, months, decades? On a recent weekday afternoon, Mr. Jensen was taking his two daughters, ages 8 and 11, to the Boulder County Fair. \u201cI told them, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re going to wait until Thursday for half-price day,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, we\u2019re walking there. It\u2019s two miles from our house.\u201dFearing boredom, Mr. Jensen at first took on way too much, and he found it strange to be at the local rec center exercising alongside senior citizens, or shopping at empty big-box stores on a Tuesday. He also beat his own mother to retirement, which made for awkward family get-togethers. It\u2019s hardly surprising that a tech-savvy generation would proselytize on the internet. Also, blogging can provide the holy grail of early retirement, an additional income stream. One month into FIRE, he wrote of the guilt he felt spending money (on video games), and his concern that he would be over his household budget. He spent his days with family, at the gym, doing housework, exercising. He had no regrets so far: \u201cI made the right decision. This is life.\u201dIn the months that followed, he rewatched the mini-series \u201cRoots,\u201d lost all interest in talk of FIRE now that he had achieved it, feared a looming stock market crash, had nightmares that \u201cI\u2019m back at work and arguing with morons,\u201d finished a marathon in a personal best sub-three hours, felt moments of social isolation, took a two-week road trip across the heartland, and went twice to the beach in Florida with his wife and watched their net worth reach its highest point, despite not working, which he attributed to \u201cthe passage of the tax cut for wealthy job creators like myself.\u201d Oh, and he started a blog. \u201cMy life is so much better than it was before,\u201d Mr. Long wrote seven months in. \u201cI hope everyone here finds this peace.\u201d Speaking by phone, Mr. Long acknowledged it was possible that he\u2019d simply burned out, that all of this FIRE stuff was just a needed break until he found a more satisfying career. When he was recently offered a job back in the pharmaceutical field, it induced a mild panic attack. That morning, he\u2019d woken up on his own, \u201cnot when an alarm clock told me that I had a responsibility.\u201d He\u2019d read the news online for 30 minutes, went on a seven-mile run, took a nap and \u201cwatched the ceiling fan spin around for a little bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Trade Negotiator Warns That Canada Is Running Out of Time", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration\u2019s top trade official warned on Tuesday that Canada was running out of time to join the United States and Mexico in a new North American Free Trade Agreement, lamenting that the Canadians have proved unwilling to make \u201cessential\u201d concessions in significant areas of disagreement.Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, made the rare public comments about the state of the negotiations at an event in New York and insisted that the Trump administration will move forward with a bilateral trade pact with Mexico by Sept. 30 if an agreement cannot be reached with Canada. Such a move would anger the business world and face an uncertain path in Congress, which must ratify a final trade agreement.In separate remarks on Tuesday, Canada\u2019s leaders demonstrated little urgency to close a deal this week.Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, said that it was important that the United States and Canada find a win-win agreement.\u201cWe know that Canada\u2019s interests are what we have to stand up for and we will,\u201d said Mr. Trudeau, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \u201cWe are looking for the right deal.\u201dMr. Trudeau noted that the United States and Mexico have come to terms on their outstanding trade issues, but suggested that would have little influence on his talks with the United States.\u201cThere\u2019s a possibility there to build on what they agreed,\u201d he added.\u201cThe fact is that Canada is not making concessions in areas that we think are essential,\u201d Mr. Lighthizer said.Political considerations in all three countries are playing a role in the timeline to complete a revised Nafta.The president-elect of Mexico, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, takes office on Dec. 1, and its current president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, wants to sign the new Nafta agreement as a final act before he departs. Mr. Lighthizer said that the fate of the agreement under the next Mexican administration is uncertain and that he does not want to have to restart talks with Mexico\u2019s new leadership.Canada\u2019s internal politics are also a factor given provincial elections on Oct. 1. The Canadian government may be reluctant to finalize any agreement that contains dairy concessions ahead of a vote in Quebec, whose economy is heavily dependent on dairy, trade analysts said.Some on Capitol Hill say there may be some wiggle room on the end-of-September deadline. Congress could take several routes to allow the administration to submit a final agreement in October or later, but still allow Mr. Trump to sign the deal in November. Several congressional staff members stressed in interviews this month that the deadline is only binding if Congress chooses to enforce it \u2014 and that it may choose not to.Under United States trade law, the final text of the trade agreement must be public for 60 days before it is signed. Even if that happens before the next Mexican administration takes office, there likely will still be additional obstacles in Congress, which has the final say on trade treaties. A vote is unlikely to occur until next year and this could be complicated if Democrats take control of the House or the Senate.Ms. Freeland, who has been engaged in marathon talks with Mr. Lighthizer in Washington in recent weeks, demurred on Tuesday when asked about the specifics of the differences between the two countries. She emphasized her hope of reaching an agreement and underscored that doing so is also important to the United States because Canada is its largest market.Despite Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s threat to move ahead with just Mexico, he did not suggest breaking off trade relations with Canada if it fails to meet this month\u2019s deadline. He said that the United States and Canada would continue trade talks and try to come up with a separate deal as soon as possible.The one promise that Mr. Lighthizer would make was that Mr. Trump would not let the new deal be called \u201cNafta\u201d \u2014 an agreement which he has derided for years as a failure.\u201cThe president is not going to call it Nafta,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it something else.\u201dMr. Trump said earlier this month that he would like to call the revised deal the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, or USMC.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Corbyn, in Labour Speech, Vows to Fight Capitalist \u2018Greed\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party, doubled down Wednesday on his platform, promising to sweep away \u201cgreed is good\u201d capitalism and expand the state\u2019s role in the economy as he closed an annual conference dominated by divisions over European Union withdrawal.Outlining a \u201cradical plan to rebuild and transform\u201d Britain, Mr. Corbyn underscored his ambition to shift economic policy leftward \u2014 a position that he described as the \u201cnew common sense of our time\u201d after a decade of stagnating wages and squeezed living standards.Mr. Corbyn had harsh words for familiar adversaries in the British news media, which is mainly hostile to him and which, he said, enjoys the \u201cfreedom to spread lies and half-truths.\u201dAs for President Trump, Mr. Corbyn derided \u201cAmerica First posturing\u201d and the decisions to pull out of the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal and to move the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. \u201cHe is turning his back on international cooperation and even international law,\u201d Mr. Corbyn said.In the domestic sphere, Mr. Corbyn proposed to expand free child care and create 400,000 jobs in clean-energy technologies.In Liverpool, a spirited discussion ultimately produced a fudge: The conference agreed on a motion that keeps all options open \u2014 including another referendum \u2014 but placed a premium on the push for a general election.Mr. Corbyn, never a fan of the European Union, is hoping that the gathering crisis over Brexit will give him the opportunity to become prime minister well before the next scheduled national vote, in 2022. By then he would be nearly 73. But there is little chance of that happening unless Mrs. May opts for an election to seek approval for her much-criticized Brexit strategy.Some of the shine has been removed by months of feuding over the party\u2019s approach to anti-Semitism, a dispute needlessly prolonged by Mr. Corbyn, who ultimately retreated on the issue, but not before damage had been done to Labour\u2019s reputation.On Wednesday, Mr. Corbyn acknowledged that the summer had been \u201ctough\u201d and that the dispute had caused \u201churt and anxiety\u201d to the Jewish community. He promised that his party would \u201calways be implacable campaigners against anti-Semitism and racism in all its forms.\u201dWorryingly for party bosses, despite months of constant crisis within the government over Brexit, Labour still lags in most opinion surveys.A big majority of Labour members favor another referendum, according to pollsters. But Brexit has been difficult for the party because the issue splits its base. While many of its voters in big cities wanted to remain in the bloc, many others in working-class communities left behind by globalization opted to leave.Not only are senior Labour figures divided on whether to keep open the option of a popular vote on any Brexit deal the government negotiates, they are also split on whether to include in a vote the option to remain in the bloc.On Tuesday, Keir Starmer, the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, received resounding applause from the conference hall when he told party members that no one was taking the \u201cremain\u201d option off the table, though more Euroskeptic figures had tried to do so.Business leaders fret about Mr. Corbyn\u2019s left-wing agenda, which includes a plan to force large companies to surrender 10 percent of their shares to funds managed for their workers. But they are growing more alarmed daily by the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union in March without any deal.At a meeting held on the fringes of the conference, Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said she had been \u201creally careful about language\u201d when discussing Brexit. She said she had \u201conly started using the word \u2018catastrophe\u2019 in the last few months.\u201dBut at the same meeting, Caroline Flint, a lawmaker who had argued for Britain to remain but who now wants to proceed with Brexit, warned that any move to stop it could inflame voters and lead to a resurgence of the far right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is This a Mid-1990s Moment for the Economy? Three Reasons for Optimism", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are parallels today to the strongest period of growth and prosperity in recent decades.A painful recession was fading into memory, yet the expansion felt unsatisfying to many. There was evidence of huge technological leaps everywhere except in the data on worker productivity. And the unemployment rate was falling to levels that forecasting models predicted would trigger a burst of inflation. That was the economic situation in the mid-1990s, and it also describes 2018. An intriguing \u2014 and optimistic \u2014 possibility for the years ahead is that the parallels with the 1990s won\u2019t end there.Back then, technological advances that had been building for years finally started to translate into higher rates of productivity growth economywide. Some feared inflation, but Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, decided not to move pre-emptively to choke off the expansion. Instead, he advocated patience to see just how hot the economy could get without setting off a spiral of rising prices.The result was the strongest period of growth and prosperity in recent decades.A trade war or emerging markets crisis or economic policy mistake could prove more powerful than economic fundamentals. And some of the technological advances that seem on the verge of fueling a productivity boom may take longer to develop than their enthusiasts assert.In 1996, many Fed policymakers wanted to raise interest rates to head off the risk of inflation. \u201cBut Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing the wonders of a \u2018new economy\u2019 in which improved productivity growth would allow faster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cMeeting after meeting,\u201d he added, the Fed\u2019s policy committee \u201cheld off on rate increases while believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear. And meeting after meeting, inflation gradually declined.\u201dMr. Powell wasn\u2019t forecasting that the same would happen in coming years; rather, he was preaching the virtues of Mr. Greenspan\u2019s strategy of risk management that allowed the boom to emerge.The expansion of the last nine years has been steady and successful at putting millions of people to work, but it has fallen short in overall growth or in generating substantial boosts to incomes.The culprit: productivity. The amount of output per hour of labor has been growing slowly. In the last five years, it has risen about 1 percent annually, compared with 2.1 percent on average since 1947.If that changes, and businesses find ways to get more production of goods and services out of each hour of work, it should set the stage for higher wages and faster growth. That\u2019s what happened in the 1990s: Annual productivity rose an average of 1.8 percent from 1991 to 1995, then leapt to a 3 percent annual rate from 1996 to 2000.What are the chances of a similar jump in the coming years, with similar beneficial results? Economists don\u2019t have a great understanding of what drives productivity advances, but there are three realistic possibilities of where gains might come from \u2014 and they aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.In 1987, the economist Robert Solow joked that \u201cyou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.\u201d That is, even as there were remarkable advances in semiconductors, software and desktop computing, it wasn\u2019t evident in any efficiency improvements in the overall economy.The surge didn\u2019t arrive until well into the 1990s, and that pattern \u2014 a long lag between a technological innovation and its full economic impact \u2014 makes sense when you think about it.For example, fewer corporate executives have a full-time secretary now than they did in the 1980s, in part because of innovations like voice mail, email and desktop word processors. But it\u2019s not as if companies suddenly fired a bunch of secretaries on the day they got a voice-mail system. It was a gradual process as more people became accustomed to answering their own phones and typing their own memos.Moreover, sometimes big innovations can actually make the economy less productive while they are being introduced. An automobile factory that\u2019s installing a robotic assembly line might employ many robotics engineers, but also autoworkers still making cars the old way. Even if the innovation eventually results in higher productivity, the company might need more person-hours of work per car produced in the short run.What are the potential parallels in 2018? One day driverless cars may be a boon for productivity \u2014 but right now they are a drag on it as thousands of skilled engineers work to develop the technology without generating a dime of economic output.Similarly, farms may eventually increase their yield with artificial intelligence that allows them to automate the pulling of weeds and the application of fertilizer. Electrical utilities may be able to become more efficient using smart grids. Hospitals may be able to deliver better care for less money when computers help diagnose patients.Will technologies like those be ready for prime time soon, or ever? That\u2019s the part we don\u2019t know for sure.But there are other forces that will more clearly affect the productivity outlook in the next few years.At the root of conservative economic philosophy is that low taxes on capital, along with light regulation, will encourage businesses to invest more heavily, resulting in a more productive economy in the long run.The next few years will be a test of that proposition.The corporate income tax rate was cut to 21 percent at the start of the year, from 35 percent. The Trump administration\u2019s deregulation-minded appointees have had a year and a half to go about their work.Oh, and the stock market is booming, and interest rates remain low by historical standards, implying companies should have plenty of access to capital on favorable terms if they want to make those investments.In short, this should be a conducive environment for businesses to increase their \u201ccapital stock\u201d \u2014 the accumulated facilities, equipment, software and other intangible investments \u2014 to enable workers to be more productive.Is this investment actually happening? The evidence isn\u2019t definitive at this point. Business investment rose at an 11.5 percent rate in the first quarter of 2018 and 8.5 percent in the second quarter, both substantially faster than the economy as a whole. But that was fueled in part by a boom in energy exploration that was probably more tied to the rise in oil prices in 2017 than tax policy.The nascent trade war may create a layer of uncertainty for businesses that have major customer bases overseas as they weigh big-ticket investments, working at cross-purposes with the stated goal of the tax legislation.But the verdict on whether pro-business policy out of Washington will drive a surge in investment spending, with big benefits for productivity, will depend on more than a couple of quarters, and remains a real possibility.Finally, the tight labor market could force businesses to find more efficient ways to deploy workers.With the unemployment rate at 3.9 percent, near a several-decade low, companies in a range of industries have been complaining about the difficulty of finding qualified labor.But one distinct possibility is that it will force businesses to act more creatively and aggressively about squeezing more economic output from each hour of labor. Companies could invest more heavily in new capital \u2014 think of automated checkout kiosks at retail stores or restaurants. Or companies could provide extra training so that each worker can get more done.It could also happen through experimentation with new management techniques or other business practices; these would show up in what economists call \u201ctotal factor productivity.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the traditional way economists think about productivity, but we see it in other contexts. When the minimum wage is raised, companies sometimes try to replace human labor with machines or focus on making their workers more productive.The ultralow unemployment may have the same effect in the years ahead.There is, for good reason, a tendency to focus on the risks of what can go wrong in the economy. The current expansion could become the longest on record next year, which makes the recession risk talk all the more relevant.But the 1990s are a reminder that there can be good economic surprises as well as bad ones. Predicting the future is hard. And the parallels aren\u2019t perfect. But there\u2019s reason to wonder if economic history just might repeat itself.Advertisement"}

Mr. McDonnell also proposed nationalizing critical utilities, giving a third of the seats on company boards to workers and making firms prove that they paid their rightful share of tax.Labour\u2019s economic agenda has surprised some with its boldness and put the party on a collision course with business groups. But that is unlikely to faze a leadership that says it is rediscovering the party\u2019s socialist roots and believes that voters will trust a left-wing agenda to redress some of the failings of a decade marked by stagnating real wages and poor productivity growth.\u201cJust a few words of advice though, archbishop,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cWhen they get around to calling you a Marxist, I\u2019ll give you some tips on how to handle it.\u201dUnder Jeremy Corbyn, Labour\u2019s most left-wing leader for decades, the party performed better than many expected in a general election last year, depriving Prime Minister Theresa May of her parliamentary majority. In most opinion surveys, Labour is now a few percentage points behind Mrs. May\u2019s Conservative Party, which is so divided over plans for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, that there is speculation that another election could be called soon.Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Corbyn prefer to talk about an economic agenda designed to roll back the austerity politics of the last decade \u2014 policies that have helped move Labour to the left of the social democratic positions it adopted under the previous Labour leaders, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband.\u201cThe balance of power at work has been tipped against the worker,\u201d Mr. McDonnell said. \u201cThe result is long hours, low productivity, low pay and the insecurity of zero-hours contracts,\u201d which let companies decide from day to day how much paid work, if any, an employee receives.Promising to press ahead with nationalization, Mr. McDonnell identified water and sewerage companies as the first targets, saying that shareholders would be compensated with bonds. While most staff members would keep the same jobs, those of senior executives and directors would be filled at significantly reduced salaries. Energy utilities and postal and rail services would also be nationalized.His other big proposal would apply to companies with more than 250 workers, who would transfer 1 percent of their shares each year to \u201cinclusive ownership funds\u201d that would ultimately control 10 percent of the stock.Business groups were unimpressed. \u201cWith Labour\u2019s current proposals, the fallout for the U.K., its workers and customers would be a drop in living standards,\u201d said Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry.\u201cAt a time of great uncertainty, this is no way to build the foundations of competitiveness and productivity that will improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d she added.Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said that the \u201coverwhelming majority of business leaders are as frustrated as anyone about poor wage growth, sluggish productivity and corporate governance failures.\u201dNevertheless, he added, \u201cthe answer will not be found in sweeping measures and angry rhetoric.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Recalls Top Diplomats From Latin America as Worries Rise Over China\u2019s Influence", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States has recalled three chiefs of mission from Latin American nations that cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of recognizing China.The move comes as American officials have expressed growing unease over China\u2019s rising influence in the region.For decades, Taiwan and China have competed for recognition. In 1979, the United States switched its support and officially established sovereign relations with China, and many other countries followed. But Washington has supported any decisions by nations to continue recognizing Taiwan, a self-governing island that China wants to bring under Communist Party rule.In June 2017, Panama cut ties with Taiwan, which surprised the United States government. The American ambassador to Panama at the time, John Feeley, said he learned about the switch from the president, Juan Carlos Varela, only an hour or so before Mr. Varela announced it, and only because he had called Mr. Varela to discuss an unrelated matter.The diplomats returning to Washington are Robin Bernstein, ambassador to the Dominican Republic; Jean Manes, ambassador to El Salvador; and Roxanne Cabral, the charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in Panama. A State Department official said they would return to their posts by Sept. 14.The move \u201cis an appropriate and serious signal by the U.S. government to those three countries and to the Chinese government that it is now reviewing the implications of the diplomatic switch and is worried that U.S. interests could be jeopardized,\u201d Mr. Feeley said.\u201cMy sense is that they will be most focused on the issue of industrial and commercial espionage and the possibility of Beijing using its embassies to expand that activity in those countries and the Caribbean Basin,\u201d he added.China is now the world\u2019s second-largest economy and is expected to overtake the United States as the largest one in 10 to 15 years.It is difficult for any nation, especially a small one, to decide not to recognize the sovereignty of China.Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China, said on Saturday that the recall was \u201cheavy handed.\u201d The United States should not be surprised as Latin American governments push back against American requests, he added, when President Trump has continued to alienate the people of Latin America.\u201cTrump has openly and systematically offended Latin American countries and their people,\u201d Mr. Guajardo wrote in an email. \u201cHe labels us as rapists and criminals, has never traveled to the region as president, has deported and separated families, and threatened to cut all sort of aid. China comes with an offer of friendship and economic development (albeit one that I don\u2019t think will pan out). Why the surprise?\u201dThe United States has yet to fill some ambassador posts in the region, including those in Mexico and Panama, Mr. Guajardo noted, whereas China has assigned ambassadors in all Latin American nations with which it has diplomatic relations.\u201cSave a few countries in Latin America, the region as a whole has a historical preference for the U.S. as the main ally,\u201d he said. \u201cThis changed when Trump assumed the presidency. It was his call, his choice, to turn away from the region.\u201dLast month, Ms. Tsai made state visits to Belize and Paraguay to try to strengthen ties with those nations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A \u2018Particularly Bright\u2019 Moment Brings Another Fed Rate Increase", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said on Wednesday that the American economy was experiencing \u201ca particularly bright moment\u201d as the Fed announced a widely expected increase in its benchmark interest rate and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates.Mr. Powell emphasized that the decision to raise rates to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent was not intended to get in the way of continued growth. \u201cMy colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy and moving forward,\u201d he said.But the Fed\u2019s decision was criticized almost immediately by President Trump, who opened a Wednesday afternoon news conference by declaring himself \u201cnot happy\u201d with higher rates.Mr. Trump once again broke with the practice of his recent predecessors, who avoided public comment about monetary policy. Higher interest rates increase the cost of federal borrowing and Mr. Trump, whose fiscal policies have sharply increased the scale of federal borrowing, suggested he would prefer lower borrowing costs. \u201cWe could do other things with the money,\u201d he said.He added, however, that the Fed was raising rates \u201cbecause we\u2019re doing so well.\u201dThe Fed\u2019s decision, announced after a two-day meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, represents the eighth time that the Fed has raised interest rates since the 2008 financial crisis, and the third time this year. Another increase is expected in December.The Fed described economic conditions as \u201cstrong.\u201d It predicted that growth this year could top 3 percent, before slowing in coming years. Unemployment remains low, inflation remains around the 2 percent pace the Fed regards as optimal, and the pace of investment has increased, it said.For the first time in recent years, the Fed did not describe monetary policy as \u201caccommodative,\u201d indicating that its benchmark interest rate is rising back toward a level the Fed regards as neutral, meaning that monetary policy is neither stimulating nor restraining economic growth.A number of Mr. Powell\u2019s colleagues have argued publicly that the Fed most likely needs to raise rates to a level that begins to restrict economic activity. The Fed warned last year that there was no need for a tax cut in the midst of a steady economic expansion. Mr. Trump and Congress ignored that advice, cutting taxes and increasing spending. The result has been a short-term increase in economic growth, which some Fed officials fear could lead to higher inflation.Mr. Powell said that gradual rate increases remained the best way for the Fed to navigate between the danger the economy will overheat and cause inflation, and the danger the economy will falter.\u201cWe think that gradually raising interest rates is the way that we take both of those risks seriously,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell also said that the Fed sees little sign of inflationary pressure.In a new round of forecasts the Fed published Wednesday, members of the policymaking committee predicted the central bank would raise rates five more times by the end of 2020.Asked if he agreed, Mr. Powell emphasized his uncertainty about both the medium-term economic outlook and the path of Fed policy. He described the prospect of restrictive monetary policy as \u201cvery possible\u201d but added that \u201cit depends\u201d on the evolution of economic conditions.Speaking before Mr. Trump issued his latest criticisms of Fed policy, Mr. Powell said that the Fed was carrying out its mission and that \u201cwe don\u2019t consider political factors.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, if not his politics, could surely influence the Fed\u2019s trajectory given uncertainty about the trade war the president has started with China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico.Mr. Powell said that the Fed was hearing \u201ca rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country\u201d about the economic impact of those tariffs. But Mr. Powell added that the Fed has yet to see a negative effect in the economic data.The Fed chairman outlined some areas in which the president\u2019s policies might bring surprises on the upside.Republicans argued that tax cuts would increase economic growth by creating \u201csupply side\u201d incentives for increased investment in the economy. Mr. Powell said it was too early to judge the effects, but \u201cwe hope they\u2019re huge.\u201dHe also expressed hope that the Fed would continue to be surprised by the number of Americans who are returning to the labor force as the economy strengthens.A few Fed officials, and a larger group of outside economists, argue the Fed is moving too quickly to raise rates. They point to the slow pace of wage growth as evidence there is still considerable slack in the labor market. Mr. Powell acknowledged Wednesday that the gains from economic growth have not been distributed evenly.\u201cThe benefits of this strong economy have not reached all Americans,\u201d he said.In the Fed\u2019s latest batch of economic projections, 12 of the 16 officials who submitted forecasts said they expected to raise rates in December.Fed officials predicted three rate increases in 2019 and one in 2020. The new forecasts, which included 2021 for the first time, showed that Fed officials expect to end the current rate increase cycle in 2020. None are planned in 2021. That means the march toward higher rates is well past the halfway point: Eight increases in hand, five more planned.Markets continue to anticipate fewer rate increases in coming years, in part because of doubts that the economy will continue to grow.\u201cOur view is that the Fed will press ahead with gradual rate hikes for now, but that officials are still underestimating just how quickly the economy is likely to lose momentum next year, as the fiscal boost fades and monetary tightening bites,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior United States economist at Capital Economics. \u201cWe expect the Fed to call time on rate hikes and ultimately begin cutting rates by early 2020.\u201dSo far, there is little sign the Fed is crimping economic growth. Consumer borrowing costs are rising, but rates remain quite low by historical standards. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage loan reached 4.55 percent in August, up from 3.96 percent in December 2015, according to Freddie Mac.As rates climb, the economic effects are likely to increase. Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said the Fed\u2019s rate increases have raised the cost of the average payment on a five-year car loan by about 2 percent.\u201cIt will not get better for consumers or the industry from here,\u201d Mr. Smoke said.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaumAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rei Kawakubo Revealed (Sort Of)", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "Forty years ago, the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons designer began creating subversive, gender-bending clothes for men at a time when no one else was. She still is.Supported byEARLY ONE MORNING, in the beginning of April, just as the cherry blossoms came into full bloom in Tokyo, 100-odd people gathered at the entrance to an anonymous office building in Aoyama, an elegant and sedate neighborhood known for its designer stores and expensive French restaurants. Unlike the building\u2019s facade (squat, brick, unremarkable) or its interior (empty, beige, somehow even more unremarkable), the people making their way inside were, like the pink petals feathering the city\u2019s sidewalks, impossible to ignore. Some looked like religious fundamentalists or figures from 16th-century portraits, others like extras from \u201cLa Strada.\u201d They nodded and held doors open for one another, but remained quiet and unsmiling.When I asked a devoted, elfin publicist in sequined basketball shorts the color of aquarium gravel if his colleagues had dressed up especially for the show, he looked at me with confusion, barely contained derision and maybe a bit of pity. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look like this always.\u201dEVEN THE MOST oddly dressed woman is seldom doing anything all that transgressive with her appearance. We assume that women care about how they look, even when they don\u2019t want to look pretty, so when they don kooky hats or outsize suits or shave their heads or apply rouge with purposefully grotesque abandon, it\u2019s taken to be merely an outlandish variation on expected behavior. Meanwhile, an eccentrically dressed man \u2014 not a dandy in the Beau Brummell mold but someone plainly interested in creating new and jarring shapes with his body and clothes \u2014 is a rare and electrifying sight. In refusing to telegraph the traditional goals of male fashion (power, utility, wealth), it can seem as though he has renounced capitalism itself \u2014 even if the price of doing so is equal to a series of consecutive mortgage payments.When I met Kawakubo, this is what I wanted to talk to her about: her approach to making clothing for men, whether or not she had thoughts about the state of masculinity in 2018, how designing men\u2019s wear is different (or similar) to creating women\u2019s wear. I wondered if perhaps the tighter constraints of masculine dress codes allowed, in fact, for more creativity and fun. I didn\u2019t expect real answers. Kawakubo is notorious for her gnomic pronouncements (e.g., \u201cThe void is important\u201d) and her anachronistic, otherworldly embodiment of what it means to be a genius. Once, in response to a journalist\u2019s question, Kawakubo drew a circle on a piece of paper and walked away.To my surprise, I did not find the designer particularly aloof or monastic in her bearing. Flanked by her husband and translator, Adrian Joffe, who is also the company\u2019s president, Kawakubo projected a kind of plain and quiet professionalism, though the topic of masculine versus feminine wares appeared to agitate her. \u201cMen seem to have more courage to try new things now, not only in Japan but all over the world,\u201d she said, wondering aloud why women have become \u201cso quiet,\u201d and why, these days, it\u2019s the men who buy and wear the showpieces. Women, comparatively, have become more conservative. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit upsetting,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have an insight into that, it might help with my business.\u201dKawakubo recalled how when she was younger, in the 1980s especially, young women added their names to lists for expensive pieces and were happy to wait in long lines to buy them. These days, though, \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency for men to queue up to buy things,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder why women don\u2019t do this. Why are there no women queuing up for Supreme or Nike?\u201d I suggested that perhaps in an age of digital streaming, streetwear had replaced record collecting, sublimating whatever obsessive, completist, seemingly male-specific tendencies that were once reserved for rare Nirvana EPs and Kanye\u2019s earliest mixtapes. Kawakubo seemed to have no reaction to this theory, and said nothing.Like many men I spoke to, Spodek told me that wearing Comme des Gar\u00e7ons gives him the impression of having turned himself into a work of art. He spends almost all of his discretionary income on Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and is saving up for a trip to Japan, which he referred to as a \u201cpilgrimage.\u201dThough Kawakubo described Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\u2019 male clientele as comprising students and men with creative jobs \u2014 \u201cAnyone who is not free in his work probably is not wearing our clothes\u201d\u2014 she admitted that the so-called rules of men\u2019s wear (subdued colors, suiting materials, professional silhouettes) make designing for men more interesting, especially as someone with a self-imposed edict to always be creating new, never-before-seen garments. \u201cThe basics of clothing lie in men\u2019s fashion,\u201d she has said.\u201cThe best thing about Comme des Gar\u00e7ons clothes is how they fit. As weird as they might look, they actually feel really natural on the body and are designed very practically,\u201d said Utaka. I asked him if he had a favorite item. \u201cA ridiculously cool black coat from the fall 2012 collection,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt looks like anybody could have made it, like it\u2019s just two pieces of fabric stuck together.\u201d Part of Kawakubo\u2019s 2D collection (every Comme des Gar\u00e7ons collection is named, and the clothes hew literally to the theme, though Kawakubo\u2019s interpretation of \u201cliteral\u201d can often feel like abstraction), the piece is a visual paradox, at once completely flat-looking and voluminous, with rounded shoulders, a nipped waist and angular hips \u2014 like what you\u2019d make if asked to design a parka for a paper doll. Utaka praised the garment\u2019s draping and lapel construction, noting that although the coat\u2019s structure looks simple, its engineering is anything but.This secret pragmatism is perhaps the most traditionally masculine feature of Kawakubo\u2019s designs for men. Those who wear Comme des Gar\u00e7ons tend to talk about how the clothes don\u2019t feel new, even when they are \u2014 you try on a jacket with the tags still attached and have the impression that it\u2019s been hanging in your closet for years. Kevin Hearn, a 49-year-old musician and keyboardist for the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies and longtime Comme des Gar\u00e7ons client, says Kawakubo\u2019s garments \u201cfeel musical \u2014 like each item is a different song, something that brings color and joy and inventiveness into the world.\u201d When we spoke, Hearn was wearing his latest purchase \u2014 a black Gore-Tex slicker with a grim reaperlike hood. He described Comme des Gar\u00e7ons clothes as \u201cplayful\u201d and then said, \u201cbut this raincoat isn\u2019t funny at all. It\u2019s elegant and well designed. It has pockets where you want there to be pockets, strings where you want there to be strings.\u201d Kawakubo, he noted, \u201cisn\u2019t joking around.\u201d\u201cWHAT DID YOUR father dress like?\u201d I asked Kawakubo about halfway through our interview. Joffe translated, and Kawakubo spoke to him in Japanese for what felt like 20 to 30 seconds. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand the question,\u201d Joffe said. He laughed, Kawakubo did not, and it was tacitly understood that this was tantamount to a refusal.Kawakubo likes to insist that first and foremost, she is a businesswoman. This is true in a certain sense ($300 million in yearly sales for the labels combined, and 135 stores, all of which Kawakubo owns completely), but also almost hilariously imprecise. \u201cMost businesses only think of evolution and growth in terms of the bottom line, and maybe the difference with Comme des Gar\u00e7ons is that it\u2019s not necessarily what you can and can\u2019t sell that makes the business, because the business is creation,\u201d she said. Kawakubo admits that her venture into men\u2019s wear was a practical decision, not an artistic one. But, she added, \u201cI\u2019ve often thought this is the most difficult way to do business. It\u2019s not easy to sell only ideas and ones that people are not used to.\u201d Every choice she makes, she said, even about corporate structuring, \u201cis based on aesthetic values.\u201dWhether she likes it or not \u2014 and it\u2019s almost certain that she does \u2014 the products of Kawakubo\u2019s business are, for the most part, bought and enjoyed as art. And to see someone in Comme des Gar\u00e7ons on the street is to wonder if perhaps fashion isn\u2019t actually more generous, more civic-minded, more political than art. Unlike a painting purchased in a gallery and hung on the wall of a private home, a Comme des Gar\u00e7ons garment actually circulates in the world, confronting (and delighting and confusing and frustrating) the very people who never would or could wear it themselves.That\u2019s how I felt, at least, that morning in Tokyo. Sitting across the office runway from all those Comme des Gar\u00e7ons employees, I was in awe \u2014 and ashamed. My outfit, which I had chosen to be both appropriate and flattering, suddenly looked not just boring but selfish. It delighted neither me nor anyone else. It seemed like a waste. I had dressed, I realized, like a man might \u2014 a non-Comme des Gar\u00e7ons-wearing man.A few days later, when I returned to the office to interview Kawakubo, I wore different \u2014 but similarly lackluster \u2014 clothes. I had no delusions that she even took note of my appearance, though I was also certain that if she did, it would have depressed her. \u201cIs there any man you wish you could design for and haven\u2019t?\u201d I asked at the end of our hourlong meeting. Kawakubo shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a stupid question,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Compared with manufacturing, the investment needed to automate some tasks in the hotel sector \u2014 like front desk or concierge services \u2014 is likely to be relatively low.At the Sheraton Waikiki, next to the Royal Hawaiian, cashiers at the beachside lounge worry about a newly deployed computer system that will allow servers to close out their own checks \u2014 making cashiers redundant.New technologies are reconfiguring the workplace in other ways. Doormen are losing tips as guests turn to Uber and Lyft instead of regular taxis. So are bellhops when guests use Seamless, a food-delivery app, instead of room service.How many jobs will technology take out? Hoteliers have yet to figure out how guests will react to a more tech-heavy experience. A Marriott spokeswoman said in a statement that the chain was not deploying technology to eliminate jobs but was \u201cpersonalizing the guest experience and enhancing the stay.\u201dCliff Atkinson, senior vice president for hospitality at MGM Resorts, said new technologies had changed job descriptions at properties across his chain but had not eliminated jobs. Front-desk clerks displaced by automated check-in kiosks are deployed as \u201clobby ambassadors\u201d or concierges.Still, history suggests that the most powerful motivation to deploy new technologies has been the opportunity to reduce labor costs. From 1993 to 2007, Professors Acemoglu and Restrepo estimated, each new robot cut 5.6 jobs and reduced wages by 0.5 percent.As technology gets better and cheaper, there are lots of new tasks it could take over. \u201cIt is a new, uncharted area for our company and our industry as a whole,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. \u201cWe have talked about one or two brands being fully automated and self-service for the guest.\u201dDavid Autor, an economist at M.I.T., says it is plausible to foresee a future in which \u2014 as airlines have done \u2014 hotels deploy humans to tend to elite guests and automated systems for everybody else. Workers generate costs well beyond their hourly wage, Professor Autor argued. They get sick and take vacations and require managers. \u201cPeople are messy,\u201d he noted. \u201cMachines are straightforward.\u201dUnions would rather not have manufacturing\u2019s story repeat itself in the service sector. \u201cWe are trying to get ahead of that,\u201d said Anand Singh, president of Unite Here\u2019s local in San Francisco. \u201cWe are not Luddites, but we are seeking a real voice at table.\u201dEdward Wytkind, who until this year headed the Transportation Trades Department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said unions could not stop technology if they tried. \u201cMaybe you can stop it through one round of bargaining or slow it down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut innovation has been going on for 100 years and has never stopped.\u201dAnd he noted what might be the cost of success: \u201cAre we winning a future for workers? Not if the company goes out of business.\u201dA better strategy might be to demand a say in how technology is deployed.The Teamsters\u2019 tentative deal with U.P.S., for instance, calls for six months of advance warning to the union of technological deployments and for the creation of a committee with union and company representatives that would negotiate \u201cregarding the effects of the proposed technological changes.\u201dUnite Here is following a similar path. Mr. Singh listed the union\u2019s goals for Marriott contracts: \u201cWe want to talk about how technology can assist the work we perform and ease the rigors of our work, how our members are trained, what happens to workers who would otherwise be tagged as redundant, how our members are repositioned to succeed or hired into other workplaces.\u201dIn June, the union managed for the first time to include protections from technological change in its contracts covering workers at the Las Vegas properties of MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Workers will be trained to do jobs created or modified by new technology, allowing them to share in the productivity gains. The contracts also provide for the company to try to find jobs for displaced workers. But the union\u2019s key achievement was to get 180 days\u2019 warning of technological deployments.\u201cThey have to let us know and show us the prototypes and must negotiate with us,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cAt the end of the day, they can move forward, but this gives us time to understand the effects.\u201dIf they could choose a precedent from American labor history, today\u2019s union leaders might follow the path of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.In the 1960s and \u201970s, dockworkers were walloped by one of the most revolutionary technical innovations of the 20th century: containers. At a stroke, containers slashed both the time and number of workers needed to load a ship, saving vast amounts of money.But you need a lot of power to get a deal like that. The longshore union could shut down ports at will, imposing huge costs on shippers. For workers lacking that kind of clout, the gains achieved by the longshoremen seem out of reach.Unite Here\u2019s victories so far have been hard won. \u201cIt was not an easy ask,\u201d Mr. Taylor said of the language on technology in the Las Vegas deals. \u201cIt does infringe on hotels\u2019 right to do what they want.\u201dThe outcome might or might not deliver a greater share of the gains from technology to workers. But front-desk clerks and concierges will have better options than severance when Alexa or computer software takes over some of their tasks. \u201cIt was a good resolution,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cTime will tell if it is good enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In KFC\u2019s China Ads, Nuggets Are Served With Patriotism", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe fast food chain\u2019s campaign celebrates the country\u2019s four-decade rise from rural poverty to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. HONG KONG \u2014 China began an audacious experiment four decades ago to inject free-market thinking into its rigid, Communist-controlled political system, beginning a process that would lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty and create the world\u2019s second-largest economy.And what better way to celebrate this accomplishment than with a bucket of fried chicken?Last week, KFC introduced an advertising campaign in mainland China celebrating 40 years of \u201creform and opening up,\u201d the catchphrase that defined the era. A two-minute TV spot that aired on state television showed two Chinese celebrities traveling back in time by railway, seeing streets filled with bicycles and bamboo scaffolding.The actors are then jolted back into the present on a high-speed bullet train to sporting events that evoke the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and to young people using smartphones and cheering at pop music concerts. As the ad continues, it shows people carrying boxes and buckets of KFC, with one group of twentysomethings clinking chicken nuggets together as if toasting with champagne.\u201cWho would have thought that the past 40 years would bring so much change?\u201d one of the stars, the 44-year-old actor Huang Bo, says to Lu Han, a 28-year-old Chinese heartthrob. The TV spot concludes with a voice-over \u201csaluting\u201d China\u2019s 40th anniversary of economic reform and a cheer of \u201cGo, China!\u201d Then it touts KFC\u2019s seasonal meal deals. They include a bucket proclaiming \u201c40 years of reform and opening up\u201d that contains three chicken nuggets, three drinks, two wings, two meat pastries, two burgers and a box of popcorn chicken. Price: about $14.80.Foreign companies in China rarely venture into the political realm in their advertising, but the ad comes at a potentially difficult time. The mounting trade war between the United States and China, a major market for American consumer brands, has strained the two countries\u2019 commercial ties. \u201cKFC can potentially capitalize on CCTV\u2019s prestige and benefit in the Chinese market at the critical moment when there are increasing tensions between the U.S. and China,\u201d said Hongmei Li, an associate professor of strategic communication at Miami University in Ohio and the author of the book \u201cAdvertising and Consumer Culture in China.\u201dThe ad has been greeted with a mix of amusement and cynicism in China, where consumers are increasingly marketing-savvy.\u201cIt makes me feel nostalgic,\u201d Guo Yuhong, a 51-year-old retiree, said of the part of the advertisement set decades ago. \u201cYou know it used to be very luxurious to eat KFC in the past?\u201dOthers were less impressed.\u201cLook at the bright red color,\u201d Wang Xuejing, a Beijing customer, said as she scrolled through a KFC banner ad tailored for WeChat, a popular Chinese social media platform. \u201cIt\u2019s so plain, not modern at all.\u201d\u201cVery tacky,\u201d said her companion, Zheng Boyi, pointing to the gold lettering on the bucket they had shared. \u201cIt\u2019s China red,\u201d Yang Donghe, a 17-year-old model, said with some hesitation about the campaign\u2019s red-and-gold color scheme. \u201cNot bad.\u201dKFC also appeals to patriotism in other countries.Arriving in 1987, KFC was an early entrant among consumer brands after China opened up to foreign investment, and it won broad appeal in part by tailoring its menu to local tastes. Breakfast combos of fried dough sticks and soy milk are a hit, and meal deals also offer rice. Its fried chicken comes in local flavors, encrusted with salted egg yolk or Sichuan spices.KFC now has more locations in China than in the United States, with more than 5,000 restaurants in more than 1,000 cities.The brand has slipped in popularity in recent years, facing competition from higher-end foreign brands like Pizza Express, a British chain, as well as cheaper local upstarts like Zhen Gongfu, or Real Kung Fu in Chinese. Yum Brands, which owns the KFC brand in the United States, spun off its Yum China operation two years ago, and it is now a separate company. Representatives of Yum China, which owns KFC stores in China, did not respond to requests for comment. It is unclear whether the new ad campaign will gin up business for the restaurant chain, but some Chinese diners doubt it. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about the ad,\u201d said Yu Peng, a 28-year-old customer. \u201cIt won\u2019t affect my decision of eating KFC or not, though. I care more about the price and quality.\u201dTiffany May reported from Hong Kong, and Zoe Mou from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. and Canada Reach Trade Deal to Salvage Nafta", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe deal came after a weekend of frantic talks to try and preserve a trade agreement that has stitched together the economies of Mexico, Canada and the United States but that was on the verge of collapsing. After more than a year of tense talks and strained relations between President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, negotiators from both sides came to a resolution just ahead of a midnight deadline set by the White House.The 11th-hour agreement was punctuated by a frenetic Sunday, with Canada\u2019s leaders teleconferencing throughout the day with top American officials in Washington. Mr. Trudeau convened a 10 p.m. cabinet meeting in Ottawa to brief officials on the deal, as Jared Kushner, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers, and Robert E. Lighthizer, the president\u2019s top trade negotiator, hashed out the final details. Mexico\u2019s under secretary of foreign trade, Juan Carlos Baker, was expected to present the texts of the agreement to the Mexican senate just before midnight.In a joint statement, Mr. Lighthizer and Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, said the new deal \u201cwill give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region.\u201dThe trilateral deal will no longer be called Nafta, they said, but will be named the \u201cUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u201dThe deal represents a win for President Trump, who has derided Nafta for years and threatened to pull the United States from the pact if it was not rewritten in America\u2019s favor. Overhauling trade deals has been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top priorities as president and he has used tariffs and other threats to try and force trading partners to rewrite agreements in America\u2019s favor.The agreement reached on Sunday includes changes to several provisions in Nafta.\u25a0 International settlement dispute: A system that allows Nafta countries to rely on an independent body to resolve disputes will remain intact. Canada had insisted on keeping this provision, known as Chapter 19.\u25a0 Dairy: The United States will be allowed to increase dairy exports into Canada, a win for Mr. Trump, who had insisted on greater access for United States dairy farmers.\u25a0 Autos: Requires a higher percentage of a car to be manufactured in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. For the first time, the deal requires that a percentage of any vehicle that qualifies for zero tariffs must be manufactured in a factory where the average production wage is at least $16 an hour.\u25a0 Tariffs \u2014 Steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place on Canada and Mexico, pending further negotiations. Canada and Mexico secure at least a partial exemption from any potential future American tariffs on automobiles.Canada\u2018s agreement to ease protections on its dairy market will provide access that is greater than what the United States would have gained through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty that Mr. Trump withdrew from last year.The United States also relented on its demands to eliminate an independent tariff dispute settlement system that Canada has said is a red line in negotiations. Keeping that was a major concession for the United States and a change for what was agreed with Mexico.The countries also reached an understanding that would protect Canada from the automobile tariffs that Mr. Trump has routinely threatened, though it is not clear how far those protections would extend. A senior administration official said that if those tariffs were imposed on global imports, Canada and Mexico would receive \u201caccommodations\u201d for their existing car production.But in a sign of how fraught trade relations remain, Canada did not win assurances that Mr. Trump would lift the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed earlier this year. Administration officials said that no changes had been made and that those levies are being addressed on a different track.The agreement builds upon the deal that was reached with Mexico in August. That made updates to provisions surrounding the digital economy, agriculture and labor unions. Most importantly it made alterations to rules governing automobile manufacturing, in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico.\u201cIt\u2019s a good day for Canada,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said late Sunday, after convening a meeting with his cabinet. He said he would deliver more details about the agreement on Monday.President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico said on Friday that Mr. Trudeau had appealed to him to help pave the way for a three-nation deal and that he would insist that a revised Nafta include Canada.While Canada had played down the end-of-the-month deadline, the talks were restarted in earnest this weekend as the United States and Mexico signaled they would release text of their bilateral trade agreement as early as Friday. Mexico wants a deal signed before Dec. 1, when the new Mexican administration takes over, and the Trump administration wants the current, Republican-controlled Congress to vote on the deal quickly, given a potential change in control after the November midterm elections.Industry groups cheered the deal on Sunday night.\u201cManufacturers are extremely encouraged that our call for a trilateral agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico has been answered,\u201d Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.A revised Nafta that includes Canada has a far greater chance of being ratified by Congress but its fate is still somewhat uncertain. Democrats could take control of the House or the Senate in the midterm elections in November and attempt to call for changes to the agreement.\u201cThe crucial test for a new Nafta, or any new trade agreement, is whether it is enforceable, particularly with respect to promises to protect worker rights and the environment,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cAmericans are sick of hearing speeches about the benefits of new trade agreements when the agreements in place aren\u2019t even enforced and their opportunities don\u2019t materialize.\u201dLawmakers have said they do not expect Congress to vote on the deal until early next year.Catherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto and Katie Rogers from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why I Applaud the Unpopular Mr. Macron", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe French have soured on their wunderkind president. He\u2019s aloof and tone-deaf, it\u2019s said. What else is new?Opinion ColumnistPARIS \u2014 The French, it seems, have soured on President Emmanuel Macron, the wunderkind who swept to power 16 months ago. His poll numbers have slumped as the gloss on the 40-year-old upstart has faded. The consensus is in: He\u2019s aloof, Jupiter-like, tone-deaf, devoted to coddling the rich.In a whirlwind of activity, Macron has taken aim at the protections and entitlements that have made it hard to hire and fire in France, and sometimes made not working (at least in the official economy) more rewarding than working.Live well, live hidden, goes the old French saying. Financial success is always a little suspect. Money is like God: best not mentioned in public. \u201cPro-business\u201d remains an insult. Macron, the young disrupter and ex-banker, has been challenging an old country to adjust its self-image, embrace risk over security. Many have tried to do that. Many have failed.So the domestic honeymoon is over, like the coziness with President Trump that could not stop Trump trashing international agreements dear to Macron (Iran, climate). The rekindled thrill at Macron\u2019s Gaullist pomp has ceded to irritation at his airs. A scandal involving his security chief, Alexandre Benalla, who was caught on video beating up a protester, was handled badly enough to become an \u201caffaire.\u201d Macron can be peremptory when his convictions are challenged. The business of politics engages him less than the burdens of history.For decades, there were two skeletons in the French closet \u2014 Vichy and the Algerian War. The shame of France \u2014 for its World War II collaboration, for its brutal colonial war \u2014 eluded honest accountings. Such lies and evasions are ticking bombs in the fabric of any society.This month, Macron also aimed a volley of truth at the cast of little-England chameleons, headed by the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who ushered Britain to its unfinest hour, the delusional decision to leave the European Union.\u201cThose who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it\u2019s going to bring a lot of money home are liars,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt\u2019s even more true since they left the day after so as not to have to deal with it.\u201dThese were words that needed saying. With each passing week the immense cost of Britain\u2019s fit of pique becomes clearer. Macron remains Europe\u2019s most vigorous bulwark against the wave of nationalism, nativism, xenophobia and small-mindedness that were expressed in the Brexit vote and have found expression across a continent anxious about immigration.Macron faces no domestic presidential or parliamentary elections until 2022. With the weakening of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, he is the only European politician who can stand up to the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, whose illiberal model for the evisceration of democracy through the politics of fear has traction. The European Parliament elections in May 2019 will be an important barometer of the Macron-Orban confrontation.To be a serious historical figure today is to stand in isolation. Judgment is instantaneous, sometimes irrevocable. Macron has made mistakes. People do. I think he\u2019s the last best hope for the world I believe in and I salute him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Censors Bad Economic News Amid Signs of Slower Growth", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China has long made it clear that reporting on politics, civil society and sensitive historical events is forbidden. Increasingly, it wants to keep negative news about the economy under control, too.A government directive sent to journalists in China on Friday named six economic topics to be \u201cmanaged,\u201d according to a copy of the order that was reviewed by The New York Times.The list of topics includes:\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the situation is more serious than previously thought or that they want to prevent a panic,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a retired political science professor from Renmin University in Beijing.Mr. Zhang said the effect of the expanded censorship strategy could more readily cause people to believe rumors about the economy. \u201cThey are worried about chaos,\u201d he added. \u201cBut in barring the media from reporting, things may get more chaotic.\u201dThe directive didn\u2019t appear to affect run-of-mill daily coverage of economic data, which could still be widely found online in China on Friday. Instead, the directive appeared to be aimed at easing the overall tone.Indeed, another notice sent on Friday instructed online news outlets to remove comments at the bottom of news articles that \u201cbad-mouth the Chinese economy.\u201dChina\u2019s propaganda department couldn\u2019t be reached late Friday for comment.Negative economic news could undermine the careful message Chinese officials have tried to transmit to the public in recent months. They have said that the country\u2019s vast and growing ranks of consumers, as well as China\u2019s increasing sophistication in technology and other areas, would help it weather any ill effects from rising American tariffs.The trade war could certainly worsen the economic climate if it lingers, leading to job losses and even weaker consumer sentiment. But China has more deep-seated economic problems.Officials are trying to clean up huge debts accumulated by local governments. Curbing debt could mean slower economic growth, as it deprives borrowers of the funds they would otherwise spend.Mark Williams, chief Asia economist of Capital Economics, said the firm expects the Chinese economy to slow down to 5 to 5.5 percent from 6.9 percent last year. Despite the lower forecast, he stressed that it was \u201cnot a weak number\u201d for the Chinese economy.\u201cOne of the problems is there\u2019s a lot of doubt about official Chinese data,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cAnd when they come out with these directives, it just raises more questions.\u201dIn the past year, domestic news media have had to write their stories on the economy with a gentler tone, said a journalist covering finance for a Chinese business newspaper, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Censors have also erased online commentary that contained the phrases \u201cconsumption downgrade,\u201d taxes, debt and unemployment, according to the Journalism and Media Studies Center at the University of Hong Kong, which monitors censorship on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like social media service.One post that was removed by censors said: \u201cThe bad news in the market is exploding, pessimistic viewpoints are spreading, many retail investors are in despair.\u201dAnother read: \u201cWill the emergence of robots free up labor or cause unemployment and poverty?\u201dThe scrutiny over economic news adds to a broader pattern of the tightening of control over media since President Xi Jinping came into power in 2012. Particularly online, the Chinese government has centralized and beefed up regulatory agencies that monitor content. Recently, the agencies have come down harder on entertainment news and celebrity gossip, in addition to political and social issues.Two weeks earlier, NetEase, an online news portal, said it had to suspend updating its financial platform \u201cbecause of serious problems.\u201dSui-Lee Wee reported from Beijing, and Li Yuan from Hong KongAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sweden\u2019s Centrists Prevail Even as Far Right Has Its Best Showing Ever", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySTOCKHOLM \u2014 Sweden looked set for a period of political confusion after election results on Sunday put a center-right bloc and the governing center-left coalition neck and neck, while a far-right, anti-immigration party came in third \u2014 winning a higher percentage of the vote than ever before, but achieving less of a breakthrough than polls had suggested.With more than 99 percent of ballots counted, the national election commission reported that the governing center-left Social Democrats had 28.4 percent of the vote, making it the largest single vote-getter, but handing the party its worst showing in decades.The center-right Moderate party was next at 19.8 percent, while the far-right Sweden Democrats were running third, with 17.6 percent, up from 12.9 percent in 2014 but a less successful showing than many Swedes had feared. Some polls had predicted that the Sweden Democrats would come in second, with more than 20 percent of the vote.The red-green bloc of center-left, leftist and environmental parties, led by the Social Democrats, had 40.6 percent of the vote. The center-right alliance, led by the Moderates, was just behind with 40.3 percent. The results mean neither bloc can command a majority in Parliament, and both have rejected the idea of any deal with the Sweden Democrats.For some voters, the fierce debates were a welcome change.\u201cIn Sweden we have been too afraid to discuss the issues,\u201d said Anders Nilsson, 54, an I.T. engineer who voted for the Center party in Botkyrka, a diverse suburb south of Stockholm. \u201cNow we dare to discuss tough questions.\u201d\u201cThe world\u2019s eyes are on Sweden and the path it takes,\u201d Annie Loof, the head of the Center Party, said in a debate before the vote.The Social Democrat prime minister, Stefan Lofven, who runs a minority government of the center-left, had warned voters on Saturday not to cast their ballots for what he called a \u201cracist\u201d party.\u201cThis election is a referendum about our welfare,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about decency, about a decent democracy and not letting the Sweden Democrats, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government.\u201dJimmie Akesson, the leader of the Sweden Democrats, told supporters on Saturday that the current government had \u201cprioritized, during these four years, asylum-seekers,\u201d listing failures to do more for health care, housing and pensioners. \u201cSweden needs breathing space,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need tight, responsible immigration policies.\u201dThe results on Sunday followed another recent European election pattern: the shrinking of mainstream parties of the center-left and the center-right as they lose votes to more extreme parties on both sides of the political spectrum, as well as to environmentalist parties.In Sweden, this shift has raised questions about whether the main parties will keep their vows to have no dealings with the Sweden Democrats, or whether they will have to reach some understanding with the party, especially on crucial budget votes.The main parties may try to negotiate some sort of grand coalition, but that would be unusual in Sweden, where minority governments are fairly common.About 7.5 million registered voters chose from almost 6,300 candidates for a four-year term in the 349-seat Parliament.Arian Vassili, a 23-year-old engineering student who voted Sunday in Botkyrka, said he supported the Social Democrats. \u201cThis is an incredibly important election,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an election about values, how you view people, your fellow human beings and whether we are going to take care of each other.\u201dMaria Enberg, 42, a cook who lives in Botkyrka, said she had voted for the Center party. \u201cThe Sweden Democrats have become so big, and I really wanted to vote against them. I don\u2019t want any racist party governing in Sweden.\u201dThe Sweden Democrats\u2019 rise began in 2010, when the party crossed the 4 percent threshold for Parliament seats, getting 5.7 percent of the vote. In 2014, its vote share rose to 12.9 percent, making it Sweden\u2019s third-largest party.The Sweden Democrats have greatly benefited since the migration wave of 2015, when 163,000 asylum seekers came to Sweden, about 1.6 percent of the population.Under Mr. Akesson\u2019s leadership, the party has tried to soften its image. It now uses for the party logo a floppy flower in Sweden\u2019s colors of blue and yellow instead of a flaming torch, and the party insists that it will not tolerate racism. But it campaigned on keeping \u201cSweden Swedish,\u201d cracking down on crime and questioning whether immigrants and Islam will alter the country\u2019s identity.As in Germany, stricter border controls have been introduced in Sweden, and the numbers of new immigrants has fallen steeply, to about 23,000 this year.But the political damage had been done, and despite a thriving economy and generally low unemployment, the Sweden Democrats argued that immigration should stop and that resources should go to refurbishing Sweden\u2019s famous welfare state, which is strained by an aging population and the challenge of taking on migrants.During the campaign, the right-wing party spoke directly about traditionally taboo subjects like identity, Islam, integration and crime, winning supporters who felt the traditional parties had been reluctant to touch such sensitive issues. The party, along with the Left party on the other extreme, has benefited from a general sense of discontent and loss of confidence in the political system.Li Bennich-Bj\u00f6rkman, a political scientist at Uppsala University, said it was \u201csort of shocking\u201d that the Sweden Democrats could come this far, but she noted that the party, which has disavowed its roots in the white supremacist movement, had transformed.\u201cI would say that the major part of their electorate are not racist and fascist,\u201d Ms. Bennich-Bj\u00f6rkman said. \u201cThey have managed very skillfully to transform themselves into a variant of the Social Democratic party, just with more nationalist ambitions,\u201d she said.The Social Democrats, who have dominated the country for a century, built Sweden\u2019s welfare state. But their support has declined from 45 percent in 1994 to just over 28 percent on Sunday. The Left Party had 7.9 percent of the vote, and the Green Party 4.4 percent.The Moderate party, led by Ulf Kristersson, leads the center-right bloc. He was chosen in October 2017 to head the party when his predecessor, Anna Kinberg Batra, resigned after suggesting that it might be possible to work with the Sweden Democrats. In its alliance, the Center Party won 8.6 percent of the vote, the Christian Democrats 6.4 percent and the Liberals 5.5 percent.On Sunday night, Mr. Kristersson called on the prime minister to resign. \u201cThis government has run its course,\u201d he told a party rally.With the two blocs so close to each other, negotiations over forming a government are expected to be drawn out. \u201cUsually we are quick in forming a new government,\u201d said Mr. Holmberg, the political scientist. \u201cThis time it could drag on for weeks or months.\u201dBoth centrist parties have moved to the right under the pressure of the Sweden Democrats and have promised tougher policies on immigration, the integration of refugees and crime.Daniel Suhonen, the head of Katalys, a trade union research group, said he saw \u201cvery sad\u201d parallels in the United States for the Sweden Democrats\u2019 rise.\u201cThey had a clear answer, like Trump,\u201d he said at a Social Democrats event. \u201cThey said all the problems in Sweden are created by an elite that is corrupt and ruined the country with immigration, and you can see that in your bad pension, the lack of affordable housing for your adult children. They said you can solve it if you stop immigration.\u201dChristina Anderson reported from Stockholm and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Do We Actually Know About the Economy? (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMacroeconomics is better than you think, microeconomics worse, and data are limitedOpinion ColumnistIn a couple of days I\u2019m giving a luncheon talk to the New York chapter of the National Association of Business Economists, and the title of this essay was the title I provided for the talk. To be honest, it was a bit of a dummy title, and I wasn\u2019t at all sure what I would actually say; but I\u2019ve been spending some time trying to pin things down, and found myself wanting to put it together in a little essay. So here are some meta reflections on economic knowledge, inspired in part but not entirely by the financial crisis and its aftermath.Now, obviously the crisis has inspired both soul-searching among economists and a lot of outside criticism. But I\u2019d argue that most of both the internal soul-searching and the outsider criticism is off-base.Among macroeconomists, the self-criticism seems to me to be mainly too narrow: people berate themselves for, say, not giving financial markets a bigger role in their models, but few have done what they should, which is to question the whole direction macroeconomics has gone these past four decades or so.Among economists more generally, a lot of the criticism seems to amount to the view that macroeconomics is bunk, and that we should stick to microeconomics, which is the real, solid stuff. As I\u2019ll explain in a moment, that\u2019s all wrong. In fact, in an important sense the past decade has been a huge validation for textbook macroeconomics; meanwhile, the exaltation of micro as the only \u201creal\u201d economics both gives microeconomics too much credit and is largely responsible for the ways macroeconomic theory has gone wrong.Finally, many outsiders and some insiders have concluded from the crisis that economic theory in general is bunk, that we should take guidance from people immersed in the real world \u2013 say, business leaders \u2014 and/or concentrate on empirical results and skip the models. In reality, however, advice from business leaders has generally been worse than useless this past decade, while the voices in the air heard by madmen in authority have, as usual, given very bad advice. And while empirical evidence is important and we need more of it, the data almost never speak for themselves \u2013 a point amply illustrated by recent monetary events.So let me talk about three things:The unsung success of macroeconomicsThe excessive prestige of microeconomicsThe limits of empiricism, vital though it isThe clean little secret of macroeconomicsThere\u2019s a story about quantum physics \u2013 not sure where I read it \u2013 about the rivalry between the physicists Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman. Schwinger was first to work out how to do quantum electrodynamics, but his methods were incredibly difficult and cumbersome. Feynman hit upon a much simpler approach \u2013 his famous diagrams \u2013 which turned out to be equivalent, but vastly easier to use.Schwinger, as I remember the story, was never seen to use a Feynman diagram. But he had a locked room in his house, and the rumor was that that room was where he kept the Feynman diagrams he used in secret.Now, the thing about IS-LM-type analysis is that using it isn\u2019t that big a deal in normal times, but it makes some very strong predictions \u2013 predictions very much at odds with many peoples\u2019 priors \u2014 about abnormal times. Specifically, this kind of analysis says that when there is a really big adverse shock to demand \u2013 say, from the collapse of a major housing bubble \u2013 there\u2019s a regime change, and neither monetary nor fiscal policy have the same effects they do in normal times.What about fiscal policy? Traditional macro said that at the zero lower bound there would be no crowding out \u2013 that deficits wouldn\u2019t drive up interest rates, and that fiscal multipliers would be larger than under normal conditions. The first of these predictions was obviously borne out, as rates stayed low even when deficits were very large. The second prediction is a bit harder to test, for reasons I\u2019ll get into when I talk about the limits of empiricism. But the evidence does indeed suggest large positive multipliers.The overall story, then, is one of overwhelming predictive success. Basic, old-fashioned macroeconomics didn\u2019t fail in the crisis \u2013 it worked extremely well. In fact, it\u2019s hard to think of any other example of economic models working this well \u2013 making predictions that most non-economists (and some economists) refused to believe, indeed found implausible, but which came true. Where, for example, can you find any comparable successes in microeconomics?But, you say, we didn\u2019t see the Great Recession coming. Well, what do you mean \u201cwe,\u201d white man? OK, what\u2019s true is that few economists realized that there was a huge housing bubble. But that\u2019s not a failure of fundamental models: the models certainly would have predicted that a bursting bubble that slashed residential investment by 4 percent of GDP and destroyed $7 trillion in homeowners\u2019 equity would cause a severe recession. What happened was that economists refused to believe that home prices could be that out of touch with reality.That\u2019s not exactly a problem with macroeconomics; to some extent it\u2019s a problem with financial economics, but mainly I think it reflected the general unwillingness of human beings (a category that includes many though not necessarily all economists) to believe that so many people can be so wrong about something so big.The bottom line: the past decade has been a vindication, not a refutation, of good old-fashioned macro. Which brings me to the flip side: microeconomics is not as great as advertised.The dirty little secret of microeconomicsI spent much of my academic, pre-public intellectual career straddling two surprisingly distinct economics sub-fields. To normal human beings the study of international trade and that of international macroeconomics might sound like pretty much the same thing. In reality, however, the two fields used very different models, had very different intellectual cultures, and tended to look down on each other. Trade people tended to consider international macro people semi-charlatans, doing ad hoc stuff devoid of rigor. International macro people considered trade people boring, obsessed with proving theorems and offering little of real-world use.Both sides were, of course, right.Anyway, I think it\u2019s fair to say that over the past few decades the economics profession has tended to take the micro side of this debate. Microeconomic theory, grounded in rigorous derivation of individual behavior from utility maximization, was taken as the gold standard. Old-fashioned macroeconomics, based on loose psychological propositions like the marginal propensity to consume, and often describing aggregate relationships without explicitly describing what individuals were doing, was considered dubious and uncouth.Indeed, macroeconomists were sufficiently hurt by the sneers of microeconomists that they spent several decades trying to make their field as much like micro as they could.But does microeconomics really deserve its reputation of moral and intellectual superiority? No.Even before the rise of behavioral economics, any halfway self-aware economist realized that utility maximization \u2013 indeed, the very concept of utility \u2014 wasn\u2019t a fact about the world; it was more of a thought experiment, whose conclusions should always have been stated in the subjunctive.Yes, we believe that people tend to act in their self-interest and don\u2019t usually pass up obvious opportunities to make themselves better off. So it made sense to follow that line of thought to its end point. What if we imagined individuals who knew what they wanted and pursued the optimal strategy, given the constraints they faced, to achieve as much of those goals as possible? If that were the case, what would that predict about behavior?It\u2019s an interesting and sometimes illuminating exercise. But it\u2019s not proof that the world actually works that way. And the truth is that it often doesn\u2019t. Kahneman and Tversky and Thaler and so on deserved all the honors they received for helping to document the specific ways in which utility maximization falls short, but even before their work we should never have expected perfect maximization to be a good description of reality.True, a model doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to provide hugely important insights. But here\u2019s my question: where are the examples of microeconomic theory providing strong, counterintuitive, successful predictions on the same order as the success of IS-LM macroeconomics after 2008? Maybe there are some, but I can\u2019t come up with any.The point is not that micro theory is useless and we should stop doing it. But it doesn\u2019t deserve to be seen as superior to macro modeling.And the effort to make macro more and more like micro \u2013 to ground everything in rational behavior \u2013 has to be seen now as destructive. True, that effort did lead to some strong predictions: e.g., only unanticipated money should affect real output, transitory income changes shouldn\u2019t affect consumer spending, government spending should crowd out private demand, etc. But all of those predictions have turned out to be wrong.What data can and can\u2019t tell usData are good (they are also, as far as I\u2019m concerned, plural, although this is looking like a losing battle.) Some of my best friends are data. The growing focus of economists on empirical evidence is very much a good thing.But data never speak for themselves, for a couple of reasons. One, which is familiar, is that economists don\u2019t get to do many experiments, and natural experiments are rare: the vast bulk of the data we see reflect the confounding effects of variables we aren\u2019t interested in, and reverse causation on the variables we are trying to assess.The other problem is that even when we do get something like natural experiments, they often took place under economic regimes that aren\u2019t relevant to current problems.Both of these problems were extremely relevant in the years following the 2008 crisis.Start with the effects of monetary expansion. History actually provides us with many examples of countries that rapidly expanded their money supplies, and the great majority of these examples look like, say, Brazil in the 80s and 90s:That is, you might be tempted to conclude that the empirical evidence is that monetary expansion is inflationary, indeed roughly one-for-one.But you needed a model, something like IS-LM-with-Tobin, to tell you which examples were relevant. The data didn\u2019t speak for themselves.What about fiscal policy? The raw correlation between budget deficits and real output is negative, not positive, but everyone knows that this is because most of the causation runs from GDP to the budget, not the other way around.So you wanted to look for examples of major shifts in fiscal policy that didn\u2019t reflect automatic stabilizers. For the U.S. that mainly meant wars; across a broader set of countries, you could look at the effects of austerity programs. Both these sources of sort-of natural experiments suggested a positive multiplier, but less than one, i.e., private-sector crowding out or in.I would also note that because assessing fiscal policy changes can be subject to a serious error-in-variables problem, you really want to look at extreme changes. This means, in particular, that when we\u2019re talking about austerity policies you want to look at the period 2009-2012, the post-Greece panic; everything after that is relatively small changes at the edges, subject to so much measurement error that you wouldn\u2019t expect to find clear results.The point is that empirical evidence can only do certain things. It can certainly prove that your theory is wrong! And it can also make a theory much more persuasive in those cases where the theory makes surprising predictions, which the data bear out. But the data can never absolve you from the necessity of having theories.So what do we know about the economy?Over this past decade, I\u2019ve watched a number of economists try to argue from authority: I am a famous professor, therefore you should believe what I say. This never ends well. I\u2019ve also seen a lot of nihilism: economists don\u2019t know anything, and we should tear the field down and start over.Obviously I differ with both views. Economists haven\u2019t earned the right to be snooty and superior, especially if their reputation comes from the ability to do hard math: hard math has been remarkably little help lately, if ever.On the other hand, economists do turn out to know quite a lot: they do have some extremely useful models, usually pretty simple ones, that have stood up well in the face of evidence and events. And they definitely shouldn\u2019t defer to important and/or rich people on policy: compare Janet Yellen\u2019s macroeconomic track record with that of the multiple billionaires who warned that Bernanke would debase the dollar. Or take my favorite Business Week headline from 2010: \u201cKrugman or [John] Paulson: Who You Gonna Bet On?\u201d Um.The important thing is to be aware of what we do know, and why.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Never Heard of Bolivian Wine? That May Be About to Change", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cYou could say, in a way, Bolivia won the contest,\u201d said Mr. van Casteren, who is a Master of Wine, the wine-world equivalent of a Ph.D. \u201cI wanted to prove that the best Bolivian wines can compete with the best of the world.\u201dMr. van Casteren had a horse in this race: For the past eight years, he has been a consultant for the Dutch government, helping Bolivian winemakers improve their products for export.That is changing. Exports are trickling into the United States, Brazil, Europe and China, mostly in restaurants. \u201cI think there will be much more interest in Bolivian wines in the next six to 12 months,\u201d Mr. van Casteren said.When he started to consult here, none of the country\u2019s 65 wineries exported bottles. Now, five do.Still, their reach is limited. Bolivia\u2019s vineyards total only about 1.5 percent of the 550,000 acres in neighboring Argentina \u2014 the world\u2019s sixth-largest wine producer \u2014 and Bolivia\u2019s annual production of 8.3 million liters is a molecule among the world\u2019s 25 billion liters.One doesn\u2019t usually find poverty and high-quality wines in the same place. Yet although it is one of the poorest countries in South America, Bolivia has a long tradition of winemaking, so the quality of its wines is surprisingly good. While the terrain offers its own challenges, from jungle to mountains, it also has benefits.200 milesBrazilPeruBoliviaLa PazSamaipataValle de los CintisTarijaParaguayChileArgentinaBy The New York TimesDaily temperatures can swing more than 35 degrees, which concentrates acidity, and summer rains dilute the wine, yielding a more elegant style, one \u201cmore associated with cool climates of the Old World,\u201d Mr. Roig said.No calling-card varietal has emerged. Muscat of Alexandria, a white grape, accounts for 70 percent of grapes planted in Bolivia, but most is used to distill the pisco-like spirit singani. Though the Spanish arrived with grapes in the 16th century, the modern industry is only 50 years old, so winemakers are still exploring different grape varieties.Many vineyards are banking on tannat to give Bolivia a special international identity, as did the wine that finished second in Mr. van Casteren\u2019s tasting, by the third-generation winemaker Nelson Sfarcich of Campos de Solana.There are also pockets of grape varietals that were originally brought from the Canary Islands by the Spanish, like torront\u00e9s and pedro gim\u00e9nez in whites and negra criolla in reds. Vicchoque\u00f1a is a mutant of negra criolla that yields a wine akin to pinot noir.The Valle de los Cintis, north of Tarija, is the spiritual home of small-scale traditional winemaking. There are still about 30 vineyards with parrales, or climbing vines, some 100 to 250 years old, that grow entangled with moelle and cha\u00f1ar trees. The Spanish used this system to protect the grapes from sun and diseases; it has disappeared everywhere else in the world, Mr. van Casteren said.At Cepas de Fuego, Weymar R\u00edos Cavero, who is in his mid-70s, still makes wine much the way his father and grandfather did, hand-blending fertilizer and mixing a natural spray for diseases. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve done is to put in trellises and search for grapes best adapted to here,\u201d he said. His syrah is a standout, Mr. Tottenborg said.Amane Hagiwara, 31, who grew up in Japan and North Africa and trained in France, discovered the valley while traveling and has made it his home for three years. Drawn by the terroir and tradition, he ferments old-vine moscatel de Alejandria and negra criolla in locally made clay amphoras for his label, Los Bauguales.\u201cWhat we have to do,\u201d he said, is to be true to the local terroir \u201cand not copy winemaking from elsewhere. Make it how you feel it, with your tradition, with your history; then you can transmit something real.\u201dNortheast of Valle de los Cintis, the valleys of Santa Cruz and Samaipata demonstrate the potential for growth. When Mr. Roig established his winery in this region in 2007, there were just 100 acres planted. Now there are more than 1,200. Bolivia has up to 20 times more land suitable for grape cultivation than it uses.Mr. Roig, who left Bolivia when he was 17 and now lives in Washington, D.C., is focused on exports to Europe and the United States. That the wine \u201cis recognized by people abroad brings up self-awareness and pride\u201d for Bolivians, he said.Mr. Escobar cited a study showing that for every 25 acres of grapes planted, 10 families are lifted out of poverty. \u201cOur ambitions are very big for Bolivian wine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think it can be the next region, like Georgia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Independents Approve of the Economy, but Will It Help Republicans in the Midterms?", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRelying on independents as a bellwether for political outcomes is not as straightforward as it seems. For one thing, many of them aren\u2019t paying that much attention to politics.Similarly, when Mr. Obama was president and the economy was growing, Republicans thought it was getting worse, and Democrats thought things were improving. Today, those same Democrats think the economy is worse than it was a year ago, while Republicans think things have gotten better.But what about independents? What nonpartisans make of Mr. Trump\u2019s stewardship of the economy may give us some insight into whether Republicans will get a boost in the midterms, because independents are often the most persuadable voters. It may also offer an indicator of whether weakly committed Republican partisans might defect at the polls, even as their ratings of presidential approval remain high.Despite the fact that more people are declining to register at the polls as belonging to one party or another, the number of people identifying themselves as independents with no party tendencies has been relatively stable.Sixty percent of nonpartisans from the December 2011 wave of the study remain purely independent of party in the summer of 2018. The 40 percent who moved did so in roughly equal fashion to both sides of the aisle. About 13 percent changed their affiliation to lean toward Republicans, and another 13 percent to lean toward Democrats \u2014 still calling themselves independent when initially asked but acknowledging, when pressed on the question, that they tilt one way or the other.Another 6 percent changed their descriptions to weak partisans of each party (3 percent each), and the remainder split pretty evenly into strong partisans, with slightly fewer calling themselves strong Democrats than Republicans.Despite the unexpected events and vitriolic nature of much of the politics of the last two years \u2014 and despite the movement of 40 percent of independents out of the category over the last seven years \u2014 the share of independents in the electorate has changed by only 2 percent over all. There are slightly more independents in 2018 than there were in 2011, with more Democrats moving in to the category of independent than Republicans, but not by much.In December 2011, these nonpartisans were not impressed with the nation\u2019s economy. Roughly four in 10 thought things had stayed the same, and another four in 10 thought things had gotten worse between 2010 and 2011. Just over 8 percent thought things had gotten better, and 5 percent were not sure what to think. These assessments reflect the period\u2019s proximity to the global financial crisis and the fact that many people were still unsure whether the recovery would continue or expand.By 2016, these same independent voters had become slightly more optimistic. Five years from their first interview, just more than half of them thought things had stayed the same in the last year, while only 30 percent thought things had gotten worse. Still, only 12 percent thought things had gotten better between 2015 and 2016.After Mr. Trump\u2019s election, however, these same independent voters shifted their assessments of the economy in a notable manner: Just over a year after the president\u2019s inauguration, 35 percent of the nonpartisans in the Voter Study Group panel thought the economy had gotten better over the last year, nearly three times the share who thought so in 2016.Perhaps the unified message from political elites about a growing economy (with Democrats saying Mr. Obama delivered the recovery and Republicans crediting Mr. Trump) helped to nudge some independents into believing things had gotten better. But another interpretation is that the nonpartisan voters in 2018 simply appreciate that the economy is doing well \u2014 more so than they did in 2011 or 2016.Relying on independents as a bellwether for political outcomes is not as straightforward as it seems. Independents tend to be less connected to politics in general, paying less attention to news about public affairs and expressing less interest in politics than partisans.But if the midterm elections are a referendum on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, it may be relevant that today three times as many independents think the economy is growing as did in 2016. On the other hand, only a third of them think that, on average, things are better today than they were a year ago. This suggests that Mr. Trump\u2019s other qualities, and his many controversies, may not allow him to reap significant political benefits from a strong economy.Advertisement"}

With less money coming in and more going toward interest, political leaders will find it harder to address pressing needs like fixing crumbling roads and bridges or to make emergency moves like pulling the economy out of future recessions.Within a decade, more than $900 billion in interest payments will be due annually, easily outpacing spending on myriad other programs.

Interest payments will overtake Medicaid in 2020 and the Department of Defense budget in 2023.What\u2019s more, the heavy burden of interest payments could make it harder for the government to repair aging infrastructure or take on other big new projects. Mr. Trump has called for spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, but Congress has not taken up that idea.Until recently, ultralow interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve to support the economy, allowed lawmakers to borrow without fretting too much about the cost of that debt. But as the economy has strengthened, the Fed has gradually raised rates, starting in December 2015. The central bank is expected to push rates up again on Wednesday, and more increases are in store.\u201cWhen rates went down to record lows, it allowed the government to take on more debt without paying more interest,\u201d Mr. Goldwein said. \u201cThat party is ending.\u201dAfter bottoming out below 2 percent, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has climbed to over 3 percent recently.Yield on 10-year Treasury note8%MONTHLYRECESSIONS6420\u201998\u201900\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918Yield on 10-year Treasury note8%MONTHLYRECESSIONS6420\u201998\u201902\u201906\u201910\u201914\u201918By The New York Times | Source: ReutersThere\u2019s no guarantee that these forecasts will prove accurate.

As a result, the United States still has plenty of borrowing capacity left because the Fed can print money with fewer consequences than other central banks. And interest rates plunged over the last decade, even as the government turned to the market for trillions each year after the recession. That\u2019s because Treasury bonds are still the favored port of international investors in any economic storm. But that privileged position has allowed politicians in both parties to avoid politically painful steps like cutting spending or raising taxes.That doesn\u2019t mean rapidly rising interest costs and a bigger deficit won\u2019t eventually catch up with us. Charles Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter administration, once summed up the danger of deficits with a metaphor. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of the wolf at the door, but termites in the woodwork.\u201d Rather than simply splitting along party lines, lawmakers\u2019 attitudes toward the deficit also depend on which party is in power. Republicans pilloried the Obama administration for proposing a large stimulus in the depths of the recession in 2009 and complained about the deficit for years.In 2013, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called the debt and deficit \u201cthe transcendent issue of our era.\u201d By 2017, as Senate majority leader, he quickly shepherded the tax cut through Congress.Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who warned of the deficit\u2019s dangers in the past, nevertheless played down that threat on the Senate floor as the tax billed neared passage. \u201cI understand it\u2019s a risk, but I think it\u2019s an appropriate risk to be able to say let\u2019s allow Americans to keep more of their own money to invest in this economy,\u201d he said.He also claimed the tax cuts would pay for themselves even as the Congressional Budget Office estimated that they would add $250 billion to the deficit on average from 2019 to 2024. In an interview, Mr. Lankford insisted that the jury was still out on whether the tax cuts would generate additional revenue, citing the strong economic growth recently.While the Republican about-face has been much more striking, Democrats have adjusted their position, too.Mr. Warner, the Virginia Democrat, called last year\u2019s tax bill \u201cthe worst piece of legislation we have passed since I arrived in the Senate.\u201d In 2009, however, when Congress passed an $800 billion stimulus bill backed by the Obama administration, he called it \u201ca responsible mix of tax cuts and investments that will create jobs.\u201dThe difference, Mr. Warner said, was that the economy was near the precipice then.\u201cThere was virtual unanimity among economists that we needed a stimulus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a $2 trillion tax cut at the end of a business cycle with borrowed money won\u2019t end well.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Canada Won\u2019t Budge on Trade ", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispute settlements and dairy tariffs go to the heart of how Canada sees its relationship with the United States.Mr. Fagan is a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, University of Toronto.That same attitude may be at work in the recent dust-up between the two countries over President Trump\u2019s efforts to revise Nafta. Mexico, the third partner in the trade deal, has already reached its own arrangement with Washington. So why is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau digging in his heels? This is not a country known for taking bold stands. The United States and Canada have had trade disputes before. In 1994, there was a case involving the trade in live swine. A recent case dealt with supercalendered \u2014 glossy \u2014 paper. Each time, the conflict was resolved through a system of international panels, established by the 1986 negotiations (and later expanded under Nafta to include Mexico).Canada had fought hard for this system in the original trade talks. We insisted that the pact build up rules as well as tear down tariffs. But the United States had demanded that disputes be dealt with in its own courts. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney refused to budge, and in the end Washington did something almost unbelievable: It agreed, and in doing so limited its own domestic authority. \u201cO.K., you can have your damn dispute settlement proposal,\u201d Treasury Secretary James Baker told the Canadian side. But Canada\u2019s victory was really a compromise. The countries agreed to a two-tiered system: Domestic courts would rule first, while countries could appeal to binational panels in limited circumstances. Now Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiators want to take back that compromise and once again let domestic courts have the first and final say.As a practical matter, this is a pretty small change: The system runs smoothly, and appeals are less important than they used to be, at least in some people\u2019s eyes. And there\u2019s always the World Trade Organization, with its own dispute resolution process, as a backstop. But practical matters aren\u2019t the point. Many Canadians believe that Mexico caved to Mr. Trump, putting Canada in a precarious position as the outlier. The real issue here, as before, is the power imbalance.The dispute-resolution issue is similar to the other main obstacles facing negotiators: Canada\u2019s protection of its culture and dairy sectors. Canadians are intensely protective of their culture, especially when it is so close to, and so often overshadowed by, the United States\u2019. Because the original trade deal included protections for what Canada considered the critical pieces of its cultural heritage, Ottawa has insisted that such protection be maintained in any new deal; Washington, obviously, disagrees.Dairy is also a case where the principle may seem more important than the practical. Canada sets domestic prices for dairy products; for this to work, it needs to place limits on how much milk and cheese it imports. Canadian negotiators are willing to loosen up on some of those limits, as long as the country\u2019s command-and-control system survives. But that system is exactly what Mr. Trump has attacked with his tweets about \u201c270 percent tariffs,\u201d which in fact are rarely applied. In other words, the reason these talks have been so hard is that the two sides see them in fundamentally different terms. To Americans, Canada seems to be making a big fuss over minor details. To Canadians, Americans \u2014 and Mr. Trump above all \u2014 seem intent on undermining hard-fought protections.Canada is perfectly happy to negotiate changes to Nafta; in fact, they\u2019re overdue. The negotiations should have been about working together in the digital age. A deal should simplify rules of origin and align regulations for trade in goods, as well as focus on trade in services. It should open up government procurement and clarify intellectual property rules. Some of these are in play, but they\u2019re hardly anyone\u2019s priority.Thirty years ago, Prime Minister Mulroney was intent on deepening trade relations with the United States. Now Prime Minister Trudeau has named a minister of international trade diversification. Diversification from what? No one in Canada need ask.Drew Fagan is a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, University of Toronto, and a former head of policy planning at Canada\u2019s Foreign Affairs Department.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Finally Makes It to the Big Apple", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a bank of the Bronx River, below the roar of the Bruckner Expressway, Walmart has finally found a foothold in a city that has long shunned it.Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business, Jet.com, is leasing a 205,000-square-foot warehouse in the Bronx that will soon begin supplying MacBooks and organic eggs to New York\u2019s well-heeled shoppers.The physical presence is a victory for the nation\u2019s largest retailer, which has faced resistance from labor groups and their political allies every time it has proposed opening a store in the five boroughs. But it\u2019s also an acknowledgment that the company\u2019s longtime national strategy won\u2019t work in certain big cities.With a revamped Jet\u2019s new push into New York, Walmart is trying to reach beyond its core base of big-box stores in rural and suburban America and compete for higher-income urbanites. A retailing empire built on no frills and low prices, Walmart is using Jet to entice millennials and young families with trendy, premium products like Big Gay Ice Cream and Dr. Martens shoes.\u201cWe believe we can win in New York,\u201d Jet\u2019s president, Simon Belsham, said in an interview.By acquiring stand-alone businesses, Walmart has been able to avoid the political furor it typically sets off in left-leaning cities where there is deep support for the unions that Walmart has rebuffed. Jet is also pushing to grow its business in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington.The retailer\u2019s previous attempts to enter the New York market, in Queens and then in Brooklyn, ended in stinging defeat. Activists and city leaders turned the proposed stores into a referendum on Walmart\u2019s labor practices.As recently as 2014, nearly half the City Council accused the Walton Family Foundation, which is funded by the company\u2019s founding family, of trying to curry favor with New Yorkers by donating \u201ctoxic money\u201d to local efforts to support charter schools.This time around, many city leaders either declined interview requests or did not return requests for comment on Jet\u2019s growth plans in New York. Some are skeptical, even if they are taking a wait-and-see attitude.\u201cWalmart may think they have found a new, under-the-radar path into New York City by buying up businesses already here, but we should not be fooled,\u201d Comptroller Scott M. Stringer, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cWe intend to be watching very carefully.\u201dMaritza Silva-Farrell, executive director of the labor and community group Align, worked to sink Walmart\u2019s plans to open a store in the East New York section of Brooklyn. She and others argued that Walmart\u2019s low prices would endanger local businesses and that its lower wages would depress pay at other retailers.Ms. Silva-Farrell said she was still concerned about Walmart\u2019s business model. But Amazon, she said, is becoming \u201ca world threat\u201d as the company increasingly dictates the global supply chain and broadens into manufacturing.\u201cAmazon is going to define how the economy is going to work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger problem than Walmart.\u201dSome labor activists see Walmart\u2019s use of Jet to break into the New York market as a sign of victory.\u201cThe fact that Walmart had to acquire another company in order to operate in New York City is a testament to our efforts to keep them out,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.New York is now a testing ground for Walmart\u2019s urban e-commerce strategy, which puts every step of the sale \u2014 from the mobile app to the \u201clast mile\u201d of delivery \u2014 under the company\u2019s control.Walmart is also providing a decent amount of local jobs. Jet employs about 1,300 engineers, executives and other white-collar workers at its Hoboken headquarters and is planning to hire more than 100 workers in its Bronx fulfillment center, a warehouse where customer orders will be prepared and shipped.A spokeswoman said it was too early to comment on the pay at the warehouse since the facility is not yet operational. Parcel employs 150 part-time drivers, all earning $15 an hour, which will soon be the city\u2019s minimum wage.When Walmart acquired Jet, it was not clear how the large retailer would integrate the website into its larger online strategy.Founded by the e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore, Jet was billed as the \u201cAmazon killer\u201d that could win over shoppers with low prices. But Jet seemed redundant with Walmart.com, leading some in the tech world to speculate the real motivation was to acquire Mr. Lore, who now runs Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business nationally.About a year ago, Walmart signaled that it was switching gears and focusing Jet\u2019s efforts on certain cities in the Northeast, where Walmart lacks a huge brick-and-mortar presence.Mr. Belsham, who was hired to run Jet in March, said the redesigned website was meant to be less utilitarian and offer more \u201cinspiration\u201d \u2014 enticing shoppers to order groceries and, say, a pair of Nike sneakers, all in the same online basket.The offerings are upscale, but the prices are not outrageous by New York standards. Pints of Van Leeuwen Earl Grey Tea ice cream for $5.99 and hydroponic Gotham Greens lettuce for $3.49 are less expensive than at some city grocery stores.Online grocery is already a crowded market: FreshDirect, Peapod, Instacart and Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods are offering grocery delivery in New York. But analysts expect Jet will have the advantage of using Walmart\u2019s buying power with vendors to compete on price. Jet is also offering products, like iPhones and designer clothing, that other grocers do not.For same-day scheduled delivery, Jet charges a $5.95 fee. There\u2019s no fee for orders over $35 with no scheduled delivery time.\u201cThis is a surgical strike,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, a managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. \u201cWalmart could be a top-10 retailer in the city within the first year.\u201dNot all analysts are sold on the strategy, which they say is likely to lose Walmart money in the near term as the company ramps up its marketing and hiring.For Jet\u2019s \u201crelaunch\u201d party last week, the company rented out a brownstone near Washington Square Park to showcase its New York offerings. One floor of the apartment featured museumlike displays of what Jet said were actual orders by New Yorkers \u2014 including an arrangement of Sam Edelman high heels, avocados and rolls of toilet paper \u2014 bathed in purple light.\u201cIt feels like a bit of a sideshow,\u201d said Scott Mushkin, a retail industry analyst at Wolfe Research. \u201cWalmart\u2019s strength is in places like Missouri, Arkansas and Mississippi, where their stores are the center of commerce. I don\u2019t know what they bring to the table in Manhattan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Here\u2019s One Emerging Threat That Could Derail the Bull Run", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNothing so far has succeeded in ending the bull run in stocks that began nearly a decade ago.The rally survived the sluggish economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European debt crises, fiscal battles in Washington, the oil bust, concerns about China\u2019s growth and, most recently, President Trump\u2019s trade war.Now the stock market faces a more prosaic but nonetheless powerful threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds.For years, yields on Treasuries were so low that investors had an incentive to buy stocks in the hope of higher returns. Yields are still quite low by historical standards, but they have been rising in recent weeks, and they could go even higher if the Federal Reserve keeps raising its target interest rate. (An increase was announced on Wednesday.)The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen to 3.1 percent, from 2.4 percent at the end of last year, and analysts expect the yield to climb to 3.42 percent by the end of 2019, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. That yield is still far from beating the stock market\u2019s recent annual performances. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 19 percent last year and is up 9 percent this year. But buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process.Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off. One way to make that comparison is to look at the difference between the yield on the 10-year Treasury and the \u201cyield\u201d on the stock market, measured by dividing the historical yearly earnings of the S. & P. 500 companies by the value of the index. When the earnings yield is substantially higher than the 10-year Treasury yield, investors are more likely to favor stocks. The difference has narrowed. It\u2019s now 1.83 percentage points, well below the 2.88-point average of the past three years.If companies\u2019 profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds. But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year. And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more. In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more. Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.There is a major reason this bearish outcome may not occur. Profits could be stronger than analysts are forecasting.But if companies disappoint investors with lackluster profits, the federal government has an investment it is eager to sell them.Advertisement"}

Shops are closing by the thousands. Retailers are going bankrupt.But it may be too early to declare the death of retail. Americans have started shopping more \u2014 in stores.From the garden section at Walmart to the diamond counters at Tiffany & Company, old-school retailers are experiencing some of their best sales growth in years.The strong revenues start with a roaring economy and an optimistic consumer. With more cash in their wallets from the tax cuts, Americans have been spending more.The boom also reflects a broad reordering of the $3.5 trillion industry, with fewer retailers capturing more of the gains. Stores that have learned how to match the ease and instant gratification of e-commerce shopping are flourishing, while those that have failed to evolve are in bankruptcy or on the brink.\u201cThe retailers that get it recognize that Amazon has forever changed consumer behavior,\u201d said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor and former director of the retailing center at the Wharton School. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to work to shop.\u201dMany successful stores are now a cross between a fast-food drive-through and a hotel concierge.Target\u2019s shoppers can order sunscreen or a Tokidoki Unicorno T-shirt on their phone, pull up to the parking lot and have the items brought to their car.Nordstrom lets customers in some stores make returns by dropping their items into a box and walking out \u2014 no human interaction required.Walmart is employing 25,000 \u201cpersonal shoppers\u201d to select and package groceries for curbside pickup.But the pace of closings has slowed, as the most unprofitable stores have been culled and the weakest companies have collapsed. At this time in 2017, nearly 5,700 stores had shut across the United States, according to Coresight Research, a retail analysis and advisory firm. So far this year, about 4,480 have closed.Some big retailers, like J. C. Penney and Sears, are still sputtering, despite closing lagging stores and sprucing up ones that remain open. But the stronger players are capitalizing on the industry\u2019s failures. Target said it was picking up new toy customers in the wake of the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us liquidation this spring.The rebound is feeding the broader economy. Hiring is up, with an average of roughly 50,000 retail jobs being added each month since February, according to the National Retail Federation.\u201cThere has been a shakeout, and 2017 was seen as the bottom,\u201d said Melina Cordero, head of retail research for the Americas at the real estate firm CBRE.Far from retrenching, many retailers are expanding their physical presence or spending billions to overhaul existing stores.Dollar General plans to open 900 stores this year, as it deepens its reach into rural America with inexpensive food and clothing. The company is building a huge following in areas where there are fewer places to shop, particularly in the South and in parts of the Midwest.The newly renovated flagship will probably include expanded retail space as well as hospitality offerings, driven by the success of its in-store \u201cBlue Box\u201d Cafe, which on some days can have a wait list of more than 1,000 people and features a $32 \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany.\u201d Tiffany\u2019s success is built almost entirely on its stores, which account for more than 90 percent of its revenues.\u201cWe have big expectations for this project,\u201d Tiffany\u2019s chief executive, Alessandro Bogliolo, told analysts in a conference call last week. The renovation is expected to reduce the company\u2019s near-term profits, signaling the importance.One of the most ambitious and costly makeover attempts is taking place at Target. The retailer stormed across the American suburbs more than a decade ago, building hundreds of big-box stores known for affordable, hip clothing and furnishings.But many shoppers had grown tired of Target\u2019s cavernous stores, and its cool edge had slipped. Target has lately targeted a new market of young urbanites \u2014 with plans to open about 30 smaller stores in cities and near college campuses this year.Many of the new stores are supposed to be all things to all shoppers \u2014 what the industry calls an \u201comni-channel\u201d experience.Customers can order online and pick up at the store. They can order online and have their purchases delivered home, in some cases, on the same day. Or they can visit the store; employees\u2019 starting salaries were raised in an effort to bolster retention and morale.\u201cOur stores are at the center of our strategy, and they are at the center of our success right now,\u201d Target\u2019s chief executive, Brian Cornell, said in a conference call last month after the retailer reported its largest quarterly sales growth in 13 years.Tiffany Tully, 33, said recent changes to her local Target in Minneapolis had made shopping there more pleasant. The clothing displays, she said, feel more carefully curated and \u201cappealing to the eye.\u201d And she likes the convenience of returning Target items she buys online to the store rather than having to ship them, as with Amazon.\u201cTechnically I am a millennial, but I like going to stores,\u201d said Ms. Tully, a stay-at-home mother.Retailers have been tweaking their store and online strategies for years. But it\u2019s only recently that Amazon\u2019s blistering success has prodded the incumbents to try to reinvent themselves.Ms. Kahn of the Wharton School said retailers could have made these improvements decades ago if they had focused on what shoppers wanted.\u201cMost people want to spend less time shopping, not more,\u201d said Ms. Kahn, whose book \u201cThe Shopping Revolution\u201d describes the disruption in the retail industry.She said Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, had understood this when he pioneered the idea of one-click shopping. But many retailers have built their businesses around the opposite idea, like expansive stores that take hours to wade through and commissions that encourage employees to push certain products.The investments in the new stores and digital offerings are being made at an opportune time, when the strong economy is giving retailers the necessary cash. But any economic weakness could derail their progress before it takes root beyond a few good quarters. Amazon remains the omnipresent cloud, putting pressure on profits and forcing retailers to keep evolving.\u201cThese are big shifts,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a research and consulting firm. \u201cIt is like turning around the Queen Mary. You can turn the rudder, but it takes time to gain a purchase.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was 2013 and it took six months \u2014 and hundreds of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u2014 to land another position as a manager of publications and marketing for the American Civil Liberties Union. A year later, he was laid off again.Fed up, Mr. Grupper decided to try something new: being his own boss.The only drawback? He may never retire \u2014 and he has company.A growing number of New Yorkers are starting businesses in their 50s and 60s, even as their colleagues are easing into retirement. They are crafting specialty foods like toffee \u2014 Oprah Winfrey is a fan \u2014 vegetarian dog treats and organic tempeh, a meat alternative traditionally made from soy beans.One former executive at Lehman Brothers, who lost a chunk of her retirement savings when the firm collapsed, has since parlayed her corporate skills and experience into a recruiting service for financial and real estate companies. A speech therapist whose job was eliminated decided to help immigrants communicate better.These \u201cencore entrepreneurs\u201d are increasingly finding their niche: Their numbers are growing more than twice as fast as the population of New Yorkers over 50. Now a new report by the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit research and policy organization, has documented the trend using an analysis of census and labor data and dozens of interviews with organizations that work with entrepreneurs.The number of self-employed New Yorkers who were at least 50 rose to 209,972 in 2016, up 63.7 percent from 128,282 in 2000. By comparison, the number of city residents overall who were at least 50 rose just 28.5 percent to 2.67 million from 2.08 million during that same period.These older New York entrepreneurs are also part of a national trend, driven partly by the financial crisis a decade ago. Still, their numbers have grown even as the economy has rebounded. In August, the national unemployment rate was 3.9 percent overall, and 3.1 percent for those 55 years and over, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.For many, it means no more answering to bosses half their age, or making do with part-time jobs bagging groceries to get by in their golden years.Since 2016, the AARP Foundation has partnered with local business development and social service groups on a program for older entrepreneurs, called Work for Yourself @50+, in more than two dozen major cities.Older entrepreneurs comprise an overlooked demographic group and require more resources and support services, said Jonathan Bowles, the executive director of the Center for an Urban Future. New York City, he said, should create an incubator for older entrepreneurs and tailor start-up competitions that provide them seed money. While many older people have ideas, he said, they often lack the confidence and resources to follow through.\u201cThis is such a great opportunity to bolster the city\u2019s economy and help more New Yorkers become financially secure later in life,\u201d Mr. Bowles said. \u201cGiven the demographics, New York could see an even more powerful boost from older entrepreneurs in the next decade.\u201dManhattan has the highest concentration of entrepreneurs 50 and over \u2014 72,996. Next is Queens (58,597); Brooklyn (45,961); the Bronx (22,094); and Staten Island, (10,324), according to the report.Julianne Cho, a spokeswoman for the Department of Small Business Services, said that they already provide a wide range of resources to help entrepreneurs of all ages, including holding free classes and programs and connecting them to a network of lenders that provide tens of millions of dollars in low-interest loans.Many entrepreneurs 50 and older said they have no choice but to look for new and creative ways to supplement their income and savings as they live longer. They describe feeling squeezed by rising rents and health care costs, and are facing uncertain job prospects and age discrimination, especially in industries where younger workers are less expensive and are often more fluent in digital and social media skills.\u201cWhat we bring to the table is experience, wisdom and an incredible network \u2014 and those three things really ensure success in a start-up company that younger people don\u2019t have,\u201d said Ms. Gray, now 69.For Gordon Bennett, 66, it was time for a career change as job opportunities dwindled after three decades of working as a creative director in the high-pressure advertising industry. In 2011, he decided to take a chance and spent $40,000 of his savings to go into business with Barry Schwartz, a former chef at a yoga retreat who had a recipe for tempeh. \u201cWhen we started off, we had no idea what we were doing,\u201d Mr. Bennett recalled.\u201cThis is something I wanted to do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just didn\u2019t see myself as a retired person.\u201dAdvertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Chinese are catching up to the U.S. in many ways, and the president grasps only part of the reason.Opinion ColumnistEarly in the movie \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d a Chinese-Singaporean father admonishes his young kids to finish their dinner, saying, \u201cThink of all the starving children in America.\u201d I\u2019m sure that everyone of my generation in the theater laughed at that joke. After all, we\u2019d all been raised on the line: \u201cFinish your dinner. Think of all the starving children in China.\u201dThat little line contained within it many messages: The first, which any regular traveler to China\u2019s biggest urban areas can tell you, is that rich China today \u2014 its luxury homes, cars, restaurants and hotels \u2014 is really rich, rich like most Americans can\u2019t imagine.The second is that this moment was destined to be a test of who will set the key rules of the global order in the 21st century: the world\u2019s long-dominant economic and military superpower, America, or its rising rival, China. And this test is playing out with a blossoming full-scale trade war.What does such a test of wills sound like? It sounds like a senior Chinese official telling me at a seminar at Tsinghua University in April that it\u2019s just \u201ctoo late\u201d for America to tell China what to do anymore on issues like trade, because China is now too big and powerful. And it sounds like President Trump, in effect, telling China: \u201cSays who? Show me what you got, baby!\u201d Or as Trump actually tweeted last week: \u201cWe are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. \u2026 If we meet, we meet.\u201dI guess we should be grateful that this confrontation has been confined to trade, but, as I said, it was inevitable. Because, as one top tech executive pointed out to me: \u201cChina is not a \u2018near peer\u2019 anymore. It is a peer.\u201dAs Mary Meeker\u2019s latest internet trends study noted, five years ago China had only two of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded tech companies, while the U.S. had nine. Today, China has nine of the top 20 \u2014 Alibaba, Tencent, Ant Financial, Baidu, Xiaomi, Didi, JD.com, Meituan and Toutiao \u2014 and the U.S. has 11. Twenty years ago, China had none.Do you see a trend? Do you hear footsteps? The total value of China\u2019s internet economy is already bigger than America\u2019s. And China\u2019s economy now is so cashless that many women no longer carry purses or men wallets \u2014 just a cellphone with mobile apps \u2014 to buy anything, or even donate to a beggar.And don\u2019t get me started on the biggest emerging work and services tool in the world \u2014 artificial intelligence. China\u2019s plan is to catch up to America in A.I. and surpass it as soon as possible, and it\u2019s well on its way. Because with A.I., the more training data you can feed the machine the faster it learns, the more patterns you can see and the more algorithms you can write to improve products and services or invent new ones. Because China has so many more people than we do, and so many more of them use mobile apps for their daily lives, China\u2019s ability to amass giant data sets and train more machines faster is considerable.\u201cIf data is the new oil, then China is the new Saudi Arabia,\u201d remarked Kai-Fu Lee, author of \u201cAI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.\u201dChinese companies are already the world leaders in computer vision/facial recognition and speech recognition, which can be used for commerce and for surveillance and societal control. In just the last two years there has been an explosion of fintech start-ups in China, offering mobile payments, lending, brokerage and banking. And the No. 1 and 3 drone manufacturers in the world \u2014 DJI and Xiaomi \u2014 are Chinese. France\u2019s Parrot is No. 2. At the same time, China is producing far more engineers and scientists than the U.S., and their quality is steadily rising.America today, by contrast, has become the unrivaled world leader in generating data about Donald Trump and from Donald Trump.In the daily barrage of Trump news and tweets, some Trump statements are actually true, though \u2014 like the need for the U.S. to confront China\u2019s unfair trade practices. China has grown incredibly these past 30 years with a very specific formula: hard work, unleashing capitalism, smart planning and long-range investments in education and infrastructure \u2014 but also by stealing intellectual property, forcing technology transfers and cheating on World Trade Organization rules.We have to respond. But wisely.Historically the U.S. could dominate the global scene and check a rising power like China, and set the global rules, with just our sheer physical mass \u2014 more money, more troops, more naval ships, more top-10 companies, more scientists and more universities. That is just not possible any longer, as China has become both big and smart in more and more areas. But all is not lost.It happens that we have three huge assets that China doesn\u2019t have, and is unlikely to acquire them anytime soon. We should be doubling down on our strengths: immigration, allies and values. Instead, Trump is squandering them.Also, we have real allies in a way China does not. China has clients, customers and frightened neighbors. It does not have real partners like Canada and Mexico. It doesn\u2019t have the whole Atlantic alliance with the European Union or tight relations with Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Australia \u2014 which we can leverage if we aren\u2019t doing stupid stuff, like slapping them with steel tariffs or tearing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Our nation has never been just a beacon for profit-making, which only measured countries by their trade balance with us. Our values attracted people to our shores and helped us spread our rules onto the wider world. When Trump tore up the TPP trade deal I\u2019m certain that he actually disappointed China\u2019s economic reformers, who wanted to use the pact to create pressures inside China to reform.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sick River: Can These California Tribes Beat Heroin and History?", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "As salmon runs decline and opioid addiction grips the region, the Yurok, Karuk and Hoopa tribes see a connection between the river\u2019s struggles and their own.Supported byWEITCHPEC, Calif. \u2014 For thousands of years, the Klamath River has been a source of nourishment for the Northern California tribes that live on its banks. Its fish fed dozens of Indian villages along its winding path, and its waters cleansed their spirits, as promised in their creation stories.But now a crisis of opioid addiction is gripping this remote region. At the same time, the Klamath\u2019s once-abundant salmon runs have declined to historic lows, the culmination of 100 years of development and dam building along the river.Today, many members of the Yurok, Karuk and Hoopa tribes living in this densely forested area south of the California-Oregon border see a connection between the river\u2019s struggle and their own.\u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence to me that this opioid problem and the river crisis are happening at the same time; when that resource is gone, it leads to a sense of despair,\u201d said Amy Cordalis, the Yurok tribe\u2019s general counsel.Conflict along the Klamath has been a part of life going back to the Gold Rush, say those living on the reservation. Battles over land rights and federal funding, high rates of violence, an epidemic of meth in the 2000s and drought have all contributed to the tribes\u2019 difficulties. Some strife has been caused from outsiders; some has come from within.Now heroin is fraying family bonds like never before, they say, a devastating response to crisis.\u201cThe river is the lifeblood of our community,\u201d Ms. Cordalis added, describing the Klamath\u2019s central role in traditional prayers, dances and rituals. \u201cWith the Yurok people, who we are and how we live always comes back to the river.\u201dSalmon runs reached historic lows last year, destabilizing an already fragile subsistence economy for thousands living along the river. Without salmon in this region, where unemployment can reach 80 percent in some areas, families risk hunger and destitution.At the same time, a surge of heroin has intensified problems with opioid addiction that first began with painkillers like OxyContin in the early 2000s and began to worsen in 2014, according to tribal members. Among the Yurok, the Karuk and the Hoopa Indians, it is difficult to find anyone who has not been directly touched by heroin.Nationally, Native Americans are the hardest-hit demographic in an overdose death epidemic that has affected every corner of the country. Between 1999 and 2015, there was a 519 percent increase in the number of overdose deaths among rural Native Americans, according to a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, compared to an increase of 325 percent in rural areas overall. Abuse of painkillers and heroin have played significantly into those trends.Ultimately, 90 percent of the money was disbursed to members in a lump sum. Some questioned the wisdom of that decision by the tribal leadership, suggesting the money would be quickly spent, rather than saved.Since then, the river\u2019s intensifying troubles have caused spiritual pain, in addition to exacerbating economic anguish.\u201cIn part, there\u2019s a tremendous feeling of guilt, I think. The economics of it matter, yes, but it\u2019s so much more than that for us,\u201d said Yurok Chief Justice Abby Abinanti. \u201cOur worldview is that we\u2019re here in partnership with these other beings, the river and the fish. We have obligations to them.\u201d\u201cNow it feels like the river is as sick as it has ever been. I think last year was the first time in history that the Yurok people did not fish on the Klamath,\u201d Ms. Cordalis said. \u201cWhen you start separating those ties, it really affects people.\u201dThe effects of heroin \u2014 and meth before it \u2014 have seeped into every aspect of life. Outside the Yurok tribe\u2019s bureau, a mural created by the Yurok children shows the river flowing through lush forests and curving past villagers performing traditional prayer-dances. In one panel, a Native American woman wanders the forest collecting wood and acorns, while kayakers splash in the river\u2019s waters.But unwinding across the painting are darker scenes too: broken bottles, needles, depictions of suicides, and dead fish.Thomas Willson, 55, a former Yurok tribal council member who grew up on Hoopa land along the Trinity River, said that a long history of alcohol and drug abuse in the region deeply affected his own life. Many, he said, turned to selling drugs to support their addictions.While alcohol and methamphetamine were plagues for him and his generation, now \u201ceveryone is leaning off of that and going toward heroin.\u201d He has lost several family members to opioid overdoses, he said, including his sister-in-law and a cousin, and several friends.Mr. Willson, who is Christian, sees a direct connection between his faith and the Yurok spiritual values. \u201cWe have to take care of our hills and our river. That\u2019s what God put us on this earth for, to be land managers,\u201d he said.Environmental degradation of the area\u2019s delicate ecology has coincided with the heroin surge, exacerbating the problems for the region.Four out-of-date dams upstream, built in the early- to mid-20th century, have sparked residual ecological strain downstream. Now the solution that tribal members hoped for \u2014 their removal \u2014 awaits approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.Before the dams went up, the river was the third-largest producer of salmon in the United States. Last year, the Yurok tribe had to cancel commercial and subsistence fishing altogether because of the lack of fish. During some parts of the year, the waters become so toxic that people are advised not to swim or make contact with the river.The tribes, environmentalists and others hope the dams can be removed to address the ecological and cultural crises at once.\u201cThe reservoirs behind the dams have been breeding grounds for very toxic blue-green algae, and that has really sickened people,\u201d said Stephen Most, a regional historian.The dams came up for relicensing in 2006 and, because of new environmental standards, would need to be retrofitted with fish ladders to allow salmon and other fish to pass through. But that would not be in the financial interest of PacifiCorp, which operates the dams, according to a spokesman for the company, and so it has agreed to discontinue operation.In October 2016, then-Interior Secretary Sally Jewell urged the removal of the four lower-river dams operated by PacifiCorp, which are used to produce electricity. Citing dozens of scientific studies, she said the removal would reopen hundreds of miles of spawning area for salmon and quickly restore the water\u2019s quality.\u201cWhile these dams brought prosperity to many, their construction came at a steep cost to tribes and fishing communities,\u201d Ms. Jewell wrote in the official recommendation.In a statement, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it did not have a timeline for deciding on the dam removal project.As they wait anxiously for the dam removal to be approved, tribal leaders are also looking for inclusive ways to bring drug treatment to the region, where abuse is often stigmatized. One solution proposed by Ms. Abinanti and others are Yurok \u201cwellness villages,\u201d planned living sites along the river where the tribe can help reintegrate people who have struggled with addiction. Those programs would be fundamentally centered on the tribe\u2019s traditional practices. They are in the process of looking for funding.Peggy O\u2019Neill, the planning director for the Yurok tribe, said the sizable homeless population in the town of Eureka, Calif., includes many Native Americans who have been turned away from their families. In Humboldt County, a government homeless count in 2015 found that nearly one in five transient people were Native American, a disproportionate number.\u201cYou didn\u2019t used to see homeless Indians. Someone would take you. That\u2019s not happening anymore because people can\u2019t deal with it,\u201d Ms. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to deal with a family member that is addicted to drugs.\u201dNow, she said, throughout the reservation, many grandparents are raising their grandchildren. In remote towns upstream, she said, many rural homeless are sleeping in cars or outside.\u201cYou feel like it\u2019s a war zone,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are trying to kick doors in, break into your car, they\u2019re just desperate. And how many times can you steal from someone who doesn\u2019t have anything?\u201dMs. Cordalis, the general counsel to the Yurok tribe, has been using the law to protect the Yurok way of life for its roughly 6,000 members. In March, the Yurok joined other communities nationally and filed a lawsuit against several opioid companies with the Northern California Federal District Court. The suit claims that opioid addiction has increased crime, led to economic losses and increased hospital and administrative costs.In May, the tribal council passed an emergency declaration and vowed to create a plan to address the sharp rise in opioid abuse on the reservation.While the tribe figures out how to fund the wellness villages, there are few other treatment options. There is also some skepticism among tribe members about medication-assisted treatment options, like methadone and buprenorphine, which are the gold standard in treating opioid-abuse disorder, according to Dr. Katie Cassle, a family medicine physician with the United Indian Health Service.\u201cThere\u2019s still some conflicting feeling about Suboxone as a treatment, because it\u2019s not an abstinence-based treatment per se,\u201d said Dr. Cassle. Nonetheless, she started a buprenorphine program last year and now has eight patients.For many, the idea of culturally relevant addiction treatment brings hope. Codie Donahue, 38, lost his children and wound up homeless after he and his girlfriend became addicted to methamphetamine and heroin. Mr. Donahue, who has Yurok and Karuk lineage, recently checked into a drug rehab program in Eureka, a few hours from his hometown, Orleans, Calif.He recalled the holy ceremony he once performed as a high priest for the Karuk Indians. In the ritual, he and others would pray in hopes that the river would wash away the sins of his tribe.\u201cEach morning, you go up to the altar in the mountains, and at the end of the ceremony, we go down to the river and it washes all the bad down to the deepest parts of the ocean,\u201d Mr. Donahue said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a new day, a new time. You\u2019re forgiven, and then you do better.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Came of Age During the 2008 Financial Crisis. I\u2019m Still Angry About It.", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe generation that graduated into the recession is not to blame.Mr. Miller is an editor at The New York Times. I grew up in a suburb of Detroit, in a house near a dead end, which my parents bought in 1992. They paid for it with a conventional mortgage that they had the misfortune of refinancing in January 2008. A series of disasters followed, all of which would have been previously unthinkable. Within a matter of months, investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed from having taken on too much risk, predominantly in the housing market, and by the fall of that year both of my parents had lost their jobs. In the brief interim between their refinancing and the global economic meltdown, the value of the house plummeted, so my parents owed more on their mortgage than what the property was worth.At this time, I was a senior at New York University, one of the country\u2019s most expensive private institutions and one of the reasons my parents, who, like so much of the middle class, had no real asset of value aside from their house, decided to refinance the mortgage in the first place. My parents and I always imagined we\u2019d find a way to pay for my college, through some clever combination of savings and scholarships \u2014 and, if all else failed, through one of the easily available high-interest student loans offered by major banks. All of this seemed practical enough, or at the very least as if it could be worried about later: My parents \u2014 again, like so much of the middle class \u2014 believed that any variety of worst-case scenarios didn\u2019t happen to people like them.By March 2009, about two months before my graduation, I returned to my childhood home for spring break, aware that, short of an unexpected miracle, my parents would soon have nowhere to live. The \u201cfor sale\u201d signs sticking in the front lawns of the neighbors\u2019 empty houses led me straight to the street\u2019s dead end.I return to this scene often, even 10 years later. The financial crisis remains the defining trauma of my generation, many members of which, like me, had just graduated from college or were preparing to in 2008. In the years since, the suffering from the financial crisis has become the connective tissue of a demographic routinely denounced as lazy and spoiled.And so housing reports, sociological studies and the news media have blamed grim statistics, like the shrunken class of American homeowners, on an \u201centitled\u201d millennial lifestyle, in the process producing some of the most laughable pseudoscience in recent history. Many people have and will continue to condemn me personally for my tremendous but unexceptional student debt, and the ways in which it has made the recession\u2019s effects linger for my family. I\u2019ve spent quite a lot of time in the past decade accepting this blame. The recession may have compounded my family\u2019s economic insecurity, but I also made the conscious decision to take out loans for a college I couldn\u2019t afford in order to become a journalist, a profession with minimal financial returns. The amount of debt I owe in student loans \u2014 about $100,000 \u2014 is more than I make in a given year. I am ashamed and embarrassed by this, but as I grow older, I think it is time that those profiting from this country\u2019s broken economic system share some of my guilt. It\u2019s an awfully nice thought, but I wonder where this realization was 10 years ago, when it would have meant something. Being forced to witness this halfhearted apology tour among high-ranking officials is another prominent feature of having grown up during the crisis, one that brings me back to a different scene from 2009, which I tend to revisit a great deal.

{"Headline": "With Climate Change No Longer in the Future, Adaptation Speeds Up", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn New York, designs are underway for a $203 million flip-up wall to protect Lower Manhattan from intensifying storm surges.In China, companies building coal-fired power plants amid more frequent periods of drought are shifting to a more expensive technology that cools the plants\u2019 equipment with less water.In Bangladesh, rice farmers facing rising seawater are changing what they grow, some to more salt-tolerant varieties of the crop and others away from rice altogether, to shrimp.All these shifts, experts familiar with them say, are in response to climate change.Not long ago, climate change was seen as a threat for the future. Increasingly, it\u2019s a reality of the present, a new normal spurring billions of dollars in annual spending as governments, companies and citizens scramble to adapt.Intensifying storms, like Hurricane Florence, which walloped the Carolinas this month; worsening drought, which fueled the fires that have swept through California this year; and rising seas that have put coastal cities on edge around the globe are all linked at least in part, scientists say, to a human-induced rise in global temperatures, and they are prompting all manner of defensive measures.The United Nations estimates that adapting to climate change could cost $500 billion yearly by 2050 \u2014 a price tag that would be borne by everyone, including governments, the private sector and citizens. But whether even that sum would succeed in shoring up people and infrastructure is anyone\u2019s guess. The shift in focus from trying just to prevent climate change to trying to live with it is forcing some sobering trade-offs, and they are likely, experts say, to get more painful.For decades, a philosophical debate has raged about how to respond to climate change. One side \u2014 essentially the climate purists \u2014 has argued for a strategy known as mitigation: remaking energy, agriculture and other sectors to curb carbon emissions and prevent temperatures from rising. The other side \u2014 the climate pragmatists \u2014 has called for adaptation: accepting that climate change is happening and taking steps to adjust.Initially, many environmental activists rejected adaptation as a sellout, a \u201ckind of laziness, an arrogant faith in our ability to react in time to save our skins,\u201d as Al Gore, then Bill Clinton\u2019s running mate, put it in his 1992 book, \u201cEarth in the Balance,\u201d a call to slash emissions. But emissions have continued to rise. In 2017, energy-related carbon output hit an all-time high, the International Energy Agency says. So climate hawks have come to view adaptation as crucial.The work is going slowly. In 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries both mitigate and adapt to climate change.No comprehensive accounting exists of how much is being spent on adaptation, United Nations officials say. What\u2019s clear is that the sums, distributed across a variety of pools, are relatively small.Another example is financing by six large multilateral development banks for adaptation efforts in emerging and developing countries, which totaled $7.4 billion in 2017, according to the World Bank. The Bangkok talks failed to achieve agreement on more adaptation money; diplomats are expected take up the issue again in December, at a climate conference in Katowice, Poland.Lack of money isn\u2019t the only problem in adapting to climate change. So are the unintended consequences. Some moves to adapt to climate change actually are worsening carbon emissions.One example is the use of air-conditioning which, particularly in developing countries, is soaring, both because of rising heat and humidity linked to climate change and because of economic growth, said Caroline Lee, an analyst at the International Energy Agency who focuses on adaptation.Here is a look at how three places are experiencing climate change and trying to adapt.The city of 64,000 residents has, for about a decade, been studying its vulnerability to climate change and planning how to adapt. It uses wildfire maps, and models that project sea-level rise through 2030, 2050 and 2100, to map areas by their vulnerability to climate change. Then the city overlays demographic data onto those maps, including residents\u2019 age and income, which allows it to identify particularly vulnerable neighborhoods.That\u2019s raising an uncomfortable question: Should the city pay to fortify the cliff below the road, protecting it and those houses but potentially intensifying erosion of nearby beaches? Or should it, in planning parlance, \u201crecede\u201d \u2014 essentially abandoning the cliff to Mother Nature? If the city chooses to keep shoring it up the cliff, it will face yet another quandary, noted Tiffany Wise-West, the city\u2019s sustainability and climate action manager: \u201c\u2018Who pays?\u2019 is a big question. Do we all pay as taxpayers? Do we require private residents to pay?\u201dBangladesh, a low-lying country of about 167 million people on India\u2019s eastern flank, borders the Bay of Bengal and is crisscrossed by rivers including the storied Ganges and the Brahmaputra. The bay and rivers long have defined Bangladesh\u2019s economy; now, so is a changing climate.Over the past decade, Bangladesh has spent about $500 million in government money on planning and projects to adapt to climate change, said Saleemul Huq, director of the country\u2019s International Center for Climate Change and Development and one of the authors of Bangladesh\u2019s response plan.Along the coast, rice farmers are shifting to new varieties of the crop bred with the help of government money to grow in saltier water. But that is only a temporary fix, because eventually the salinity of the water will exceed the tolerance of the specially engineered rice. \u201cWe\u2019re always playing catch-up,\u201d Mr. Huq said. \u201cWhen we can\u2019t grow rice anymore, we switch to raising shrimp.\u201d Yet even shrimp isn\u2019t a panacea. It\u2019s lucrative for those who farm it, but, unlike rice, it\u2019s not a dietary staple.Mr. Huq compares climate adaptation in Bangladesh to an effort to fend off an invasion by space aliens. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the initial scout ships of the alien invasion have landed on earth, and one of them has landed in Bangladesh,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mother ship\u2019s on its way. When it comes, it\u2019s going to land in New York, London, Paris\u201d and other major global cities.\u201cYou guys are not ready for it yet. But you\u2019re going to have to learn from us how to deal with it. Because we are learning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Magaqa reached for the gun under his seat \u2014 too late. One of his passengers saw flashes of light, dozens of them, from the spray of bullets pockmarking the doors.The ambush was exactly what Mr. Magaqa had feared.

Struck half a dozen times, he hung on for weeks in a hospital before dying last year.All of the assassination targets had one thing in common: They were members of the African National Congress who had spoken out against corruption in the party that defined their lives.\u201cIf you understand the Cosa Nostra, you don\u2019t only kill the person, but you also send a strong message,\u201d said Thabiso Zulu, another A.N.C. whistle-blower who, fearing for his life, is now in hiding.\u201cWe broke the rule of omert\u00e0,\u201d he added, saying that the party of Nelson Mandela had become like the Mafia.Political assassinations are rising sharply in South Africa, threatening the stability of hard-hit parts of the country and imperiling Mr. Mandela\u2019s dream of a unified, democratic nation.But unlike much of the political violence that upended the country in the 1990s, the recent killings are not being driven by vicious battles between rival political parties.Quite the opposite: In most cases, A.N.C. officials are killing one another, hiring professional hit men to eliminate fellow party members in an all-or-nothing fight over money, turf and power, A.N.C. officials say.The party once inspired generations of South Africans and captured the imagination of millions around the world \u2014 from impoverished corners of Africa to wealthy American campuses.The murders have swelled into such a national crisis that the police began releasing data on political killings for the first time this year, while the new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has lamented that the assassinations are tarnishing Mr. Mandela\u2019s dream.But Mr. Ramaphosa is struggling to unite his fractious party before elections next year and has done little to stem the violence. His administration has even resisted official demands to provide police protection for two A.N.C. whistle-blowers in the case surrounding Mr. Magaqa\u2019s murder, baffling some anticorruption officials.The recent assassinations cover a wide range of personal and political feuds. Some victims were A.N.C. officials who became targets after exposing or denouncing corruption within the party. Others fell in internal battles for lucrative posts. In rural areas \u2014 where the party has a near-total grip on the economy, jobs and government contracts \u2014 the conflict is particularly intense, with officials constantly looking over their shoulders.Mr. Magaqa\u2019s province, KwaZulu-Natal, is the deadliest of all. Here, 80 A.N.C. officials were killed between 2011 and 2017, the party says. Even relatively low-level ward councilors have bodyguards, and many politicians carry guns themselves.\u201cIt was better before we attained democracy, because we knew the enemy \u2014 that the enemy was the regime, the unjust regime,\u201d said Mluleki Ndobe, the mayor of the district where Mr. Magaqa and five other A.N.C. politicians have been assassinated in the past year.\u201cNow, you don\u2019t know who is the enemy,\u201d he said.More than any other, the death of Mr. Magaqa, the most prominent politician assassinated so far, has focused attention on the deadly scramble within the party that helped bring democracy to South Africa.A rising star in the A.N.C. who had become a national figure, Mr. Magaqa returned to local politics in his hometown, Umzimkhulu. After accusing party officials of pocketing millions in the failed refurbishment of a historic building, Mr. Magaqa and two of his allies were killed in rapid succession.But few other political figures have been arrested in such killings, adding to a widening sense of lawlessness.\u201cThe politicians have become like a political mafia,\u201d said Mary de Haas, an expert on political killings who taught at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. \u201cIt is the very antithesis of democracy, because people fear to speak out.\u201dFor good reason. After Mr. Magaqa\u2019s death, Mr. Zulu, the whistle-blower now in hiding, loudly condemned corruption in Umzimkhulu. The impoverished municipal government spent a large chunk of its budget to refurbish a historic building called the Memorial Hall. But after five years and more than $2 million in public money, the project was a sinkhole of dubious spending, with little to show for it.For breaking the code of silence, Mr. Zulu and another party official are now in grave danger, according to a 47-page report released in August by the Office of the Public Protector, a government authority that investigates corruption. The two whistle-blowers, the report said, fear that \u201cthey may be assassinated at any time.\u201dThe Public Protector\u2019s office urged the national police to provide security for the whistle-blowers and reprimanded Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s police minister for being \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d in failing to do so. But the police minister rejected the report and moved to challenge it in court.The Public Protector had a message for Mr. Ramaphosa as well: The president should \u201ctake urgent and appropriate steps\u201d to protect the whistle-blowers. But Mr. Ramaphosa has not responded. Khusela Diko, his spokeswoman, said the president is consulting his police minister.For decades before the end of apartheid, different factions under the A.N.C.\u2019s umbrella \u2014 communists, free marketeers, trade unionists, agents in exile \u2014 competed with one another, sometimes violently, as they fought white rule.But the recent increase in killings inside the A.N.C. is a potent reminder of how far the party has strayed from creating, in the ashes of apartheid, a political order based on the rule of law.The Public Protector\u2019s investigation into the Memorial Hall has frozen the renovation. Umzimkhulu\u2019s mayor, Mphuthumi Mpabanga, called the project a \u201cdream\u201d that would change \u201cthe lives of the people.\u201dBut it has little resonance for many in Umzimkhulu, a vast municipality with pockets of extreme poverty. Margaret Phungula, 60, carries buckets to a muddy stream six times a day for water, adding spoonfuls of chlorine. Shown a photo of the Memorial Hall, she stared blankly.\u201cThey\u2019re not thinking of us,\u201d she said of the town\u2019s leaders. \u201cWe\u2019re still suffering.\u201dIn the arc of the A.N.C., Mr. Magaqa and his friends belong to the generation that includes Mr. Mandela\u2019s grandchildren. Too young to have been politically active during white rule, they came of age in a new country \u2014 one forged by the party.Their political lives, mirroring the A.N.C.\u2019s post-apartheid trajectory, began with youthful idealism, followed by lost innocence and, ultimately, fratricidal violence.Mr. Zulu, 36, the whistle-blower, always wanted to be an A.N.C. man. His grandmother took part in the A.N.C.-led potato boycott against apartheid in the 1950s, and he felt part of that legacy.In his late teens, he fell in with a group of politically minded young men like himself. One of them stood out immediately: Mr. Magaqa, a skinny, stubborn teenager with a bright smile. The youngest in the group, he quickly became its leader.Mr. Magaqa made a name for himself by leading a strike during high school. When students contributed money for a trip to Cape Town, the principal told them it had been put to other uses. Mr. Magaqa shut down the school for weeks.The early 2000s were a hopeful time for the young men. Their elders in the A.N.C. had gained political freedom for black South Africans, so the young men turned their attention to breaking into an economy still dominated by the white minority.Les Stuta \u2014 the second A.N.C. whistle-blower whose life is in danger, according to the Public Protector \u2014 was in the group as well. He recounted how they pledged to earn money to help their mothers, who worked as live-in maids for white families far away.\u201cGuys,\u201d Mr. Stuta recalled saying often, \u201cthey must come back home.\u201dThe young men traveled together across the vast stretches of the rural district to open youth league branches of the A.N.C., borrowing cars or hitchhiking.Finally, in 2004, Mr. Stuta got a car \u2014 a beat-up white Ford Escort with a sputtering 1.3-liter engine. The young men stocked it with oil and water to deal with frequent breakdowns along the dirt and gravel roads to remote villages. When Mr. Stuta could not afford to replace the starter for six months, party meetings ended with the young men pushing the car back to life.\u201cThat Ford Escort,\u201d Mr. Stuta said, \u201cwas everything to us.\u201dBy 2006, Mr. Magaqa and his circle got well-paid government jobs in Umzimkhulu. He got a car of his own, with a vanity plate: \u201cGogwana,\u201d the grandmother who had raised him while his mother worked in Johannesburg.When the A.N.C.\u2019s youth league was established in Umzimkhulu, Mr. Magaqa became the chairman, beginning his rapid rise within the league \u2014 traditionally a springboard to leadership in the A.N.C. itself.But something nagged Mr. Zulu. Within a few years, the overriding pursuit of positions and money consumed his peers. Suddenly, some were taking kickbacks, drinking rare whiskeys and prodding Mr. Zulu to drop his high-mindedness. Flipping Jesus\u2019s teaching, they often asked him: Who can live on principle alone?Soon, Mr. Zulu lost his government job and devoted himself to fighting corruption. But life was very different for his friend. At 27, Mr. Magaqa left the province for the national stage in Johannesburg. He became the A.N.C. youth league\u2019s national secretary general, the No. 3 position, in 2011.As soon as he was appointed, he went to a car dealership in a wealthy Johannesburg suburb where he bought an icon of South Africa\u2019s moneyed class: a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle, the ML 500 4Matic.Mr. Magaqa raved about it to his friends back home \u2014 its V8 engine, the thunderous noise from the twin exhaust pipes.\u201cHe felt like he\u2019s got money,\u201d recalled Phumlani Phumlomo, a childhood friend.How much money Mr. Magaqa made in Johannesburg \u2014 and how \u2014 were questions Mr. Zulu preferred not to ask.\u201cI don\u2019t know how he acquired his money,\u201d Mr. Zulu said. \u201cRemember, he had access to everyone and anyone who\u2019s big in the country.\u201dIt only lasted a few months. Mr. Magaqa fell in one of the countless shake-ups within the A.N.C. and lost his position. He drove his Mercedes straight back to Umzimkhulu and put most of his money into a minor league soccer team, the Blue Birds. He recruited the best players, lodging them in a big house with cable and PlayStations. When his team won on the road \u2014 and it won a lot \u2014 he put up the players and coach in a hotel.\u201cBut then his cash ran out,\u201d said the coach, Mduduzi Ngubane.With his money gone, Mr. Magaqa went back to what he knew best: politics.Jacob Zuma, the party\u2019s scandal-plagued leader, was president of the nation, and more than ever, local A.N.C. politicians began killing one another over positions, contracts and jobs.In 2016, when Mr. Magaqa returned to politics, 31 politicians were assassinated, double the number from the year before, according to the tally by researchers. Of that total, 24 were killed in his province.With the backing of regional A.N.C. power brokers, Mr. Magaqa became a councilor in Umzimkhulu and a member of its decision-making body, effectively becoming the leader of an insurgent A.N.C. faction.The sudden return of a political star, someone who could still call on powerful figures in Johannesburg, was seen as an immediate threat to his party rivals in Umzimkhulu.\u201cHe was too ambitious,\u201d said the municipal manager, Zweliphansi Skhosana. \u201cThat was the problem that he had.\u201dMr. Skhosana, a former high school teacher, knew Mr. Magaqa all too well. He had taught the young man from 10th grade through 12th grade. The two stood on opposing sides during the strike over money for the Cape Town trip.Now they were facing off again. Regarded as the real power behind Umzimkhulu\u2019s dominant A.N.C. faction, Mr. Skhosana still lived next to the old high school, in the area\u2019s largest house, surrounded by a concrete wall and electrified barbed wire.Right after joining the council, Mr. Magaqa zeroed in on the troubled renovation of the Memorial Hall. Little had been done to it, and the construction of a new annex was proving to be a disaster.A few councilors had already raised concerns, calling it a classic public works boondoggle designed to siphon money into the pockets of politicians and their allies. Jabulile Msiya, a councilor whose ward included the hall, said she had been excluded from meetings on the project after asking too many questions.Experts unconnected to Umzimkhulu\u2019s politics, like Robert Brusse, an architect specializing in heritage buildings, agreed something was wrong.A few weeks after being hired as a consultant for the project in 2016, Mr. Brusse went to see the Memorial Hall for himself.\u201cAs I walked onto the site, I said, \u2018There\u2019s a rat here. This stinks,\u201d\u2019 he recalled.The new building behind the Memorial Hall was \u201cprofessionally incompetent\u201d and a \u201ccomplete waste of money for what is being produced,\u201d he said.Mr. Magaqa and his council allies demanded an independent audit \u2014 a motion quashed by the A.N.C.\u2019s dominant faction in the municipality.Mr. Skhosana, the municipal manager, dismissed any possibility of corruption. Mr. Magaqa, he said, was simply trying to stir up trouble to gain control over the local government.He waved away accusations by councilors that the contractor had been chosen because of personal connections to a local official. The contractor simply had a \u201ccash flow\u201d problem, he said.But the contractor, Loyiso Magqaza, contradicted him in a telephone interview, denying any cash flow issues. \u201cThey can never\u201d blame me for the project\u2019s failure, he said.Mr. Magaqa, stuck in a deadlock with his former teacher, turned to someone his allies said he trusted fully: his old friend, Mr. Zulu.Mr. Zulu had become a known corruption fighter in the province, gathering evidence and sharing it with officials he trusted. So Mr. Magaqa gave him what he described as official documents about the Memorial Hall.The documents, which were reviewed by The New York Times, showed that after the contractor won the renovation contract in 2013, worth $1.2 million, the municipality paid the company and its subcontractor nearly two-thirds of the money, even though the project was far behind schedule.Two years later, after the company and its subcontractor failed to finish, the municipality hired a different contractor for another $1 million.In all, the documents do not unequivocally prove corruption on their own, but they show the municipality spent nearly all of the money it had budgeted for the hall \u2014 and ended up with little to show for it.Mr. Zulu said he had grabbed the files and promised to pursue the case with his contacts in the police. But over the following months, Mr. Magaqa brandished the documents in the council and challenged leaders of the dominant A.N.C. faction, leading Mr. Zulu to wonder whether his old friend was also trying to use the issue to his personal political advantage.The council speaker appeared to be moving over to Mr. Magaqa\u2019s side, according to the speaker\u2019s nephew, Mduduzi Thobela, an old friend who backed Mr. Magaqa during the high school strike. The speaker and Mr. Magaqa had been friendly, and were even related through marriage.Then the killings started.First came the warning: Three bullets pierced the storefront office where the council speaker worked.A few weeks later, the speaker, Khaya Thobela, was sprinkling holy water in a religious rite in his front yard \u2014 and was gunned down where he stood.A month later, the councilor expected to replace him, Mduduzi Shibase, was assassinated after opening the gate to his home. He had strongly supported Mr. Magaqa\u2019s call for a forensic audit of the Memorial Hall.Ms. Msiya, the councilor who had asked pointed questions about the project, got a worried call from Mr. Magaqa.\u201c\u2018Where are you? Don\u2019t go out. I\u2019m coming,\u2019\u201d she recalled him saying.He showed her a \u201chit list\u201d he got from a friend in a government intelligence agency, she said.\u201c\u2018It\u2019s going to be me,\u2019\u201d Mr. Magaqa told her. \u201c\u2018After me, it\u2019s you.\u2019\u201dOn July 13, 2017, a red BMW cased the neighborhood where Mr. Magaqa lived. His neighbors did not recognize the car. It had a license plate from Gauteng, the province where Johannesburg is.Mr. Magaqa, accompanied by Ms. Msiya and other allies, had spent the day in a far corner of Umzimkhulu. But he was in a rush to head back home. The twin killings had shaken him, it was late afternoon, in the dead of South Africa\u2019s winter, and the sun would be setting in no time.\u201c\u2018Let\u2019s go, we\u2019re not safe,\u201d\u2019 he said, recalled Nontsikelelo Mafa, a councilor and close ally.As always, Mr. Magaqa drove his Mercedes himself and hid his gun under the driver\u2019s seat. His bodyguard and another A.N.C. politician in the car also carried guns.Talk of the killings soon gave way to more pleasant topics during the 45-mile drive. The car stereo played house music, blasting the Distruction Boyz\u2019s \u201cOmunye,\u201d an instant hit about a party. The group was planning a party that evening, too, for Ms. Mafa\u2019s 27th birthday.By the time they got back, the music had Mr. Magaqa jumping in his seat. They pulled over at a hangout by the main road, where the red BMW had been waiting.Mr. Magaqa spotted the hit men first.\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he told the passengers in the back seat. Ms. Mafa saw two men with assault rifles approaching and Mr. Magaqa reaching for his gun.Then, the flashes of light.Mr. Zulu\u2019s cellphone rang minutes after the shooting. He reached out to senior police officials he trusted.\u201cThe first one hour is decisive,\u201d he said.But the hit men weren\u2019t caught, even though they drove a conspicuous car and had left witnesses: two women in the back seat survived with wounds to their legs.Mr. Magaqa died about eight weeks later \u2014 from his injuries, the authorities said. His family insisted he had been recovering and was poisoned.The speeches were anodyne, or became rallying cries for the party. But Mr. Zulu had none of it. At a service beforehand, he said Mr. Magaqa had been killed for revealing corruption inside the party.Today, fearing for his own life, Mr. Zulu sleeps in a different place every night. Two bodyguards, hired by his extended family, shadow him at all times. The three big men squeeze into his compact Volkswagen, which sinks a few inches every time they get in, as Mr. Zulu wages his one-man crusade against corruption.\u201cThe A.N.C. is like an ocean that will cleanse itself,\u201d he said, repeating it so often that he seemed to be trying to convince himself.He, too, says he is fighting for what President Ramaphosa calls a \u201cnew dawn\u201d for the nation. So why, he asked, has Mr. Ramaphosa remained silent on the Public Protector\u2019s recommendations to provide him with security?\u201cI\u2019ve been living like a hunted animal,\u201d Mr. Zulu said.In an empty, roofless room, wrapped in heavy blankets against the cold, Mr. Magaqa\u2019s mother spoke about the promises A.N.C. officials made after her son died. His Mercedes sat in a corner of the backyard, riddled with bullets.She was still waiting for the A.N.C. to solve the killing, to take care of her son\u2019s four children, or even to fix his broken cars.\u201cEspecially the Mercedes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s destroyed our family, especially me. Each and every day, I see it, and everything comes back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Trump to Trade, the Financial Crisis Still Resonates 10 Years Later", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThis week is the 10th anniversary of the inflection point of the financial crisis: the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the biggest bankruptcy in history. To some, it feels like a long time ago.Yet, its effects still echo in the way we live today \u2014 in the attitudes that pervade our economy, our culture and our politics. It is hardly a stretch to suggest that President Trump\u2019s election was a direct result of the financial crisis.The crisis was a moment that cleaved our country. It broke a social contract between the plutocrats and everyone else. But it also broke a sense of trust, not just in financial institutions and the government that oversaw them, but in the very idea of experts and expertise. The past 10 years have seen an open revolt against the intelligentsia.Mistrust led to new political movements: the Tea Party for those who didn\u2019t trust the government and Occupy Wall Street for those who didn\u2019t trust big business. These moved Democrats and Republicans away from each other in fundamental ways, and populist attitudes on both ends of the spectrum found champions in the 2016 presidential race in Senator Bernie Sanders and Donald J. Trump.The depth of financial despair during the Great Recession and the invariably slow recovery have unleashed a sense of bitterness that dominates the political landscape, culminating in Mr. Trump\u2019s electoral victory.The deepest crises, he said, always lead to populism. And it should be no surprise that a crisis leads to conflict and, in some extreme cases, war. \u201cI would be worried about the emergence of populism,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause populists tend to want to fight with the other side rather than try to find ways of getting through it.\u201d Populists on every side of the political spectrum \u201chave in common that they\u2019re confrontational,\u201d he said.When I wrote \u201cToo Big to Fail\u201d nearly a decade ago, I knew that the crisis would redefine Wall Street and the economy, but I didn\u2019t appreciate how fundamentally it would redefine the political environment.\u201cOur conclusion: Financial crises tend to radicalize electorates,\u201d Mr. Sufi wrote. \u201cAfter a banking, currency, or debt crisis, our data indicate, the share of centrists or moderates in a country went down, while the share of left- or right-wing radicals went up in most cases.\u201dIn the United States, the crisis exposed an economy that had been a charade \u2014 one that most Americans didn\u2019t understand or appreciate. The use of debt had masked the real problems underneath the surface: a significant decrease in worker participation, automation that would take jobs and stagnant wage growth.These issues long predated the crisis. But as Warren Buffett famously said, \u201cYou only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.\u201dIn truth, our economy today is in much better shape than you might expect, with unemployment at 3.9 percent \u2014 lower than it was before the crisis.Yet debates persist about the way the government, first under President George W. Bush and then under President Barack Obama, chose to respond to the crisis. Should it have done more directly for homeowners? Should it have demanded more onerous terms for the hundreds of billions of dollars in loans to the banks and bankers, like restricting compensation and firing executives to demonstrate more accountability? Should some bankers have gone to jail?For some, it is tempting to think that the government should have taken a more populist approach itself. If it had offered more help directly to the public rather than what was perceived as bailing out the banks, there is a suspicion that divisions could have been lessened, yielding a more united United States.But would it?In Britain, the government did all those politically popular things: It restricted banker pay, it fired executives, it lent money to banks on onerous terms, it restricted spending.It didn\u2019t work. The British economy grew significantly slower than ours. And the resulting resentment and bitterness were much worse than our own, leading to a manifestation of populism even more drastic: the unimaginable vote to leave the European Union.It\u2019s not popular to say, but it\u2019s clear that the financial crisis was so deep and so painful that whatever populist positions policymakers took, the positive feelings would have been short-lived.Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary under Mr. Obama, recounted in his book \u201cStress Test\u201d a conversation that he had with President Bill Clinton as he was considering a more populist approach. Mr. Clinton told him, \u201cYou could take Lloyd Blankfein into a dark alley, and slit his throat, and it would satisfy them for about two days. Then the blood lust would rise again.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t help that the economic medicine used by policymakers after a crisis exacerbates those feelings of anger. The most efficient fix \u2014 lowering interest rates \u2014 helps the wealthy because they end up with cheaper mortgages and enjoy the benefits that low rates have on corporate growth. Those lower on the economic ladder, on the other hand, get little in interest on their savings. The gap between the haves and the have-nots widens.But that approach actually works, pulling everyone along with it, even if it is uneven and there are greater beneficiaries than others.There is one question I get more than any other: \u201cWill we have another crisis?\u201d The answer, of course, is yes. But it\u2019s not a Wall Street crisis similar to 2008 that concerns me. I\u2019m worried about something far bigger.When I wrote \u201cToo Big to Fail,\u201d that phrase was only used in the context of financial institutions. Today, it is used to refer to cities, municipalities, states and countries. If you look at the buildup of debt, that\u2019s the place to keep an eye on.That\u2019s not the only cause for concern, either. If history tells us the political divisions we have seen since the financial crisis were predictable, then what does history have to say about what comes next?Mr. Dalio pointed to the chilling of international relationships that happened after the Great Depression as a worrying example of the divisions that can widen when populism fosters protectionism. \u201cWe started to have economic tariffs and we started to have back-and-forths of those things,\u201d he said.He paused for a moment, signaling he didn\u2019t want to contemplate what that later manifested. But he continued, \u201cWhich then, 10 years later, led to Pearl Harbor.\u201dThere are, of course, many steps between populism and war. But Mr. Dalio said he saw similarities between the global environment that preceded World War II and the one we see today.That\u2019s reason enough to never forget this crisis and its lessons.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Burt Reynolds: A Star With the Pedal to the Metal", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn AppraisalIt\u2019s fitting and consoling to imagine that he\u2019s there now. Mr. Reynolds, who died Thursday, may not have lived up to his full potential as an actor \u2014 he often said so himself \u2014 but he was one of the great drivers in American popular culture. This isn\u2019t a minor accomplishment. The pride he took in performing his own stunts was partly the bluff machismo of a former athlete and partly a commitment to screen acting as a physical rather than a cerebral or emotional undertaking. He could play romantic leads, detectives and football players: The range was always there, even if he didn\u2019t always use it. He was sometimes clean-shaven, and not always southern. But if you grew up in the prime of his stardom, you most likely remember him, with a mustache and a cowboy hat and maybe a pair of aviators, behind the wheel of a car.Which is, in its way, a hot-rod movie too, about a young gearhead named Luke Skywalker whose rebellion against authority unfolds on a galactic scale and ends in feats of fancy driving. Bandit\u2019s aims may be more earthbound, but his skill set represents a fusion of Luke\u2019s finesse and Han Solo\u2019s derring-do. For complicated and not entirely plausible reasons \u2014 and $80,000 of a rich heel\u2019s money \u2014 he and his buddy Cledus (the country singer Jerry Reed) need to haul a truckload of Coors beer from Texarkana to Atlanta. Along the way they incur the wrath of a sheriff with the unimprovable name of Buford T. Justice and the impeccable gravitas of Jackie Gleason.\u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d was \u2014 and remains \u2014 a hell of a lot of fun. It was also a protest movie, both widely popular and unabashedly populist, a word that meant something a little different back then. Cledus and Bandit are southern working-class white men in revolt against, to put it bluntly, state power and capitalist greed.That kind of class consciousness would shift rightward in subsequent decades, an evolution that doesn\u2019t really have much to do with Burt Reynolds. He was not the type of actor to take up causes or make political statements. Like many of his characters, he preferred to focus on getting the job done, and having as much fun as he could in the process.Mr. Reynolds\u2019s Sonny Hooper is a stuntman \u2014 a perfectly meta role for an actor who had done his own driving while playing bootleggers, racers and other daredevils. Hooper and his comrades are the unsung artists of the film industry, which regards them as expendable workers, to be exploited, endangered and cast aside. Their dedication and solidarity (as well as their reckless, good-timing approach to life, sex and art) stand in contrast to the greed and pretensions of the directors and producers, who lack vision, humanity and any sense of craft or fun. The class struggle culminates in a single, clean, knockout punch. Guess whose fist delivers it.Hooper is a heroic Hollywood proletarian: sexy, honorable, mischievous and brave. The Trans Am is red this time. The man playing him, of course, is a movie star: a master of the box office universe without equal at that moment. Maybe there\u2019s a contradiction there, but contradictions troubled Burt Reynolds about as much as roadblocks bothered Bandit.

{"Headline": "Trump Can\u2019t Win the War on Demography ", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA proposed citizenship question on the 2020 census reveals the dependency between older white voters and America\u2019s growing young minority population.Mr. Frey, a demographer, is the author of \u201cDiversity Explosion.\u201dSince the early days of his campaign, from his proposal to build a wall along the Mexican border to his discredited committee on voter fraud, President Trump has declared war on America\u2019s changing demography. His administration has followed through on that strategy with a proposal to add a question to the 2020 census asking about citizenship. If the question remains on the form, millions of households, particularly Hispanic and Asian-American, could skip the census, leading to an overrepresentation of white Americans during this once-a-decade count.Six lawsuits seeking to remove the proposed question are moving through the federal courts, with the first trial likely to take place this fall. The likely source of future gains among the nation\u2019s population of children, teenagers and young working adults is minorities \u2014 Hispanics, Asians, blacks and others \u2014 most of whom are born in the United States.Indeed, the only part of the white population that is growing appreciably is older people, the same group to whom Mr. Trump is appealing. Thanks to aging baby boomers, the older retirement-age white population will grow by one-third over the next 15 years and, with it, the need for the government to support Social Security, Medicare, hospitals and the like. Revenue for these programs will have to come from the younger minority population. If the census does not accurately count this population, then all the services that support children and future workers, such as public education, Head Start, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and Medicaid, will be shortchanged.Although the slowly growing, rapidly aging white population will be accurately counted, the fast-growing minority school-age and young adult populations that represent the nation\u2019s future will not get their due \u2014 demographically, politically or economically.Let\u2019s assume that one in three people in Hispanic and Asian noncitizen households refuses to answer the census. If that\u2019s the case, the Hispanic share of the United States population would drop by 2.1 percentage points (from 17.3 to 15.2 percent) and the total white population share would rise by 2.2 percentage points (from 62 to 64.2 percent).This imbalance would influence congressional reapportionment, hurting large, immigrant-heavy states. It will also shape how congressional and state legislative districts are drawn, favoring rural and small areas at the expense of large metropolitan areas, since noncitizen households are far more prevalent in the latter.The underenumeration of racial minorities would also misallocate billions of dollars in state and federal funds for housing assistance, job training, community development and a variety of social services that should be distributed on the basis of census counts. It would provide a faulty framework for surveys that will inform thousands of policy and business decisions, such as where to locate schools, hospitals, employment sites or retail establishments catering to different population groups, over the next decade.William H. Frey, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a population studies professor at the University of Michigan, is the author of \u201cDiversity Explosion: How New Racial Demographics Are Remaking America.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Once \u201899 Percent Against Trump,\u2019 Dean Heller Calls Him \u2018Great Leader\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySenator Dean Heller on Wednesday called President Trump \u201ca great leader\u201d who had revived Nevada\u2019s economy, a striking departure from the arm\u2019s-length approach Mr. Heller took with Mr. Trump in the 2016 campaign and in the first months of his presidency.In a private conference call with White House aides, other Nevada Republican officials and local activists, Mr. Heller \u2014 the most endangered Senate Republican up for re-election this November \u2014 offered an unqualified embrace of the president.\u201cOur arms are wide open,\u201d Mr. Heller said on the call, held to drum up interest in Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rally scheduled for Thursday in Las Vegas. \u201cWe\u2019re so thrilled to have the president.\u201dOn Wednesday, noting that Nevada is now No. 1 in job creation per capita, Mr. Heller said, \u201cMy message is going to be Nevada is back to work, and it\u2019s back to work because of this president.\u201dThe only Senate Republican running in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in the 2016 election, Mr. Heller is facing a pricey and highly competitive race against Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democratic nominee. Recently polling indicates that the race is effectively tied, and that about half of Nevadans do not approve of the president.Mr. Heller also predicted that Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court, would overcome an accusation of sexual assault three decades ago and be confirmed.\u201cWe got a little hiccup here with the Kavanaugh nomination, we\u2019ll get through this and we\u2019ll get off to the races,\u201d he said.The New York Times listened in on the call, which also included the White House political director, Bill Stepien; the Nevada attorney general, Adam Laxalt, the Republican nominee for governor; and Danny Tarkanian, who is running for an open Nevada House seat.It is Mr. Tarkanian\u2019s House candidacy that partly explains Mr. Heller\u2019s newfound admiration for the president. Mr. Tarkanian, a son of the legendary former University of Nevada-Las Vegas basketball coach, was challenging Mr. Heller in this year\u2019s Republican Senate primary until Mr. Trump intervened. The president persuaded Mr. Tarkanian to drop out of the Senate primary and instead run for the House.But in warming to the president, Mr. Heller is not just returning a favor to Mr. Trump for clearing his primary field: The senator is also wagering that he cannot win in a midterm election without galvanizing his state\u2019s Republican base. Grass-roots Nevada Republicans are enthusiastic backers of Mr. Trump, and the president\u2019s endorsement has helped several Republican candidates prevail in competitive primaries this year.In his last trip to Nevada, at the state Republican convention in June, the president joked about Mr. Heller\u2019s initial distance, saying he had been a \u201clittle bit shaky at the beginning\u201d but had become \u201crock solid.\u201dThe senator, though, was far less effusive at the time than he was on Wednesday\u2019s call. He spoke only briefly before Mr. Trump and claimed he had written the tax overhaul \u2014 and was happy \u201cthis president signed it.\u201dMr. Stepien helped offer balm to whatever raw feelings there may still be between Nevada Republican activists and Mr. Heller, heaping praise on the senator for supporting Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda and scorning Ms. Rosen for being \u201cpart of the obstruction.\u201dMr. Laxalt did his part to unify the party, too, warning that if he lost his race for governor against the Democrat nominee, Steve Sisolak, it would be impossible for Mr. Trump to carry Nevada in 2020.\u201cIf you thought the Harry Reid machine was bad, the Sisolak machine would be a sight to behold,\u201d Mr. Laxalt said, alluding to the former Senate Democratic leader who very much remains the de facto leader of the state Democratic Party.Advertisement"}

Free Publicity.", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW WINDSOR, N.Y. \u2014 Through his headset on the sun-baked runway, Air Force Maj. Ray Geoffroy listened as the lead Thunderbird pilot commanded the F-16s above: \u201cReady, now pull. All. The. Way.\u201dThe noisy fighter jets rolled in unison and started a steep, rocket-like climb in the sky above Stewart International Airport. Below, the spectators at the New York Air Show gaped as the United States Air Force Thunderbirds streaked by.The Thunderbirds capped three hours of fancy flying that delighted the crowds. Earlier, the West Point Parachute Team jumped out of an Army plane, decorative red smoke pouring from their boots. And Mike Wiskus, an acrobatic pilot, flew his Pitts biplane upside down and just feet from the ground.An estimated 25,000 people attended each day of the weekend-long show. Saturday\u2019s and Sunday\u2019s attendance exceeded the number of daily visitors to the air show in the three previous years, the show\u2019s producer, Bryan Lilley, said.\u201cEvery year it\u2019s exponential,\u201d Mr. Lilley said, predicting that a crowd of 100,000 was possible in the future.Stewart Airport, about 70 miles north of New York City in rural Orange County, has an 11,000-foot runway that makes it long enough for the largest aircraft to land. The Army, Air Force and Marines are at the airport sharing space with the Air National Guard 105th Airlift Wing.\u201cIt\u2019s long and big. It\u2019s like a beachfront air show inside an airport,\u201d Mr. Lilley said. Fierce-looking fighter jets and capacious cargo carriers were mixed in with food stalls and souvenir stands along the near mile-long flight line.In 2015, Ed Harrison, Stewart Airport\u2019s general manager, moved there from Newark Liberty International Airport. He said he thought an air show was just the thing to elevate the airport\u2019s profile.\u201cWe would never think of doing this at Newark or Kennedy or La Guardia. But here we have the capacity to do it,\u201d Mr. Harrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s a ton of publicity and it\u2019s not costing us anything.\u201dAirlines were invited to watch the show and consider scheduling service, Mr. Harrison said. \u201cThey see Stewart is part of the New York metro area. They see the crowds that come here that say, \u2018This is accessible,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we believe it is translating into more airline interest.\u201dBut Mr. Harrison also said the show could not disrupt business. \u201cThe air show stops when a flight takes off,\u201d he said.On Saturday, a private Boeing 747 thundered down the runway just a few hundred feet from the crowd. George Cline, who was overseeing the performances, said it was the sort of thing that thrills audiences. He could barely hide his own excitement.\u201cDid you see it?\u201d he asked. \u201cPeople are sitting right here on the taxiway and saying, \u2018I\u2019ve never been this close.\u2019\u201dIn his experience, Mr. Cline said, \u201cThe No. 1 thing people want to see in air shows is modern military. They want to see the new planes and the old planes.\u201dThat certainly was the case for Albin and Cathy Les, who came to the show from Massachusetts with their children and grandson. The C-5M Galaxy was high on their list of planes to visit. The cargo carrier designed 50 years ago remains the largest United States military transport plane. When they posed for a family photo, however, it was in front of the considerably smaller Northrup T-38 fighter jet. All seven relatives, including 15-month-old J.J. Florio, were wearing T-shirts with the silhouette of an F-14.For serious World War II buffs, two bombers \u2014 the B-17 featured in the film \u201cMemphis Belle\u201d and a B-25 flown by Larry Kelley of Delaware Aviation Museum \u2014 were offering flights in the $400 a seat range. Thrill-seekers on a tighter budget could also find an $80 helicopter ride offered by Independent Helicopters, an Orange County company, air show sponsor and a tenant at Stewart Airport.Contracts to provide security, tents, food and portable toilets during the air show, as well as handle the event\u2019s ticket sales and other necessities, add an estimated $5 million to the region\u2019s economy, according to the Port Authority.The Orange County executive, Steven M. Neuhaus, said the actual financial benefit of the airport is far higher when other tourist-related businesses that are supported by a thriving local airport are factored in.\u201cWe see an 8 percent increase in sales tax revenues,\u201d Mr. Neuhaus said. \u201cIt\u2019s off the chart compared to what it has been the last 10 years.\u201dAt the end of the day, after standing on a raised platform for hours orchestrating the airplanes, an exhausted Mr. Cline wiped sweat from his sunburned brow and offered his own sunny assessment of the show.\u201cIt\u2019s great advertising for the airport. People who probably have never been here before in their life, drove out to this airport and they are thinking: \u201cI could take a flight out of here.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeremy Corbyn, at Labour Party Conference, Faces Pressure on New Brexit Vote", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 As the annual meeting of Britain\u2019s opposition Labour Party began on Sunday, one big question was reverberating around the conference center in Liverpool: Should Britons be allowed to weigh in again on the country\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union?Until now, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has shown reluctance. But he is facing pressure on the issue, and it appears to be having an effect.In an interview published on Sunday, Mr. Corbyn told The Sunday Mirror that while he was not calling for another referendum, he would \u201cadhere\u201d to any decision by party members, many of whom want a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d on the terms of any exit deal \u2014 a plebiscite that would most likely give the option of staying inside the European bloc.\u201cTo constitute the majority in Parliament that you would need to have a second referendum, the opposition party is pretty important,\u201d said Paul Webb, a professor of politics at the University of Sussex in England. \u201cSo it could be a game-changer.\u201dMr. Corbyn and his spokesman on economic issues, John McDonnell, would prefer for the growing crisis over Brexit to precipitate a general election that might bring them to power, rather than another referendum.Mrs. May declared the negotiations were at an \u201cimpasse\u201d after the bloc\u2019s leaders rejected the proposals she had made before the talks. The news prompted a fall in the value of the British currency, stoked political tensions and raised questions about Mrs. May\u2019s ability to avoid a chaotic and economically damaging departure.On the Labour side, \u201cJeremy Corbyn seems to be the strongest holdout against a second referendum,\u201d said Mr. Webb, the politics professor.Joseph Todd, a spokesman for Momentum, said that many of the motions last year had come from people who \u201cdid not actually want to talk about Brexit; they wanted to hurt the party leadership.\u201d This year, he argued, \u201cthere are a lot of activists who genuinely want to discuss the issue.\u201dMoreover, there is a question of urgency, especially in some of the country\u2019s major trade unions, which are alarmed about the economic implications of Britain\u2019s quitting the European Union without a deal. The Trades Union Congress said in a statement this month that, given the real risk of a collapse in talks, or of a deal that does not protect jobs, \u201cwe do not rule out the possibility of campaigning for people to have a final say on the Brexit deal through a popular vote.\u201dStill, Mr. Corbyn\u2019s main objective is to force another election, he told the BBC on Sunday, and he has a long track record of euroskepticism. He was first elected to Parliament in 1983 on a pledge to quit what was then called the European Economic Community. In subsequent decades, he seemed to cling to a vision of the bloc as a bankers\u2019 club whose rules limiting state aid to unprofitable companies could impede his leftist agenda.Ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum, Mr. Corbyn officially supported remaining in the European Union, but critics argued that he did the bare minimum to help the \u201cRemain\u201d campaign. He publicly accepted the results, but has allowed Labour policy to slowly evolve toward a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d that would retain close economic ties to the European Union to preserve jobs.Though Labour\u2019s divisions on Brexit are nowhere near as deep as those of the governing Conservative Party, they are nonetheless real. Some party members are vocally embracing \u201cLexit,\u201d a leftist agenda for Brexit that might emphasize greater public ownership and a new strategy for the economy.\u201cThere is evidence of what is beginning to look like a significant shift against Brexit, and quite a lot of that has happened in those Labour-held constituencies that voted Leave but now are thought to have a Remain majority,\u201d Mr. Webb said.That could point to a cautious, gradual shift in Labour policy, whatever Mr. Corbyn\u2019s instincts might say.\u201cI don\u2019t underestimate his capacity to stick to his position,\u201d Mr. Webb said, \u201cbut I think the pressure is growing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These include four \u201cunicorn\u201d digital start-ups valued at over $1 billion: Skype, TransferWise, Taxify and Playtech. This year, Estonians are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the establishment of their Republic in 1918. But for about half that time, the country was occupied, and it was rebuilt almost from scratch in the 1990s after regaining its freedom from the Soviet Union. Unburdened by legacy technology, Estonians entered the internet age with a unique opportunity to build a new kind of country where almost everything can be done entirely online, cost-effectively and fuss-free \u2014 a supportive environment in which entrepreneurs can thrive. President Kaljulaid emphasizes that this shift to a digital nation is based not just on new technology, but also on new ways of thinking: \u201cWe have succeeded in going digital because we have put people and businesses, their need for rapid data exchange and identity verification, at the center of change.\u201d\nIn 2014, Estonians asked: If their country could serve citizens and residents entirely online, why not open up their digital borders to more people? This new population wouldn\u2019t need citizenship or physical residency, but would still be issued an Estonian digital ID card, enabling them to operate within Estonia\u2019s digital business environment without physically being in the country. This would allow more people to establish and manage an E.U. company entirely online, helping democratize entrepreneurship globally.\nThe success of the e-Residency program rests on its being a national initiative, in which state organizations work closely together to serve e-residents and ensure their compliance with the rules. The private sector, both inside and outside Estonia, adds more value by offering products and services to the growing e-resident market.\n\nMoreover, the program generates revenue and attracts investment. According to a recent report published by Deloitte, in the first three years of operation, the e-Residency program contributed \u20ac14.4 million to the Estonian economy; it is expected to add an additional \u20ac1.8 billion by 2025.\nIllustrations by Michele MarconiThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Trump Berates Canada and Threatens Car Tariffs as Nafta Talks Falter", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said he rejected a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada during the United Nations General Assembly this week and threatened on Wednesday to punish Canada by taxing the cars it exports into America, signaling a new low in relations between the two nations.Mr. Trump\u2019s comments come after months of tense trade negotiations between Canada and the United States have failed to produce an agreement and as the White House prepares to move ahead with a bilateral trade deal with just Mexico.\u201cFrankly, we\u2019re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from Canada,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s the mother lode. That\u2019s the big one. We\u2019re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada.\u201dTrade tensions between the United States and Canada have been rising for months, and relations between Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau have soured amid disagreements over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement.Mr. Trump said he turned down a meeting with Mr. Trudeau because Canada had treated the United States \u201cvery badly\u201d and because of its high dairy tariffs, which are preventing the United States from selling milk into Canada. A spokesman for Mr. Trudeau said the prime minister never requested such a meeting.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to snub Mr. Trudeau when he did not stand to shake the Canadian prime minister\u2019s hand during a lunch at the United Nations summit meeting. Mr. Trudeau said the two leaders did not meet because their schedules were full of meetings with leaders from far-flung countries.Mr. Trump left open the possibility of reaching a deal with Canada, but said there would be no more Nafta.\u201cI don\u2019t like Nafta. I\u2019ve never liked it. It\u2019s been very bad for the United States. It\u2019s been great for Canada, great for Mexico,\u201d Mr. Trump said, adding that he would rename the pact \u201cU.S.M.C.\u201d for United States-Mexico-Canada.The Trump administration is expected to send Congress text of a new Nafta on Friday that does not include Canada, according to congressional aides and others familiar with the discussions, raising doubts about the ability to keep the 25-year-old trilateral pact intact.Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, said on Wednesday that \u201cat this point, we are running out of time\u201d for negotiations with the Canadians.The impending failure to reach an agreement among the three countries by Sept. 30 is creating a new round of uncertainty for companies whose supply chains and businesses depend on access to all three markets and for lawmakers, who must determine whether they can allow the United States to go it alone with Mexico.Mexico and the United States want to sign a final deal before the new Mexican government takes over on Dec. 1, and the final text of trade agreements must be released 60 days before they are signed by the president, under United States law, fueling the deadline.Mr. Trump would not commit to pulling out of Nafta but said he was willing to go it alone with Mexico for now.\u201cWe\u2019re very well along the way with Mexico, the relationship\u2019s very good,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens with Canada. They\u2019re charging us 300 percent tariffs on dairy. We can\u2019t allow that to happen.\u201dCanada has said it will not allow the United States deadline to govern the trade talks. After marathon talks this month, Mr. Lighthizer and Ms. Freeland scheduled no formal meetings in Washington this week.\u201cWe will keep working as long as it takes to get to the right deal for Canada,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in New York on Wednesday.Asked what would happen if the United States moves forward with just Mexico, Mr. Trudeau said: \u201cWe will keep working on a broad range of alternatives. A broad range of paths are ahead of us.\u201dCanadian and American officials have tried to avoid negotiating in public, but in recent days their differences have started to spill out. Speaking at an event sponsored by Politico in Toronto on Wednesday, David MacNaughton, Canada\u2019s ambassador to the United States, said Canada wanted protection from the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs on national security grounds.Upcoming elections in Quebec, a province whose economy is heavily dependent on dairy, have also complicated negotiations for Canada\u2019s leaders as they look to close a deal with the United States.\u201cIt seems like Canada has decided it\u2019s too risky before the Oct. 1 Quebec elections to make any deal on Nafta, so the U.S. and Mexico deal will go forward and get signed, get stuck in the refrigerator,\u201d said Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cCanada and the U.S. will talk and at some point they will all get stirred up and served together in Congress in 2019.\u201dCanada is the largest export market for America, and members of Congress from both parties have been adamant that it should be included in any agreement with Mexico. Congress must ratify major trade deals, and an agreement that excludes Canada is expected be difficult to pass. There is also an ongoing legal debate as to whether the president has the authority to terminate Nafta on his own. If Nafta is terminated, Canada and Mexico could continue to trade on its terms or work together on their own new free trade agreement.The agreement the United States reached with Mexico in August updates Nafta provisions on the digital economy, automobiles, agriculture and labor unions. Among the most significant alterations are changes to rules governing car manufacturing, in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico.The core of the trade pact \u2014 which allows American companies to operate in Mexico and Canada without tariffs \u2014 remains intact.With Nafta negotiations floundering, administration officials and Japanese leaders announced that they would open bilateral negotiations toward a free-trade agreement between the two nations.Mr. Lighthizer said he would seek congressional approval to use so-called fast track authority to hasten the negotiations, which he said would proceed in two stages. First, he said, the countries will seek to reach an \u201cearly harvest\u201d agreement to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers for goods. Following that agreement, the countries said in a joint statement issued Wednesday afternoon, \u201cthe United States and Japan also intend to have negotiations on other trade and investment items.\u201dThe joint statement said the United States\u2019 goal in negotiations was to lift its auto industry. It also noted that Japanese officials would not exceed \u201cJapan\u2019s previous economic partnership agreements\u201d in opening up its markets for agricultural and forestry imports. That effectively means that the Trump administration concedes it will not win greater concessions in those areas from the Japanese than the Obama administration did in negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump rejected after taking office.Advertisement"}
