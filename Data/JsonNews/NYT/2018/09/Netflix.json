{"Headline": "At the Close of Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s \u2018My Struggle,\u2019 a Magician Loses His Touch", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesThe most elite of the world\u2019s white, male, under-60 novelists sometimes seem to ride together as if in a peloton, as if they were competitors in the Tour de France, coasting in and out of each other\u2019s slipstreams. When one breaks from the pack while up in the mountains \u2014 witness Jonathan Franzen or the Norwegian Karl Ove Knausgaard \u2014 a target surfaces on his jersey.Sensing this ancient dynamic, Tom Wolfe once replied to an attack by Norman Mailer by commenting, \u201cThe lead dog is the one they always try to bite in the ass.\u201d Mailer casually responded: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the top dog just because your ass is bleeding.\u201dEspecially trying is Book Six\u2019s 400-plus page excursus into Hitler and the etiology of the Third Reich. It is a grindingly sophomoric exercise that sits undigested under this novel\u2019s skin, like an armchair inside a snake. This section purports to explain why Knausgaard\u2019s book shares a title with Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d \u2014 in German, \u201cMy Struggle.\u201d But its salient points could have been made in 40 pages, or even four.I write all this as a Knausgaard admirer. The earlier books in this series, notably the first three, and especially Book Two, were for me among the great reading experiences of this decade. In his commitment to the quotidian details of his life as a boy and as a man, Knausgaard writes like a whale filtering krill. He has an uncanny, nearly magical gift for isolating his details, for holding them to the light until they shine.What once felt like sorcery in his work now sometimes seems, in Book Six, like fumbling tricks. A spell has been broken, a thermometer shaken down.It\u2019s simplest to talk about this novel as if it were three 400-page books, which arguably it should have been. In the first, Knausgaard comes to grips with the fame the early books in the series brought him. There is a freight of unwanted attention, especially a threatened lawsuit from his uncle Gunnar, who was incensed that so many family secrets were spilled in Book One. The author smokes and frets and tries to keep writing.The second section contains the Hitler material. It includes a close reading of \u201cMein Kampf,\u201d and considers that book\u2019s ideas and impact through many lenses \u2014 through Dostoyevsky\u2019s consideration of nihilism; Heidegger\u2019s yearning for simplicity; the weird and barbed images of the Old Testament, still lurking somewhere in our minds. He spends pages on a favorite poem by Paul Celan. He winds through the socialism of Jack London and Karl Marx, through the art of Rembrandt and J.M.W. Turner, through Wagner\u2019s triumphal music and Victor Klemperer\u2019s analyses of fascist language. Knausgaard doesn\u2019t bite off more than he can chew, for he chews with a morbid enthusiasm, one that the reader never quite comes to share.In the third and final section he shows his wife, Linda, what he has written about her and their children in his first book. She weeps, but she seems strong enough to take it.She is not strong enough to take it. In the very affecting final section, Linda has a mental breakdown (she had spent time in a psychiatric hospital before they met) and the author tries to care for her. He pulled the pin on a grenade when he wrote the first novels in this series, writing unsparingly about the people close to him, using their real names. In this final book the grenade has gone off; it\u2019s too late for him to throw himself on it.\u201cThis novel has hurt everyone around me, it has hurt me, and in a few years, when they are old enough to read it, it will hurt my children,\u201d Knausgaard writes. Yet he would not, you sense, have changed a word.Knausgaard remains Knausgaard. There is vital writing in this book on many subjects, from male vanity and supermarket carts to fruit labels and how we view the changing faces of loved ones over time. About prawns, for example, he writes: \u201cAlive they looked almost like office workers of the ocean, in death like a company of ballet dancers.\u201dAt least once, he made me laugh out loud. \u201cIf there were a choice between couples therapy and death,\u201d he writes, \u201cI would unhesitatingly choose death.\u201d He\u2019s seldom this vivid here, however.This book feels like it was written quickly, and indeed it was. But then so were the previous books in the \u201cMy Struggle\u201d series. He says amazing, terrifying things about his productivity in this book, such as: \u201cI would have to write three new books in 10 months. Which wasn\u2019t implausible, I\u2019d been doing about 10 pages a day for the past six months as it was, in the region of 50 pages a week given the fact that I wasn\u2019t allowed to work weekends.\u201dSeveral major ideas boil to the surface in Book Six. The first is about how Hitler\u2019s memoir and politics were all about the obliterating \u201cwe,\u201d not the individual \u201cI.\u201d This way leads to herd instinct, to madness. This is among the reasons Knausgaard\u2019s books so strongly insist on the facts of one life.A second is the way that liberal society denies and buries so many of the dark instincts that lurk inside us. We hide death and disease. We pretend that beauty and charisma, Nazi ideals both of them, don\u2019t matter, when in fact they have never mattered more. We spend our hours playing epic-quest video games that stir the grandiose instincts absent from our daily lives. Knausgaard fears another dark figure will come along to tap our inchoate longing to be part of something greater than ourselves.These ideas are interesting but they are not new, and they\u2019re buried in an endurance test of a novel. This book is the largest in the absorbing \u201cMy Struggle\u201d series, but curiously it\u2019s the runt of the litter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "App-Only Banks Rise in Europe and Aim at Traditional Lenders", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Greg Stevenson was trying to refinance the mortgage on his four-bedroom home in eastern England when things started going awry. An attempt by his bank, TSB, to shift data to a new computer system had gone spectacularly wrong. For several maddening days, he could not connect to his account, transfer funds or reach anybody at the bank for help.\u201cI felt abandoned,\u201d said Mr. Stevenson, a 31-year-old software developer. \u201cI needed to be moving money around, and I needed access to my bank.\u201dThe systems failure in April, affecting nearly two million TSB customers, was a breaking point for Mr. Stevenson. He moved his money to Monzo, a British start-up that is among a growing number in Europe offering checking accounts and A.T.M. cards, but lack physical branches \u2014 everything is done through an app.So-called fintech companies have sought to take on the world\u2019s biggest banks for years, but only recently have companies like Monzo begun to build a critical mass. Millions of customers across Europe, most in their 20s or 30s, have signed up over the past two years. And thanks to favorable regulations in the region and an influx of venture capital, that shift is accelerating.Here in Britain, officials have been concerned about the power of large banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and they see the start-ups as weakening the hold of traditional lenders. The authorities have adopted policies such as a \u201cregulatory sandbox,\u201d allowing what are known as challenger banks to test new financial products and get feedback from regulators before proposing them to customers.Support from regulators in Europe has given momentum to companies entering the market there. In addition to making slicker apps, the companies have slashed fees for spending overseas and wiring money. Last year, Monzo became one of the first challenger banks to receive a license allowing it to hold customers\u2019 deposits on its own, a milestone no start-up in the United States has achieved.\u201cOur regulator is pretty forward thinking,\u201d said Tom Blomfield, 33, the co-founder and chief executive of Monzo, referring to Britain.Finance hasn\u2019t been immune to the technological change reshaping many other industries. Consumers and businesses are using new payment services and online lenders, and hedge funds are increasingly relying on complex algorithms.But Mr. Blomfield \u2014 who sat for an interview at his London apartment after walking the office dog, a cockapoo named Bingo \u2014 argues that day-to-day retail banking has been relatively unaffected.Monzo, like other start-up banks, still has to figure out how to be profitable. But it has already begun to reimagine banking for an increasingly cashless society. Customers of the future won\u2019t need branches when they can text a customer service representative. Detailed spending breakdowns help account holders control their spending. Doing without retail space and tellers keeps costs down, allowing the company to reduce fees and hire programmers.\u201cThe internet lets you run these traditional businesses at a fraction of the cost,\u201d Mr. Blomfield said.Monzo got started with crowdfunding and remains a minnow compared with the giants of British banking, but customers \u2014 notably younger, wealthier ones \u2014 are signing up. Roughly 75 percent of Monzo\u2019s 900,000 clients are under 40, split evenly between men and women. On average, they make more than 50,000 pounds, or about $65,000, a year, nearly double the median British salary, and Monzo is adding more than 2,000 customers a day.Digital banks face innumerable issues, though. Chief among them is how they will make money. A slick app and basic checking accounts are unlikely to be enough, unless they can offer services like mortgages and other loans that come with higher interest rates.As they expand, these start-ups will also face more regulatory scrutiny and targeting by fraudsters. Traditional banks must ensure, for example, that a certain proportion of the deposits they hold are kept in reserve, as a safety net. Such policies help guarantee that a bank will not lose its customers\u2019 money, but they make it harder to turn a profit. Now that Monzo holds customer deposits, it must also meet these requirements.Start-ups also have to fight inertia. People rarely change banks, whether because of an existing mortgage or the headache of updating a Netflix account. Less than a quarter of Monzo\u2019s customers deposit their paychecks into their accounts; most use it as an add-on, to take advantage of perks like cheaper foreign exchange transactions. Even Mr. Stevenson, who does his day-to-day banking with Monzo, had to go to another local lender to refinance.\u201cThe big question is, will millions of people switch their primary transaction accounts, where their checks get deposited and where they pay their bills, and do their key transactions,\u201d said Hans Morris, a former executive at Citigroup and Visa who now manages Nyca, a New York venture capital fund. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a historical bet, you would say that they aren\u2019t going to switch.\u201dMr. Blomfield is confident his company\u2019s young customer base will eventually turn to Monzo for other, more lucrative, financial services that it intends to eventually offer.Monzo plans to announce in coming weeks that it is raising about \u00a3100 million, at a valuation of more than \u00a31 billion, according to two people familiar with the deal. The deal will make it one of the biggest start-ups in Europe, and Monzo will use the funds to help enter the United States as early as next year.Revolut, another banking start-up, has more than 2.75 million customers across Europe, and it is adding 7,000 each day. After raising $250 million in April, it, too, wants to offer services in the United States.Government policies there are more constraining, however. As a result, most fintech firms in the United States have focused on payment services like Square, and mobile money transfers like Venmo, though companies including Chime have entered partnerships with licensed lenders to offer banking accounts more like Monzo.Still, investors in Europe have been won over. A record $1.2 billion has been pumped into banking start-ups globally so far this year, 70 percent of which has gone to European companies. That is more than double last year\u2019s figure, and a tenfold increase on the amount invested in 2014, according to CB Insights, a market research firm.Martin Mignot, a partner at Index Ventures and a member of Revolut\u2019s board of directors, said TSB\u2019s systems failure this year encapsulated the issues traditional banks face: costly retail space and slow, legacy computer systems. Revolut and others are more nimble than their older, larger competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s a different mind-set,\u201d he said.Even some who once felt that app-based banks were a gimmick have been won over.\u201cI was a bit skeptical, but I\u2019m definitely a convert,\u201d said Sinead Loftus, a legal assistant in Ireland who joined Revolut after growing frustrated with her local bank\u2019s fees. \u201cI\u2019ve convinced my mom to get one, I told all my co-workers to get one, I got my boss one.\u201dAdvertisement"}

These are edited excerpts from the conversation.This season deals very explicitly with the theme of disgraced celebrities. How did the current news cycle influence you?How does that jibe with this idea of what we\u2019re currently going through, that it feels like people are being forgiven too easily? How can I condemn that while at the same time being like, \u201cNo, but, we do need to forgive each other?\u201d Some people have also not really done the work to be forgiven.There are a lot of references to previous seasons \u2014 BoJack\u2019s questionable interactions with Charlotte\u2019s daughter, Penny, for instance \u2014 which also suggest that he hasn\u2019t learned much from his mistakes. Is that a creative challenge for you, figuring out how to keep this character that hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed interesting? \u201cFundamentally\u201d is a good word, because I think he\u2019s changed in small ways, moved forward, and then moved back again. A big thing we were talking about at the beginning of this season is, \u201cWhat does BoJack really need to do in order to change?\u201dThe things we kept landing on are: He needs to get sober and get therapy. That\u2019s what this guy needs. His refusal to do that is the thing that\u2019s holding him. It felt like if we want to move this character forward, we need to get him to the place where he\u2019s willing to do those things.That means he needs to find a new rock bottom to hit, unfortunately. At the end of Season 4, he thinks he\u2019s in a good place. Why would he get help then? Why would he change anything about himself? He feels like, \u201cI\u2019ve climbed out of this hole, myself.\u201d A big point of this season is that you don\u2019t have to do it yourself. In fact, this idea that you should do it yourself is harmful. BoJack feels that to ask for help from other people is a sign of weakness, and that it\u2019s dragging people down, trying to get them to care about his problems. That\u2019s something that\u2019s deeply ingrained in him.I do think BoJack being willing to do that at the end of this season does represent real growth. But I wouldn\u2019t blame an audience for being dubious of that, based on his performance in the past.He and Diane have a blowout toward the end of the season, and she asks for the details of what he\u2019s done to other women in the past. He says that he can\u2019t remember and he doesn\u2019t even know if they will remember.I haven\u2019t planned out what happens next, but I would guess that most of those women remember. Can he undo any of the things that we\u2019ve seen him do in this series, or other things that are implied, that we don\u2019t even know about? No, he cannot. He cannot undo that damage.[But] I think there\u2019s a lot to be said for stopping, and changing. There\u2019s a danger in thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s too late for me, therefore I\u2019m just going to continue being a bad guy for the rest of my life.\u201d I think that\u2019s really damaging and self-fulfilling \u2014 using your previous damage, or bad deeds, as an excuse to continue to do bad deeds.What made you choose to depict the funeral for BoJack\u2019s mother via monologue? The format came first. We talked about how do we maintain the interest over a whole episode, when it\u2019s just a monologue? You\u2019re just watching this guy talk, which is not really done a lot in the world of animation. I feel like it doesn\u2019t necessarily play up all of our strengths, and I think to handicap ourselves in that way felt like a good challenge.I think it\u2019s also really a testament to Will Arnett as an actor that he can sustain the episode the way he does. I will say it\u2019s the best acting of his entire career. He might not agree with that; people who have worked on other shows might not agree with that. But he really is incredible on this episode. I\u2019m so proud that I got to write it for him.That monologue is a continuation of how the show examines the cyclical effects of trauma, especially within families: The idea that hurt people will hurt people. Right. I think that also relates, again, to forgiveness. A big part of BoJack\u2019s relationship with his mother is about this question of, what can you forgive? And can you forgive when no apology is offered? You\u2019re not forgiving for her sake, you\u2019re forgiving for your own sake. Is that a thing worth doing? And how can you find a way to do that?Are you hopeful that change within the industry can really happen on a grand scale, outside of Weinstein? Yes. We need to be more rigorous. The events that happen at the end of this season don\u2019t happen a lot, but it does happen. You do hear reports of abusive things happening on sets too often, in ways that if that happened in a corporate boardroom, forget about it. That guy\u2019s fired, everyone knows about it. That stuff doesn\u2019t fly.As far as taking care of its workers, Hollywood is behind the times, actually. We\u2019ve allowed ourselves some wiggle room because we\u2019re artists, but I think we can have strict rules. Absolutely we should be held to the same standard that most people in most professions are. I think there are moves to make that happen, and I am hopeful that they will.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Netflix Executives Who Bent Comedy to Their Will", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyLOS ANGELES \u2014 To its competitors, the Netflix takeover of comedy must have seemed nasty, brutish and quick.In only a few years, the streaming giant has pushed aside HBO as the home of prestige stand-up and made Comedy Central seem like Comedy Marginal. By signing up A-listers (Dave Chappelle, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock), turning rising talent into stars (Ali Wong and Hannah Gadsby) and radically expanding the volume of new content, Netflix has transformed the stand-up special into the bustling center of popular culture. How did it do it?The cynical explanation, commonly heard in comedy circles, is that the service just outspent everyone else. But in rare, extensive interviews that explored that criticism as well as a controversy over pay equity, Lisa Nishimura, Netflix\u2019s vice president of original documentary and comedy programming, and Robbie Praw, its director of original stand-up comedy, the most powerful gatekeepers in stand-up, tell a different story, one in which iconoclasm, new metrics and abiding faith in the algorithm disrupt the stale conventions of an industry.Over dinner at an Italian restaurant last month, Ms. Nishimura, 47, projected casual charisma in jeans and glasses, shifting between comedy nerd chatter and Silicon Valley-speak. Mr. Praw, 37, warm but more cautious, sat next to her, listening in awe as she explained perhaps her greatest coup, persuading Mr. Chappelle to return to a national platform. She lingered on the image of seeing him after the Bafta Awards one year in London when a security guard who didn\u2019t recognize him stopped him from entering a party. She introduced herself: \u201cWe\u2019re heading to another party. Wanna go?\u201dHe did, and years later, he joined her again, not only agreeing to release his first standup special in 13 years on Netflix, but also following that with three more in 2017. Bringing this reclusive star to Netflix solidified its dominant reputation. His pay for the package of shows was widely reported as $60 million. Netflix does not confirm salaries, but, asked how she determined what to offer him, Ms. Nishimura responded: \u201cThe way we do everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cWe go into the data.\u201dThe same impulse was evident over a decade earlier when Ms. Nishimura started working for Netflix, buying content of all kinds from companies other than major studios. After seeing how specials first shown on cable performed on Netflix, she developed a hunch that the common wisdom about the stand-up special \u2014 that it had a limited audience \u2014 was entirely wrong.It was a fairly niche genre then; months went by without a major release. But when you made specials readily available, Ms. Nishimura noticed there was an enthusiastic untapped market. \u201cWe started to hear from artist and managers that they were feeling something almost instantly,\u201d Ms. Nishimura said.When Netflix started developing original content, Ms. Nishimura\u2019s experience helped make the case to bet big on comedy. Now, 50 percent of its 130 million subscribers have watched a special in the last year, and a third of those viewers have watched three such shows.Netflix currently releases about a special every week, and the frequency increased dramatically in fall 2016, not long after Ms. Nishimura brought on Mr. Praw, a comedy obsessive who was vice president at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal and who, at Netflix, leads four employees constantly scouting new work. Their strategy is rooted in the belief that Netflix doesn\u2019t need to choose between quality and quantity, that the eternal showbiz question of whether to go for mass or prestige is a false choice.They can do both, their argument goes, because they not only have more data on what the audience wants \u2014 and, with their algorithm\u2019s help, are better able to personalize the experience \u2014 but also their system of analyzing taste is more refined than that of others in the industry.Unlike traditional media outlets, Netflix does not fixate on categories of age, gender or race. \u201cWe don\u2019t pull demographic information because you would be in danger of imparting biases of what a 75-year-old Japanese grandmother would want to watch versus a 14-year-old kid from Ohio,\u201d Ms. Nishimura said. \u201cBut there are moments in time when they are in the exact same taste cluster. We see it all the time.\u201dThe Netflix system has more than 2,000 \u201ctaste clusters\u201d that measure content by tone, timbre and feeling to predict what you will want to see when you log onto the site. Netflix places more emphasis on whether a show is uplifting, somber or redemptive than on genre or who the director is. But what do these new metrics say about comedy that the rest of us cannot see?Netflix is famously tight-lipped about data. It won\u2019t release audience information to the news media or comics, who would love to know who watches their specials to plan tours.But the two executives will discuss some details. Mr. Praw said one of the many misconceptions he brought to Netflix was that there would be no overlap between fans of, say, Gabriel Iglesias\u2019s broad comedy and Maria Bamford\u2019s more cerebral standup. \u201cWhat we discovered is that for some people that\u2019s the case,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for others, that assumption is wrong.\u201dMs. Nishimura added that there was also a surprising overlap between viewers interested in Ms. Gadsby and \u201cWild Wild Country,\u201d the documentary series about a cult leader. They are both popular, she said, among those drawn to explorations of the \u201chuman condition, what motivates people under pressure.\u201dNetflix may try to transcend the old categories, but now that it\u2019s the biggest and most influential stand-up platform, it\u2019s become a subject of intense scrutiny about issues of representation and pay equity.Netflix had not produced any new hourlong stand-up shows by black women in 2017 or 2018 \u2014 although several have appeared in the service\u2019s half-hour and 15-minute collections. When asked if Netflix has a responsibility to do better, Mr. Praw said: \u201cI think we have a responsibility, but it\u2019s also what our members want.\u201dThe next day, Mr. Praw emailed to clarify his comments and in a follow-up conversation conceded that programming so few black women has been a failure. Since our discussion, Netflix has announced that Tiffany Haddish and Ms. Sykes will release specials through the service next year.In comedy circles, the most common criticism of Netflix is that in releasing so many specials, it\u2019s oversaturating the market, making it more difficult for comics who aren\u2019t superstars to break out. But Mr. Praw rejects that argument. \u201cWe would never look at musicians and say let\u2019s put out 10 albums this year,\u201d Mr. Praw responded.When asked if he\u2019s worried about running out of A-list stars, Mr. Praw pointed to forthcoming specials by Ellen DeGeneres and Adam Sandler and remaining deals with Mr. Rock and Mr. Seinfeld.Players like Disney and Apple are entering the streaming market. But it\u2019s unclear if these outlets will spend tens of millions of dollars on stand-up. Asked if Netflix can continue to offer huge sums, Ms. Nishimura replied, \u201cIf we continue to grow the audience, we\u2019re O.K.\u201dThis may be partly why Netflix is putting a premium on the global market, recently hiring an Amsterdam-based executive to recruit international comics. Next year, the service will release 47 half-hour specials in seven different languages on the same day.\u201cWhen you look around the world, there\u2019s stand-up markets all over the place where there weren\u2019t 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Praw said. \u201cNow there\u2019s clubs in Korea.\u201dIn this new venture, they may upend another bit of common wisdom \u2014 that comedy has trouble crossing borders. It wasn\u2019t long ago when it seemed ridiculous that a DVD rental company would dominate American stand-up. The idea that it would take over the world hardly seems far-fetched.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Comcast Outbids Fox for Control of British Broadcaster Sky", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Comcast emerged as the victor for the British broadcaster Sky on Saturday, beating 21st Century Fox in a monthslong battle whose outcome promises to reshape the media landscape.The final battle for control of Sky, a pay-television company whose reach extends across Europe, came down to an unusual one-day, three-round auction overseen by Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel. At the end, Comcast bid \u00a317.28 per Sky share, while Fox had bid \u00a315.67 a share.Comcast and its chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, have succeeded in an international foray into empire building, gaining a big European outpost. Sky also represents yet another source of content that could prove valuable as traditional media and telecommunications companies vie against Netflix. While Comcast already owns NBCUniversal, more original shows and sports programming rights could help retain existing subscribers and draw new ones.\u201cThis is a great day for Comcast,\u201d Mr. Roberts said in a statement. \u201cThis acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally.\u201dMartin Gilbert, the chairman of the Sky board committee that oversaw takeover bids for the company, said in a statement that Comcast\u2019s offer was \u201can excellent outcome\u201d for shareholders and recommended that they accept the bid.While Comcast emerged as the definitive winner of the auction, one unresolved question is whether Fox and its soon-to-be owner, Disney, would sell the 39 percent stake it already owns in Sky to its rival. Analysts have speculated that Fox and Disney would be willing to trade that holding in return for Comcast\u2019s roughly 30 percent stake in Hulu, the American streaming service. (Such a deal would give Disney near total control of that business.)It is also unclear whether Mr. Roberts\u2019s costly pursuit will sit well with his own shareholders. Comcast\u2019s winning bid is nearly 61 percent above Fox\u2019s initial bid of about $23 billion in late 2016.Mr. Murdoch founded Sky in the 1990s and it has since become one of Europe\u2019s top television and broadband companies. Both bidders had coveted Sky\u2019s international reach \u2014 it has about 23 million customers in five European countries \u2014 and its mix of original content and valuable sports broadcasting rights like English Premier League soccer.That overseas footprint would give Comcast a way to diversify away from the American market, where cord-cutting has slowed the growth of its traditional broadband and pay-TV businesses.Sky has also been developing a video-streaming platform known as Q, which Mr. Roberts has praised as impressive.Rarely has a multibillion-dollar takeover battle played out in such dramatic fashion, with a government-supervised auction taking place over a weekend. But the battle for control of Sky has been full of drama for nearly two years.Fox\u2019s 2016 offer for Sky was met with skepticism by British lawmakers and regulators, who feared giving the family too much control over Britain\u2019s media market. Mr. Murdoch already controls news outlets like The Sun and The Times of London, and skeptics worried that full control of Sky\u2019s in-house news arm would give him too much power.Ultimately, Fox was allowed to bid for Sky by the British government.Comcast, however, did not walk away from Sky. Instead, it and Fox continued to vie for dominance, leading the Takeover Panel to announce the unusual auction that took place on Saturday.Edmund Lee contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

The show also packages suicide as some beautiful mystery to be examined, one last puzzle to bring us all together \u2014 classic Jon, he always knew how to get us on the same page.Jon\u2019s friend Rome (Romany Malco) is also suicidal, and is in fact about to kill himself, too, when he finds out about Jon\u2019s death. But the show approaches Rome\u2019s depression and despair as quirky traits rather than devastating, life-threatening conditions that require immediate and persistent attention.There\u2019s Jon, there\u2019s Rome, and then there\u2019s Eddie (David Giuntoli), the mopey guitar teacher, and Gary (James Roday), the jerky, glib cancer survivor. Eddie hates his wife Katherine (Grace Park) because, um, she\u2019s a lawyer? Gary likes to scam on lots of women and meets Maggie (Allison Miller) at a cancer support group, and somehow she immediately becomes one of the gang, befriending Rome\u2019s wife Regina (Christina Marie Moses) and Jon\u2019s widow Delilah (Stephanie Szostak). Maggie is instantly there for lots of painful and intimate moments, even though she and Delilah are literal strangers.It\u2019s odd nonsense, one of many signs that this show that claims to be about friendship doesn\u2019t have clear ideas about what friendship is or means. (It\u2019s \u201ca million little things,\u201d see.) The yearslong bond these men formed through shared experience and hardships and triumphs is mostly identical to the bond these two women formed when one of them came along as a plus-one to the other one\u2019s husband\u2019s funeral. Yesterday.In the three episodes made available to critics, \u201cMillion\u201d dabbles in \u201cThis Is Us\u201d\u2013style schmaltz; in \u201cthirtysomething\u201d\u2013style \u201clet\u2019s all talk about how being married is boring sometimes but also good\u201d; and in \u201cDamages\u201d\u2013style ominous computer clacking indicating business scandals might be afoot. It\u2019s also very reminiscent of the Netflix teen drama \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d in that it deifies the character who kills himself and sets up the idea that they\u2019ve left an elaborate trail of bread crumbs to explain their suicide, and that everyone will be so sorry once they finally understand how wrong they\u2019ve been.It\u2019s fine for a show to be emotionally manipulative \u2014 we know what we\u2019re getting, we\u2019re along for the ride. A teen girl plays guitar and sings a Joni Mitchell song at her father\u2019s funeral? Sure, I cried; I\u2019m not an animal. Weepy is good, in its way.Weepy scenes aren\u2019t a whole show, though. \u201cA Million Little Things\u201d never finds its way to an authentic moment. It\u2019s set in Boston but never feels like Boston whatsoever. It confuses soundtrack for story. By all available evidence and for multiple reasons, if not quite a million, these friends would be better off without each other.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "48 Years Later, Orson Welles\u2019s Last Film Makes Its Debut", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTELLURIDE, Colo. \u2014 Orson Welles was on the line. \u201cWhat are you doing Thursday?\u201d he asked.It was 1970, and the \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d director had called Peter Bogdanovich to ask him to appear in his latest film, \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind.\u201d Yes, he knew that Mr. Bogdanovich was stretched thin. Just drop by the set on Thursday, Welles insisted. The whole movie was only going to take a few weeks to shoot \u2014 tops.Forty-eight years later, \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind\u201d has finally arrived. It was shown for the first time in North America on Saturday at the Telluride Film Festival, where two new documentaries about the herculean efforts to finish the film were also screened. \u201cIt\u2019s sad because Orson\u2019s not here to see it,\u201d Mr. Bogdanovich, 79, said from the stage of the Palm Theater here. \u201cOr maybe he is.\u201dNo lesser a force than Frank Marshall, one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood, had been leading the salvage effort. Mr. Marshall, 71, made his name by making the impossible possible \u2014 shutting down the Las Vegas Strip to shoot \u201cJason Bourne,\u201d staying calm the time Steven Spielberg asked him to find 10,000 additional snakes for a scene in \u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark,\u201d figuring out how Clint Eastwood could crash a jetliner for \u201cSully.\u201d If he couldn\u2019t pull the film over the finish line, who could?\u201cNo one really knew if we had enough material to put together a movie that actually made any sense,\u201d Mr. Marshall said on Saturday.The producer Filip Jan Rymsza loading 100 hours of footage of \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind,\u201d long stored in a Paris warehouse. From that, a team tried to craft the film Welles envisioned.The result is a politically incorrect fever dream that involves dwarf sidekicks, Ms. Kodar in \u201credface\u201d as a Native American woman, at least one orgy, a drive-in theater, \u201970s-era views of women (disposable) and inclusion (nonexistent), the mutilation of a doll, a car crash, mannequins, an ice cube, lanterns, rifles and a giant phallus built with chicken wire and perched on a sand dune, among other imagery.\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to seeing this film since I was 12 years old,\u201d said Randy Haberkamp, 61, the academy\u2019s managing director of preservation and foundation programs. Mr. Haberkamp said that, as a boy in Ohio, he had seen a CBS special on Welles that mentioned \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind.\u201d \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018I can\u2019t wait until it comes out,\u2019 \u201d he said.Afterward, however, the atmosphere was notably somber. Mr. Marshall, who was the film\u2019s original production manager, and Mr. Bogdanovich returned to the stage, along with the film scholar Joseph McBride, who appears in \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind\u201d as a gauche young critic. For a minute, it seemed as if emptiness had suddenly hit them: Now what? Their 48-year battle to get the film finished and seen was over.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of bittersweet,\u201d Mr. Marshall said.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad movie, I think,\u201d Mr. Bogdanovich said haltingly. \u201cNot only Orson\u2019s last movie. But it\u2019s sort of like the end of everything. It comes across to me like the end of the world.\u201dNot present at the Telluride screening: Filip Jan Rymsza, a European producer who gave \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind\u201d a hard push in 2014 by helping to win over two mercurial rights holders: Beatrice Welles, the filmmaker\u2019s daughter and sole heir; and Ms. Kodar, Welles\u2019s longtime companion. Mr. Rymsza was anchoring the Venice premiere, where he read statements from Ms. Welles and Ms. Kodar, both of whom cited poor health for not attending the Venice or Telluride screenings.Ms. Welles also heaped praise on the salvage squad, adding, \u201cIs this Orson Welles\u2019s goodbye? Impossible! He left behind far too much. I hope with all my heart that this picture will be able to reopen people\u2019s eyes and souls to his massive talent.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How an Egotistic Basketball Star Grounds \u2018American Vandal\u2019 Season 2", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMinor spoilers for \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d Season 2 follow.The nature of the offense is the hook \u2014 the drawing of penises on faculty cars in Season 1; a laxative contamination of the school cafeteria\u2019s lemonade by a mysterious figure identified only as \u201cThe Turd Burglar\u201d in Season 2. But the astute depiction of modern-day teenage culture and pitch-perfect ensemble cast moves \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d beyond the clever conceit and into the realm of masterful comedy. And if the new season has a breakout character, it\u2019s DeMarcus Tillman (an excellent Melvin Gregg), a star basketball player at St. Bernardine High and one of the prime suspects in the case.When he makes his grand entrance in Episode 3 (after bit appearances in the previous episodes) DeMarcus is an instantly recognizable figure: As a student, he is flagrantly mediocre, but as an athlete, he is an academic institution\u2019s dream \u2014 an \u201call-around player,\u201d as his coach describes him, who can \u201ccross like Kyrie, then cut back like Curry,\u201d according to DeMarcus\u2019s father. (More important, his star power helps bring money into the school.) Nicknamed \u201cMr. Untouchable,\u201d he has a signature celebratory move in which he \u201cplays\u201d the violin \u2014 \u201cfor his haters\u201d\u2014 every time he scores on the court. (\u201cFor all the sad songs you singin\u2019, I got this for you right here.\u201d) Take the massive egos of Kanye West or Kobe Bryant, add some of the arrogant cluelessness of Ryan Lochte, and you\u2019ve got a huge part of what makes DeMarcus DeMarcus.What sets him apart from those larger-than-life narcissists, however, and thus makes DeMarcus such an utter delight to watch, is the pure goofball charm Mr. Gregg exudes, calling to mind Will Smith as the Fresh Prince. Tall and good-looking, he commands attention wherever he goes. DeMarcus is friendly with everyone at this tony Catholic high school in Bellevue, Wash.; as he strolls through the hallways, he gives high-fives and trades handshakes specially designed for each classmate. (\u201cEvery handshake is like a McNugget,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, completely unique.\u201d)He\u2019s candid to a fault, a trait that clashes deliciously with his tendency to condescend to everyone around him, especially his teammates. \u201cI look down at people with love,\u201d he reveals, matter-of-factly. DeMarcus is like the student who is constantly disrupting the class to say something wildly inappropriate, and is admonished by the teacher \u2014 who is simultaneously trying to stifle a laugh. You can\u2019t help but be drawn to him.The show\u2019s creators, Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault, and its showrunner, Dan Lagana, use the character to interrogate a crossroads of social issues: class, race, the corrosive nature of the sports industrial complex within academic institutions. In one clever subplot, the wannabe-detectives Sam and Peter turn to DeMarcus\u2019s texts to try to suss out his guilt or innocence; as they compare his language to that of the Turd Burglar\u2019s cryptic messages on social media, the subject turns to the matters of code switching. DeMarcus unashamedly shifts his slang when around his mostly white classmates at St. Bernardine versus his friends back home in Rainier Beach, a less affluent and less white town 40 minutes away. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d one of those \u201ccity friends,\u201d as Peter describes them, tells the filmmakers resignedly. \u201cWe all gotta do it.\u201dThis flippant response is emblematic of how \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d presents these issues \u2014 instead of signposting the complicated, often icky politics that typically underscore the narrative of a black athlete at a predominantly white school in real life, they are seamlessly embedded in the storytelling. Sometimes they are brought right to the surface, as with the code switching comment, but more often it\u2019s subtle.In a later episode, DeMarcus reveals that underneath his happy-go-lucky exterior is a teenager who finds his success \u201calienating.\u201d Mr. Gregg plays this moment of self-reflection just as confidently as he does DeMarcus\u2019s boastful swagger. He pinpoints the pressures of being an athlete, but one can also infer that his blackness plays a part in it, too. \u201cAll of those people, they might act like they love me, and sometimes I feel like they do,\u201d he tells Peter and Sam, as images of DeMarcus interacting with his mostly white classmates, appear on the screen. \u201cIt just don\u2019t feel real. It don\u2019t feel genuine.\u201dThe character of DeMarcus does feel real, and genuine. Not unlike Dylan Maxwell (Jimmy Tatro), the dimwitted prankster at the center of Season 1\u2019s mystery, or \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d itself, he ultimately turns out to contain a bit more substance than initially meets the eye. That\u2019s what elevates him above a one-dimensional, one-trick source of comic relief \u2014 DeMarcus is absurd, but grounded; conceited, thanks to his singular abilities, yet just as desperate for authentic human connection as the rest of us.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Traded City Life to Live in a Small Town. It Wasn\u2019t Easy. ", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EditGrowing up in a small town was one thing. What would it be like in our twenties?Running to catch the bus. Walking to the pharmacy. Walking anywhere. Even the annoying parts of city living were somehow romantic. My wife, son and I were living in Hyde Park on Chicago\u2019s South Side. A famous Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece was our neighbor on one side, the Chicago home of Muhammad Ali our neighbor on the other, and President Obama\u2019s house on yet another. We lived in a place full of life, culture, history and people. We loved it. Then we moved.My wife and I are both from small towns in the rural Midwest, but neither of us had imagined ever returning to one. We had become fully-converted urbanites: we loved the restaurants, the used book stores, the sidewalks, the public transit, the architecture, the culture. Now we were leaving all that behind and moving just one county over from where we grew up.It was hard to know what to expect. Would we make friends? Did anyone our age even live there? Would they have good coffee? I was starting a new job as the lead pastor of a small Baptist church. Whether or not we could learn how to connect to people in the community would be a matter of sink or swim.Hillsboro is about five hours from Chicago, but it felt like another world. Our new neighbors were a Casey\u2019s convenience store and gas station, a local lumber and home improvement store, and a Dairy Queen. The air smelled of corn, the sidewalks were inconsistent and unwalkable, the sky was clear and open.There was nowhere to hang out. The third spaces we were used to like coffee shops just didn\u2019t exist. When we met interesting people, we had to go out of our way to see them again and turn those connections into friendships. We started asking couples over for dinner earlier than we ever would have in the city. Sometimes it felt awkward, but we got used to it. We had a lot more time to fill, so we dove into volunteering. By getting connected with local community-development work, we were put in touch with all kinds of people we wouldn\u2019t have met otherwise. Our weekends became focused on local events and county fairs, rather than checking out new restaurants or going to museums.We\u2019ve learned to love this place. There\u2019s something romantic about small town life, too. The annual Christmas festival in the square. The garden we cultivated in our backyard. The conversations over campfires with the starry sky above. Investing our time and love into the community has made us become a part of it. We may still feel different, but I think we\u2019re beginning to blend in.Nicole Pitchford, a recent graduate from Wayne State University, sent us a problem to figure out this week:Joe Jurado I try to learn new things, set goals and develop hobbies. Right now I\u2019m learning Spanish. Explore your city! I used to think I lived in a pretty boring place but I\u2019ve found a rather vibrant arts community and a few interesting museums. Nushrat RahmanI recently graduated from Wayne State University as well (small world!). It was a strange transition from always being in school mode to now being able to turn off my work brain once I get home. The result, like you said, is time left behind. Some good advice I once got was to not always feel pressured to fill up time. In my experience, sometimes sitting and doing nothing is productive in the sense that it gives your body a chance to recuperate, to sit with inactivity and adjust to just being off. It's hard for me to tune out but I'm leaning into the practice more and more every day, by meditating, and spending time with family.Ebony MirandaI initially had this same anxiety when I graduated college. I started working 40 hours a week and then realized I had all of this empty space in my schedule. As time passed I started getting involved in activities I didn\u2019t have time for while in school, like teaching, community organizing, and going to more shows (and maybe finally learning how to play D&D).

The owner and chef, Gazala Halavi, is Druze, a sect with communities in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. She brings one of the broadest arrays of the food of the region you\u2019re likely to find in a New York restaurant: cold and hot mezze, filled pies, salads, soups, sandwiches and plates of lamb shanks, kebabs and roasted cauliflower and meatballs. Sweets include the inevitable baklava.Untamed Sandwiches, with locations in Midtown Manhattan and in Dumbo, Brooklyn, has brought its specialty, braised meats, to Randalls Island. Protein shakes and smoothies have been added to the menu, as has the Johnny Mac sandwich, layered with poached chicken breast, black bean hummus, greens and condiments. A dollar of the $11 price goes to John McEnroe\u2019s Johnny Mac Tennis Project, which gives city children the opportunity to play tennis.At this new addition to the Dream Downtown, all-day dining, California style, is highlighted. Burritos, cottage cheese toast, salads with add-ins, and more substantial plates, are offered, as well as soft serve and lattes on tap. (Wednesday)Mr. Offenbach, who grew up in Northport, N.Y., on Long Island, and worked for several years at Contra and Wildair, is now the chef de cuisine at Charlie Bird.Anne Saxelby, whose tiny cheese stall was a fixture in the original Essex Street Market for 12 years, has decided that she will not be part of the expanded new market that is soon to open across the street. She cited declining sales and other financial pressures as the reason. Saxelby Cheesemongers will continue to run a stand in the Chelsea Local section of Chelsea Market.The bistro-style Austrian-German restaurant that the chef Kurt Gutenbrunner opened 13 years ago will close after service on Sunday, which will be an Oktoberfest party starting at 11 a.m.An earlier version of this article misspelled part of the name of the restaurant where Jonas Offenbach is now chef de cuisine. It is Charlie Bird, not Charley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Trump\u2019s Trade War Finally Hits Consumers", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA refresher on why this is happening: The tariffs aim to pressure China into changing longstanding trade practices that Mr. Trump says hurt the U.S. The administration says China could win relief by giving U.S. companies more access to its markets, among other things.What is clear is that U.S. consumers will start to bear the cost of American protectionism.In approving the deal, the Justice Department decided that combining an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager wouldn\u2019t reduce competition. It appears to be another sign that vertical mergers, where two companies in different industries combine, are acceptable to the Trump administration. (Its effort to block AT&T from buying Time Warner increasingly looks like a political anomaly.)The move augurs well for CVS\u2019s bid to acquire the insurer Aetna \u2014 and for many more potential tie-ups. With Amazon looming over the sector, other companies may be tempted to take the merger plunge.Coke would be a different player. The company is openly pushing into new markets to offset slowing soda sales. (See: its $5.1 billion deal for Costa.) The company says it\u2019s watching the growth in cannabis-infused drinks for now, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine buzz-inducing Coke products hitting store shelves.In a note to clients, the analyst, Mark May, said that breaking up the company could yield two successful businesses: a retail company with an enterprise value of $400 billion and a cloud-computing business worth $600 billion. It would also help Amazon avoid antitrust scrutiny at a time when President Trump appears to be focused on the company.So far, investors appear uneasy with the idea. Amazon shares fell 3 percent after the report was published.The sting isn\u2019t necessarily that Lucid secured funding from the Saudis when Elon Musk couldn\u2019t (though that has to hurt a little). It\u2019s that Tesla, already grappling with competition from traditional carmakers like General Motors and Daimler, must now contend with a well-funded upstart that wants to grab the luxury end of market.Tesla investors can only hope that Mr. Musk, who has seemed distracted lately, can focus on beating the competition.The timing of the trip is uncertain: Elon Musk, SpaceX\u2019s C.E.O., said that the so-called B.F.R. spacecraft would not be ready until 2023 at the earliest.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Maezawa would talk about the cost. But Mr. Musk did say that developing the rocket would cost $2 billion to $10 billion, and that Mr. Maezawa\u2019s ticket was a significant investment in the project.First: \u201cSo you are a charity?\u201d This view suggests that women need help from altruistic donors to get their businesses going. Second: \u201cAh! You are a social impact fund!\u201d This response insinuates that women cannot possibly make you rich, so there needs to be a social mission attached to give an investor something virtuous to talk about at dinner parties. Third: \u201cGreat, but why would you limit yourself?\u201d This may seem like a fair comment, but if you asked me about my deal flow I would tell you that I reviewed more than 100 opportunities in six months and was blown away by the quality of applications.In fact, she writes, she wants to make money, and the firm\u2019s approach allows her to identify opportunities that \u201care largely overlooked \u2014 and therefore attractive.\u201dDealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

Both shows have stories about transracial adoption and sibling bonds, a father who made mistakes, a mom who sacrificed to keep things afloat, a needlessly mysterious death, flashbacks to happier times and adult children who have failed to fully hatch. But \u201cSorry\u201d has better dialogue and character development, even in half-hour episodes.This new children\u2019s cartoon series, based on the Hildafolk graphic novels by Luke Pearson, is smart and darling and visually distinctive. Hilda is a young girl who likes wilderness adventures, so she is none too thrilled when her mom insists that they move from their home in the forest into the town of Trolberg. Fortunately for Hilda, additional adventures await. If you like plucky and articulate heroines, sepia-seeped aesthetics and folklore, try this.Anthony Bourdain was in the middle of filming Season 12 of this CNN travel and food series when he killed himself, in June. This, of course, hangs like a cloud over these new episodes, including this season premiere set in Kenya, but Mr. Bourdain\u2019s eloquence and spirit of adventure still shine through. \u201cWho gets to tell the stories?\u201d he asks in this episode\u2019s closing narration. \u201cThis is a question asked often.

{"Headline": "Fox, Acting on Behalf of Disney, Sells Its Stake in Sky to Comcast", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTwenty-First Century Fox agreed to sell its 39 percent stake in the British broadcaster Sky to Comcast on Wednesday in a deal worth $15 billion, ending Rupert Murdoch\u2019s yearslong ambition to take full ownership of the satellite service he helped found three decades ago.\u201cWe are proud of the role our company has played in building Sky, and of the outstanding value we have delivered for shareholders of 21CF and Sky, and customers across Europe,\u201d Fox said in a statement congratulating Comcast.The decision to sell Fox\u2019s stake in Sky rested largely with Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, who could have put pressure on Mr. Roberts had he refused to tender the shares. Comcast needs more than 50 percent of Sky\u2019s equity to complete its offer.Disney had aggressively pursued Sky, with Mr. Iger calling the British company a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the Murdoch empire and describing its direct relationship with tens of millions of customers in Europe as a way to speed the introduction of Disney-branded streaming services. Disney also wanted to keep Sky out of the hands of one of its biggest competitors.With the sale of the Sky stake, along with the mandated divestitures of 22 regional sports networks owned by Fox, Disney will receive roughly $30 billion to pay down debt involved with its $71.3 billion purchase of Fox and invest in its subscription streaming efforts. Disney said on Wednesday that it would \u201cexpand\u201d its streaming plans, which include the ESPN+ sports service and a Disney-branded competitor to Netflix that will roll out next year.Disney\u2019s agreement to sell its Sky stake raises the possibility that Comcast may be willing to make a separate deal involving the streaming service Hulu. Disney is poised to own about 60 percent of that service after it closes the deal for Fox, but Comcast would remain a minority shareholder with 30 percent. Hulu has over 20 million subscribers and is a key part of Mr. Iger\u2019s strategy to sell Disney\u2019s shows and films directly to consumers. Disney intends to increase spending on content at Hulu and introduce the service overseas.But British takeover laws forbid that any deal involving Hulu being contingent on a tit-for-tat maneuver involving Sky. So a transaction for Hulu would have to be made independently.In Sky, Comcast gets one of Europe\u2019s largest media companies, with nearly 23 million customers across five countries, including Britain, Germany and Italy. For British viewers used to living in a media universe long dominated by the Murdoch family, the potential Comcast takeover signals a notable shift in ownership.The Murdochs have been fighting for control of Sky for the better part of a decade. Mr. Murdoch, 87, co-founded the satellite TV company in 1989 to compete with the British Broadcasting Corporation. Sky, which has 31,000 employees and generated about $17 billion in revenue last year, ranks as one of the most popular TV brands in Europe. It creates original shows, runs an influential news channel and has exclusive partnerships in Europe with HBO, Showtime and Warner Bros.Comcast shares fell 6 percent on Monday, the first day of trading after the Sky auction results were announced, as analysts criticized Comcast for what one called \u201cgrossly overpaying.\u201d Disney shares rose 2 percent.\u201cRather than pay such a premium, Disney can now get paid that premium,\u201d Todd Juenger, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a research report. \u201cThis weekend\u2019s outcome of the bidding war for Sky was, in our view, the best possible result for Disney.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Sean Penn Has Space Suit, May Travel in \u2018The First\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey go into space weighed down with the trite stuff.Personal lives are part of most space-travel stories, but when done right \u2014 as in Philip Kaufman\u2019s \u201cRight Stuff,\u201d the genre\u2019s apogee \u2014 the back stories illuminate what makes the astronauts tick, the physical and psychological capabilities that suit them for the job. \u201cThe First\u201d focuses on what threatens to keep the astronauts grounded.And the situations Mr. Willimon and his writing staff have come up with are also pretty earthbound. One crew member struggles with putting her mother in assisted living. One feels she\u2019s been sidelined because she\u2019s female, black and queer. (The show puts most of its social-justice eggs in one basket.) Spouses are, in general, frightened, morose and overwhelmed. Apparently it doesn\u2019t occur to anyone to at least feign excitement for a loved one who has the chance to go to Mars.Most lengthily examined, but no more original, is the plight of the mission commander, Tom Hagerty (Mr. Penn, starring in a series for the first time). A widower for reasons that take a while to come clear, he has a strained relationship with his daughter (Anna Jacoby-Heron of MTV\u2019s \u201cFinding Carter\u201d), and a lot of time is spent on their intertwined journeys \u2014 his toward space (and therefore even further away from her), hers toward sobriety and emotional stability.White male gloom is a perpetual growth area in prestige television, with Benedict Cumberbatch (\u201cPatrick Melrose\u201d), Bill Hader (\u201cBarry\u201d), Ed Harris (\u201cWestworld\u201d), Bob Odenkirk (\u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d) and Matthew Rhys (\u201cThe Americans\u201d) riding it to current or recent Emmy nominations. Mr. Penn has plenty of experience at it from his film career, and his performance here is astronaut-like: technically flawless, but also buttoned down and a little robotic.The character\u2019s insubstantiality comes clear when the fragile peace between Hagerty and his daughter breaks down, and he lashes out; even Mr. Penn, stuck playing sorrowful nobility in scene after scene, can\u2019t make the sudden violence and extreme emotion believable. (Mr. Penn gets exactly one quirky, funny moment in the eight episodes, when a nervous flyer says she hates landings and a bemused Hagerty murmurs, \u201cIt\u2019s just the flaps.\u201d)Other actors fare better. Natascha McElhone finds graceful notes in the obsessive drive of Hagerty\u2019s boss, the founder of the private rocket company that has contracted with NASA for the Mars mission, and LisaGay Hamilton is good as Hagerty\u2019s loyal but frustrated second-in-command. Keiko Agena and Oded Fehr, as key scientists, liven things up whenever they get to discuss the actual mechanics of the trip.There\u2019s also fun to be had from the near-future setting, where nearly everything is voice controlled and real strides have been made in virtual reality. On the few occasions when spaceflight is depicted, it\u2019s visually impressive.No one can really rescue the show from Mr. Willimon\u2019s tendencies, though. The arch sentimentality can get Capraesque, as when Hagerty tells a hostile Senate committee that he\u2019s decided not to testify, and instead carries the day by showing a bereaved family a spacewalk video. Worse are the flares of pretentiousness, like an unidentified, unexplained narrator who growls platitudes (\u201cThe stars and the dirt, they\u2019re the same dust\u201d) while laboriously rehabbing an ancient pay phone. That\u2019s when you know that \u201cThe First\u201d probably isn\u2019t going to achieve escape velocity.Advertisement"}

Russia\u2019s plot to subvert an election, India\u2019s new protections for Muslim women, a panda\u2019s mating call. Here\u2019s what you need to know:Over the past two years, the world has tried to absorb the details of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.But the narrative is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics._____\u2022 Mountaintop diplomacy in the Koreas. Mr. Moon\u2019s statement could put the Trump administration in a bind. Analysts fear that such a declaration would give Kim Jong-un reason to demand the U.S. withdraw its 28,500 troops from the South while North Korea is still a nuclear-armed state.At the end of their three-day summit meeting in Pyongyang, Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim climbed to the peak of Baekdusan, an active volcano revered by the Korean people. The hike, pictured above, symbolized the two leaders\u2019 commitment to normalizing relations._____The option was not available for Muslim women, who needed permission from their husband for a divorce.Last year, the Supreme Court struck down the practice, known as triple talaq, which is widely frowned upon around the world.Now, it is a criminal offense punishable by a fine or a jail sentence._____Beijing has created at least 3,200 acres (almost 13 square kilometers) of new land in the area since 2015, mostly for military bases.\u201cChina is now capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war with the U.S.,\u201d said one U.S. admiral.And our reporter found on her flight that Beijing was willing to aggressively challenge the U.S., even in international airspace._____That\u2019s a common Afghan saying that speaks to the sport\u2019s special place in the country\u2019s heart.And it was cruelly tested after an Islamic State bomber attacked a wrestling club in Kabul, killing as many as 30 people and injuring dozens more._____Tips for a more fulfilling life.But there\u2019s a less colorful way in which he helped change music: the black-and-white \u201cParental Advisory\u201d labels on albums containing explicit lyrics.In the end, record labels agreed to add \u201cParental Advisory\u201d stickers to albums, a compromise that became infamous enough to match the neon electric swagger of the man who inspired them._____Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Last Rites for the Village Voice, a Bohemian Who Stayed On Too Long", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe death of the storied alternative weekly isn\u2019t just the end of a newspaper. It\u2019s the end of New York as the lodestar for new and uncomfortable ideas. Ms. Romano is a former columnist for The Village Voice and is working on a book about it.The death last week of The Village Voice, the storied alt-weekly, was in some ways to be expected. When its latest owner, Peter D. Barbey, who bought it in 2015 to restore it to its early glory, stopped print publication almost a year ago, it seemed that it would be only a matter of time before its online presence ceased as well. The Voice didn\u2019t appear to have a strong sense of identity anymore, in part because the New York that it covered \u2014 downtown, the underground, bohemia and its ephemera \u2014 didn\u2019t exist anymore, neither in a physical sense nor as a state of mind. SoHo, once the stomping ground of artists and punk rockers, is a high-end shopping mall. CBGB, which The Voice covered religiously when Blondie and Television were at their apex, has been turned into a John Varvatos store and lives on as a T-shirt. The East Village is \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it is anymore. At least Spike Lee is still in Brooklyn.The death of The Voice isn\u2019t just about the end of a newspaper. To some of us at least, it\u2019s about the end of New York as a cultural and political center, as the place that the world turned to for art, for music, for leadership in new and uncomfortable ideas, often perceived by the mainstream to be dangerous or weird. Fred McDarrah, the paper\u2019s photographer for the much of its first three decades, and who remained a part of the paper until his death in 2007, liked to affectionately call it \u201cthe commie, hippie, pinko rag.\u201d The place was filled with characters, and I loved every one of them, even as I was terrified of them. I spent eight years at The Voice. After I interned, I started as a fact checker and became a columnist, writing \u201cFly Life\u201d and \u201cClub Crawl,\u201d two weekly columns about New York night life. It was a dream job \u2014 I had an amount of creative freedom and a filing schedule (weekly) that now seems extravagant and luxurious.But with every passing year, the New York I knew and loved was changing, and eventually, like many others, I left. The city had ceased to be affordable \u2014 and more important, interesting. The night life I had come there to partake in became sanitized by bottle service and Wall Street money. There are now pockets of creativity in parts of the city, mainly in Brooklyn, but even that borough has become more and more gentrified. Advertisement"}

A musician, orchestrator and record producer, Mr. Jones is arguably the connecting tissue among all significant modes of popular music in the 20th century and beyond. Here\u2019s a very brief roster of artists whose work he\u2019s touched: Dinah Washington, Count Basie, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson and Will Smith.The movie alternates between the present, with Mr. Jones on the go, and a retrospective of his life and career, narrated by the man himself. His hardscrabble early years on the South Side of Chicago are scary; his triumphs from the earliest points of his career onward are exhilarating; the racism he is obliged to endure throughout is infuriating.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kavanaugh Hearings on TV Offer Riveting Drama to a Captive Nation", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh unspooled over nearly nine hours on Thursday \u2014 about the length of a prestige mini-series, binged Netflix-style in one wrenching, riveting sitting.The mini-series contained multitudes. It was a political drama that doubled as a reality show. It was an interrogation of gender, class and power in #MeToo America. It was a duel of clashing narrators. And it had elements of a major sports broadcast, a showdown between rival squads complete with halftime commentary.As much as the proceedings reflected a nation bitterly divided \u2014 \u201cThis is hell,\u201d Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, declared around hour seven \u2014 it also produced a rare collective civic moment. Every major broadcast and cable network suspended regular programming to carry gavel-to-gavel coverage. Americans gathered with friends and co-workers to watch. Twitter filled up with photos of airplane cabins, seat-back screens aglow with Dr. Blasey\u2019s visage.Digital outlets, like streaming video, make it harder to capture the size of an audience. But network executives expected Thursday\u2019s viewership to rival the 30 million people who tuned in for another generation-defining TV event: the testimony of the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill in 1991.Unlike that hearing, Thursday\u2019s drama on Capitol Hill was subject to instant analysis, dissected and framed in real time on social media. Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s chances of confirmation seemed to fall and rise depending on the hour, as political reporters relayed tidbits from President Trump\u2019s inner circle. Brit Hume, the veteran Fox News anchor, compared the feeling to election night of 2016, a yo-yo of emotions for partisans on both sides.At its core was a story born of literature: two protagonists revisiting a fateful moment from decades ago. \u201cI am terrified,\u201d Dr. Blasey said at the start of her testimony; they were virtually the first words that the public had ever heard her say.Later came a Judge Kavanaugh who bore little resemblance to the milquetoast man on Fox News three nights earlier. Indignant and defiant, nostrils flaring, the judge unleashed a torrent of pain and grievance, at times unable to speak as he cried in front of a national audience.Producers had lined up the usual anchors and analysts to offer comment. But the emotions of the day were too raw to be captured by pundits alone. C-Span, the no-frills public affairs network, became a spontaneous town square for everyday Americans who lit up the channel\u2019s phone lines, compelled to share deeply personal reactions to what they had seen.\u201cI\u2019m a 76-year-old woman who was sexually molested in the second grade; this brings back so much pain,\u201d said a woman who identified herself as Brenda of Valley Park, Mo., calling in after Dr. Blasey\u2019s opening statement. \u201cI have not brought this up for years until I heard this testimony, and it is just breaking my heart.\u201dIn another call, Michelle, a 53-year-old Republican from Florida, said she was molested as a teenager by a family friend and had been too scared to say anything. Jessica, a Democrat from Chicago, described being assaulted at age 19 in college.Not all C-Span callers were sympathetic to Dr. Blasey. \u201cShe talks like she was raped,\u201d said Sherry, a Republican in California who said she was sexually attacked at 17. \u201cI\u2019m going, \u2018Was she raped or not?\u2019 I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s crying now.\u201dSteve Scully, the stoic C-Span host who gently fielded the calls, said in an interview: \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect this outpouring of people speaking in very powerful terms of what they have gone through.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the emotion of the moment,\u201d he added.On the networks, commentators spoke of the day in historic terms. \u201cFifty years from now, people are going to be playing that exchange,\u201d the CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said, singling out Dr. Blasey\u2019s pained recollection of the boys who, she said, laughed as she was assaulted.On Fox News \u2014 the network that President Trump was most likely to be watching \u2014 the analysts were impressed by both of the day\u2019s speakers.\u201cThis was extremely emotional, extremely raw, extremely credible,\u201d Chris Wallace, the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d host, said of Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimonial. Before lunchtime, he was calling the hearing \u201ca disaster for the Republicans,\u201d and Andrew Napolitano, a Fox News commentator who speaks occasionally with Mr. Trump, said, \u201cThe president cannot be happy with this.\u201dBy evening, though, after Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s tear-choked appearance, Mr. Wallace said the judge had delivered \u201cexactly what a lot of people were hoping for.\u201dThe series finale will have to wait. Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s fate remains undecided.And Megyn Kelly, the NBC News anchor, wondered if, for all the day\u2019s drama, many Americans had already made up their minds.\u201cMost people are going about their daily business,\u201d she said on the air. \u201cIf history is any indicator, they will look at the clips and they will look at their favorite channels tonight for affirmation of their worldview.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Six tenderfoot crew members stood sweating in the shadows nearby. One was staring at his iPhone\u2019s stopwatch.\u201cNow give me a take where you\u2019re exhausted,\u201d the director, doubling as a camera operator, told the actor. \u201cYou\u2019ve been up all night worshiping Satan in this one.

Could the upstart studio find novel ways to entertain 13-to-25-year-old users of apps like Snapchat \u2014 and spin off that content into traditional television shows, books and other media?She has reached a verdict after two years of stops and starts. \u201cIt looks like we can,\u201d Ms. Murdoch said.An episode of \u201cPhoneSwap.\u201d Vertical NetworksVertical will also publish an advice book based on its Brother e-magazine, which specializes in audacious lifestyle tips. An example from a recent edition: \u201cFun fact! Eating snot also keeps bacteria from sticking to your teeth!\u201dIrreverent content succeeds on Snapchat, which has 188 million mostly young users.\u201cIf we\u2019re not giving them three things to look at simultaneously, we\u2019re losing them,\u201d said Bailey Rosser, Vertical\u2019s director of audience development. \u201cMobile viewers are used to constant stimulation. Consider how much visual info your brain is processing at it scrolls through a Facebook feed or scans your home screen for app notifications.\u201dAnd use the word \u201cyou\u201d as often as possible in mobile content, she advised. \u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d she said, after a reporter shot her a skeptical look. \u201cThis audience is narcissistic.\u201dMs. Rosser, who started her career at Google, described herself as \u201cold.\u201d She is 30. She joined Vertical two years ago and tracks the performance of the studio\u2019s content across more than 100 variables to learn how viewers behave. What do they like? What keeps them most engaged?Writers and producers use her data to shape and reshape Vertical content.

The early \u201cPhone Swap\u201d data helped Vertical realize that Snapchat viewers needed to see a swapper panicking in the first 20 seconds. Otherwise they would move on. (HBO\u2019s meandering \u201cWestworld\u201d this is not.)\u201cWe\u2019ve been disproportionately successful because we have built an amazing team that leans really heavily into audience insights,\u201d said Mr. Wright, who will remain involved in the studio. \u201cThe default is to lean into the expertise that you already have \u2014 to do what you already know.\u201dMr. Chavez added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just TV for a smaller screen.

In one misfire, the studio tried to make a mobile show, \u201cEpic Quit,\u201d that involved people quitting their jobs in over-the-top ways.

I\u2019ll have my self-masturbating virtual reality suck tube.\u201dA little past midnight, Mr. Theroux and friends were whisked past the velvet rope and headed downstairs to the mock hunting lodge, where he joked with a model in denim micro-shorts and bro-hugged Mr. Skarsgard by the pool table, before grabbing a cue and challenging a young couple to a game.Crouching to break, he connected with authority, scattering the balls violently around the felt. With the barest hint of a smile, Mr. Theroux coolly rose to chalk his cue.\u201cMan, you left too early,\u201d Mr. Theroux said when I met him outside his Greenwich Village duplex around 1 p.m. the next day. \u201cI played the best game of my life. Ran the table. The other guys didn\u2019t even get off a shot.\u201dMr. Theroux does not wear shorts, even on days when the denim clings to your thighs like paint. \u201cWe all have a uniform,\u201d he said.Our plans were still fuzzy. For the last couple of days we had been discussing how to approach this article, his first in-depth interview since his tabloid-quaking split with Jennifer Aniston in February.Attempting to fit him into a standard celebrity profile seemed like a foolish venture, as if commissioning Jeff Koons for a family portrait. And as Mr. Theroux would point out, he has spent the last three years dodging the kind of tabloid glare he never asked for.Once a matinee idol for the art house set, thanks to the cerebral, aloof demeanor and subtly anarchic wit he displayed in cult favorites like \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d and \u201cMulholland Drive,\u201d the celebrity-industrial complex transformed him from an actor that cool people knew into an actor everyone knew. So excuse him if he wants to have a little fun with the news media when the news media comes buzzing at his door on a late-summer afternoon. He joked about making the article a parody of the fish-out-out-of-water celebrity profiles of the 1990s, in which a journalist and a movie star would play, say, laser tag in Times Square.\u201cLet\u2019s do something really touristy,\u201d Mr. Theroux said, whipping out his iPhone and Googling \u201ctourist activities NYC.\u201d Before long, we struck on a plan: to wander through his old haunts on the Lower East Side, then hit the Statue of Liberty.\u201cIt will be \u2018fish out of water,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cin my own fishbowl.\u2019\u201dDespite his star-worthy shades, glimmering gold Rolex and loping gunfighter gait, Mr. Theroux moved freely among the half-clothed 20-somethings lounging in the grass. No one asked for selfies, no long lenses peered at him from the bushes. \u201cIt\u2019s like weather,\u201d he said of the paparazzi. \u201cSometimes it blows in hard and wet, sometimes it\u2019s just gray.\u201dHe arrived in New York in the early 1990s with a creative pedigree. His mother, Phyllis Theroux, was a style reporter for The Washington Post; his uncle is the writer Paul Theroux. Justin had studied drama and visual art at Bennington College and moved to New York with a vague plan to pursue both.After the gallery, we wandered south, toward Chinatown. On the corner of Bowery and Canal, a tattooed woman in a checkered mini-dress and a young boy stooped to pet Kuma, seemingly oblivious to her tabloid-famous master. Mr. Theroux seemed to relish the anonymity. Although he has divided his time between New York and Los Angeles for decades, New York, he said, is home. \u201cLife there is a very gate-to-gate, garage-to-garage, car-to-car, and that\u2019s just for anybody,\u201d he said of Los Angeles. \u201cThere is this kind of hermetic seal that\u2019s placed around you.\u201d\u201cFor me, at least, it can very quickly turn you into a house cat,\u201d he added, \u201cin that you\u2019re perceiving what\u2019s going on around you through panes of glass: your windshield, your driver\u2019s side door, your rearview mirror.\u201d\u201cIn New York,\u201d he said, \u201cthe minute you shut your door behind you, you\u2019re out in it.\u201dPassing souvenir stalls and dumpling shops, Mr. Theroux spoke of his affection for Chinatown, which he often wanders alone. He lived in China during college and speaks better-than-passable Mandarin.With our clothes damp with sweat, we decided to cool off at Von, a bar on Bleecker Street where he was once a bartender.Mr. Theroux let out a long exhale, aware that anything he says on the topic will get sliced and diced into nonsense on social media. \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t go on Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the internet, it\u2019s too inelegant a machine to accurately carve truth.\u201dWith seemingly nothing to go on, the tabloids have speculated endlessly on the reasons for the split, which usually boil down to him being too edgy and New York for the sunny Los Angeles rom-com star.\u201cHow do you combat gossip and rumor?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just on crack and steroids now.\u201dHe was under no illusions about the scrutiny the couple would face. Early on, his friend Jason Bateman told him: \u201c\u2018There will be this other \u201cyou\u201d born, this other character. And this person is insane. If you follow this person, or you pay attention to this person, it will make you insane too,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo I learned early on, obviously, not to participate, not to spend time dwelling on it.\u201dNow that the relationship is over, Mr. Theroux does not feel like he owes the public an explanation.\u201cThe good news is that was probably the most \u2014 I\u2019m choosing my words really carefully \u2014 it was kind of the most gentle separation, in that there was no animosity,\u201d he said, neither defensive nor bitter. \u201cIn a weird way, just sort of navigating the inevitable perception of it is the exhausting part.\u201d\u201cThese are actually in reality small events that take place,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut everything can feel like 10 on the Richter scale if you make the headline big enough and salacious enough.\u201dHe took a breath and tried to elucidate the curious nature of a Hollywood marriage. Because acting is \u201ckind of a carny lifestyle,\u201d he said, with frequent separations a part of the job description, the split \u201cdoesn\u2019t have that seismic shift of an ordinary couple, where everything is, like, you have to tear a baby in half.\u201dFar from meta, he sounded earnest. \u201cAgain, neither one of us is dead, neither one of us is looking to throw hatchets at each other,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like, it\u2019s amicable. It\u2019s boring, but, you know, we respected each other enough that it was as painless as it could be.\u201d\u201cIt was heartbreaking,\u201d he added, \u201conly in the sense that the friendship would not be the same, as far as just the day to day. But the friendship is shifting and changing, you know, so that part is something that we\u2019re both very proud of.\u201dA few days later, when I asked if he was currently seeing anyone, he laughed. \u201cIs this the part where I coyly raise an eyebrow and not answer the question?\u201d he said.From the outside, at least, his marriage to Ms. Aniston seemed to vault Mr. Theroux into a new level of fame. Suddenly, he was on the cover of magazines, marching down the red carpet with his megastar wife, sharing his manscaping habits with Ellen DeGeneres. Mr. Theroux disagrees. \u201cI still don\u2019t know creatively if it\u2019s had an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it has.\u201dHe recently flew to London to record the voice for the Tramp for the live-animated reboot of the \u201cLady and the Tramp,\u201d opposite Tessa Thompson, for Disney\u2019s new streaming channel (set to debut in 2019). In \u201cManiac,\u201d a futuristic, Kubrick-inflected black comic thriller about a pharmaceutical experiment gone wrong, Mr. Theroux is a guest star to Emma Stone and Jonah Hill. His indelibly odd performance as a mercurial medical genius \u201cinjects the show with this syringe full of wackadoodle energy, leaving the viewers wondering what in God\u2019s name this show is about,\u201d said Mr. Fukunaga, who was just named as director for the next James Bond film.Mr. Theroux did not mind ceding top billing for a passion project at this stage in his career arc. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even call it an arc,\u201d he said, sipping his green juice at Von. \u201cIt\u2019s more like some sort of cardiogram graph.\u201dBut conventional stardom has never been Mr. Theroux\u2019s goal, said Damon Lindelof, a creator of \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that Justin is a character actor that was cursed with being born into the body of a matinee idol,\u201d Mr. Lindelof said. A career without a single dominant moment so far is O.K. with Mr. Theroux. \u201cSome people\u2019s cardiogram just starts scribbling wildly at the age of 18, and it feels terrible for those people,\u201d he said.With the afternoon temperatures still hovering around brick pizza oven levels, Mr. Theroux and I decided to skip the long boat ride to Lady Liberty and headed to the Empire State Building instead.Arriving in the soaring Art Deco lobby, Mr. Theroux was in a puckish mood. He mugged in front of a photo of Tony Danza in the celebrity gallery, cooed at the souvenirs in the gift shop (\u201cNow this is the jam,\u201d he said, holding up a tacky T-shirt of the Empire State Building), and feigned horror at the $65 express ticket to the top. (\u201cHow much for the elevator down?\u201d he said.)As he moved through a throng of tourists from Europe and Asia, few seemed to recognize him. He smiled politely when a skinny guard said, \u201cYou look just like Justin Theroux.\u201dWhen we arrived on the 86th floor observation deck, Mr. Theroux made halfhearted attempts to play tourist in his own city. \u201cI\u2019m sure no one has ever said this,\u201d he said, peering over the railing, \u201cbut the people look like ants from up here!\u201dLooking at Lady Liberty in the distance, he added, \u201cI feel kind of creepy, looking at a woman through binoculars.\u201d All jokes aside, I pointed out that there was an inescapable symbolism to the moment: He had started out on those streets below so many years before, broke and anonymous. Now he was a big Hollywood star, staring down at the city from the pinnacle of fame.Mr. Theroux raised an eyebrow at the thought of himself at any pinnacle.\u201cIf you want symbolism,\u201d he said with a hearty chuckle, \u201cwe should go to, like, the 23rd floor.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the location of the Flower Shop. It is on Eldridge Street, not Orchard.Advertisement"}

It was the all-new season of his public life.Before I stopped reading replies to my tweet, four garden-variety Horsedudes of the Bropocalypse had galloped on through with responses of this variety:Apology: \u201cWhat he did wasn\u2019t even that bad.\u201dVictim-Blaming: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just leave the room?\u201d (Subtext: maybe these women should leave the planet.)Hate: \u201cIf those women were actually funny, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to get attention this way.\u201dSelf-Loathing (via Fellow Women): \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand the culture, get out of the yogurt!\u201dAnd I saw this question pop up like a particularly pernicious specimen, not just in my personal Whack-a-Troll game but all over the internet: Doesn\u2019t he deserve a second chance? Is he just supposed to disappear?The term \u201cI am only human\u201d implies we\u2019re fallible. The very concept of humanity is based on second chances.It\u2019s that concept of humanity that makes comedy \u2014 telling jokes in person to people night after night \u2014 work. The people in the audience know they might see you fall on your face. It\u2019s part of the process. But they want you to win. Because if you win, they win. They laugh. The tension is released.The world of stand-up fiercely guards the status quo, which is ironic for an art form that prides itself on \u201ctelling it like it is.\u201d It\u2019s why a Netflix special like Hannah Gadsby\u2019s \u201cNanette\u201d was criticized by straight male colleagues of mine for \u201cnot being stand-up\u201d because it wasn\u2019t all easily digestible setups and punch lines. It was an hour investigating and questioning what stand-up comedy is and how the power structures underlying it work.In that sense, the #MeToo movement has demonstrated that, as a money-driven society, we have been asleep to the continued marketing and monetization of known abusers for years.What about the victims\u2019 second chances? To argue that their talent must not match that of Louis C. K. or they would have gotten farther at this point in their careers, is missing the point. His actions affected their careers.To think the entertainment industry is fair or just or chiefly merit-based is assuming it operates by different rules from the rest of world. The burden placed on victims will always far outweigh those placed on predators. Yes, there is probably no measure by which he can undo the pain he has caused these women, but he can try.In an entertainment career, timing is everything. In a public relations move, timing is everything. In stand-up comedy, timing is everything.As a woman in stand-up comedy, I often spend more time addressing what it\u2019s like to be a woman or defending why disturbing behavior is upsetting than just getting a seat at the table. The general way through discomfort for comedians is most often a joke. It\u2019s used as a gateway into more taboo topics, or an escape route out of an awkward situation \u2014 whether that is a drink spilling or an overly chatty table of audience members, any potential competing force for the crowd\u2019s attention must be addressed.Perhaps that\u2019s why it felt so glaring that Louis C. K. chose not to mention his public exile or the reasons behind it in his return to the stage. His choice to completely avoid it spoke louder than any heckler saying as much would have.The way to take a comedian\u2019s power away is not to laugh. But as women from time immemorial in both social situations and audiences can attest, it\u2019s usually easier to laugh something off than to be singled out as humorless or a buzzkill.Imagine trying to voice your dissent when it\u2019s your entire career on the line. The women who came forward as victims of Louis C. K. had nothing to gain except to be bullied, ridiculed and insulted. Do they get a second chance?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018S.N.L.\u2019 Has Matt Damon Play Brett Kavanaugh in Season Premiere", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA complaint often made about \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d over the last year or so is that, in its signature political sketches, the show essentially treats its cast as bench warmers while giving the key roles to an expanding roster of celebrity guests. It\u2019s a roster that started, more or less, with Alec Baldwin as President Trump, and it has grown to include Scarlett Johansson as Ivanka Trump, Ben Stiller as Michael Cohen and Robert De Niro as Robert Mueller, among many others.So as \u201cS.N.L.\u201d began its 44th season this weekend, was there any evidence that the show had taken any of this criticism to heart? In a word: Nope.In character, Damon described himself as an optimist \u2014 \u201ca keg-is-half-full kind of guy\u201d \u2014 but also as someone who would fight for his nomination: \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018stop,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cTo quote my hero, Clint Eastwood\u2019s character in \u2018Gran Torino,\u2019 \u2018Get the hell off my lawn.\u2019\u201dShe later asked, \u201cDid you ever drink too many beers?\u201dHe answered: \u201cYou mean was I cool? Yeah.\u201dStill, the sketch was largely a tour de force for Damon, who ended it by saying: \u201cAm I angry? You\u2019re damn right. But if you think I\u2019m angry now, you just wait till I get on that Supreme Court, \u2019cause then you\u2019re all going to pay.\u201d And then he shotgunned a can of water.At the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d desk, Colin Jost and Michael Che also riffed on the Senate testimony of Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford, which Jost called \u201ca classic debate of she said, he yelled.\u201dJost added, \u201cYou\u2019re not helping yourself in a drunken assault case when you yell about how much you liked drinking and how strong you were at the time.\u201dChe later said: \u201cI just want to remind everybody that all this yelling and crying happened at this dude\u2019s job interview. I mean, typically, when you\u2019re asked about a sexual assault and your drinking problem at a job interview, you don\u2019t get the damn job.\u201dChe also wondered why Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination had not been withdrawn. \u201cWhy does it have to be him?\u201d Che asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t just pick another dude from your Illuminati lizard meetings? Are Republicans so pro-life that you don\u2019t even have a Plan B for this?\u201dMcKinnon reprised her role as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 whom she portrays as an adenoidal insult comedian dispensing \u201cGins-burns\u201d \u2014 to, yes, comment on the Kavanaugh hearings.She displayed her September 2018 calendar, across which was written a single instruction: \u201cDon\u2019t Die.\u201dHave you already forgotten that Pete Davidson got engaged to Ariana Grande? If so, the self-deprecating comedian reappeared at the \u201cUpdate\u201d desk to remind you and to express his own shock. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cShe\u2019s the number one pop star in the world and I\u2019m that guy from \u2018S.N.L.\u2019 that everyone thinks is in desperate need of more blood.\u201dPerhaps you thought Kanye West\u2019s three musical performances on Saturday night (the first of which featured West dressed as a Perrier bottle and Lil Pump as a Fiji water bottle) would be enough to get people talking about his new album, \u201cYandhi\u201d (which was widely believed to be dropping on Saturday, but \u2026 did not).In another portion of his remarks, West criticized the Democratic Party, saying: \u201cYou know it\u2019s like the plan they did, to take the fathers out the home and promote welfare. Does anybody know about that? That\u2019s a Democratic plan.\u201dNBC declined to comment on West\u2019s post-show remarks.Advertisement"}

But there is a danger that private equity lending is getting too risky.

{"Headline": "This Fall, Everything Old Is TV Again", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLooking at the 2018-19 TV schedule is like flipping the dials on a time machine. The season includes \u201cMagnum P.I.\u201d (whose predecessor debuted in 1980),\u201cMurphy Brown\u201d (1988), \u201cCharmed\u201d (1998), \u201cRoswell, New Mexico\u201d (from \u201cRoswell,\u201d 1999) and \u201cThe Conners,\u201d spun off after Roseanne Barr\u2019s self-immolation by Twitter, from the revival of \u201cRoseanne\u201d (1988).It\u2019s enough temporal hopscotching to fill an entire new series of \u201cQuantum Leap.\u201d (Which somehow has not been greenlighted yet, but give it a month or two.)So if we\u2019re destined to be borne back ceaselessly into TV\u2019s past, we may as well look at what makes a good remake and what doesn\u2019t.First, some definitions are in order. This broad genre \u2014 Re TV, let\u2019s call it \u2014 falls mainly into two categories.First you\u2019ve got your reboots: old titles being remade for another era, with new casts, and possibly new settings and characters. This includes the new \u201cMagnum,\u201d \u201cRoswell\u201d and \u201cCharmed.\u201dThen you have revivals: series, exhumed as if from the grave, with the same characters played by the same actors, picking up years or decades later. These include the new \u201cMurphy Brown,\u201d \u201cRoseanne\u201d/\u201dThe Conners\u201d and the reconstituted \u201cWill & Grace.\u201dIt is true that TV has been ransacking its past almost as long as it\u2019s had one; there is a history of \u201cBrady Bunch\u201d and \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d reunion movies to attest to that. Critics like me have been griping about TV\u2019s recycling of ideas for just as long. So yes: even the complaints are remakes.But the sheer tonnage of Re TV today reflects a culture that\u2019s increasingly like a Netflix home page, full of \u201cIf You Liked \u2026\u201d and \u201cWatch It Again.\u201d And in many ways the glut of these shows, even when they appear on the old legacy networks, is a product of the streaming-TV era.New media have made TV\u2019s past ever-present and ever more accessible. \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d for instance, developed a brand-new audience in reruns and on Netflix, which was primed for its 2016 revival. (Netflix in particular \u2014 which also gave us \u201cArrested Development\u201d and \u201cFuller House\u201d \u2014 is able to both manufacture nostalgic cravings and satisfy them.)What\u2019s more, between streaming and cable, there\u2019s simply so much TV now (there will probably be more than 500 original scripted series in 2018) that it\u2019s a battle for anything new to get attention. A familiar title, like \u201cS.W.A.T.,\u201d offers a boost that \u201cAnother CBS Cop Show\u201d doesn\u2019t.But these business considerations intersect with a broader hunger to relive the past and sometimes to relitigate it.Take the movies, where the new, more diverse \u201cStar Wars\u201d films and the 2016 female-led remake of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d became culture-war battles over representation and who owns the past and the future. It\u2019s not just coincidence that \u201cerasure\u201d has been a theme in both the arguments over these movies and the removal of Confederate monuments, or that the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d fight drew in alt-right figures like Milo Yiannopoulos.The revived \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d hasn\u2019t been screened for critics (CBS picked it up without shooting a pilot), but it stands to be a counterpoint to \u201cRoseanne\u201d just as it was when it began three decades ago.Where \u201cRoseanne\u201d modeled a populist blue-collar feminism, the hard-edge TV-anchor protagonist of \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d (Candice Bergen) spoke to power from a position of power. The original series was relentlessly of-the-moment, both within its scripts and without. (Vice President Dan Quayle famously went to war with the show when Murphy had a baby while single.) The revival, from its description, aims to be just as topical, with Murphy hosting a cable-news morning show, while her grown son (Jake McDorman) hosts a conservative competitor.In her recent book, \u201cStealing the Show,\u201d Joy Press notes that while Diane English, the creator of \u201cMurphy Brown,\u201d admired \u201cRoseanne,\u201d Ms. Barr \u201cfelt alienated by the kind of middle-class liberal feminism Murphy Brown represented.\u201d This may have foreshadowed the two shows\u2019 divergence in 2018, with Roseanne having gone MAGA into the sunset, while Murphy hangs in with the post-Hillary left.But revivals are also conservative by nature \u2014 artistically, if not necessarily politically. By definition, they\u2019re trying to re-create the past in the present, simulating the appeal of the original even as they show how the world has changed around the characters. For the typical revival, the best-case scenario is getting the viewer to say, \u201cThis feels like the same show I used to watch back then.\u201dThere are exceptions; one reason \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d worked so well was that, visually and in tone, it felt like a different work from the series that aired in the early \u201890s. When it overtly called back to the past \u2014 as when Audrey reprised her dance from the original series \u2014 it was with the nightmarish sense that something had died and come back changed.But more often, the point of a revival is to deny change, at least creatively. \u201cWill & Grace\u201d acknowledged the new era with a heavy-handed premiere episode about the Trump administration. But the new season was so eerily like the original in its rhythms and tone that you could convince yourself it had never gone off the air (as long as you forgot about the original series ending that the revival Etch-a-Sketched).At its heart, the appeal of a revival is the appeal of a high school reunion, or a visit to Facebook: What are they doing now? But it can be as unsettling to find your old prime-time favorites unnaturally preserved as to find them changed.Most sitcoms could theoretically go on for decades. But there\u2019s usually an unspoken expiration date: the point beyond which the characters\u2019 lives would change \u2014 making it a different show \u2014 or, in remaining the same, they would be less funny than sad. (This is one reason I pray no one ever loads up a big enough Brink\u2019s truck to reunite the cast of \u201cFriends.\u201d)A reboot, on the other hand, may be successful or disastrous, but it at least offers the possibility, and the requirement, for rethinking and transformation. \u201cBattlestar Galactica,\u201d after 9/11, turned a breezy 1970s space opera into an ambitious story about politics, religion and the ethics of survival in the face of an existential threat.More recently, when Netflix imagined \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d with a Cuban-American family, it was able to speak to modern questions about immigration and representation, about who defines America and the working class.All this points to another distinction of reboots: Revivals, which reproduce TV\u2019s past down to the original casting, have tended to be very white, as TV\u2019s history is. But the planned reboot of \u201cParty of Five\u201d will focus on Mexican-American siblings after their parents are deported, and the \u201cRoswell\u201d reboot (also not yet screened for review) will reportedly have an immigration twist alongside its space-alien plot.CW\u2019s reboot of the witchcraft drama \u201cCharmed\u201d aims for another kind of update. The original was an artifact of the late-\u201890s \u201cBuffy\u201d era of empowered female heroines. The new version, produced by Jennie Snyder Urman (\u201cJane the Virgin\u201d), recalibrates it for the #MeToo era with a story of sexual harassment and vengeance.The pilot hammers hard for timeliness from its opening lines, \u201cThis is not a witch hunt; it\u2019s a reckoning.\u201d But there\u2019s potential in using its metaphor-heavy subject matter to look at what has and hasn\u2019t changed in 20 years.Not all reboots are so ambitious. CBS\u2019s new \u201cMagnum,\u201d judging from the rough pilot sent to critics, is the sort of charming-rogue-solving-crimes-in-paradise show that could as easily have aired in 1988 as 2018. Its chief innovation, seemingly, is that Tom Selleck\u2019s successor, Jay Hernandez, is clean-shaven. (The original \u2018stache can still be found on display with its owner on CBS\u2019s \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d)The popularity of Re TV may partly be a sign of TV\u2019s maturing. After some 70 years as a commercial medium, it has a body of texts that can be revisited, reattempted, remixed or responded to.But history can be both a spur and a burden. CBS All Access, for instance, is rebooting \u201cThe Twilight Zone,\u201d which has already had two unmemorable relaunches.And you could argue that we have another \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d already; it\u2019s just called \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Would Charlie Brooker\u2019s travelogue of social-media hell be just as powerful had it launched with the title \u201cThe Twilight Zone: Cyber\u201d? Or would it have been constrained by the obligation to call back and pay homage to the original?Then again, I\u2019m not going to bet sight unseen against Jordan Peele, one of the new \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d producers, whose \u201cGet Out\u201d had its own Serlingesque allegorical creepiness. If Mr. Peele and company can use the \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d mantle as a cover to smuggle onto TV something just as stunning and full of voice, I won\u2019t complain about being fed leftovers.In the end, nostalgia is like any other genre. You can only judge so much from a title and a premise, because it comes down to ideas and execution. Not all Re TV is (re)created equal.Advertisement"}

But the store, a convenience shop at a gas station, is where he had previously found a note instructing him that if he visited again on his birthday, he\u2019d be killed.Guess which day his mom wants him to revisit the store, to prove that he\u2019s not superstitious or easily cowed by the bullies she believes left the note? This scene places the viewer in the awkward position of speculating, for perhaps too long, whether the movie\u2019s going to let the character be killed; either way, someone is not winning any \u201cMother of the Year\u201d award any time soon. The acting is excellent, though, and the direction energetic.\u201cThe Warning\u201d was followed by \u201cPerdida,\u201d a grim Argentine drama. Its protagonist is a young female cop who works on human trafficking cases. The connective thread with \u201cThe Warning\u201d at first seems only to be that they\u2019re both Spanish-language movies. But there are more affinities. The movies\u2019 structure, for instance: Both films toggle between two time periods of about a decade apart.In \u201cPerdida,\u201d the female officer is haunted, once again, by the disappearance of her childhood friend 14 years before, a traumatic event that spurred her to join the force. The movie is earnest and twisty (as with \u201cThe Warning,\u201d one plot element requires math calculations), but also a bit of a slog. It\u2019s a little clich\u00e9d, too: One character puts on loud music, not knowing she\u2019s about to drown out the sound of her own murder.Directed by Ben Shelton from a script by Chad Klitzman, it honors young people of intellectual achievement while also making sharp points about class and educational standards. The two young leads, Jacob Latimore and Sami Gayle, are deft at playing brainy, and Helen Hunt, Christina Hendricks and Uzo Aduba offer solid adult support; Ms. Hunt is particularly effective as a sympathetic guidance counselor. The film is fleet, sweet and often genuinely funny.After \u201cCandy Jar,\u201d I was prompted to look at \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d which I\u2019d seen and enjoyed, but not so much I thought I needed to sit through it again.His point being that when health care in the United States fails over all, citizens will flood the Canadian border to take advantage of its universal health care system. There might be a thematic affinity with \u201cHow It Ends\u201d there, but it\u2019s pretty thin.Such algorithm glitches have some value. There comes a point during my hours of work when I have to hit the stop button and take the advice my mother gave me during my movie-mad childhood: \u201cGo outside and get some fresh air.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The games could be bought piecemeal as each $5 episode was released \u2014 usually two to three months apart \u2014 or, eventually, all at once.Its departure from the industry would be a blow to storytelling in video games that does more than fill the gaps between gunfights. What appears to be the sudden cancellation of Telltale projects \u2014 including one that has been partially published \u2014 has upset fans.\u201cWe released some of our best content this year and received a tremendous amount of positive feedback, but ultimately, that did not translate to sales,\u201d its chief executive, Pete Hawley, said in a statement on Friday.Telltale did not reply to requests for comment.The studio\u2019s breakthrough came in 2012 with its game The Walking Dead, which had players make difficult moral choices in a zombie-infested universe.Players determined how the protagonist, a former college professor with a secret, would try to protect a young girl whose parents had vanished in the outbreak. In addition to choosing from dialogue options, they were forced to rapidly respond to dire choices: After the professor is bitten by a zombie, he must decide whether to have his arm sawed off.Creating characters who resonated with players \u2014 and fleeting moments to alter their relationships \u2014 were among Telltale\u2019s biggest contributions to the industry, said Evan Skolnick, who teaches video game writing at Cogswell College in San Jose, Calif.It was a \u201cheart-wrenching, gut-wrenching, Sophie\u2019s Choice-every-10-minutes type of experience,\u201d said Mr. Skolnick, who spent about nine months writing for Telltale\u2019s later games. \u201cPeople were emotionally hooked, and they wanted to see what was going to happen next.

{"Headline": "R.I.P., the Celebrity Profile", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookAll glossy magazine superstar covers may look the same from a distance, but inside, you\u2019re never quite sure what you\u2019ll find.The story worked in two ways: For the reader and fan, it was appealingly revealing; for Mr. McCartney, who\u2019s been famous so long he is more sculpture than human, it was a welcome softening.For devotees of Beyonc\u00e9, this might not matter (though it should). But for devotees of celebrity journalism \u2014 the kind of work that aims to add context and depth to the fame economy, and which is predicated on the productive frisson between an interviewer and interviewee \u2014 this portends catastrophe. And it\u2019s not an isolated event. In pop music especially, plenty of the most famous performers essentially eschew the press: Taylor Swift hasn\u2019t given a substantive interview and access to a print publication for at least two years. For Drake, it\u2019s been about a year (and a tumultuous one at that). Frank Ocean has all but disappeared (again).What\u2019s replaced it isn\u2019t satisfying: either outright silence, or more often, unidirectional narratives offered through social media. Monologue, not dialogue. It threatens to upend the role of the celebrity press.But that was in a climate in which print publications had a disproportionate amount of leverage, and the internet and TMZ hadn\u2019t wrested away narrative control. When stars\u2019 comings and goings began to be documented on a minute-by-minute basis, those changes triggered celebrity reticence. On its own, that wouldn\u2019t signal the death knell of celebrity journalism as it\u2019s been practiced for decades. But the pressure being applied to celebrity journalism from the top might pale in comparison to the threat surging from below, where a new generation of celebrities \u2014 YouTube stars, SoundCloud rappers, and various other earnest young people \u2014 share extensively on social media on their own terms, moving quickly and decisively (and messily) with no need for the patience and pushback they might encounter in an interview setting.This generation is one of all-access hyperdocumentation, making the promise of celebrity journalism \u2014 emphasizing intimate perspective and behind-the-scenes access \u2014 largely irrelevant.These are one-sided stories, with no scrutiny beyond the comments section. And so they\u2019ve be come highly visible safe spaces for young celebrities, especially in an era when one\u2019s direct social media audience \u2014 via Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and more \u2014 can far exceed the reach of even the most prestigious or popular publication, and in a way that\u2019s laser-targeted to supporters.All of which leaves celebrity journalism in a likely unsolvable conundrum. The most famous have effectively dispensed with it, and the newly famous have grown up in an age where it was largely irrelevant. Over time, the middle space may well be squeezed into nothingness.What\u2019s more, creation of content has been diversified \u2014 for the casual consumer, it can be difficult to tell the difference between original reporting and aggregation, content created by journalistic outlets and content created by brands. This blurriness incentivizes the famous away from traditional media, where they don\u2019t control the final product.And so as the power dynamic tilts in favor of the famous over the press, publications \u2014 weakened, desperate, financially fragile \u2014 have been forced to find ever more contorted ways to trade, at minimum, the feeling of control in exchange for precious access.These stories trade on the perceived intimacy of friendships as a proxy for actual insight, abdicating the role of an objective press in the process. The covenant implicit in celebrity profiles is that the journalist is a proxy for the reader, not the subject. But in the thirst for exclusive access, the old rules get tossed by the wayside \u2014 ethics become inconvenient. Friendship should be a disqualifier, not a prerequisite.That is a disservice to fans, who miss out on what happens when someone in the room is pushing back, not merely taking dictation. Imagine how wildly illuminating probing conversations with Beyonc\u00e9 about \u201cLemonade\u201d or Ms. Swift about \u201cReputation\u201d would have been, a boon to the curious as well as an opportunity for the interview subjects to be shown in their full complexity. But rather than engage on those terms, these stars have become hermetic. It\u2019s a shame: We\u2019ll never know the answers to the questions that aren\u2019t asked.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Beating Disney for Sky, Comcast Remains in the Game", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byComcast and the Walt Disney Company have long been rivals. But Brian L. Roberts, who runs Comcast, has recently become the Magic Kingdom\u2019s nemesis in chief.For Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, the loss of Sky and its vast European customer base to Mr. Roberts has to sting. It was perhaps the first time during his ultrasuccessful 13-year tenure that Mr. Iger was denied such a prize, one he called \u201ca crown jewel\u201d when first pursuing it.But the realities of the entertainment business make the outcome more complicated.\u201cI am happy that Disney didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email. \u201cComcast paid a very expensive price for this, and I think it\u2019s hard to justify.\u201dComcast\u2019s offer for the majority stake in Sky puts that total value of the company at $48 billion including assumed debt, or 15 times expected 2018 earnings.Mr. Nathanson added, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t stop Disney.\u201dMr. Iger could also refuse to sell, which would put more pressure on Mr. Roberts because there will be a smaller pool of Sky investors from which to cobble together a majority stake.Sky shareholders must agree to sell their stock to Comcast in the weeks ahead. Comcast needs more than 50 percent of shares to complete its offer.Hulu could emerge as another chess piece. Disney is poised to own about 60 percent of that service after it closes the deal for 21st Century Fox, but Comcast would remain a minority shareholder with 30 percent. Hulu, which has over 20 million subscribers, is a pillar in Mr. Iger\u2019s new strategy to sell Disney\u2019s shows and films directly to consumers.Comcast, however, is keen on keeping its Hulu investment and would be willing to continue selling streaming rights for its NBC series to the service, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. That stance could change, they acknowledged.Analysts have bandied about the possibility that Disney could sell its 39 percent stake in Sky if Comcast were willing to sell its 30 percent ownership of Hulu. British takeover laws, however, would forbid such a tit-for-tat maneuver. A Hulu transaction would have to be a parallel deal and not contingent on the Sky stake.In the battle with Mr. Roberts, Mr. Iger won the big prize: 21st Century Fox. That\u2019s a purchase that, in addition to Hulu and the Sky stake, includes assets like a leading TV studio with more than 30 series in production, the \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cAvatar\u201d franchises and overseas TV providers like Star of India. Absorbing those businesses \u2014 a huge task given disparate corporate cultures \u2014 will allow Disney to become one of the few traditional media companies with enough scale and intellectual property to compete against Netflix and tech giants like Apple and Amazon, both of which are moving aggressively in Hollywood.In fighting to the end for Sky, Disney forced Comcast to pay 27 percent more than it initially offered, essentially returning the favor for driving up the 21st Century Fox price. Comcast expects cost savings of about $600 million after folding Sky into its business.Mr. Iger can still use his world-class collection of content rights \u2014 Marvel superheroes, the Disney Princesses, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d Pixar\u2019s beloved characters \u2014 to roll out Disney\u2019s planned streaming service (known in industry parlance as an \u201cover the top\u201d business) in Europe.\u201cThey can use their rights to go over the top in the long run in Europe,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said.In Sky, Comcast gets one of Europe\u2019s largest media companies, with nearly 23 million customers across five countries, including Britain, Germany and Italy. For British viewers used to living in a media universe long dominated by the Murdoch family, the potential Comcast takeover signals a notable shift in ownership.Indeed, the most stinging loss may belong to the Murdoch family, which has been fighting for control of Sky for the better part of a decade. Mr. Murdoch, 87, co-founded the satellite TV company in 1989 to compete with the British Broadcasting Corporation. Sky, which has 31,000 employees and generated about $17 billion in revenue last year, ranks as one of the most popular TV brands in Europe. It creates its own original shows, runs an influential news channel and has exclusive partnerships in Europe with HBO, Showtime and Warner Bros.Mr. Roberts and his advisers began looking at Sky as an acquisition as early as July 2017, long before engaging in the bidding war against Disney for 21st Century Fox assets. Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in Sky was the primary reason that Mr. Roberts went after the company, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.For Comcast, pursuing Fox was always about building its international businesses. Mr. Roberts cared much less about other assets that the Murdoch family was selling, including the FX and National Geographic cable networks. Cable companies like Comcast, which primarily operates in the United States, have grappled with a decline in pay-TV subscribers who have flocked to streaming services like Netflix. Mr. Roberts, who fashions himself as his company\u2019s principal dealmaker, identified Sky as one way to keep Comcast growing.He was particularly taken with Sky\u2019s technology. The British broadcaster sells a set-top box that streams its programming over a broadband connection and includes apps like Netflix or Spotify. Sky built the technology to become its key engine for delivering programming, a setup similar to Comcast\u2019s Xfinity program.Sky also owns valuable sports rights, including a large chunk of the English Premier League. That was seen as a nice fit with Comcast since its NBCUniversal division owns the American rights to those matches. In addition to sports, the deal gives Comcast some Disney and Fox content. Sky owns streaming rights to films from both studios for the European markets in which it operates for the next two to three years.At least 10 investment banks advised the various parties. Five law firms were involved, as were consultants from four outside public relations companies.Mr. Roberts and a band of Comcast executives, including its chief financial officer, Michael J. Cavanagh, set up a war room in a London hotel before the weekend to wage their battle for Sky. To win, Comcast needed to submit a clearly superior bid \u2014 high enough to persuade Sky shareholders to tender their stock in the weeks ahead.When it was over, Mr. Roberts had his victory.Disney had no comment.And 21st Century Fox said in a statement that it was \u201cconsidering its options\u201d regarding its 39 percent stake in Sky and \u201cwill make a further announcement in due course.\u201dMr. Roberts allowed himself a few moments to celebrate.\u201cThis is a great day for Comcast,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cThis acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally. We couldn\u2019t be more excited.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In this case, though, the cocooning effect is more noticeable.The show moves in a glitter-zone of skyscrapers, luxury apartments, expensive restaurants and family horse ranches. The non-glamorous are kept in the background. One of the socialites, who claims to be descended from an Aztec emperor, says of her circle, \u201cMexico City is very closed\u201d \u2014 the metropolitan area\u2019s 21 million other residents apparently slipped her mind.Would a Mexican or other Latin-American production company have done things differently?

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018The Land of Steady Habits,\u2019 Suburban Malaise, With a Twist", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American suburb is zoned for ambivalence. Neither city nor country, suburbia \u2014 at least in the imagination of too many novelists, filmmakers and songwriters to count \u2014 yokes affluence to alienation. Beyond the well-kept lawns and hedges are seething hives of adultery, anomie and addiction. These pathologies may not actually be more common along the commuter rail lines than anywhere else, but there is an imposing body of literature that insists otherwise.Leaving his gracious old colonial in the care of his ex-wife, Helene (Edie Falco), Anders says that he has decided to give \u201ccondo living\u201d a try. To feather his bachelor nest, he wanders through retail stores soliciting decorating tips from women \u2014 customers and salespeople alike \u2014 and then sleeping with them. It doesn\u2019t seem like much fun, for him or his partners, but it\u2019s a way of passing the time.Anders may have quit the rat race, but he can\u2019t seem to stay away from the track. He goes to parties where he runs into Helene, and pursues awkward conversations with old friends who are less than delighted to be in his company. Helene has moved on to a new man (Bill Camp), which bothers Anders more than he would like to admit. He tries to maintain a semblance of paternal authority with his drifting, post-collegiate son, Preston (Thomas Mann), and indulges in some desperate adolescent behavior with another young man, Charlie (Charlie Tahan), who takes a lot of drugs.Nobody seems to like Anders all that much, and he doesn\u2019t really care. He acts less like a man in free fall than like a guy who\u2019s got it all figured out, which has the effect of making him at once pitiable, infuriating and kind of mysterious. Maybe he is privy to some kind of esoteric knowledge. Or maybe he\u2019s just a shallow jerk embracing his true identity.\u201cThe Land of Steady Habits\u201d (Connecticut\u2019s longstanding unofficial nickname) is not only Anders\u2019s story, though his self-centeredness can make it feel that way. As he stumbles toward either a bright new beginning or a total flameout \u2014 the first foreshadowed by a tentative romance with Barbara (Connie Britton), the second by his age-inappropriate semi-friendship with Charlie \u2014 other lives are illuminated, and also singed, by his wayward comet\u2019s path. His blithe clumsiness contributes to, and directly causes, a lot of hurt, visited especially on the next generation. Middle-aged guys may muddle through, but young men like Preston and Charlie risk losing their way, and even their lives.The darkness and pain haunting Westport are more pronounced \u2014 and maybe for that reason less affecting \u2014 than the melancholy and quiet rage that figure in Ms. Holofcener\u2019s other movies. The suburban setting is acutely rendered, but it also feels a little secondhand, with not as much room for invention and oddness than the New York and Los Angeles of \u201cLovely and Amazing,\u201d \u201cFriends with Money\u201d and \u201cPlease Give.\u201dBut within these constraints, the performances have sufficient grit \u2014 and the writing has just enough polish \u2014 to make \u201cThe Land of Steady Habits\u201d feel unpredictable and fresh. Mr. Mendelsohn, who looks and speaks as if he were perpetually sucking on a cough drop, makes no overt gestures either in the direction of likability or awfulness. Anders can be thoughtless and casually cruel (after sex with Barbara, for example), and he can also be affable and honest. That it\u2019s hard to tell the difference is a credit to the actor, who all but dares us to give up on the character altogether.And the film\u2019s strength is that it holds this out as a real possibility, taking seriously the proposition that redemption may be out of reach. In most versions of the suburban male midlife crisis story, the protagonist comes by our sympathy as if it were a birthright or a secular manifestation of grace. In Ms. Holofcener\u2019s secular, implicitly feminist revision, Anders has no such entitlement. He\u2019s stuck with himself, as everyone else \u2014 the audience included \u2014 is stuck with him. We make the best of it, and in this case \u201cthe best\u201d is a very fine movie.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Mexican Baseball Team Plays in Texas. It\u2019s a Home Game.", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "The owner of the team decided to stage half of the team\u2019s home games across the border in Laredo, Tex., in a mutually beneficial, and symbolic, gesture of cross-border unity.Supported byLAREDO, Tex. \u2014 The national anthems of the United States and Mexico were played over the stadium speakers as the flags of both countries fluttered in the hot summer wind. Fans chatted away in English and Spanish. Burgers and popcorn were as prevalent as carne asada tacos and apple slices covered in tamarind sauce.It was time for the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos, the Owls of the Two Laredos, one of the oldest teams in Mexican baseball, to take the field here at Uni-Trade Stadium on the Texas side of the border.Except this was not an away game.The border can be a blur here, a perspective sometimes not understood from afar in the heated discussions of the day about walls and migrants and international trade agreements. So this season, in a mix of symbolism and business savvy, the Tecolotes played half their home games away from their home in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, just across the Rio Grande.It felt normal, even expected. Already, fans and players and team employees lived on one side of the border or the other, crossing back and forth using visas and special permits common in border towns. And a previous iteration of this Mexican baseball team once played regularly here.But that was 14 years ago, and times have changed. The logistics of playing on both sides of the border have become dizzying, as crossing times grow because of heightened scrutiny of documents and vehicles. Nuevo Laredo, too, has grown violent in the drug war, making the kinds of trips that used to be taken for granted less frequent and more tense.One Tecolotes game scheduled to be played there this summer was moved here, to Laredo, Tex., after both teams\u2019 players worried about a 90-minute shootout that had taken place there.Still, both cities found the arrangement for the Tecolotes to play in Texas mutually beneficial and something that came to mean much more, a reminder of simpler times and the bonds, however tested, that remain strong.\u201cThough politics and diplomacy are tense and difficult elsewhere, we have to do what we can here,\u201d Mayor Enrique Rivas of Nuevo Laredo said. \u201cWe live in a reality here different than Washington or Mexico City thinks. Baseball came here to unite what politics perhaps hasn\u2019t been able to do.\u201dThe cross-border team, believed to be the only one in baseball playing home games in two countries, is the brainchild of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mansur, a Mexican businessman who owns the Tecolotes, part of the Liga Mexicana de B\u00e9isbol, or the Mexican Baseball League.Over the winter, Mansur moved the team to Nuevo Laredo from Veracruz and pushed to play games in Laredo. He brought back the name Owls of the Two Laredos, which a previous version of the team used years ago. It was a marketing move rooted in the obvious: These two cities are inextricably intertwined.More than $208 billion in trade passed through Laredo last year, making it one of the busiest land ports in the United States, according to the United States Department of Transportation. On average, 39,000 people a day cross the border here by foot, car and bus. About 95 percent of Laredo\u2019s population of 260,000 is Hispanic.\u201cGrowing up, it was like one community,\u201d said Horacio De Leon, Laredo\u2019s city manager, who was born and raised in Laredo to parents from Nuevo Laredo. \u201cWe go see a family member on one side and go to school here.\u201dThe Tecolotes came up with a new logo that represented the team\u2019s binational nature: No. 2 wrapped around an L, with elements from both countries\u2019 flags. The Tecolotes\u2019 slogan, plastered on its ubiquitous signs, is \u201cDos Naciones, Un Equipo,\u201d or \u201cTwo Nations, One Team.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re sitting in a territory that once was Mexican,\u201d Mansur, 72, said in his office before a game in Laredo. \u201cAnd all the people that lived here haven\u2019t lost their roots.\u201dIt helped that a forerunner of today\u2019s Tecolotes played somewhat regularly on both sides of the border from 1985 to 2004 and that both cities had an empty, available stadium; in Laredo, a now-defunct independent league team left the Uni-Trade ballpark last year. The Tecolotes struck a five-year deal to play there.Of its 114-game regular-season schedule, the Tecolotes played 30 home games at Uni-Trade Stadium and 27 on the Mexican side, at Estadio Nuevo Laredo \u2014 plus playoff games hosted on both sides of the border, before the Tecolotes lost last week.Attendance at the Laredo games was higher than in Nuevo Laredo; the violence and distant location of the stadium in Nuevo Laredo made it harder to attract fans, team officials said. There is also more disposable income and sponsorship money in Texas \u2014 a key reason Mansur wanted his team to play here.Although local officials and residents said the violence in Nuevo Laredo had lessened recently, the State Department earlier this year placed five Mexican states, including Tamaulipas, where Nuevo Laredo is, on its do-not-travel list, on a par with countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. Bringing baseball back, Rivas thought, could counter this.\u201cWith the Tecolotes, people start talking about Nuevo Laredo and sports from here \u2014 positive things, not just negative things,\u201d Rivas, the mayor, said. \u201cWe have a stereotype and stigma of violence and insecurity. And little by little \u2014 I mean, little by little \u2014 we\u2019re reversing it. But Tamaulipas is still dangerous.\u201dReminders of the danger of Nuevo Laredo are everywhere, and its reputation led some players to request trades off the team, while others refused to show up after being traded to the Tecolotes. \u201cAs much as we explain that you\u2019re going to live in Laredo and we\u2019re going to pick you up and drop you off after the game, it has been a problem for us,\u201d said the Tecolotes\u2019 general manager, Grimaldo Mart\u00ednez.The streets of Nuevo Laredo are noticeably emptier than its neighbor's. The mayor\u2019s security detail includes Mexican marines.\u201cSometimes on the bus, I get a little nervous,\u201d said outfielder Domonic Brown, 31, a Florida native who was an All-Star with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2013. \u201cI grew up pretty decent. And I knew nothing about Nuevo Laredo other than Netflix, El Chapo and seeing that stuff on the news.\u201dPlayers and officials said the team has not been a target of gangs. As a Tecolotes van snaked through the outskirts of Nuevo Laredo on the way to the stadium on a recent afternoon, the relief pitcher Iv\u00e1n Zavala pointed out a hot zone for shootings. When car tires screeched, everyone\u2019s head spun.\u201cThe violence has been quiet now, but we know that at any moment something can happen,\u201d said Zavala, 31, who is from Guanajuato, Mexico.For security reasons, most of the Tecolotes\u2019 players lived in Laredo, in an extended-stay hotel, during the season, which was possible because many are United States-born players of Mexican descent.Before games in Laredo, the players who lived in Nuevo Laredo met at the border crossing bridge downtown, walked into the United States, then hopped in a team van to the stadium. After games in Nuevo Laredo, team vans dropped players off at the crossing. It was much faster by foot.\u201cWe cross so much that we recognize nine of every 10 border agents,\u201d said Kelvis Flete, the Tecolotes\u2019 assistant general manager. \u201cThey even used to ask us if we won that night.\u201dThe team\u2019s operations are based mostly out of Uni-Trade Stadium, with a handful of team employees working out of Nuevo Laredo. But little is left behind at the Estadio Nuevo Laredo, which is why when Flete needed a printer before a game in Nuevo Laredo, he lugged one from his office in Laredo.\u201cIt\u2019s not the most ideal situation, but we make the most of it,\u201d said pitcher Alex Sanabia, 30, a San Diego native and former Miami Marlin. \u201cIt would be easier to play all on one side.\u201dWatching from the concourse at Uni-Trade Stadium, Cesar Infante, 38, said that he moved from Nuevo Laredo to Laredo at 15, learned English, went to school, became a United States citizen and found a job in information technology. Because of the insecurity, he returns sparingly, only to visit his mother.\u201cFor those people that don\u2019t go back to Nuevo Laredo, this team is a part of home,\u201d he said. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t have the money to take me to Tecos games in Nuevo Laredo as a kid, but now I can bring my kids. For me, it\u2019s very exciting. This team unites us. Families enjoying the same sport together on each side.\u201dAlthough tickets were cheaper in Nuevo Laredo, the average paid attendance in Laredo was nearly double, at over 4,000. Fans twirled noisemakers, but those, plus drums and megaphones, were more prevalent in Nuevo Laredo. The attractions in Laredo included postgame fireworks and a playground set up beyond the outfield.An in-game announcement reminded fans visiting from Mexico that their $3.50 border crossing fee by car would be waived with a Tecolotes ticket stub. Laredo, which collects the border toll when leaving the city, did this to encourage attendance from Mexico.\u201cIt\u2019s great that the Tecos are back,\u201d said Beto Garcia, 61, a retired truck driver born and raised in Nuevo Laredo who moved to Laredo 25 years ago to join his wife and to work. He nursed a beer while sitting on a picnic table surrounded by the group of family and friends that accompany him to many Tecolotes games.\u201cPeople here respond well to baseball,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re a small town, but this is how we entertain ourselves.\u201dMany players understood what they meant to the fans on both sides. Their travel inconveniences were trivial compared with those of the many people who crossed the border daily with much less.\u201cSometimes you don\u2019t understand the magnitude of what we\u2019re doing, but this is really big,\u201d said infielder Alejandro Rivero, 30, who is from the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. \u201cIssues between the countries are among the politicians and leaders. We\u2019re just the athletes who play on both sides, but we\u2019re showing people can enjoy life and live in peace.\u201dPlaying in two countries resonated deeply with outfielder Amaury Caza\u00f1a, 40. He escaped his native Cuba on a boat 13 years ago. He ended up in Miami, was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in 2006, but never reached the major leagues. He became a naturalized Mexican this year through his wife, who is Mexican.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to live when limits are put on you,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when you have the opportunity to move freely across a border, you feel accomplished. It\u2019s comforting knowing you can go from one country to the next. A lot of people wish they could do the same.\u201dIt took extensive coordination among the team, cities and immigration officials from both countries for the Tecolotes to play on both sides of the border. The 16-team Mexican league insisted that the Tecolotes help any visiting teams secure visas or other travel documents to cross into the United States.Luckily, Mansur said, about 80 percent of the league personnel coming to the games already had the necessary travel documents, since a number of teams train in the preseason in the United States, and many teams have players who for a variety of reasons travel to the United States from their home countries.When a visa or border pass was needed, Laredo city officials sent a letter to American immigration officials vouching for the player or coach. Only a few were denied entry, Mansur said.Still, the transportation was taxing.The Tecolotes have one bus and two vans to ferry their 30 players and coaches and baseball equipment. Inspections of vehicles entering the United States took a long time. And to get all the needed people and gear into position for each home game took many daily trips across the border, by van and foot.Mayor Pete Saenz, 66, of Laredo, Tex., and Rivas, 46, his counterpart, enjoy a close bond; they lobbied together in Washington last year on issues concerning their region and invited each other to the Tecolotes\u2019 two home openers this year.\u201cThis is the way we operate here,\u201d Saenz, a Democrat, said. \u201cWe understand that there are two countries, but we\u2019re neighborly and helpful, and it\u2019s very much part of our culture. Even though I\u2019m very much a U.S. citizen and patriotic as well \u2014 and they are very patriotic as Mexicans \u2014 that doesn\u2019t divide us.\u201dMany of the players believe that whatever happens with the wall or border relations, they will still serve as a bridge between the cities.After a recent game in Nuevo Laredo, the Tecolotes quickly showered and jammed into the team\u2019s two vans. At the border crossing, 17 players hopped out, crossed quickly through the American checkpoint and on to the hotel where they park their cars or get a ride home.\u201cIt feels like one team is uniting and breaking down the barrier of the border in a way,\u201d said first baseman Roberto Lopez, 32, who was born in San Diego and raised on both sides of the border. \u201cWe\u2019re not all on the same page with the wall and the border, but we\u2019re here just playing baseball.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Maya Rudolph Became the Master of Impressions", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "FeatureThe actress and comedian can move up and down the scales of race, age and gender with hilarious ease \u2014 a talent that grew from finding her place in a world where no one looked like her.Supported bySeparate from the irrefutable fact that God looks like Maya Rudolph is the equally remarkable revelation that Maya Rudolph looks like God \u2014 that is, she looks at you the same way, you must imagine, that God takes in his creation: happy to see it, while somehow existentially disappointed in it, but forgiving of it and still maintaining affection for it, even though it has absolutely let him down in some indefinable way only he can understand. Her wide eyes, which lend themselves so easily to bald astonishment or mania in her comedy, turn down one fraction of one degree at the outer corners when at rest, lending a suggestion of ruefulness to her neutral gaze. The effect is offset by Rudolph\u2019s cautious, closemouthed smile, which rests on her face as easily as powder on a puff. It\u2019s invigorating to find yourself the subject of a look so wistful, even if the expression is inadvertent. It makes you want to be the better version of yourself Maya Rudolph apparently knows you can be.Traditionally, one of the slipperiest things about talking to God is trying to tell someone else about it after the fact. It\u2019s the same with Maya Rudolph. Her comedy is so rooted in elasticized facial expressions and meticulously off-kilter impressions that attempts to recreate conversations with her inevitably fall flat. One of the funniest things Rudolph said at our first meeting, as we sat in a San Fernando Valley French bistro tucking into hot, pricey fries so good they could have been from McDonald\u2019s, was: \u201cO.K., well.\u201dShe was telling the story of the time she was bitten by a black-widow spider while getting a massage on a girls\u2019 vacation that many comedy fans might commit real-life murder to attend, with her \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d friends Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Ana Gasteyer and the writers Paula Pell and Emily Spivey. Rudolph was doing an impression of Gasteyer the moment Rudolph explained to her that she was possibly about to die.Her Gasteyer was a 120 percent concentration: angular head movements; precise intentional blinks; a modulated operatic voice \u2014 classic Gasteyer, but swirled with the essential oils of her performance as a tightly wound 1990s Martha Stewart. Rudolph\u2019s account of the fiasco was bursting with rollicking impressions \u2014 Poehler taking charge with peppy fortitude; Dratch trying to discreetly escape to a shower \u2014 but to print the transcript would be a disservice to Rudolph, because the transcript is simply not funny. The element that brings tears of laughter to your eyes is not the words themselves, but the curious, thrilling sensation of witnessing other people\u2019s faces and voices emerge from Rudolph\u2019s own.It\u2019s tough to put a finger on exactly when Maya Rudolph became someone Americans love to love. They liked her on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d when she demonstrated a particular knack for impersonating musical divas across time and race. They liked her, too, in the 2011 film \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d when she turned the part of the ostensible straight-woman \u2014 the bridal tether against which the titular maids jostle like Mylar balloons in the wind \u2014 into a character at once heartfelt and grotesque. At some point, though, viewers began to regard Rudolph with an enthusiasm normally reserved for a three-day weekend. Like those holidays, she comes around fairly regularly: stealing scenes in movies, turning up for delightful guest arcs in prime time. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like everybody has a song,\u201d Poehler told me, \u201cand I think Maya\u2019s song is like a really good popular song that will stand the test of time.\u201dNearly 20 years in, Rudolph\u2019s career appears to be entering a platinum era. Earlier this summer, she wrapped filming on a 2019 Netflix movie directed by Poehler, inspired by their real-life vacations: \u201cWine Country.\u201d This year, she\u2019s up for an Emmy for playing, well, God; Rudolph captivated viewers in a two-episode stint on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d as an all-powerful cosmic decider. Her \u201cJudge\u201d was goofy, charming and sinisterly unreadable \u2014 perhaps her strongest-ever flexing of her ability to embody multiple personalities concurrently. This month, she\u2019ll star in \u201cForever,\u201d a new streaming series for Amazon. Less a traditional comedy than a surreal minimalist comedy, it offers an opportunity for Rudolph to display a quality rarely seen in two-minute comedy sketches about space travel: pathos.Why has the nation now decided to pine for Maya Rudolph? Perhaps it\u2019s not so much a sudden appreciation for the chameleonic ability to slide up and down the spectrum of races, ages and personae that she\u2019s always possessed, but that a more fundamental aspect of her character is just now coming into view: the groundedness behind the fun-house reflections. In a world that seems increasingly, exhaustingly unpredictable \u2014 unbound by rules of any sort \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be nice to crawl into a bottle of wine with Maya Rudolph, wearing matching silk jumpsuits, and listen to her canny assessments of what\u2019s really going on?Two years after Rudolph\u2019s birth, her father, working alongside Stevie Wonder, produced Riperton\u2019s album \u201cPerfect Angel,\u201d featuring the song that would be Riperton\u2019s biggest hit: \u201cLovin\u2019 You,\u201d a spare, dreamy number that showcased Riperton\u2019s mastery of the so-called whistle register \u2014 precariously high notes at the upper upper reaches of what can be produced in the human vocal tract. The song\u2019s origins as a lullaby for Rudolph are preserved in vinyl grooves; the album cut ends with Riperton cooing, \u201cMaya.\u201d \u201cLovin\u2019 You\u201d hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1975, generating intense, sometimes rattling public interest in Riperton.\u201cWhen I was a kid, and people would come up to me or stare at me because of my mom, I didn\u2019t like it. I really didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Rudolph told me. \u201cI used to think, Oh, they\u2019re staring at my hair, because it\u2019s so big and ugly,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t realize people were just staring at my mother, like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s her daughter!\u2019 I didn\u2019t know; I was a kid. And kids always personalize things.\u201dIn the early \u201970s, when Rudolph\u2019s parents wed, there were about 65,000 black-and-white married couples in the United States. Rudolph and her older brother, Marc, are members of what is sometimes called the Loving generation \u2014 a miniature population boom of mixed-race individuals born in the years immediately following the 1967 Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court decision, which struck down state laws criminalizing interracial marriage. Marc was born a year after the ruling, when their parents were living in Chicago. Rudolph recalls hearing stories about the racism that permeated the family\u2019s lives; when her father entered the apartment building where they lived, she said, he would have to conceal her brother so that the landlady wouldn\u2019t see him entering with a black child. When Riperton became pregnant a second time, the family determined to quit Chicago for a new environment. To choose a nesting spot, they visited friends in various cities across the United States (a tactic employed by Rudolph\u2019s pregnant character in the 2009 film \u201cAway We Go\u201d) before settling in Gainesville, where Rudolph was born.\u201cNo,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did.\u201dAfter her mother signed with Epic Records, the family moved to Los Angeles, where most of the people she knew were, she recalls, \u201ceither black or white-slash-Jewish.\u201d She embraced the closest analogue she could find on television: Lisa Bonet, an actress just a couple of years older, who played the daughter of two black parents, despite having a white mother in real life. \u201cI was obsessed with \u2018The Cosby Show,\u2019 but mainly because of Lisa Bonet,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cThere is no prettier creature in the universe.\u201d Their shared racial background afforded Rudolph an opportunity to brag. \u201cI\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019m mixed, too!\u2019\u2009\u201d She rolled her eyes at the implied physical comparison. \u201c\u2009\u2018Just like Lisa Bonet!\u2019\u2009\u201dI asked Rudolph if she was often asked the question perennially posed to mixed-race kids, in what always feels like a sleazy attempt to catch you in a lie about being multiple things simultaneously: Which side do you identify with? \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. I admitted that, more than black or white, I\u2019ve always felt closest to other mixed people \u2014 regardless of race \u2014 because they\u2019re the ones who grow up being asked questions like that. Rudolph nodded. \u201cMeeting other mixed kids has always affected me. It was like part of a secret society.\u201dHold your heart carefully before you read this next sentence: Rudolph\u2019s father \u2014 in her words, a \u201cpretty adorable Jew\u201d \u2014 did not know how to do his daughter\u2019s hair after his wife\u2019s death. \u201cSo much of my childhood was dealing with my hair and being super embarrassed by it, mainly because I grew up being the only mixed kid,\u201d she said. Rudolph and her brother were raised in an affluent part of the Westwood neighborhood in Los Angeles. The school Rudolph attended was so white that one of her grade-school friends was Gwyneth Paltrow. To the white people outside their family, she and her brother looked black. But their black relatives lived halfway across the country in Chicago; they saw them only on visits. \u201cI never felt like my black cousins,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt loved, but I didn\u2019t feel culturally. ...\u201d She trailed off. \u201cI was the kid that lived in California who didn\u2019t grow up around the family.\u201dHer independent attempts to style her \u201csuper, super, superthick and supercurly\u201d hair were hapless. \u201cI was just completely lost,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom died when I was 7, so when you don\u2019t have a woman \u2014\u201d She cut herself off. \u201cFirst of all, hair products that exist today did not exist when I was a child. The detangling system that I use now on my children is light-years beyond anything that would\u2019ve ever happened to me growing up in Westwood.\u201dRiperton\u2019s sisters would perform labor-intensive black-hair maintenance on their niece during their California sojourns. \u201cMy neighbors used to say, \u2018We could hear you screaming across the street.\u2019 My aunties would come to town from Chicago and get the marcel iron out,\u201d she said.Her hair remained an object of fascination for strangers into adulthood. In college, a student came up to her and remarked: \u201cYour hair is so ethnic. Can I touch it?\u201d (\u201cNo.\u201d) \u201cI actually have an aversion to that word, way more than people say they hate the word \u2018moist.\u2019 I hate the word \u2018ethnic\u2019 in that way. It\u2019s like they\u2019re talking about a print.\u201dFrom a young age, comedy was Rudolph\u2019s defense against other people\u2019s intrusions. \u201cI know that part of owning being funny was an armor, and was, like, to literally not cry,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cIt\u2019s a protection. Just be like: \u2018Oh, yeah! I\u2019m the lady with the crazy hair!\u2019\u2009\u201d Intentional zaniness, she said, is \u201cso much better than the painful alternative. The alternative is I\u2019m an ugly duckling. I\u2019m just a weirdo.\u201dIf people were familiar with her mother, they \u201cwanted to know why I wasn\u2019t as black as my mother, more or less,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t seem as culturally black.\u201d They also knew that her mother was gone. \u201cIt really didn\u2019t help that it was a public experience,\u201d Rudolph said, of growing up in the aftermath of her death. Two months after the event, Rudolph appeared on the cover of Jet magazine alongside her father and brother; an inside spread featured photographs and a detailed description of her motherless seventh-birthday pool party. \u201cIt was weird to grow up that way, thinking, I\u2019m the kid whose mom died, and everybody knows it \u2014 or at least you feel like everybody knows it.\u201dIt was fitting, then, that Rudolph, who before second grade had already been assigned two seemingly permanent identities \u2014 the kid who looked different and the girl without a mother \u2014 would develop a virtuosic talent for becoming other people, transforming herself, in the process, into someone it was impossible to exactly pin down.One of the people Rudolph memorably became was the Italian fashion designer Donatella Versace. On \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d where Rudolph was a cast member from 2000 to 2007, she portrayed Versace, with a satin-flat mantilla of white-blond hair, as hazy and psychotic, frequently possessed by whiplash bursts of anger yet ultimately softhearted. Her Versace was held captive by her own industriousness, forever taking on new projects (a tape of Versace children\u2019s songs sung by herself, a line of Hot Pocket-inspired Versace Pockets) yet also Champagne-drunk and quite sleepy. While not by any stretch a flattering portrait, it hovered just north of cruel. In Rudolph\u2019s hands, Versace was not dumb \u2014 merely too glamorous for the world and occasionally hampered by a thick Italian accent. It was an impression in the truest sense of the word \u2014 not an identical copy but a blend of heightened tics and imagined quirks that felt so true to the idea of a person that the real version paled by comparison.You didn\u2019t even have to exist for Rudolph to inhabit you fully; her character Megan, the anxious, awkward, striving-to-be-noticed teenage host of her school\u2019s morning news program, \u201cWake Up, Wakefield,\u201d was such an accurate depiction of a poor-postured adolescent that it was almost physically painful to watch Megan\u2019s dreams of being cool fail to come true in every one of her sketches.Rudolph joined \u201cS.N.L.\u201d at the tail end of the 1999-2000 season, and it swiftly took over her life. \u201cIt was literally my everything,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy baby and my husband all at once. I cared about it more than my laundry or my food, which \u2014 neither were being well taken care of. I gave all my energy to that show. Plus you\u2019re creating a new show every week, so it was just really intense \u2014 in a good way. In a way that I liked.\u201dBlack women have been habitually underrepresented in the cast of \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Rudolph was only the fourth since the show\u2019s 1975 debut. \u201cWhen I did \u2018S.N.L.,\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like I was hired to be the black lady, which can happen a lot,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cWho knows? Maybe I was and no one told me.\u201dRudolph describes \u201cS.N.L.\u201d as a positive experience but concedes that there were moments of disappointment, when the writing was out of her hands. \u201cThere were times I was frustrated, like, \u2018Why can\u2019t I [expletive] just play that role?\u2019 But obviously the person next to me that\u2019s white is going to play that white character.\u201dAs in her childhood, her hair marked her as an outsider. In her limited on-camera experience before \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d she recalled, \u201cevery time I\u2019d work, they\u2019d be like, \u2018I really don\u2019t \u2014 like, can I touch? \u2014 I really don\u2019t know what to do with your hair.\u2019 They would just say the most awful, disgusting things.\u201d When she arrived at Studio 8H, she encountered a new obstacle: \u201cMy hair was natural when I started \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 but it was so thick to get under the wigs.\u201dShe began devoting several hours a week to altering its texture, including a standing Friday-night blowout appointment with her friend Jodi Mancuso, who ran the hair department. The blow-dry station \u201cwas on the same hallway as a lot of the dudes\u2019 dressing rooms. And every [expletive] Friday night, we\u2019d hear some [expletive] white guy walking down the hall going, \u2018Is something burning in here? What\u2019s burning?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cI\u2019m like\u201d \u2014 Rudolph\u2019s lips and voice tensed, and she enunciated every exasperated syllable \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018I\u2019m. Get-ting. My. Hair. Done.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cIt was too hard,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd nobody else understands or cares, when they don\u2019t have kids. They\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s cool!\u2019\u2009\u201d she said, turning away with a distracted nod. \u201c\u2009\u2018What are you guys doing tonight?\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re going to see Justin Timberlake because Andy\u2019s doing \u201cDick in a Box\u201d with him! What are you doing?\u2019 And I was like\u201d \u2014 Rudolph affected the faraway stare of a revenant \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018My daughter\u2019s sick. I\u2019m going home.\u2019\u2009\u201dMembers of the public familiar with the careers of Rudolph and Anderson react to their long-term relationship in one of two ways: Either they are surprised to learn that Rudolph and Anderson have been a couple since 2001 or they knew that but are surprised to remember it. Perhaps it\u2019s that a high-minded film auteur would not seem to possess a wacky enough personality to pair with a woman who earned a living parodying Beyonc\u00e9 from Destiny\u2019s Child as \u201cBritanica\u201d from \u201cGemini\u2019s Twin\u201d; perhaps it\u2019s that Maya Rudolph is not Daniel Day-Lewis. Often people\u2019s response to the couple takes the form of jocular fetishization, as when New York Magazine\u2019s The Cut published a short opinion piece titled \u201cPaul Thomas Anderson and Maya Rudolph Are the Greatest Celebrity Couple,\u201d affectionately citing, as a piece of evidence, an unsmiling candid paparazzi photo of them walking side by side. There have been instances, however, when the teasing has overreached and Rudolph has, like her parents, found her interracial relationship the object of prurient interest. She recalled a comedy writer who told her that her and Anderson\u2019s children were \u201cquadroons or octoroons\u201d \u2014 \u201cbecause people think that being aggressive is funny, I guess.\u201dAlthough they are not married, Rudolph refers to Anderson as \u201cmy husband\u201d in conversation, as when a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 told her that a man once introduced himself to the restaurant\u2019s staff as \u201cthe unofficial mayor of the Valley\u201d and Rudolph instantly blurted, \u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t my husband.\u201d She said it felt \u201cooky\u201d to keep referring to her long-term partner as her \u201cboyfriend\u201d after the birth of their daughter (they now have four children); she likes \u201chusband\u201d because \u201cpeople know what that means. It means he\u2019s the father of my child, and I live with him, and we are a couple, and we are not going anywhere.\u201d\u201cForever\u201d asks a lot of its viewers. It doesn\u2019t require them to have a casual familiarity with centuries of fake monarchical successions or jump through multiple tangled timelines. Instead it tests their capacity for existential dread \u2014 but funny. As a unit of time, the concept of forever is inherently unsettling to humans; an idea of which we have a broad working definition, but which none of us can actually experience. On the show, forever is a state that is quiet to the point of being sepulchral, with no electronic distractions (though there is shuffleboard). It is suffused with slowly deepening panic, unhurried but increasingly restless. Most TV shows are something you turn to to escape real life, but this one almost works the opposite way; real life is a pressure release valve for \u201cForever.\u201dLike Rudolph, Armisen is mixed-race \u2014 a fact to which she partly attributes their closeness. His background is Venezuelan, German and Korean. On \u201cForever,\u201d their union of blends adds a further layer of ambiguity to the environment; June and Oscar are residents of a nondescript California suburb, but they look as if they could be from anywhere.\u201cHis impression of me is the most upsetting impression I\u2019ve heard,\u201d she said, hunching her shoulders. In a voice that sounded like an irritated version of her own, but colored with Armisen\u2019s intonation, she looked askance and asked: \u201c\u2009\u2018Why am I cold?\u2019\u2009\u201d Everyone, she said, tells her the impression is valid. \u201cLiterally, I have more fun working with him than, like, most things in life.\u201d While Armisen and Rudolph\u2019s close friendship inspired them to collaborate again, the result is surprisingly macabre. \u201cForever\u201d is saturated with death.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of death. But I\u2019ve been more fearful in the past, and lately I\u2019ve been more like, \u2018Oh, I hope we all get to go somewhere.\u2019\u2009\u201d Rudolph said this as we sat across from each other in a pair of human-size bird cages. We\u2019d been wandering around a brand-new outdoor plaza in search of a quiet spot to talk. In classic upscale-California-mall style, that ended up being these bird cages. We each crawled inside one. \u201cThe show feels like scratching an itch to me a little bit,\u201d she said.Rudolph\u2019s performance in the second episode of \u201cForever\u201d is heart-rending. Without betraying key elements of the plot: Her character is in a consumer-electronics store, trying to make a purchase, when she breaks down in tears. It\u2019s a depiction of grieving that will prick anyone who has ever been caught off guard by a sudden longing for a lost person. It also feels like a distinctly adult moment of mourning. I asked Rudolph if she recalls what grieving was like as a 7-year-old.\u201cFor many, many years,\u201d she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t even touch this conversation. Like my mom was always \u2014 it was such a painful \u2014\u201d She changed course. \u201cI don\u2019t remember if I ever did proper grieving. I know I did, but it came out in ways \u2014 like when I was a kid, I went to a new school and I kicked people. I was like the kicker for a year. And then people tell me stories that I don\u2019t remember, like I\u2019d be crying at a roller-skating party, and they were like: \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying?\u2019 And I wanted to skate with a boy, and they said that I was like\u201d \u2014 she quaked with sobs \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018My grandma died.\u2019 Which wasn\u2019t true! But I was [expletive] laying it on thick. I definitely think that children process very differently. And I\u2019m genuinely fascinated by it, so I wish I knew all the ways that I do or did, but I don\u2019t. But I know that the place that I was with it most of my life was more of a, \u2018Poor me, why me?\u2019It was less fun to be the child of a famous person when she wasn\u2019t backstage. Rudolph repeated multiple times her request that any pleasantries I may or may not have exchanged with zero to four of her children at any point during our interview sessions (all of which took place in public spaces, rather than at her home) not be described. \u201cI grew up with people knowing who my mother was,\u201d she added, \u201cand that isn\u2019t lost on me. I understand that I probably have more of an awareness of strangers\u2019 recognizing me.\u201dAfter her mother\u2019s death, strangers started stopping Rudolph to share their emotional reactions with her, \u201cabout things,\u201d she said, \u201cthat were really kind of intense, sometimes. Complete strangers would just be like: \u2018I felt like she was this angel!\u2019 And you\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019m 16. Why are you telling me about my dead mother?\u2019\u2009\u201d It happened so often that Rudolph wondered if she were drawing them out. \u201cHonestly, I used to think \u2014 I was like, Do I have, like, a power?\u201dOne sun-dappled morning in late August, she and I sat on a bench under a canopy of plane trees, looking out over the concentric circles of gardens at the Getty Center. I asked her if she can usually tell when someone has recognized her but hasn\u2019t said anything.\u201cIt just happened,\u201d she said, not moving her head. Rudolph was wearing a tiered sundress in a muted rainbow geometric pattern and no makeup. Even behind her white cat-eye sunglasses, her freckled face was still familiar. I asked her to tell me the next time she saw someone spot her, and almost immediately, she nodded at a cluster of women on a lower level of the garden. \u201cThis group is the group,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cThe lady that\u2019s second to last, with the white shirt, she\u2019s letting all her friends know where we\u2019re sitting.\u201d As Rudolph narrated, the group\u2019s pace slowed. \u201cThey\u2019re all checking us out.\u201d They continued to walk back and forth over the same patch of path, like a gang of Ms. Pac-Mans trapped between two walls. \u201cSo they\u2019re just getting a better peek,\u201d Rudolph continued. \u201cBut you know what, they\u2019re not bothering \u2014 oh!\u201d She interrupted herself as one of the women jumped to the back of the line to walk the path yet again. \u201cShe\u2019s getting a second peek! Look at that. But they\u2019re not taking pictures.\u201d She can\u2019t ask for more than that.As we watched, the group of women exited their well-worn patch of garden and moved to the upper level, where we were seated, a bold maneuver that allowed them to pass directly in front of us, as close as polite American society would permit.This is the thorny part of finding yourself in the public role of people\u2019s fantasy friend: Your friends are everywhere, and they\u2019d love to see you. Rudolph seems as if she could be your pal because maybe she could be. She is fun and casual. Poehler says people sense \u201ca really warm mother and maternal thread\u201d in Rudolph. \u201cThey\u2019re sensing it correctly,\u201d she added. Rudolph doesn\u2019t travel with a team in tow; there is no bodyguard lurking at a discreet distance. But because she\u2019s so approachable, she is approached \u2014 probably more than any one person approaching her would realize. (Almost never when she\u2019s with a man, she has noticed; people wait for \u201cthe minute the man steps away.\u201d) The daily life of Maya Rudolph is jam-packed with people\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to meet Maya Rudolph, because she\u2019s not quite aloof enough to seem off limits.Instead, she\u2019s a canvas \u2014 for herself, in her impressions, but more exceptionally, for others as well. She is strangers\u2019 down-to-earth friend, if only they could meet her. She is their unwitting emotional confidante. She is black, unless she\u2019s not black enough, in which case she is weird. She is smiling slightly and regarding the manicured garden in peaceful contemplation, or perhaps so she will not inadvertently make affable eye contact with a gawking visitor and embolden them to invite themselves over. It can be exhilarating to be universal. But it\u2019s also a little exhausting.Rudolph estimates that about half the people who come up to her aren\u2019t exactly fans. She is, she said, more \u201crecognizable\u201d than famous. They just want to confirm her identity.Usually, she tells them who she is. But recently a woman interrupted her when she was in a department store searching for a pair of shoes. \u201cI was in a zone,\u201d she told me, and mimed inspecting a shoe in her hand. The woman tapped her on the shoulder, so that Rudolph would face her. \u201cShe said, \u2018Excuse me, aren\u2019t you that lady?\u2019\u2009\u201dWas she?\u201cI just looked quizzical.\u201d Rudolph made the expression you might make if someone asked you what time it was on Mars. \u201cShe said: \u2018No? Aren\u2019t you the lady from \u201cBridesmaids\u201d?\u2019 And I went\u201d \u2014 she gave an understated, bewildered head shake \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018No.\u2019\u2009\u201dCaity Weaver is a writer at large for the magazine and a writer for the New York Times Styles section.

{"Headline": "The Best and Worst Moments of the 2018 Emmys", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDid you hear the one about the Emmys\u2019 being super diverse this year?NBC turned over this year\u2019s telecast to Lorne Michaels, and the ceremony at times felt like a glammed-up installment of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d with a heavy dose of the show\u2019s past and present stars. As with most episodes of \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d the results were decidedly mixed. Performers like Mr. Thompson and Leslie Jones enlivened the evening, but several bits, like a running gag featuring Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen as inept Emmy experts, fell flat.As the hosts, Mr. Jost and Mr. Che reprised the give and take of their \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segments on \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d cracking wise about subjects like Ronan Farrow, Roseanne Barr and the death of traditional television.\u201cOur network NBC has the most nominations of any broadcast network,\u201d Mr. Che said. \u201cWhich is kind of like being the sexiest person on life support.\u201dAs has become typical at Emmy telecasts, there were also plenty of Netflix jokes.With the perennial winner \u201cVeep\u201d out of the running this year, the Emmy Awards were guaranteed to crown a new top comedy. But the competition seemed like an even split between FX\u2019s whimsically avant-garde \u201cAtlanta\u201d and Amazon\u2019s period charmer \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201dIn the end, it wasn\u2019t close. \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d dominated the category, taking home five awards Monday night, the most of any program. The haul included the top award as well as best comic actress for Rachel Brosnahan and best comedy writing and directing for the creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino. When Alex Borstein was announced in the supporting actress category, she ascended the stage in delightfully dramatic fashion:\u201cOh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god!\u201d said an ecstatic Mr. Winkler, 72, who\u2019d leapt onto the stage to accept his award for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series, bringing the audience to its feet. He played Gene Cousineau on HBO\u2019s dark comedy \u201cBarry.\u201d\u201cI wrote this 43 years ago,\u201d he said of his acceptance speech. Mr. Winkler was first nominated in 1976 for his role as Arthur Fonzarelli, who exemplified midcentury American cool in a black leather jacket, on \u201cHappy Days.\u201dIt has become commonplace for award shows to highlight the exclusion of minorities with a knowing wink at how far things have (sort of) come, and the Emmys were no different. In addition to the opening musical number, Mr. Che appeared in a pretaped bit in which he handed out \u201creparation Emmys\u201d to veteran black performers who have been overlooked by the voting academy.Jaleel White (\u201cFamily Matters\u201d), Marla Gibbs (nominated five times for her role as Florence on \u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d), Tichina Arnold (\u201cMartin,\u201d \u201cEverybody Hates Chris\u201d) and Kadeem Hardison (\u201cA Different World\u201d) were among the famous faces who happily accepted Mr. Che\u2019s acknowledgment of their impressive careers.The catch: The co-host \u201cstole\u201d the statues from the four-time winner Bill Cosby. But Mr. Cosby\u2019s wins did not actually have anything to do with those performers not having their own awards. Rather, these actors remain unsung by Emmy voters because of a system that has largely overlooked black artists for decades.Going into the Emmy Awards, fans of \u201cThe Americans\u201d could be forgiven for indulging in some quixotic wishful thinking: Might the great FX spy series, virtually ignored by the Emmys throughout its run, claim the top drama award for its final season?He started his speech paying tribute to his mother, who he said had passed away two weeks ago. \u201cMom always believed in finding the sunshine in things, and she adored my girlfriend, Jan,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.Mr. Weiss was referring to Jan Svendsen, the chief creative officer at Charity Network, and added: \u201cYou wonder why I don\u2019t like to call you my girlfriend? Because I want to call you my wife.\u201dMs. Svendsen\u2019s jaw dropped, and she said yes before Mr. Weiss had even popped the question. The crowd cheered as Ms. Svendsen walked to the stage. Once she arrived, Mr. Weiss told her, \u201cThis is the ring that my dad put on my mom\u2019s finger 67 years ago.\u201dHe knelt and said, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d\u201cThe only white people that thank Jesus are Republicans and ex-crack heads,\u201d Mr. Che joked, regarding acceptance speeches at predominantly white awards shows. As the night went on, there were a few callbacks to his comment, but the \u201cWestworld\u201d star Thandie Newton, who won for best supporting actress in drama, had the best one.This is not normal. The world\u2019s gone a bit crazy. I mean, for somebody like me, a nobody from nowhere, gets this sweet gig \u2014 free suit, new boots \u2014 just because I don\u2019t like men. That\u2019s a joke, of course. Just jokes, fellas. Calm down. #Notallmen, but a lot of them. It is just jokes, but what are jokes these days? We don\u2019t know. Nobody knows what jokes are, especially not men. Am I right, fellas? That\u2019s why I\u2019m presenting alone. There is a winner and the Emmy goes to Stephen Daldry, \u201cThe Crown.\u201d And of course Stephen could not be with us tonight to accept the Emmy on his own behalf because of probably me. So I think I\u2019ll just leave now and that\u2019s well done, him.And just like that, he was gone. It wasn\u2019t clear if that was Mr. Glover beneath all that makeup \u2014 he hadn\u2019t walked the red carpet earlier in the evening.

In these films, Superman and his girlfriend, Lois Lane, encounter a variety of villains like mad scientists, flying robots and mummies, as well as more real-world threats like Nazis. The shorts are very much a product of their time (as with other animated shorts produced during World War II, there are a few cringe-inducing moments of Japanese stereotyping), but the animation still holds up very well. The shorts are notable for their use of rotoscoping, an animation technique that allows animators to trace over live-action footage in order to produce more realistic action. The design also served as a big influence on later DC animation, including \u201cBatman: The Animated Series\u201d and \u201cSuperman: The Animated Series.\u201dSuperman made his comics debut in 1938, and he first appeared on the big screen three years later in these animated shorts, most of which were produced by Max Fleischer (a handful at the end of its run were produced by Famous Studios).

The death of Heath Ledger at age 28 certainly played a role, but the film itself broke new ground for complex superhero storytelling onscreen.

The film asks how good can succeed in the face of such evil, and what lengths we will pursue in order to achieve justice. Much of the film\u2019s effectiveness is owed to Ledger, who posthumously received an Oscar for his performance.

Lizzie Borden Is Helping With That.", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "Ms. Sevigny takes a career turn with \u201cLizzie,\u201d producing and starring in an arty horror movie about Lizzie Borden and the infamous ax murders.Supported byI was wrong.Ms. Sevigny, it turns out, has begun a relatively radical career turn. Tired of being defined more by her offscreen aura than by her acting \u2014 hello, she was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe \u2014 Ms. Sevigny produced \u201cLizzie\u201d so that she could, for the first time in her 50-film career, play the lead part. Set in 1892, the movie finds a rage-filled Ms. Sevigny, 43, romancing Kristen Stewart\u2019s Irish housemaid and literally smashing the patriarchy (in the face, with an ax) in a series of scenes involving full nudity.\u201cNow I\u2019m ready to direct a feature,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s where I hope I\u2019m headed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never lived west of Third Avenue, and it feels very adult,\u201d she said with a giddy smile, as we sat on buckets of plaster and drank iced tea from a bougie shop down the block.Ms. Sevigny is perhaps one of her generation\u2019s finest character actresses. \u201cChlo\u00eb\u2019s artistic choices are refreshingly dangerous,\u201d said Bob Gazzale, president of the American Film Institute. \u201cTime and again, she invites us into her own fragility \u2014 and that invitation is hand-delivered with a strength, courage and confidence that few are able to convey.\u201d\u201cEveryone is made up of different colors, and sometimes I do feel like I only get to be one,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said.She sighed and stared out the window in silence.\u201cIt sounds so pretentious,\u201d she said after a long time. \u201cBut I have to work harder because of the annoying It Girl thing. It gets in the way of recognizing my acting. I\u2019d rather be cool than a bunch of other things, I guess.\u201dShe offered a tight smile, which seemed to serve as an edict: Let\u2019s change the subject.Ms. Sevigny decided to produce the project. \u201cI\u2019d never gotten to carry anything, and so I decided, for the first time, to take the producing plunge,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard because I had no idea what I was doing. I used to have a weird removal from the business side of film. I\u2019d retreat to, \u2018It\u2019s an art!\u2019\u201d\u201cLizzie is this feminist American outlaw, sort of a pioneer for the idea of female autonomy,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cEven today, I think a lot of women find themselves in circumstances where they\u2019re under a man\u2019s control \u2014 husband, father, boss \u2014 and are desperate to change those circumstances.\u201dMs. Sevigny said she hoped that \u201cLizzie,\u201d with its central theme of patriarchal oppression and abuse, would \u201ccontinue the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up conversation.\u201d While directed by a man, Craig William Macneill, \u201cLizzie\u201d was also financed by women, produced by women and employed women as principal crew members (production designer, editor).But Ms. Sevigny added that she had not experienced #MeToo abuse during her career, at least not to the degree as some other actresses, including those who have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Ms. Sevigny said her worst moment came during an audition, when a female casting director, using vulgar language, told her, \u201cYou have to make men want to\u201d have sex with you \u201cand women want to be you.\u201d\u201cI left that room, which was full of people, and cried in the parking lot,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cI\u2019d never been made to feel like such a commodity.\u201d She added, \u201cPTSD is too strong, but that moment affected me for years, and it still does.\u201dAnother tight smile.Yet \u201cLizzie\u201d also seems to represent an effort by Ms. Sevigny to push into more populist territory.\u201cI have been very calculated in my career, and now I\u2019m kicking myself for some of those decisions \u2014 the things I didn\u2019t do,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cI used to be afraid to do anything that might be seen as frivolous or silly. Big, commercial, whatever. When I was younger, I guess I was snobby.\u201dShe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve got to have more fun with acting. I\u2019ve always been so stressed and nervous about getting it right.\u201dWith that, Ms. Sevigny started asking me questions. Was the plaster dust bothering me? Because it was starting to bother her. What did I think about her new apartment, anyway?\u201cI think it\u2019s very adult,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "HBO and Netflix, Reluctant Rivals, Party Down After Winning 23 Emmys Apiece", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Richard Plepler, the chairman and chief executive officer of HBO, stood at the center of an airy plaza at the Pacific Design Center, where the network has held its post-Emmys party for more than a decade.Another awards season had just drawn to a close, with HBO and Netflix winning 23 Emmys apiece. HBO has long taken pride in its dominance of the Emmys, an honor that came close to ending Monday night. But Mr. Plepler bristled at the notion that there was a rivalry between the network he runs and the well-funded digital upstart.\u201cThis reductive idea that their success comes at our expense, or our success comes at their expense, is just not accurate,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cYou know how you know it\u2019s not accurate? Look at the last three, four years! We\u2019ve grown more in the last three, four years than at any time in history. They\u2019ve grown more. We\u2019ve done great work. They\u2019ve done great work. This is not a binary dynamic. Now \u2014\u2014 \u201dMr. Plepler looked to his left.\u201cLet me give the producer a hug,\u201d he said, moving into the arms of Lorne Michaels, the producer of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and the producer of the Monday night Emmys broadcast.\u201cMazel tov!\u201d Mr. Plepler said.Things had looked dicey for Mr. Plepler and his team until the final moments of the ceremony, when HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d took the statuette for best drama, the most prestigious award of the night.A sense of relief was palpable at the floral-themed HBO after-party. The music was not too loud, and the expansive room allowed for easy conversation. John Oliver, who had won his third Emmy in three years, in the best variety talk show category, walked by, and Mr. Plepler grabbed him and hugged him.\u201cThe thing we are proudest about is, in this incredibly fierce, competitive environment, the line of talent at our door is longer than it\u2019s ever been, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in that talent,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the network the network.\u201d\u201cAre we curating quality, are we curating excellence?\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if we continue to do that, the awards are going to come and, more importantly, talent is going to keep coming.\u201dA few tables away stood Mr. Plepler\u2019s new boss: John Stankey, an AT&T executive of three decades.\u201cThere he is, there he is,\u201d Mr. Plepler said, gesturing toward Mr. Stankey.After mentioning that the two had sat together at the Microsoft Theater, Mr. Plepler added, \u201cHe\u2019s fully in the business now.\u201dIf Mr. Plepler had played down talk of a rivalry with Netflix, Mr. Stankey did not shy away from the subject. \u201cPercentage wise,\u201d he said, \u201cwe performed a lot better, a much higher win-loss ratio.\u201dDecades ago, HBO was in the position Netflix is in now, playing the role of challenger in an industry that was set in its ways. A longtime HBO advertising motto highlighted how different it was, in form and content, from the advertising-driven television business: \u201cIt\u2019s Not TV, It\u2019s HBO.\u201dAnd as it billed itself as the home to what would be called prestige TV, its marketing materials announced with pride, year after year, that it had won more Emmys than anyone else.But now, like every champion getting on in years, HBO has found that it must adjust its strategy if it is to avoid being knocked out by the competitors \u2014 Netflix, Amazon, Hulu \u2014 who would like to take its place as the envy of the industry.Amazon, with a significantly smaller programming slate than Netflix\u2019s, also had a strong night, winning five Emmys during the telecast, including best comedy for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d The victory represented the first time a streaming service had taken the award.Netflix\u2019s 23 wins were the result of an aggressive strategy. It has reached its tentacles into many genres \u2014 from limited series, to reality shows, to stand-up specials \u2014 in an effort to appeal to almost every conceivable niche audience. The company is spending about $8 billion on content this year, roughly $6 billion more than HBO lays out annually for its programming.After the Emmys ceremony, Netflix\u2019s executives and stars packed NeueHouse, a fashionable work space in Hollywood located a few blocks from its new headquarters. Music was blasting, thanks to the of-the-moment D.J. Daisy O\u2019Dell, who had worked the CAA party on Saturday night and the Showtime party on Sunday.The revelers included Dave Chappelle, Jeff Daniels and Tiffany Haddish. They wended their way through narrow hallways covered in thick curtains in a shade best described as Netflix red. Ben Stiller held court in a murkily lit corridor until one of the many security guards present reluctantly told him he was blocking traffic.\u201cThrilled to share the night with HBO,\u201d Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix, said in an email. \u201cThe fact that our wins were across so many titles and forms made me particularly proud of the work of our creators and the team at Netflix.\u201dThe morning after the parties, the Nielsen numbers were in, and they were sobering. Despite all the hoopla \u2014 the campaign-season parties, the red-carpet events and acceptance speeches \u2014 the Emmys telecast had scored a low in the ratings, with 10.2 million viewers, a loss of 11 percent compared with last year\u2019s show.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Does Facebook Have Room for More Than One Founder?", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelling your start-up to Facebook will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for about $715 million, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.\u201cThey are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,\u201d Mr. Acton said. \u201cThey just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don\u2019t necessarily agree with.\u201dYes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook\u2019s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. That\u2019s a problem: Facebook\u2019s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.That\u2019s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It\u2019s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. \u201cYou think they can\u2019t eat any more,\u201d says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs \u201ccram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.\u201dThe bigger worry might be to SoftBank\u2019s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don\u2019t go too far.\u2022 Amazon\u2019s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to \u201censure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.\u201d\u2022 Keith Enright, Google\u2019s new chief privacy officer, told them to \u201ctake into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.\u201dFox is selling at the behest of Walt Disney, which struck a deal over the summer to buy most of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s media empire.So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy. But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed\u2019s chief, said yesterday: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider political factors.\u201dThe sportswear company\u2019s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.Another factor: Under Nike\u2019s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can\u2019t sell league-branded merchandise after 2020. That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process. Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.And:If companies\u2019 profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds. But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year. And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more.

{"Headline": "Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: The Benefits and Moral Quandaries of a World Run by Code", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. & A.If you\u2019re like me, you enjoy the fact (most of the time) that algorithms can suggest a movie to watch or a new song to play or an efficient way to organize your social media feeds. But what about an algorithm that helps the police predict who might have committed a crime? Or one that allows you to be diagnosed by a computer rather than a doctor? You\u2019d probably have some follow-up questions before deciding whether you\u2019re as comfortable with these things as with the recommendation engines on Spotify and Netflix. In \u201cHello World: Being Human in the Age of Algorithms,\u201d the mathematician Hannah Fry looks closely at the potential benefits and hazards of a world increasingly run by code. Below, she discusses a \u201cmassive wake-up call\u201d she experienced in Berlin, the scale of data mining, a person who inspired the way she talks to audiences and more.When did you first get the idea to write this book?I went to Berlin to give a talk, and I was really inexperienced and na\u00efve. I was jolly and made jokes, and said, \u201cHere\u2019s how you contain riots.\u201d If there\u2019s one city in the world that really understands what it is to be oppressed by a police state, it\u2019s Berlin. And they almost literally tore me apart on stage. It was a massive wake-up call for me. You can\u2019t sit around and play with this stuff and not realize there are wider implications for it.And then I saw governments using really substandard algorithms for really important stuff. I thought, the people who are writing these aren\u2019t talking to the people who are using them, and the people who are using them aren\u2019t talking to the people whose lives are being changed by their decisions. And I thought it was really important to bridge the gaps between those three groups.What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?Also, I\u2019ve worked in data science for ages but I didn\u2019t know just how much data the data brokers have on you. They are massive companies. There\u2019s all the standard stuff, like your name, age, gender, height. But there\u2019s also things like: whether or not you\u2019ve had an abortion or a miscarriage; what your proclaimed sexuality is and what your true sexuality is.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I thought I\u2019d do a jolly jaunt and be done with it in six months. It was much harder than I thought. There\u2019s real nuance in these questions. They don\u2019t have easy answers. To be able to answer them, or to create something that was interesting to read, I had to research so deeply. I did more work for this, and I read more, than I did for my Ph.D.The last chapter in the book is about whether or not machines can be creative, and whether a machine can recognize true beauty. So I had to define beauty in some way. I\u2019m a mathematician, do you know what I mean? Writing about \u201cWhat is art?\u201d is not something I ever thought I\u2019d be doing.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read \u201cHello World\u201d in 50 words or less.This isn\u2019t really a book about algorithms. It\u2019s about humans. It\u2019s about who we are, where we\u2019re going, what\u2019s important to us \u2014 and how that is changing with technology. I can\u2019t promise it will give any answers, but I do hope it will change the way people see the world.This interview has been condensed and edited.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShows are scrambling to hire more minorities, but the pipeline of experienced writers is thin, a problem of the industry\u2019s own making.Dailyn Rodriguez, a veteran writer and producer, said she wasn\u2019t necessarily looking to work on a new show for the coming season. But she suddenly found herself in high demand, her agents constantly fielding calls about her availability. She was what one Hollywood executive called a \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 not just a Latina, but one who had risen through the television ranks.With dozens of shows now in production, television executives are hustling to diversify their writers\u2019 rooms, the hidden nuclei of Hollywood where stories, dialogue and characters are born, and where the showrunners of tomorrow are created.A deluge of shows in this age of peak TV, with Netflix, Amazon, HBO and other services greenlighting new offerings almost daily, has also stoked demand. Many of these new series have people of color and women as lead characters, in turn pushing minorities and women to the center of the writing staff, a major step forward for writers who say they have long felt like window dressing.\u201cEveryone is eager to find that person,\u201d said Christy Haubegger, an agent at Creative Artists Agency who focuses on diversity. Ms. Haubegger has fielded so many requests for experienced writers of color that she recently created an online database, so networks and producers could look for themselves. \u201cThe demand has been that high,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t service everybody in town.\u201dBut a major reason these seasoned writers are suddenly batting away job offers is that relatively few are in the supply chain. It is a problem of Hollywood\u2019s own making.Plenty of minority and female writers are looking for jobs, but may be unknown to or overlooked by showrunners, unrepresented by agencies, or seen as lacking in experience. \u201cThe pool is wide but not deep\u201d is a common refrain. Even those at the forefront of diversification efforts acknowledge that a shortage exists. Not enough minority women have been groomed for senior writing jobs, a function not only of the industry\u2019s white male focus, but also of rarefied access, discrimination in promotions, and low entry-level pay.Whenever Jamila Hunter, head of comedy at ABC Entertainment, visits historically black colleges and talks about jobs in Hollywood, she finds herself outgunned by recruiters from Wall Street and Silicon Valley who lure graduates with tantalizing salaries. She can promise only years of dues-paying in expensive Los Angeles.Even then, there\u2019s no guarantee, given the fierce competition. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry of privileged apprenticeship,\u201d Ms. Hunter said. \u201cEconomically, there is not a pipeline for them.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one who thinks, \u2018I don\u2019t want a woman to direct my show,\u2019 or \u2018I only want white men writing this,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Aubrey, an executive with TNT. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in the trenches and it\u2019s crunchtime, it is, \u2018What is my go-to and shortlist of people I know and trust?\u2019 You have to expand your circle.\u201dWhile staffing statistics are not yet available for this year, female and minority writers and showrunners said they were seeing more people who look like them running rooms.The vast quantity of new programming has opened doors that did not exist a few years ago. Some of these shows have among the most diverse staffs in television, including \u201cDear White People,\u201d \u201cSeven Seconds,\u201d \u201cPose\u201d and \u201cMaster of None.\u201dBefore the writer and producer LaToya Morgan signed her second coveted overall deal with AMC \u2014 it gives the network ownership over everything she produces, and provides lucrative job security in return \u2014 she fielded multiple requests from potential employers. Ms. Morgan said she knew several other women of color in the same position. \u201cThere are a lot of cool and great opportunities that I don\u2019t think were there before,\u201d she said. This has a cascading effect. \u201cWhen there are more women in charge, more women are hired, said Felicia D. Henderson, a longtime writer-producer whose credits include \u201cThe Punisher\u201d and \u201cEmpire.\u201d \u201cWhen there are more black showrunners, there are more black writers on staff.\u201d And when there is more than one woman or minority writer in the room, several writers said, they are more likely to be heeded, and less likely to be called on as the voice of all women or people of color. Courtney Kemp, the showrunner of \u201cPower,\u201d calls the phenomenon \u201cBlackipedia, or Blacktionary,\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201dAt the same time, some female and minority writers question whether they are being courted because of a genuine push for diversity, or simply because male showrunners want cover from criticism.Kiersten Van Horne, a producer on \u201cBerlin Station\u201d and \u201cMistresses,\u201d said she has been told in recent months, \u201cThey\u2019re looking for an upper-level female\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re looking for diverse candidates at X level.\u201d Tracey Scott Wilson, who was a supervising producer on \u201cThe Americans,\u201d mentors younger colleagues, and said she had met white male writers who believe they were passed over because a minority or woman got their slot, even though other white men ended up being hired. \u201cThat mythology is out there and it\u2019s poisonous,\u201d she said.\u201cIf guys are mad about this stuff, they\u2019re mad about things being slightly less unfair in their favor,\u201d Mr. Slack said. The traditional path to a television writing job starts with serving as a writer\u2019s assistant \u2014 tasks include taking notes and doing research \u2014 which can lead to work as a staff writer. There are generally seven levels above that, carrying greater seniority and higher salaries, and it usually takes up to a decade to make it to the top spots of co-executive producer, executive producer and showrunner.Noelle Valdivia, a producer on the Amazon series \u201cGoliath,\u201d said she remembered being one of only one or two assistants of color when she started in the industry 12 years ago. People continue to hire alumni from their colleges or family friends, she said, and there still are not many writers\u2019 assistants of color.\u201cEveryone wants to hire diverse writers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t create them.\u201dStudios and networks have made efforts to bring along young minority writers and women. There are highly selective fellowships for up-and-comers, most of them writers of color. And, as an incentive for production companies to avoid homogeneous writing staffs, networks usually cover the salary of a so-called \u201cdiversity hire.\u201dBut the programs can carry a stigma. Ms. Saracho, of \u201cVida,\u201d said on the first day of her first television writing job in 2012, a colleague leaned over and said, \u201cYou know you\u2019re the diversity hire, right?\u201d\u201cWe wanted to accept the shame that had been heaped upon us, and prove it wasn\u2019t a given,\u201d said John Landgraf, FX\u2019s chief executive.FX had historically favored directors with extensive episodic television experience, which many women and people of color had not been given the opportunity to amass. To make the shift, the network looked to directors of short films, music videos, and independent films. \u201cIt unlocked a huge amount of talent and potential that was simply being overlooked,\u201d Mr. Landgraf said. He singled out Hiro Murai, who had never directed narrative television before the FX hit \u201cAtlanta,\u201d and has since earned an Emmy nomination.Mr. Landgraf noted that the network still had work to do. Just a third of its senior writers and executive producers in the 2018 season were people of color or women.\u201cThe good news,\u201d she said, \u201cis we can\u2019t fall off the floor.\u201dVOICESWhat\u2019s it like for women and minority writers at work on a show? Five veterans share their experiences in these edited excerpts.There was a show where one of the characters was overtly racist. In the writers\u2019 room, they didn\u2019t want to use the N-word, but they were trying to think of something else. And every single epithet you could imagine, it was just coming out, just pitching different words. And I felt myself getting angrier and angrier. I had to get up and walk out. Workwise, it had to happen, from talking in character. It still did not mean it wasn\u2019t hard. The thing about being black in a mostly white industry, particularly as a black male, is you can\u2019t lose your temper in the same way. Essentially you are an angry black man losing his temper in a way that\u2019s unprofessional, as opposed to an industry that has protected unprofessional white males in perpetua. Things are changing, things are getting better. The one thing I specifically see happening now is there are more black showrunners of both genders than any other time in television.Writers I love and respect will tell me, \u201cOh you\u2019re a unicorn, you\u2019re a higher-level female writer who\u2019s also a minority, and you\u2019re good.\u201d If you don\u2019t hit the mark and you happen to be a minority, your showrunner will assume it\u2019s because you\u2019re a minority that you\u2019re not hitting the mark.A co-executive producer of the recently ended FX series \u201cThe Americans\u201d and a television veteran of 12 years who is also a playwright.All this talk of inclusion, inclusion, inclusion. It\u2019s fine when it\u2019s not B.S. But a lot of it means a producer took a previously white male lead and is now going to make it a black female lead. And they say we need someone as a black co-writer. I get calls like that all the time. I jokingly call it a ghetto pass. Some creators have no interest in making the characters specific and grounding them in their race and/or sex. And you know you\u2019re there for the racial angle.\u201cThe Americans\u201d was a great experience. I felt heard, and I never felt like I couldn\u2019t express myself. A former journalist who joined the television industry in 2016. Her writing credits include \u201cKrypton\u201d(Syfy) and \u201cUnderground\u201d (WGN America). This past year, I had a producer tell me, with regard to a female executive he was complaining about, \u201cDon\u2019t send a girl in to do a man\u2019s job.\u201d He\u2019s no longer a producer. And there was a showrunner who, when I was working with another woman sharing an office, would say, \u201cHey, the women of color lounge!\u201d He\u2019s no longer with the show. In a lot of cases the person doing the weird thing is the person in charge. There\u2019s really nowhere you can go.Co-creator and showrunner of \u201cThe Affair\u201d (Showtime) and a producer on \u201cIn Treatment\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d; also a playwright with 11 years of television experience. I tipped the scale for the fourth season [of \u201cThe Affair\u201d] to more women than men. And it worked so much better. My writers\u2019 room was much more collaborative, better team players, all the stereotypes. The nature of the business is whose voice is the loudest, who can pitch the hardest, you succeed on other people\u2019s failures. But to have a room with a competitive spirit doesn\u2019t work for a show like mine. Also we have a significant age range in our room, from writers in their mid 20s to 60-plus, which I think helps diversity. Just, in my experience, the more disparate people\u2019s respective experiences, the more powerful the room.  Advertisement"}

Nixon asks in a recording from Sept. 19, 1971, at a time when Ms. Fonda was vehemently protesting the Vietnam War. \u201cI feel so sorry for Henry Fonda, who\u2019s a nice man. She\u2019s a great actress. She looks pretty. But boy, she\u2019s \u2026 often on the wrong track.\u201dIt certainly surprised Ms. Fonda.\u201cI had no idea how she was going to structure it, and when it opened on the tape of Nixon\u2019s voice, I just thought that was so brilliant,\u201d she said, recalling how she had initially told Ms. Lacy, \u2018I don\u2019t want a movie star documentary, because if you\u2019re going to do a real documentary about me, there\u2019s a lot more to it than just my career.\u2019\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time, and this is the most important election that I have ever experienced,\u201d she said during a telephone interview from Los Angeles, in which she spoke about coming into her own, her current passions and her next acts.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.Your public persona is that of a fiercely independent woman with little need for male support. Did you question Ms. Lacy\u2019s decision to define you by your men?You never felt that you lived up to your father\u2019s expectations \u2014 that he thought you were fat, that you made him ashamed. When did you stop seeing yourself through his eyes?Is that when you came to believe in your own worth and beauty?No, no, no, that didn\u2019t happen until I was in my 60s. I\u2019m still a work in progress. You know, when your father doesn\u2019t show up for you or isn\u2019t able to really show you that he loves you unconditionally, then you spend a lot of your life trying to be lovable rather than authentic.Your stance against the Vietnam War continues to inflame. Last month, protesters gathered at the Traverse City Film Festival, where Michael Moore gave you a lifetime achievement award. There was a veteran inside the theater who stood up, and I thought, \u201cWell, O.K., let him say his thing, and we will talk, and that will be cathartic for both of us.\u201d But instead, he said: \u201cIf I had a Congressional Medal of Honor, I would present it to you. I am so grateful that you helped end the war.\u201d It was very, very beautiful. The men and women who were outside were extremely well behaved, and I just feel badly that they don\u2019t understand the war. Because if they did, and they understood what was true then, I wouldn\u2019t be the lightning rod that I am. It would be the series of presidents and administrations, both Republican and Democrat, that they would be angry at, because we were lied to.What\u2019s the focus of your activism today? Grass-roots organizing. The organizations that are going door to door and helping people understand that the white working class is not the enemy of people of color, and vice versa. That we have to stand together against a common enemy, which is people that only care about money and power and don\u2019t give a hoot about average Americans.What do you think about #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up?I never thought I\u2019d live to see it happen. I think it emanated from Hollywood because the women who were speaking out were white and famous. And then it spread across sectors to the women who are far more vulnerable \u2014 farm workers, office workers, restaurant workers, domestic workers. If we\u2019re going to win this \u2014 by winning, I mean creating safety and dignity and respect for women of color in the workplaces \u2014 we also have to create economic equality. And we have to stand alongside women in other sectors of the economy, which is what I\u2019ve been doing.You\u2019ve said that until last year, you didn\u2019t realize that perhaps you weren\u2019t paid the same as your male co-stars. I didn\u2019t pay any attention. It never occurred to me that I was worthy to get paid the same as my male co-star. I was a good girl. Good girls don\u2019t talk about money. Good girls aren\u2019t ambitious. [Now] I ask and I fight. It\u2019s never too late.At an age when a lot of women feel rendered invisible, both personally and professionally, what are your secrets for coming out on top?This is the honest truth that I am telling you: I have always been invisible.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Remember Before You Watch \u2018BoJack Horseman\u2019 Season 5", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d may be the saddest animated comedy in TV history, and with each new batch of episodes it delves deeper into its unique brand of anthropomorphic misery: dark, witty, culturally literate \u2014 but for its loyal fans, thoroughly enjoyable. In Season 4, BoJack (voiced by Will Arnett) was forced to reckon with both his family history and a heap of newfound responsibilities. It didn\u2019t always go so well.Now it\u2019s time to savor another season of heart-wrenching \u2014 but also humorous \u2014 meditations on depression, addiction, Hollywood superficiality and whether it\u2019s possible for people (or horses who walk on two legs like people) to change. Season 5 comes to Netflix on Friday, Sept. 14. If you\u2019ve forgotten where we left BoJack and his cohorts, this guide should help you remember.The problem is that Carolyn actually forged BoJack\u2019s signature on the contract for the project. Don\u2019t judge her too harshly, though; it was a rough season for the princess. After having a miscarriage (as recounted from the far-off future in the standout ninth episode, \u201cRuthie\u201d), she broke things off with her mouse boyfriend, Ralph Stilton (Ra\u00fal Esparza). Then, an employee betrayed her. But after a pep talk from Todd in the finale, she pulls herself together and eventually tells BoJack what she did. Surprisingly, he agrees to play Philbert \u2014 and he suggests to Carolyn, who longs to be a mother, that she adopt a child on her own. It sounds as if she just might.BoJack\u2019s couch-surfing slacker buddy Todd Chavez (Aaron Paul) was busy \u2014 well, as busy as it\u2019s possible for Todd Chavez to be \u2014 in Season 4. He worked on Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s abortive campaign for California governor, got railroaded into a sham engagement to the vapid actress Courtney Portnoy (Sharon Horgan), embraced his asexual identity and launched an ill-advised business venture: clown dentists. He even got his very own episode, titled \u201cHooray! Todd Episode!\u201dBy the finale, the clown dentists are rabid, living in the woods and prone to chasing passers-by, so Todd has another stroke of genius and transforms their colony into a hot new workout program. He also embarks upon a chaste romance with Yolanda Buenaventura (Natalie Morales), an asexual salamander who works for the Better Business Bureau.In the second episode of Season 4, scenes from the early life of BoJack\u2019s mother, Beatrice (Wendie Malick) \u2014 a melancholy tale of loss, guilt and mental illness \u2014 unfolded in flashbacks. Her story continued in the season\u2019s emotional penultimate episode, \u201cTime\u2019s Arrow,\u201d which recounted her history with BoJack\u2019s dad, Butterscotch Horseman (also voiced by Arnett), whom she married over her own father\u2019s objections. Young BoJack bore the brunt of the animosity that developed between Beatrice and Butterscotch. Decades later, as the marriage continued to deteriorate, Butterscotch impregnated the family\u2019s maid, Henrietta Platchkey (Majandra Delfino), and Beatrice persuaded her to give up the baby for adoption.Unbeknown to BoJack, that child turned out to be Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack (Aparna Nancherla), who got her extraordinarily long last name from her eight gay, polyamorous, adoptive dads. After a lifetime of being told she looked like BoJack Horseman, Hollyhock comes to Los Angeles from Wichita, Kan., in hopes of finding out whether he is her biological father. A DNA test confirms that they are related, and she moves in with BoJack and begins searching for mother.In his efforts to be a good parent to Hollyhock, he takes her to meet Beatrice, now languishing and suffering from dementia, in a Santa Barbara nursing home. Eventually, they bring Beatrice to live in BoJack\u2019s house \u2014 an arrangement that ends in disaster when Beatrice starts spiking poor Hollyhock\u2019s coffee with weight-loss drugs, and the girl ends up in the hospital. When he realizes that his mother was to blame for Hollyhock\u2019s brush with death, BoJack gives up on the old lady for good, delivering her to the worst nursing home he can find.Once Hollyhock recovers, the eight gay dads whisk her back home to Kansas. But in the Season 4 finale, it becomes clear to BoJack that he isn\u2019t her father \u2014 he\u2019s her half brother. And in a grand gesture of fraternal love, he flies to Wichita in order to connect Hollyhock with her mother, Henrietta. The last time we see Hollyhock, she is on her way to meet her birth mother in Minneapolis.After ending Season 3 on the verge of suicide, the show\u2019s equine antihero was nowhere to be found in the Season 4 premiere. He surfaced in Episode 2, having left Los Angeles for Beatrice\u2019s lake house, in Michigan. After more than a year as a recluse, he returns home, determined to stop dwelling on the past. It is there that he meets Hollyhock, who initially disguises herself as BoJack\u2019s maid in a scheme to obtain a hair sample for DNA testing. When the results come back and Hollyhock comes clean, the horses seek out a number of BoJack\u2019s late-90s lovers in hopes of finding her mom.So far, everyone ends the season on a relatively upbeat note. But this is \u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d not \u201cHorsin\u2019 Around\u201d: Not everyone can wind up happy. The unlikely marriage between BoJack\u2019s former ghostwriter, Diane Nguyen (Alison Brie), and his Golden Retriever frenemy, Mr. Peanutbutter (Paul F. Tompkins), grew increasingly troubled as the season progressed. She takes a job at a blog called Girl Croosh. He runs for governor \u2014 until a fracking disaster that destroys his home, along with the rise of his evil ex, Jessica Biel (voiced by the real Jessica Biel), leads him to drop out of the race. And the distance between Mr. Peanutbutter\u2019s worldview and Diane\u2019s keeps growing.It looks as if they\u2019re rekindling their romance at the beginning of the Season 4 finale. They buy a new house, then impulsively take off on a getaway to Hawaii. Unfortunately, there\u2019s bumper-to-bumper traffic on the newly built bridge from California to the island state, and the couple ends up in a seedy motel halfway to their destination. They\u2019re making the best of it until Mr. Peanutbutter disappears for hours with some adoring fans. Back at home, he unveils a library, a rough copy of the one from \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d that he has had built for Diane.The thing is, as he should know by now, she hates grand gestures. In their final scene of the season, she likens their marriage to a Magic Eye poster: \u201cIt\u2019s messy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd, at first glance, it doesn\u2019t seem to make any sense, and it\u2019s hard to figure out. But sometimes, if you squint at it just right, everything lines up, and it\u2019s the most perfect, beautiful, amazing thing.\u201d Then, she breaks down: \u201cI\u2019m so tired of squinting.\u201d We don\u2019t know yet whether the split will be permanent, but her punkish new haircut in the Season 5 trailer doesn\u2019t bode well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "25 Years After Escobar\u2019s Death, Medell\u00edn Struggles to Demolish a Legend", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMedell\u00edn DispatchMEDELL\u00cdN, Colombia \u2014 When the mayor of Medell\u00edn showed up, he was bearing a sledgehammer.He stood with it in front of the former home of Pablo Escobar, the notorious drug lord whose cocaine empire once placed him on lists of the world\u2019s richest and most wanted.Mr. Escobar lived for years in the Monaco Building, a white, six-story edifice with a penthouse apartment on top and his family name still inscribed in fading letters on the exterior.Recently, however, attention to the building has returned, piqued by scores of international books, telenovelas and movies about Mr. Escobar.Tourists now sidle up to the gate, snapping photos and posting them on Instagram. Tour guides stop by. A former cartel hit man-turned-YouTube-star appeared, offering DVDs recounting his exploits with Mr. Escobar and anecdotes from the day the building was attacked.In April, fed up, the mayor intervened.\u201cThis symbol, which is a symbol of illegality, of evil, will be brought to the ground,\u201d said Federico Guti\u00e9rrez. The mayor vowed to topple the building by next year and to put a park remembering victims in its place.The conflicting response to the building \u2014 municipal embarrassment or photo opportunity \u2014 is also a prime example of how Medell\u00edn still struggles over the Escobar narrative. Who gets to tell this history of the drug wars? Where is it told \u2014 in the streets or in museums? And who are the protagonists \u2014 the villains or the victims?I came to live in this city eight months ago. But I first became familiar with Medell\u00edn as a child in the early 1990s. It was the height of Mr. Escobar\u2019s terror campaigns to protect his multibillion-dollar drug business, and the grisly consequences were shown on the evening news in the United States. Decades later, I was drawn to cover how Medell\u00edn had managed to turn the page on its violent past.The city has become a boomtown where international architects compete to build prestige projects and well-funded technology start-ups proliferate next to trendy restaurants. Colombia\u2019s metro runs the length of the city; escalators thread the barrios that climb up the sides of the lush valley where the city sits.Medell\u00edn\u2019s residents, a famously proud clan known as paisas, are the first to tell you where their city has advanced to.But they are the last to mention where it has advanced from \u2014 the depths of the cocaine era that brought not only the horror of Mr. Escobar, but also the money that built its skyline, including the Monaco.\u201cPaisas say, \u2018dirty clothes should be washed at home,\u2019\u201d Juan Mosquera, a writer in Medell\u00edn, told me over lunch when we discussed why local residents avoid even mentioning the Monaco. \u201cIt was a mansion of horror. His family didn\u2019t just live there; they killed and tortured people, and they planned the biggest blows toward the city.\u201dIf the city wanted to keep its soiled laundry private, the popular Netflix series \u201cNarcos,\u201d whose first two seasons chronicled the rise and ruin of Mr. Escobar, exposed it to millions of global viewers.Medell\u00edn resisted the show from the start. Film crews had trouble getting permission to work in the city, and just hearing the name of the series makes my neighbors bristle.But the city itself was a key character in \u201cNarcos,\u201d and fans of the show come to Medell\u00edn in droves, seeking more stories of Mr. Escobar\u2019s life. Must-see stops include Hacienda N\u00e1poles, his ranch outside town; his grave; and La Catedral, the prison built to his specifications.Daniel V\u00e1squez, who heads public outreach at the Memory House Museum in Medell\u00edn, seemed exasperated when I asked why visitors are more interested in the life of the city\u2019s top villain than in visiting this institution dedicated to the victims of the city\u2019s armed conflicts over the last 50 years.\u201cPablo Escobar has become the pop icon of this story,\u201d Mr. V\u00e1squez said. \u201cThe city saw no urgency to tell this part of history. It wasn\u2019t a priority for the government until there was a problem, until suddenly you had narco-tours led by Popeye.\u201d\u201cPopeye,\u201d the alias of Jhon Jairo Vel\u00e1squez, a hit man for Mr. Escobar, began hawking DVDs and hosting tours of the city after his release from prison in 2016. He also created a side business as a YouTube personality with a channel called \u201cRepentant Popeye.\u201dIn a city still smarting from Mr. Escobar\u2019s wounds, the hit man seemed to be anything but sorry. In one video series, \u201cFamous Tombs,\u201d Mr. Vel\u00e1squez goes to the graves of his victims, narrating how he murdered them.\u201cIt\u2019s like if members of Al Qaeda gave tours in New York about how they had planned 9/11,\u201d said Luis Hernando Mej\u00eda, who represents the neighbors association that includes the Monaco, where Popeye would begin his tours. (Popeye was rearrested this May on charges that included extortion.)H\u00e9ctor Abad, one of the country\u2019s most popular novelists, told me on a visit to his apartment about his father\u2019s killing by a paramilitary group the year before the Monaco was attacked. He said a girlfriend once showed him the scars across her back that came from an Escobar bombing.And he offered his own home as evidence that no building in Medell\u00edn seemed untouched by past crimes. Shortly after he bought the apartment, he found a cache of gold ingots and counterfeit money hidden in a wall.\u201cYou move a brick and you find a skeleton,\u201d Mr. Abad said.He looked down the hill from his balcony toward where the Monaco \u2014 a \u201ccursed building,\u201d he said \u2014 sat awaiting the mayor\u2019s wrecking ball. \u201cIf someone gave it to me, I would refuse.\u201dWhen I caught up with Mr. Guti\u00e9rrez, I asked the mayor, 43, about the day the Monaco was bombed.\u201cWhat did I feel? Fear,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just fear about what had happened, but fear for what we are going to become.\u201dHe paused for a moment.\u201cWhy did I decide as the mayor to destroy the Monaco?\u201d he asked himself.To show that the city had been reborn, he said, and that the law had triumphed over chaos.But more than anything, he said he wanted to demolish the Monaco because Medell\u00edn was sick of telling the same story of the same villain, over and over.One of the last people I sought out to talk to about the Monaco was Mr. Escobar\u2019s son, born Juan Pablo Escobar. He left Colombia after his father was killed, changed his name to Sebasti\u00e1n Marroqu\u00edn and now works as an architect in Buenos Aires. Mr. Marroqu\u00edn was the only person I could find who was there the day the building was bombed.At first he said he wanted to talk. But then he stopped answering my emails.I began to think of what it must have been like for a child to be the son of the country\u2019s richest man, having all six floors of the Monaco for his family, yet with so many threats beyond its walls.Eventually, I did hear back from Mr. Marroqu\u00edn. I opened the email, thinking perhaps he\u2019d agree to an interview. But he, too, seemed to have had enough of the subject.\u201cThanks for your patience,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the road for more than a month. I think we should leave this one for some other time.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Let Teenagers Sleep In", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting schools before 8:30 a.m. shows a tragic disregard for both the mental health of children and for science.Mr. Nicholls is a journalist and a high school science teacher.This article has been updated to reflect news developments.A fresh-faced batch of teenagers just began a new school year, but will they get the most out of it? In the mornings, many are forced to get to school much too early. And at night, ubiquitous screens are a lure that\u2019s hard to resist. This double whammy is a perfect lesson in sleep deprivation.It is important to understand why teenagers have a particularly hard time getting enough sleep, and what adults need to do to help.First, a reminder of the basic biology: After puberty, adolescents are no longer the morning larks of their younger years. They become rewired as night owls, staying awake later and then sleeping in. This is not part of a feckless project to frustrate parents, but is driven by changes in the way the brain responds to light.The growth in screen time is particularly problematic for sleep. Not only does it eat into the time available for rest, but the blue light emitted by LEDs, TVs, tablets and smartphones suppresses the body\u2019s secretion of melatonin, the hormone that signals it\u2019s time to sleep. Overdosing on screens at night effectively tells the brain it\u2019s still daytime, delaying the body\u2019s cues to sleep even further. Parents should set real limits on screen time, model responsible use of devices and praise children who show signs of regulating their own media consumption. In the hour before bedtime, there should be a moratorium on bright lights in the home, avoiding devices and harsh LED bulbs often found in kitchens and bathrooms.But Ms. Ziporyn Snider remains upbeat: \u201cEventually a bill like this, created in the best interests of children, will pass. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201dParents need to be vocal about the reasons change is so important, joining forces with community leaders, sleep scientists, health professionals and educators to put school start times on the local, then state agendas.Advertisement"}

After wending its way through venues of similar size in Inglewood, Calif., Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Denver, San Jose, Calif., and Dallas, the monthlong run will end in Brooklyn at the Barclays Center (seating capacity: 19,000).On its website, Live Nation said that Mrs. Obama\u2019s show would \u201cfeature intimate and honest conversations between Mrs. Obama and a selection of to-be-announced moderators, reflective of the extraordinary stories shared in the wide-ranging chapters of her deeply personal book.\u201d Because of high demand during the pre-sale period, which ended on Thursday, the promoter recently added second shows in Washington and Brooklyn.Emily Bender, Live Nation\u2019s public relations director, said 10 percent of the tickets for each of Mrs. Obama\u2019s shows would be donated to charities, schools and community groups in each city.Steven Barclay, a book agent who has planned large-scale tours for the authors Ina Garten and David Sedaris, was virtually speechless as he checked the Ticketmaster landing page for Mrs. Obama.\u201cHuh,\u201d he said. \u201cWow. O.K. It\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a Madonna tour. That\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind.\u201d\u201cAs the first African-American president and first lady, I am very wary of arguments that they should not do something everybody else was allowed to do,\u201d Mr. Giridharadas said. \u201cBut an arena with tiered seating is a powerful metaphor for everything they presumably want to destroy. What this illustrates to me is that cashing in has become our common culture in a way we don\u2019t realize. It\u2019s the water in which we\u2019re all swimming.\u201dAnd the Obamas have seemingly jumped into the deep end.In 2017, the Crown Publishing Group reached a joint deal with President Barack Obama and Mrs. Obama for separate memoirs. David Drake, the deputy publisher of Crown, a Penguin Random House subsidiary, would not comment on how much the deal was worth.In addition to the publishing arrangement, the Obamas agreed to a multiyear production deal with Netflix in May to create television shows and films through their new production company, Higher Ground. Netflix did not disclose financial details, but similar deals have been worth many tens of millions of dollars over several years.In another move that seems more characteristic of an entertainment industry star than a former first lady, Mrs. Obama and Crown have struck a deal with Hearst Magazines to promote \u201cBecoming,\u201d with content sprinkled through its publications and websites, according to seven people familiar with the arrangement.The people said the agreement with Hearst was helped along by Joanna Coles, the company\u2019s recently departed chief content officer, and Gayle King, a co-anchor of \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and editor at large at O, The Oprah Magazine, which is among the company\u2019s more than 300 publications worldwide.According to people with knowledge of the plan, Mrs. Obama will appear on the cover of the December issue of Elle magazine as part of the promotional push. She also met with a select group of Hearst editors this month, people at the company said. Mr. Drake, of Crown, would not disclose the specifics of other media appearances that Mrs. Obama has planned to promote the memoir.Mrs. Obama noted during the interview that she put her legal career on pause \u201cas my husband\u2019s ascent got faster and higher and louder.\u201d Through it all, she said, being a mother helped her maintain a sense of self-worth.\u201cIt is not easy to tell somebody that you are worth a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially for women. We have a hard time saying that about ourselves, that I know my worth and I can put a monetary number on it, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Energy Data Is Relentless.", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re usingAlternative power sources have upended the electric grid. Ivan Penn, who covers the beat, discusses the changes and how he keeps track of them.How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ivan Penn, who covers alternative energy for The Times from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Q. A lot of alternative energy is basically technology. What are some of the most unusual ideas around alternative energy you've seen break out over the years?But storage isn\u2019t the only focus. Engineers continue to study other forms of energy, like capturing the power of ocean waves. And some countries are using the internet for peer-to-peer electricity trading of the solar power they generate.Battery technology is something that everyone wants to see improve. What are the challenges to broader deployment of batteries in the energy sector?The biggest issue has been cost. Batteries have been very expensive, but that\u2019s changing fairly quickly. Just as with the rapid drop in price in solar panels, batteries to store electricity have rapidly declined in cost, most likely making them more affordable within the next few years.California is also likely to be a major driver in the expansion of battery storage. The State Assembly recently passed a measure to provide about $1 billion to help homeowners purchase batteries for their homes. The state created a similar program for solar that led to one million solar roofs and helped make California by far the leader in residential solar installations.How has tech changed the power grid as a whole?Just in the last decade, the 100-year model of utilities producing electricity and selling power to consumers was turned on its head. Improvements in solar panel efficiency and lower product cost enabled consumers on a wide scale to produce their own power and sell it back to the electric grid.The grid was never designed to be a two-way street. So that has led to a reimagining of it. Utility companies must rethink the services they provide. No longer just power companies, utilities provide new services like vehicle charging stations for the growing number of electric cars.Along with producing their own power, people now benefit from improvements in energy efficiency, which has resulted in flat or reduced electricity use across the country \u2014 another adjustment for the power companies. Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, highly efficient appliances and smart technology have changed the way we use power.What kind of tech setup do you have for work? The alternative energy beat often is data driven, so tech is critical. Google Sheets and Excel help me manage data from the United States Energy Information Administration, the Solar Energy Industries Association and the California Solar and Storage Association.I also check some of the latest developments in alternative energy on Greentechmedia.com and Utility Dive. And I consult the Electric Power Research Institute.Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love? How do you use it?Our house is full of computers, mostly Apple \u2014 MacBooks, iPads and iPhones \u2014 though we use other tablets as well. The gadgets get their fair share of schoolwork activity, but they\u2019re also tools of social media, music, art, websites, programming, Hulu and Netflix.Entertainment is big. So there are several gaming systems, old and more recent, like various Nintendo systems as well as Xbox.But as if all of that weren\u2019t enough, my sons built their own computer with money they made during the summer at a fast food chicken restaurant so they could play and make video games they hope to sell. So far they\u2019re planning more than developing, but perhaps that might fall under the category of research.How has the tech industry swept into Los Angeles? And how has the city changed as a result?Without a doubt, energy technology is a staple of Southern California, given that the state is the leader in solar power. Residential solar is prolific.But technology is really changing transportation. Of course, there are Uber and Lyft, but electric vehicles have also given rise to new companies like Tesloop, which will take you from Los Angeles to San Diego in a Tesla for as little as $29 (snacks included). Prices go as high as about $84, and all users have to do is register and request a ride online. My daughter sometimes uses the service to get to and from the University of California, San Diego, where she goes to school, or uses ride shares through social media.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: Emmys Reflect Industry Tensions in 2018", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The 70th Primetime Emmys last night in Los Angeles had all the familiar trappings of Hollywood award shows: red carpet photo shoots, dramatic envelope rites, stiff banter and celebrity close-ups.In many ways, though, the show reflected the tensions and changes animating the television industry in 2018. Two running themes throughout the ceremony \u2014 prompting speculation long before the night kicked off \u2014 were the growing role streaming services have played in recent years and the intensifying push for diversity in casting and directing.This year, Netflix led the pack with 112 nominations and ended HBO\u2019s 17-year streak as the most nominated platform. In the end, Netflix and HBO called it a tie; both came away with 23 Emmys each. HBO claimed the top prize when \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d won for best drama. But it was Amazon that won for best comedy series for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d one of five awards the show received at the ceremony.Notably, this year the Emmys boasted the most diverse group of nominees in its history \u2014 as those who watched the program were reminded a number of times. \u201cYes indeedy, one step closer to a black Sheldon,\u201d joked Kenan Thompson of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d referring to the lead character in \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201dComedians and presenters throughout the evening were quick to mock premature back-patting on inclusion and sexual harassment. A whimsical but pointed musical segment opened the show: \u201cWe solved it!\u201d Kate McKinnon and Mr. Thompson sang. Throughout the number they were joined by Sterling K. Brown, Tituss Burgess, Kristen Bell, Ricky Martin and John Legend. (The actual point was: They have not solved it.)Amid the ceremonies, one unscripted moment nearly stole the whole show: The director Glenn Weiss \u2014 who won in the variety special category for directing last year\u2019s Oscars \u2014 drew stunned cheers and an outpouring on social media when he proposed to his girlfriend live on stage. She said yes.The winners in top categories:(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Now trending in the Bay Area: the shofar, an ancient Jewish horn.So far the two most prominent figures showing off their musical skills are tech billionaires \u2014 Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Benioff, to be exact.Mr. Benioff played the shofar for the Jewish new year at a synagogue in San Francisco, where he was backed by a guitarist, the holy ark and a toddler wielding a purple plastic horn.Mr. Zuckerberg posted a video of himself playing the instrument in his Palo Alto home, where he was accompanied by the offscreen wailing of his 1-year-old daughter, August.\u201cDear Mark,\u201d one person commented on the Facebook clip, \u201cI wish you new algorithms.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

They\u2019re all suffering from some form of PTSD. They\u2019re being haunted by old memories of war. It\u2019s very unlike the original \u201cPredator,\u201d where there\u2019s beefcake and muscles on top of muscles and guys who weren\u2019t afraid to run into a buzz saw. These guys have already run into a buzz saw.So you\u2019re the comic relief?I would say Shane Black\u2019s writing is the comic relief. But make no mistake, the subject matter is dark, it\u2019s thrilling, it\u2019s scary, it\u2019s ominous. But it\u2019s got that Shane Black signature where these really serious themes are in place but always done with a dollop of humor [in movies like \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang\u201d]. It\u2019s a good transition piece for me because as I move forward in my career and do more action stuff, more thriller stuff, get back to my dramatic roots, this is what I would call a \u201cbridge job.\u201dIs it daunting to rethink your career after so much success with \u201cKey & Peele\u201d?I felt like I was at my absolute best with the best possible partner. There was an alchemy there that will never happen again. I will admit that there is a certain amount of trepidation to moving forward and going: \u201cHow naked do I want to be in front of people? What will it cost me to show who I truly feel I am to audiences?\u201dYou felt like you couldn\u2019t be your true self doing sketch comedy? Yes. Part of it\u2019s the genre, in that it\u2019s going: \u201cWell, you\u2019re not asking for me to be me. You\u2019re asking to see wigs and mustaches and hunchbacks and one eye and different accents.\u201d But also, I\u2019m an adult male still trying to discover who I am. And sometimes it\u2019s the little pedestrian questions like: \u201cDo I like mint chocolate chip ice cream? Or do I eat it because somebody else liked it and I felt like I was supposed to like it or people weren\u2019t going to like me?\u201d Part of why I\u2019ve always been a very good actor is I\u2019m very good at taking direction. I don\u2019t know what I want, but I\u2019ll do whatever I can to give you what you want.You\u2019ve called comedy \u201ca 19-year detour.\u201d Can you explain?I was on my way to doing dramatic and classical work in Detroit, and I met a bunch of real fun actors, and they were all performing at Second City. And I thought: \u201cWell, I feel like I have a facility for comedy. I should go audition for this place.\u201d And I got in, and that was the beginning of this other path. So from June or July 1997 until October 2015, that was my life. I enjoyed it and I learned so much from it. But then you just start getting itchy.I\u2019m not. I was at one point in time and then I realized it was an unhealthy endeavor. So I figured if I can lean in and support him, then that\u2019s the best thing I could do for my maturation as a human. And then figure out, \u201cKeegan, what do you want to do?\u201d I want to be proud of myself. I\u2019m already proud of him.Do you miss \u201cKey & Peele\u201d?I don\u2019t. If Jordan wanted to do it again, that might be something I\u2019m interested in doing. But right now, any time I\u2019m asked this in an interview, I just have to honestly answer: \u201cI don\u2019t miss it.\u201d Nineteen years of the same thing \u2014 I didn\u2019t have any more desire to do it.

{"Headline": "Emma Stone, Jonah Hill and the Art of Keeping Viewers Off-Kilter", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast fall, the actress Emma Stone, wraith pale and peroxided, sat in a folding chair on a Silvercup Studios soundstage in Queens. She wore a tank top and a gray coveralls. Her face, fluorescent-lit, was set in perma-scowl.\u201cWhat\u2019s normal, anyway?\u201d she asked the camera throatily.Good question.When the producer Michael Sugar bought the rights to the series, he offered it to Mr. Fukunaga, who took it because, \u201cI wanted to do something that allowed me to play around with different genres,\u201d he said. (A few of those genres: caper, thriller, fantasy.) He brought on Mr. Somerville and they scrapped just about everything \u2014 setting, characters, tone.In place of an asylum, they\u2019ve substituted a clinical drug trial. And Espen has morphed into two characters, Ms. Stone\u2019s Annie, a depressive and drug addict grieving a family trauma, and Jonah Hill\u2019s Owen, a man estranged from his wealthy clan and a possible schizophrenic. Under the dubious supervision of the toup\u00e9ed Dr. Mantleray (Justin Theroux) of Neberdine Pharmaceuticals and Biotech, participants test a sequence of pills designed to cure any mental illness and \u201ceradicate all unnecessary, inefficient forms of human pain forever.\u201d Results may vary.The pills, and some \u201cpowerful microwave technology,\u201d shunt the participants into dreamlike states where they encounter past traumas and current coping mechanisms. (Is it all in their heads? Probably.) Annie and Owen, whose psyches have become mysteriously linked, suddenly find themselves as Long Island high school sweethearts or a pair of ritzy 1940s grifters. And yes, in one sequence Ms. Stone plays Annie as an elf.\u201cA half-elf,\u201d Ms. Stone clarified, speaking by telephone. \u201cI have never wanted to play an elf.\u201d(Speaking a smidgen more seriously, Ms. Stone pointed to the attraction of signing on to the 10-episode project: \u201cTo explore a character in a kind of wider range than I\u2019m used to was really exciting.\u201d)The tone mutates, too, swerving from light to dark, gentle to cruel, loopily surreal to bluntly aggressive, sometimes in a single episode. Even the scenes set in the supposedly ordinary waking life are meant to make you feel messed up.\u201cManiac\u201d conjures a day-to-day world in which technological advances topped out sometime in the 1970s and society has fractured. The microprocessor never happened; smartphones don\u2019t exist. New drugs flood the market, cybersex has taken some odd turns and \u2014 just to put the psycho firmly back in psychodrama \u2014 there\u2019s at least one purple koala playing chess in Washington Square Park.The characters don\u2019t feel comfortable in everyday life. Neither should the audience.\u201cI want the audience to feel slightly disoriented about what reality is,\u201d said Mr. Somerville, speaking by telephone. \u201cI think that\u2019s cool.\u201d\u201cReality is weird!\u201d he added.Reality seemed fairly stable \u2014 if also fairly hectic \u2014 on set last fall. Filming was a little more than half completed and everyone was about to take a short break, which explained the cake frosted to read, \u201cHiatus Time, Let\u2019s Party.\u201d The rooms housing the drug trial glowed eerily and variously caffeinated assistants rushed around preparing the set and the actors for an upcoming scene.\u201cThose scars look so real,\u201d Mr. Hill said as he passed Ms. Stone. (They met in 2007\u2019s \u201cSuperbad\u201d and have remained close ever since; complimenting each other on creepy makeup is pretty much routine.)\u201cManiac\u201d was filmed over four months, which isn\u2019t an absurdly small amount of time for a 10-episode series, but a snug fit when only one director, especially a director as meticulous as Mr. Fukunaga, is overseeing every episode. Even the first season of \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d which Mr. Fukunaga also directed in its entirety, had only eight episodes. And it didn\u2019t depend on \u201ca globular cluster of arborized realities,\u201d Neberdine-speak for a branching system of distinct but not entirely separate worlds.\u201cFor what we were trying to accomplish we had a pretty low budget\u201d \u2014 Netflix wouldn\u2019t reveal what that budget was \u2014 \u201cand a nearly impossible sort of schedule,\u201d Mr. Fukunaga said.At Silvercup, during a break between scenes, the production designer, Alex DiGerlando, summoned Mr. Fukunaga, who\u2019d grown a mid-shoot near-beard and seemed to be surviving mostly on almonds and herbal tinctures, to a table where he\u2019d assembled an assortment of rusty medieval weaponry: an ax, a halberd, some vicious hooked knives and more. Mr. Fukunaga nixed everything. It was too unspecific, too boring. The elves and half-elves deserved better.The globular cluster of arborized realities wasn\u2019t only a hassle for the props department, it was also a strain on the actors involved. Many of the cast members reappear as multiple characters. And some of the characters seem aware that they\u2019re not entirely real. When Ms. Stone plays Arlie, the Gold Coast con artist, she also has to play moments in which Annie scrapes through Arlie\u2019s brilliantined exterior and then other moments in which the two characters seem to merge.That wasn\u2019t too hard for Ms. Stone. \u201cObviously, I thought, \u2018How the hell am I going to play five characters and switch in and out of them on a day-by-day basis,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cbut it was really kind of a joy.\u201d When it came to the moments where Annie bled through, it reminded her of all the moments in other projects when she\u2019d let her own life, her own emotions surface for an instant before letting the character take over again.The other challenge, maybe the hardest challenge, was to make a series this weird, this wonky, this full of koalas and a cappella and chunky computer graphics, that also respected what Owen and Annie are suffering, the ways in which her PTSD and his schizophrenia are crippling their lives. Even in a series where reality is up for grabs, that had to feel real. Their pain is never the punch line.\u201cEmotional realism is what matters and if we deviated from that, the whole thing would fall apart,\u201d Mr. Somerville said. (That was also true of \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d a show he described as a \u201cspiritual distant cousin\u201d to \u201cManiac.\u201d)If Neberdine\u2019s ethics are a class-action suit waiting to happen, the show isn\u2019t arguing against traditional psychoactive drugs or forms of therapy. (Mr. Somerville\u2019s wife is a psychotherapist, so a show questioning the efficacy of that entire system wouldn\u2019t be a smart move.) It\u2019s suggesting, as Ms. Stone said, \u201cHow lucky we are, all of us, to reach out and find a friend in a time of need.\u201d\u201cManiac\u201d has had a strange side effect on its creators. To make it, Mr. Fukunaga said, he and Mr. Somerville \u201creally put our lives\u2019 emotional experiences into this narrative.\u201d They spent months having vulnerable, searching, radically intimate conversations, at dinner, in bars, sitting in a van on location at 5 a.m.\u201cWe both essentially were completely going through a therapeutic process,\u201d Mr. Fukunaga said.There might be therapeutic processes less involved and less expensive than creating a limited streaming series. Then again, a production schedule probably means that you\u2019ll see the therapy through and there are no copays or insurance wrangles to slow you down.Now that production has wrapped, \u201cI think we\u2019re now totally fixed,\u201d Mr. Fukunaga joked. \u201cThank you, Netflix, for fixing my mind.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Turns out they had an acquaintance in common from their high school days in Florida.\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me,\u201d he said, using more colorful language.Mr. Centineo swears it hasn\u2019t gone to his head. \u201cIt\u2019s on a two-dimensional screen. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s really happening in real life,\u201d he said, drinking a kale and spinach cold-pressed juice. \u201cYou start noticing your numbers and people start reaching out to you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s really been the surreal part of it,\u201d he continued, \u201crandom people who I haven\u2019t spoken with in years or people that I\u2019m close with who are like, \u2018Oh my God, you\u2019re on my Instagram feed, you\u2019re on my Twitter, you\u2019re all over Tumblr.\u2019\u201dHe had back-to-back interviews, and to get out some of his abundant boyish energy, he suggested a stroll around NoLIta, a neighborhood that he tries to check out whenever he is in New York.But he may not have been prepared for the triple-digit temperatures and sweat-inducing humidity. It wasn\u2019t even noon and already his tangle of dreamy curls was starting to droop. Faint pools of sweat appeared on his striped T-shirt and button-down, which he wore with chunky sneakers by Valentino. \u201cThey\u2019re so sick,\u201d Mr. Centineo said. Sadly, they were just on loan from his stylist.What was supposed to be a leisurely stroll soon became a game of staying cool, something difficult for someone who describes himself as easily distracted. Up the block from By Chloe, he spotted a shaded fire station driveway and bounded across the street into oncoming traffic.\u201cI just like climbing things and exploring,\u201d he said, as sweat formed above his matinee-idol brows.Mr. Centineo grew up near Palm Beach, Fla., where he got his start in community theater. Local modeling gigs and commercials landed him an agent and bigger roles in Los Angeles. At a certain point, his agent said he had to move west if he wanted to continue. \u201cThat\u2019s when I looked at my parents and was like, \u2018Yo, I\u2019m about it. If you move me there I\u2019ll be successful. This is what I want to dedicate my life to,\u2019\u201d he said.While Los Angeles was great for Mr. Centineo\u2019s career, it also offered temptations. \u201cA year and a half ago I decided to cut the negative habits, things and people out, and dedicated myself to loving myself and my career,\u201d he said.Instead of drinking and smoking weed, he began working out and eating better. \u201cThis feels like the fruits of the harvest coming to fruition,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I found was, when I took care of my body, my mind and my emotions and my heart were way happier. When I wasn\u2019t drinking, when I wasn\u2019t smoking weed and partying, I was responsible for my actions and I could choose my actions from a more mindful place. And my life changed \u2014 drastically.\u201dOutside the gallery, Mr. Centineo noticed the corner traffic light and took its very presence as a dare. \u201cShould I climb it?\u201d he said, with a mischievous grin. Before receiving an answer, his 6-foot-2 frame was already clambering on top of a trash can. Mr. Centineo hasn\u2019t let fame dampen his wild, youthful charms.\u201cEver since I\u2019ve been a kid, I\u2019ve always been about running around, climbing trees, exploring,\u201d he said, when he was earthbound again. He has done parkour in the past and recently took up M.M.A. boxing, much to the chagrin of his agents and managers. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you get rocked in the face for the first time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be sparring, and someone will come down and nail me with a right hook and I\u2019ll start smiling. That\u2019s when the adrenaline hits.\u201dNot once during two hours with a reporter did Mr. Centineo pull out his smartphone to check his Instagram or Snapchat, which is surprising for an actor who so convincingly plays a teenager living in a social-media-saturated world.He\u2019s no Luddite but is consciously trying to manage his tech intake. \u201cThe other day I went up to some dunes in Malibu and just turned off my phone for, like, eight hours,\u201d he said. \u201cI leave my phone in the car when I go hiking or when I\u2019m at the gym.\u201dStill, he recognizes that his celebrity owes a debt to Instagram. \u201cWhen you\u2019re someone who is in the attention of the masses, you can\u2019t help but become a sort of reality personality.\u201dThe shade turned out to provide little relief from the heat. It was getting close to 2 p.m. and he had more interviews in store. And he needed to freshen up again, as sweat was dripping down the side of his face. \u201cI\u2019ve got to embrace it,\u201d Mr. Centineo said with a defeated laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s just about being in the moment.\u201dIt was time to head back to his air-conditioned chariot, an Escalade, and head off to People magazine\u2019s offices, which were presumably icebox cold.As he headed out of the garden, a timid young woman with dyed-blond hair stopped him and asked for a photo. Another Boca High alum? No, she had seen him on TV.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018True Detective\u2019 Director Cary Fukunaga Is Bringing His Obsessions to Netflix", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "FeatureWith the new show \u2018Maniac,\u2019 he continues bringing an auteur\u2019s sensibility \u2014 and a fanatical attention to detail \u2014 to the small screen.Supported bySecond movies, Fukunaga had been told, mattered more than first ones. They showed what kind of director you really were: one who waited for the perfect thing, or one who was prolific, experimental and didn\u2019t repeat himself. Fukunaga knew he wanted to be the second kind. So the film he chose to make after \u201cSin Nombre\u201d was wildly different from its predecessor: a period costume drama. His adaptation of \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s classic novel, starred Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender as a particularly smoldering Rochester. It is both exceptionally haunting and powerfully romantic \u2014 a horror story and a love story \u2014 and it required an entirely distinct directorial approach. \u201cAt first,\u201d he recalls, \u201cI was like: What do I do with the camera? It just sits there? But I really wanted to do a study on composition and restraint. Especially in my generation and younger, there\u2019s this impulse to cut, to move and do things all the time, and I was trying to figure out how to do as little as possible.\u201dFitting the entirety of \u201cJane Eyre\u201d into a two-hour movie sometimes felt to Fukunaga like \u201ca real sacrifice \u2014 the ability to explore characters for many hours was a sort of itching desire at that point.\u201d And so he turned to television. In 2013, he directed the entire first season of HBO\u2019s metaphysical crime series, \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d written by Nic Pizzolatto and starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Television has historically been considered a writer\u2019s medium, and film a director\u2019s one, which is another way of saying that on TV, writers usually have the power, and on movies, directors do. The sheer quantity of footage that needs to be shot for a TV show, often on tight turnarounds and smaller budgets, means that series are typically passed like a hot potato from director to director while the cast, crew and showrunner \u2014 who is often the writer-creator \u2014 attend to larger questions of continuity, plot, tone and style. Even when a TV show is in the hands of a great director, that person typically only sets the show in motion (think Martin Scorsese directing the pilot of \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d) or puts her imprint on a few stellar episodes (think Michelle MacLaren and the episode of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d with the bear fight).But Fukunaga was not an unequal partner in \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d His sensibility can be felt in the gorgeously eerie, rock-steady tone that suffuses every frame of the series, so precise and overgrown you can almost smell it. His work made the most convincing case yet that a distinctive directorial viewpoint could, on TV as in the movies, be as qualitatively important as good writing \u2014 could perhaps even make up for overwrought writing. (The second season of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d was written by Pizzolatto, but not directed by Fukunaga, and without him, the series took a pretentious nose-dive.) With \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d Fukunaga was at the forefront of a new directorial approach to TV \u2014 one that includes David Lynch\u2019s reboot of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d and Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\u2019s work for HBO on \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d and \u201cSharp Objects\u201d \u2014 in which directors are intimately involved with every aspect of a series\u2019s many episodes, a totalizing force. This month, Fukunaga brings that force to his second TV show, \u201cManiac,\u201d a Netflix series starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill as participants in a drug trial that purports to do the work of decades of therapy with three pills.On a sunny day in late May, the director walked into the series\u2019s bustling postproduction office in SoHo and was immediately beset on all sides. The show, set in a bizarre alternate world in which the drugs ingested result in vivid, psyche-plumbing experiences that bear a stark resemblance to existing film genres (\u201980s action-comedy, fantasy quest, etc.), was hurtling toward completion, and his attention was urgently needed everywhere \u2014 editing, special effects, color correction, scoring. Fukunaga is 41, tall and extremely handsome. He carries himself with an athlete\u2019s bouncy elegance (until his early 20s, he wanted to be a professional snowboarder) and radiates an assured California calm. He can take a nap anywhere, at any time, a skill he learned while researching \u201cSin Nombre\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019d be on the railroad tracks for days at a time, and I learned how to sleep on gravel pretty well.\u201d But this lackadaisical vibe belies his thrumming high standards and his obsessive eye.Fukunaga has a devoted core of colleagues who have collaborated with him on multiple projects and talk, in quasi-religious terms, about the moments when they realized they had to just let go and let Cary be Cary, trusting his instincts and his process, however taxing that process could be. From each of his sets there are tales of his single-minded insistence on certain details: on finding the perfect church on a hill; the perfect petroleum refineries; the perfect exterior for Neberdine Pharmaceutical Biotech, the drug company where the majority of \u201cManiac\u201d takes place. The location team showed Fukunaga hundreds of possibilities before finally uncovering the one that was just right. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest thing when you can feel dozens of people, literal breathing human beings who are standing next to you on a tech scout, for example, all being like, Can we just get back in the [expletive] bus?\u201d Patrick Somerville, the creator and head writer of \u201cManiac,\u201d says of Fukunaga\u2019s determination. He cannot stand a mediocre job, Somerville explains. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I think it\u2019s vulgar to him.\u201dFukunaga is aware that his exactitude has given him something of a reputation. He co-wrote the screenplay for the recent adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s \u201cIt,\u201d but did not end up directing it, as had been originally planned. \u201cThe studio just kind of pulled the plug when they felt like I was going to be too difficult,\u201d he says, his voice a shrug. But it\u2019s not that Fukunaga has a temper \u2014 he never even raises his voice. The vibe on the \u201cManiac\u201d set was so amiable that during one visit, the crew was observing \u201cFukunaga Friday,\u201d in which they all walked around with Fukunaga\u2019s distinctive plaited pigtails, more and more of them as the day went on. By midday, one bald man was walking around with wire pigtails tucked beneath his hat.In person, Fukunaga is affable and probing; he makes conversation, but not small talk, while cuddling his pit bull, which he adopted while on location for \u201cManiac.\u201d He\u2019ll recommend the Harper\u2019s Magazine article about schizophrenia that helped him better understand Hill\u2019s character, Owen, who is mentally ill; he\u2019ll become a little abashed about the astrologer he sees (\u201cEvery time I\u2019ve been to him he\u2019s been really accurate\u201d); and he\u2019ll un-self-consciously entertain you with stories about his many experiences with ghosts \u2014 the poltergeist who slammed cabinets in his childhood home, the dead woman who touched his face in the middle of the night when he was 4, the ghost in a London apartment that made itself known with its vile body odor \u2014 told with both a childlike openness and a director\u2019s cunning efficiency, relaying exactly the details needed to accurately imagine the ghost for yourself.But for all his charm, Fukunaga is also implacable. \u201cWhen someone comes into a meeting and says, \u2018This is an orange,\u2019 Cary will say, \u2018Prove to me that this is an orange,\u2019\u2009\u201d says Mara LePere-Schloop, an art director on \u201cTrue Detective\u201d and a Fukunaga regular. \u201cIt\u2019s a very rigorous thing, and it will drive some people insane.\u201d\u201cHaving a moment\u201d is the Rosetta Stone for Fukunaga, who uses his extreme, gnarly attention to material detail to vertiginously recreate the lived experience of people who are superficially nothing like him. Fukunaga spent his formative years growing up around Berkeley\u2019s Telegraph Avenue, \u201csurrounded by Berkeley protesters and communist bookstores and homeless people.\u201d His Japanese-American father and Swedish-American mother divorced when he was 4, and he split time between them. His parents changed jobs with some frequency \u2014 his father worked for a generator company before eventually becoming an administrator at the University of California, Berkeley, and his mother was a dental hygienist before going back to school to become a teacher. Fukunaga spent time living in Mexico after his mother married a Mexican-American, which is how he learned to speak Spanish. He started making videos, like one about pirates, when he was 10. In his late 20s, after snowboarding for a few years and working on music videos, he went to film school at N.Y.U. His award-winning student film, \u201cVictoria Para Chino\u201d \u2014 a 13-minute Spanish-language short based on a 2003 news story about a tractor-trailer smuggling almost 100 immigrants across the border, found abandoned with 17 dead people inside \u2014 led directly to \u201cSin Nombre.\u201dThere is something fundamentally athletic about Fukunaga\u2019s directorial approach, the idea that with enough practice, research and experience, mastery becomes indistinguishable from instinct. His third feature film, \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d about a child soldier \u2014 for which Fukunaga did years of research, including visiting Sierra Leone in 2002, at the end of the civil war there \u2014 was filmed in Ghana, where Fukunaga and other members of the crew came down with malaria. He shot the film himself anyway. Fukunaga explained to Idris Elba, one of the film\u2019s central actors, the virtues of doing your own cinematography, ultimately inspiring Elba to learn how to operate a camera for his own directorial debut. \u201cWhen he\u2019s looking down the iris of the lens,\u201d Elba says, \u201che can spot things, his intuition takes his eye and he can adapt right on the spot.\u201d Working on \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d Matthew McConaughey made Fukunaga a T-shirt with the image of feet on a skateboard that said \u201cEverything Lends,\u201d a reference to his ability to find inspiration on the fly.Fukunaga\u2019s immersive tendencies extend to his hobbies, of which he has a shocking number. He skateboards, surfs, rides a motorcycle and used to practice capoeira. He lives in the West Village, but has a house in upstate New York, a two-hour drive outside the city, where he goes to relax and work in his wood shop, spending time alone or with friends. His polo horse is stabled nearby. He learned to ride after working on \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d prohibited for insurance reasons from taking lessons with the cast. Because Fukunaga does not do things in half-measures, this somehow led to his becoming a devoted polo player. Trudie Styler, who appears in \u201cManiac\u201d and is a friend of Fukunaga\u2019s, says her husband, Sting, has described him as a \u201c10,000-hour guy,\u201d a reference to Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s notion of the amount of time needed to master a craft. He\u2019s the type of person who will put in the effort and \u201cbecome not only proficient, but an aficionado,\u201d she explains.If this conjures some sort of swaggering John Huston with a snowboard, please let me clarify: Fukunaga is a distinctly Bay Area variation on the type, not macho so much as open-mindedly omni-competent. Yes, at some point, he and some buddies decided to learn as many skills as they could to survive the apocalypse \u2014 he\u2019s not a prepper; it was more of a merit-badge thing \u2014 so he can sail a monohull, climb rocks, shoot a gun, use a bow and arrow and navigate with a compass. But he also has gorgeous handwriting, speaks several languages and loves many a lifestyle Instagram account. He just got a new cooking range upstate, the same kind as a French cook and lifestyle guru he follows, and he is thrilled about it: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be sick. It\u2019s wide, two ovens \u2014 you can do meat and your potatoes at the same time, your root vegetables.\u201d He has seen a therapist. He may or may not currently be single (\u201csort of ... it\u2019s complicated\u201d), but has a reputation for falling madly in love. \u201cThe guy is a sensitive guy,\u201d says Mick Casale, a friend and former screenwriting teacher of his at N.Y.U. \u201cHe comes over for lunch, and we just talk about love!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an interesting juxtaposition between his personal self and his professional self,\u201d says the director and actor Joshua Leonard, a close friend of Fukunaga\u2019s. The two met when they both had short films at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005. \u201cCary is very different as a friend than he is as a director. As a friend, he is a big softy. As a director \u2014 I want to be very careful how I say this, and I want you to be careful if you use this quote \u2014 I don\u2019t think he gives a [expletive] if people like him or not on set.\u201dFukunaga can be obsessively granular, because be believes the wrong detail can shatter a movie or TV show\u2019s spell \u2014 its unique ability to enable us to have a moment. \u201cAnytime something is slightly uncanny or just not quite right, it could potentially disturb suspension of disbelief.\u201d The wrong detail is a disservice to the material, to the audience, to the project, and Fukunaga is painstaking about grinding them out. \u201cIt\u2019s like sanding,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just want to sand all the burrs away. So, you have to clean and clean and clean.\u201d\u201cManiac\u201d is so jam-packed with oddities that the koala, when it appears in Episode 2, is just one more surreal detail in a show bursting with them. The series is set in a New York that is similar to our own, but with a different history of technology. Office workers use computers with the black-and-green interfaces of \u201980s IBMs. The city has a second Statue of Liberty \u2014 the Statue of Extra Liberty \u2014 in the East River. The central Brooklyn Public Library is a bus terminal. Washington Square Park is still full of chess hustlers, but some are animatronic puppets. Stranger still are the delusions, obsessively imagined miniworlds with the logic of waking dreams. Hill and Stone\u2019s characters spend the entire series becoming other people in order to learn how they might be themselves.Like them, Fukunaga immerses himself in other worlds to work through something more personal. \u201cWith \u2018Maniac\u2019 in particular,\u201d he says, \u201cboth Patrick and I got excited about doing a year and a half of auto-analysis of ourselves. We\u2019ve explored pretty thoroughly our relationships \u2014 sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly \u2014 with our parents and our siblings and our loved ones.\u201d Both men put a lot of themselves into the script, but when I asked for a specific example, Fukunaga laughed \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m trying to think of one without exposing myself\u201d \u2014 before demurring: \u201cI love my parents, and I don\u2019t want to throw them ... under the bridge? Under the truck?\u201dFukunaga says he wonders after he has completed a project: Why did I make that movie? Why did I tell that story? His answers are often connected to his history. Fukunaga\u2019s father was born in 1943 in a Japanese-American internment camp. He grew up knowing this. He interviewed his grandparents about their experience and studied the era in school. But when he looks back on \u201cSin Nombre\u201d and \u201cBeasts of No Nation\u201d and the devastating circumstances they depict, \u201cI think I was trying to explore the emotional side of myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI hadn\u2019t allowed myself to understand what the internment experience must have been like for my grandparents, for their family, for their kids \u2014 my uncles and my dad.\u201d He was using his work to get closer, by some emotional transitive property, to their trauma.Fukunaga was recently looking at photographs of himself as a child, \u201cand I was like, \u2018Oh, [expletive], I looked like a little ethnic kid.\u2019\u2009\u201d He was bullied at school. \u201cThere would be kids in school who would be like, \u2018My dad says you\u2019re a commie.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018That\u2019s Chinese, you idiot. I\u2019m Japanese.\u2019 Things like that.\u201d But today, people sometimes assume that Fukunaga is white. After \u201cBeasts of No Nation\u201d came out, Fukunaga remembers a Nigerian paper wondering \u201cwhy this white man was coming in telling another grim tale about Africa.\u201d He says that \u201cbecause of my economic and racial upbringing, I\u2019m not sure what group I belong to. And that gives me O-negative blood, where you can just donate to everyone. I feel like a third-culture kid. I feel part of nothing but part of everything.\u201dAs the entertainment industry has become more conscious of making room for different voices \u2014 however slowly, however haltingly \u2014 that often involves limiting those voices to their identities: Black directors should make shows about blackness, women should make shows about being women. But as an Asian-American man, Fukunaga did not grapple with his family\u2019s history by making a movie about the internment camps: Rather, his family\u2019s past made him interested in trauma more generally.Fukunaga is working on a number of projects, including an adaptation of \u201cThe Black Count,\u201d the true story of Alexandre Dumas\u2019s Haitian father, and one about the days leading up to Hiroshima. Just eight years ago, he directed \u201cJane Eyre,\u201d about a beloved female character created by a famous female author, but now he feels hesitant to take on certain female-driven scripts because he worries that his gender would consume the conversation around the project. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re getting to the point where we\u2019ll say you\u2019re not allowed to tell a story about someone who is nothing like you?\u201d he asks, rhetorically. \u201cIf people can tell stories that aren\u2019t their own, it helps make the world smaller,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it requires a sensitivity and an attention to detail.\u201dWhen he was in film school, Fukunaga did write a story about an internment camp. \u201cI was interested in it, but didn\u2019t know how to make that story yet. If anything,\u201d he says with a hint of steely self-awareness in his voice, \u201cwhenever anyone has said, \u2018You should tell this story,\u2019 I\u2019ve pivoted and done the opposite.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "NBC\u2019s Entertainment Chief Leaves in Latest Broadcast TV Shakeup", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNBC\u2019s entertainment chief, Robert Greenblatt, is stepping down from the company after almost eight years in charge, the latest change at the highest ranks of the major broadcast networks.But all of the broadcast networks are also dealing with the same problems: a declining number of viewers and a severely diminished influence in the era of streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.\u201cThese jobs are really relentless,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt said in an interview.CBS enjoyed a long run of success under Mr. Moonves, but will need to chart a new future after he was ousted this month, following numerous allegations of sexual misconduct.With Disney poised to take control of many 21st Century Fox assets early next year, there will be executive turnover at both ABC and Fox. The current head of Disney and ABC\u2019s television group, Ben Sherwood, will leave the company at some point after the Fox deal is closed, according to a person familiar with his decision.Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, will be in charge of most of Disney\u2019s television properties. Dana Walden, currently the co-chief executive of the Fox Television Group, is expected to have a high-ranking role at Disney. She will most likely oversee, among several things, ABC\u2019s entertainment executives, according to two people familiar with the plan.Fox, meanwhile, will likely forge a new identity once it loses its television studio after the deal with Disney closes.Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s departure had been talked about in Hollywood during the Emmy Awards party circuit just over a week ago. At the time, through multiple representatives, Mr. Greenblatt denied he was leaving, though he was actually negotiating his exit.But if his departure is not a surprise, the suddenness is. His last day is Monday, the same day the 2018-19 television season begins. He will be replaced by two people: Paul Telegdy, a president and the head of reality programming at NBC, and George Cheeks, a rising star at the company. They take over on Tuesday.Mr. Greenblatt, 58, said his decision was some time in the making, even though he signed a new contract a year ago.\u201cYou do get weary in these jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the daily changes that go on, you\u2019re constantly reconfiguring the business. I\u2019m just really excited about doing something. Whatever I do will be some new challenge.\u201dMr. Greenblatt arrived at NBC after overseeing the entertainment division at Showtime. NBC at the time was still licking its wounds after its disastrous decision to abandon its 10 p.m. time slot for a daily Jay Leno show. That had severely limited the number of dramas that NBC could develop in any given year, and it took years to undo the damage. NBC\u2019s comedy lineup, once the backbone of the network, had a pair of hits in \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Office,\u201d but the coffers were otherwise bare.\u201cWe were in a complete rebuilding phase, and everything had fallen apart,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt told The New York Times in an interview two years ago.It was a slog. As early as May 2015, rumors circulated that Mr. Greenblatt was done. At NBC\u2019s 2015 upfront presentation for advertisers, Jimmy Fallon, \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host, said to Mr. Greenblatt as he was exiting the stage: \u201cWe\u2019re all going to miss you, buddy. You had a good run.\u201dStephen Burke, the head of NBC Universal, said in an interview that discussions with Mr. Greenblatt about his departure had been going on for some time.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked over the last couple of years, very openly, and he would say, \u2018Geez, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Burke said.Mr. Burke complimented Mr. Greenblatt on the \u201cbrilliant\u201d job he had done at NBC, and said it was a testament that his successors were both being promoted from within.\u201cThe good news is he\u2019s built a really good team and we didn\u2019t look outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWe picked two guys who are proven commodities in our company.\u201dMr. Telegdy, 47, is the person largely credited with bringing \u201cThe Voice\u201d to NBC, and being in charge of the strongest reality lineup in the business. In addition to \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d NBC broadcasts \u201cEllen\u2019s Game of Games\u201d and \u201cLittle Big Shots.\u201dMr. Cheeks, 53, has been at NBC since 2012 and is a co-president of Universal Cable Productions. Many in Hollywood assumed he was the heir apparent to Bonnie Hammer\u2019s vast NBC Universal cable empire.Mr. Burke said Mr. Greenblatt had recommended that they take over for him, and \u201cthat\u2019s what I was planning on doing anyway.\u201dAs for his future, Mr. Greenblatt did indicate he\u2019s not done with show business. He said he\u2019d be open to a new job, including at a streaming platform.\u201cI love the idea of running a company,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a broadcast network at this point.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Highly Recommend Joining This Cult", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI am slashing my spending and rethinking my bourgeois ways. You should, too. Contributing Opinion WriterLet me tell you about the cult I have joined: the cult of thrift. The indoctrination started gently, with a podcast here, a YouTube video there, about minimalism, debt-free living, frugality, decluttering, zero waste.Then, before I knew it, I was listening to an American evangelical Christian named Dave Ramsey telling me in his Tennessee drawl that \u201cthe borrower is slave to the lender\u201d and that I need to get \u201cgazelle intense\u201d and live on \u201crice and beans, beans and rice\u201d to get out of debt, be \u201cweird\u201d by having a paid-off house.Now, having chugged the Kool-Aid, I am slashing my spending and rethinking my bourgeois ways. Bargain grocery shopping has become a sport. I make soups from scratch and serve casseroles made from cheap cuts of meat. Instead of taking the kids to expensive museum exhibitions to learn about nature, we are spending time in nature. Instead of dance classes, we dance. I am buying less wine, and when I do, it is supermarket wine. Dyeing my hair less, and when I do, using supermarket dye.These are messages relevant to our times, with reports in August that United States household debt reached a new peak of $13.3 trillion, an increase of $454 billion from the previous year. In Australia, we have some of the highest levels of household debt in the world, and with no sign of a big increase in wages any time soon, many Australians are having to learn to rein in their profligate ways.In many respects the modern cult of thrift \u2014 with its broad coalition of self-help gurus, former tech bros, evangelicals, financial educators and frugal moms \u2014 is a technologically led echo of the thrift movement of the early 20th century, with many of the same strengths and shortcomings. I feel this most keenly when listening to hardworking callers to \u201cThe Dave Ramsey Show\u201d who are in credit-card debt because of a lack of health care. And in many, many cases, callers speak of college debt from doing exactly what society told them they were supposed to do to get ahead.But with these limitations in mind, there is still much to admire about the cult of thrift, especially when the message is directed toward those with good incomes rather than unfairly applied to people living in poverty. There has long been potential for connection across the cultural and political spectrum on this issue \u2014 and the benefits of thrift go beyond the benefits to the individual. Our culture provides too few emotional payoffs for not spending money. All around us there are carefully designed messages telling us to spend. Letters arrive at our homes \u201cinviting\u201d us to apply for credit cards. Instagram offers us images of people with nicer vacations and trendier clothes and more photogenic food, which can make us dissatisfied with our own. So it is nice to know there are some corners of social media where someone will get excited about the idea of not upgrading your car, not using a credit card.I am thinking here of Facebook groups dedicated to budgeting and saving, and YouTube channels like Fun Cheap or Free, where Jordan Page, a Mormon mom of five, with another baby on the way, gets super excited about sharing her budget grocery hauls. Or the blog and YouTube channel of the Australian financial adviser Canna Campbell, who offers a glamorous vision of a life of minimalism and saving while still carrying a nice purse. When you see other people doing it, not spending feels more like a creative challenge connected to a sense of purpose, rather than deprivation.And after four months of learning from the thrifty and living more frugally, the unexpected consequence is that it has not just reduced my spending but has also improved my quality of life and satisfaction with life. Less time shopping for new consumer durables to bring into the house means more time enjoying and caring for the things we already have. More time is spent doing rather than acquiring, cutting flowers from the garden rather than buying them from a shop, cooking from scratch rather than ordering takeout.I am recognizing and appreciate my privilege in being wealthy enough to live well and still save, rather than feel dissatisfied by what a tiny percentage of the global population has that I do not. The experience has not been so much one of going without pleasure as about savoring each moment of pleasure rather than racing on to the next one.This approach is important, not just for personal satisfaction but also for politics. When professionals on relatively high wages in wealthy countries complain that they cannot get ahead and life is too expensive, they are not speaking in solidarity with the poor \u2014 they are actually insulting the poor. If we want to tackle inequality, those in higher income brackets must understand that they have the power to live within their means, that they have more than enough, not only to support themselves but to give more to others in the form of taxation or philanthropy.And the same goes for tackling environmental damage. The environment will not be saved by a consumerist mind-set in which the developed world rapidly throws out its consumer products to replace them with brand-new, more-energy-efficient consumer products, as if the environment can be saved by a fleet of shiny new Priuses bought on credit.I still have a long way to go in reducing my consumption. As my journey continues I plan to seek inspiration from people who have less than me rather than people who have more.

The ambivalent bachelor ringed by married couples haranguing him to settle down has been replaced by a female Bobbie, played by Rosalie Craig and catapulted into the 21st century, in a radical makeover that has given this show, long beloved critically, the sudden sheen of potential commerciality.Women, after all, buy the vast majority of theater tickets, and unmarried ones have become a larger and increasingly vocal portion of the population.\u201cI feel a unique challenge to represent that demographic,\u201d said Ms. Craig, who is married. \u201cAnd I want to do it carefully and with respect, so nobody feels patronized, or that Bobbie\u2019s a victim or anything like that.\u201dEncapsulating the seesawing ennui and excitement of city life, numbers such as \u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch,\u201d which was explicitly tailored for Stritch, and \u201cAnother Hundred People\u201d have become cabaret classics.The notion made immediate sense to Ms. Elliott. \u201cThe character is a people-pleaser,\u201d she said. \u201cThe character wants to help and provide for all of her friends and try to make everything work for them all the time, to the negation of herself, which feels like kind of a feminine trait.\u201dThe advent of egg-freezing notwithstanding, the double standard still persists. \u201cI know a lot of women \u2014 and I remember being in that situation myself \u2014 who have a very nice career, have friends, have partners but their biological clock is ticking,\u201d Ms. Elliott said. \u201cEverybody starts to think when they\u2019re heading toward being 40: \u2018Mmm, that\u2019s a shame they\u2019re not with anyone.\u2019\u201dWith gestures like making one of the husbands, David, a stay-at-home father, she is coaxing out feminist elements always latent in \u201cCompany\u201d \u2014 most powerfully in Joanne\u2019s exhortation to anesthetized housewives: \u201cEverybody rise!\u201d\u201cIf Bobbie\u2019s a woman and Amy\u2019s a woman, she\u2019s proposing to a woman, which we thought theoretically would be fine \u2014 why not?\u201d Ms. Elliott said. \u201cBut we tried that in the workshop, and it was just one of those \u2018Whooo \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I fully believe this\u2019 moments.\u2019\u201dAfter much thought and experimentation, Amy became Jamie, a gay man played by Jonathan Bailey, in a conceit that recalls another popular hit, the 1997 movie \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Wedding.\u201d\u201cAnd that just felt so very truthful,\u201d Mr. Harper said. \u201c\u2019Cause I\u2019m a gay man and I\u2019ve got so many amazing beautiful female friends, and we\u2019ve both said to each other \u2018Look, if we don\u2019t find that perfect partner by the time we\u2019re whatever, let\u2019s you and I get married.\u2019\u201dThe conversion of Amy to Jamie has also enabled the new \u201cCompany\u201d to integrate a gay story line that many long suspected was subtextual, if not central; why else, it was wondered back in the day, would Bobby be facing down his 35th birthday still a bachelor?This was different. \u201cIt\u2019s a little blush-making, but I admire Marianne so much that if she said she\u2019d wanted to turn him into a dog, I\u2019d probably go ahead and do it,\u201d Mr. Sondheim said in a promotional video for the production last year, vowing \u201cto try and get into the female psyche\u201d during their collaboration. \u201cGetting into a female psyche is a whole other matter, particularly a contemporary woman.\u201d (Mr. Sondheim declined to be interviewed for this article, saying he was busy at work on his new musical.)Technological developments have also affected the update of \u201cCompany,\u201d arguably the first significant musical of the Information Age. The opening bars of the original cast recording are overlaid with a telephone\u2019s busy signal, a sound unintelligible to digital natives who have the beep of Call Waiting, if they make conversation over a receiver at all.Smartphones and laptops make fleeting appearances, as indispensable instruments of current mating habits. (Indeed, what are Tinder and Bumble if not \u201canother hundred people,\u201d available in a single swipe?)\u201cIt\u2019s about being exposed to so much choice \u2014 that could be a bad thing, or perhaps in this case it could also be a good thing,\u201d said Mr. Fram, to whom the layered, staccato opening number, during which the friends propose various activities, seems \u201cas if we are looking at all 31 days of Bobbie\u2019s iCal all at once.\u201dThe show\u2019s strongest tether to the past other than Mr. Sondheim himself is Patti LuPone, reinhabiting the role of Joanne, a functioning alcoholic, that she previously performed in a 2011 concert version with the New York Philharmonic, directed by Lonny Price and starring Neil Patrick Harris as Bobby.Ms. LuPone also knew Stritch, a proto-Bobbie herself, who remained unmarried until she was in her late 40s, inspired at least one of the one-act vignettes that were the basis for \u201cCompany\u201d and regularly discussed with Furth the twinned aggravation and appeal of living alone.\u201cElaine looms because Elaine looms,\u201d Ms. LuPone said of the challenge of playing a character so closely identified with another star, which she has previously conquered following Ethel Merman in the leading role of \u201cAnything Goes,\u201d Angela Lansbury in \u201cSweeney Todd\u201d and both in \u201cGypsy.\u201dMoreover, Joanne has changed as well under Ms. Elliott\u2019s guidance. In relation to Bobbie rather than Bobby, she becomes more caring mentor than callous seductress. \u201cSomebody that\u2019s a role model,\u201d Ms. LuPone said. \u201cJoanne is the one that tells her \u2018Don\u2019t think that you have to get married. Just be yourself.\u2019\u201dCould this once-most-masculine of musicals, conceived by the boys\u2019 club of Furth, Prince and Sondheim, possibly flourish in the #MeToo era as a declaration of \u2026 sisterhood?Ms. Craig, who previously played one of Bobby\u2019s girlfriends, Marta (now P.J.), in a Sheffield Crucible version of \u201cCompany,\u201d is radiant with the possibility. \u201cI genuinely feel as if it\u2019s a new show,\u201d she said.Preparing for the lead part, she said she\u2019d gone out and bought \u201ca whole stack of books about females \u2014 where we fit now in society, what we want out of careers, singledom.\u201cAnd then I just thought, \u2018I don\u2019t even need to look.\u2019 It\u2019s my friendship group, it\u2019s my contemporaries, it\u2019s my families, it\u2019s my everything.

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Good Cop\u2019 Emulates \u2018Monk\u2019 but Misses Tony Shalhoub", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen it comes to the recent history of television, Andy Breckman may not come to mind as quickly as more celebrated showrunners like David Chase, David Simon or Shawn Ryan, but he deserves his own footnote. Back when \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cThe Shield\u201d were definitively raising the game for original cable drama, Mr. Breckman\u2019s creation \u201cMonk\u201d on USA \u2014 which premiered within months of \u201cThe Wire\u201d and \u201cThe Shield\u201d \u2014 was in there too, doing its bit for lighthearted cable dramedy.Mr. Breckman\u2019s formula was different from that of his darker cable peers. He updated Sherlock Holmes, creating a brilliant but socially awkward, obsessive-compulsive detective who assisted the police while milking comedy from the protagonist\u2019s discomfort and prudish fussiness. It wasn\u2019t a groundbreaking premise, and coincidentally or not, Mr. Breckman hadn\u2019t worked in TV all that much since \u201cMonk\u201d ended in 2009.So why does \u201cThe Good Cop\u201d feel so much more dull, clunky and antiquated than \u201cMonk\u201d did? The obvious, and at least partly correct, answer is that some things that worked in 2009 no longer work in 2018. But the more immediate lesson is the difference one actor can make.Josh Groban plays Tony Caruso Jr., the rules-obsessed New York police lieutenant at the center of the new show, and his big-eyed earnestness probably seemed like a good match for the part. But every minute of \u201cThe Good Cop\u201d serves as a retroactive demonstration of how \u201cMonk\u201d would have been nothing without Mr. Shalhoub and his marvelous expressiveness, timing and physicality (recognized this year with a Tony award for \u201cThe Band\u2019s Visit\u201d and an Emmy nomination for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d).Mr. Groban works hard and hits his marks, and he\u2019s likable, but he doesn\u2019t have anything resembling the comic chops needed to put across the show\u2019s Borscht Belt-style humor, or anything like Mr. Shalhoub\u2019s ability to relay emotion through movement (or excruciating stillness). Where Adrian Monk was childlike and eccentric but clearly a genius, Mr. Groban\u2019s Tony Jr. often just seems dense.It would be unfair, though, to put all the blame on Mr. Groban, who\u2019s only the most visible target. As you\u2019re watching \u201cThe Good Cop\u201d you might find yourself reimagining the scenes with Mr. Shalhoub playing all the parts: subbing for Tony Danza as Caruso Sr., the lovable but crooked ex-cop who\u2019s moved back in with his son while he\u2019s on parole, and for most of the supporting characters. (Though you\u2019d keep Isiah Whitlock Jr. as Burl, a lazy sergeant counting the days to retirement.)Most of the blame has to fall on Mr. Breckman. Mr. Shalhoub can no longer cover for the silliness and thinness of the plots or entertain us during the long gaps between when we solve the case and when the characters do. And he\u2019s not there to provide an emotional underpinning for the eunuch-like hero and to distract us from the show\u2019s retrograde, teenage-boy\u2019s perspective on sex and gender (mostly embodied in Mr. Danza\u2019s character, a backslapping, merrily harassing Rat Pack leftover). Whether you\u2019re prone to count such things or not, it\u2019s noticeable that all 10 episodes were written by men.And then there\u2019s the biggest question about \u201cThe Good Cop\u201d: Why does Mr. Danza sing, but not Mr. Groban? Maybe it was Mr. Groban\u2019s choice. But if Mr. Breckman is saving it for Season 2, he might have miscalculated.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018The First,\u2019 on Hulu, the Future Is Not That Dark", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 These days, the most natural question to ask about a television series set in the future is a simple one: So how bad does it get?The success of shows like \u201cWestworld,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d indicate that dystopias, or at least deep discomfort, are resonating with viewers. \u201cThe First,\u201d Beau Willimon\u2019s Hulu series about the space program in the not-too-distant 2030s (debuting Friday), is a bit of a curveball.The optimism of frontiersmanship, the desire to boldly go where no one has gone before, has long been a fascination for Mr. Willimon.\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in space and adventure travels,\u201d he said over the phone recently. \u201cNot just space, but also tales of people pushing themselves to extremes, to their limits. Whether it\u2019s climbing a mountain or going to the ocean depths, or Shackleton trying to traverse Antarctica.\u201d\u201cSome of these desires are almost irrational,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause there really is no way to explain why someone would place themselves in that much risk and peril in order to get to this place that doesn\u2019t necessarily even have a practical benefit other than the accomplishment itself.\u201dMr. Willimon began work on the optimistic \u201cThe First\u201d shortly before leaving \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d after its fourth season. His main character, Tom Hagerty (Mr. Penn, in his first major television role), is a decidedly different protagonist than the Machiavellian politician Frank Underwood of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d A veteran flyboy, Hagerty is a bit of a swashbuckler, but torn between his daughter\u2019s newfound yet shaky stability and the tantalizing skies.Hagerty\u2019s emotional foil, Laz Ingram (Ms. McElhone), is a cerebral but slightly awkward STEM visionary, all clockwork brains and fierce drive, frustrated by the tiresome bureaucracies that throw roadblocks in her path to the stars.Another star, though inanimate, is the show\u2019s setting. New Orleans wasn\u2019t initially a factor during Mr. Willimon\u2019s conceptual and writing process. But once Louisiana bolstered a tax credit program for film and TV production that had briefly been in flux, the city\u2019s presence began seeping into the creator\u2019s writing.\u201cHere\u2019s a place that\u2019s teeming with life in every sense,\u201d said Mr. Willimon, who also had a New Orleans-set play, \u201cLower Ninth,\u201d a conversation among tenuous survivors trapped on a rooftop in the aftermath of the 2005 floods from Hurricane Katrina. \u201cFrom this sort of swirling biological chaos of swamps and the Delta and the ocean, to the swirling human chaos of a city that\u2019s so rich in culture and history and every sort of person you can imagine.\u201dA similar thing happened with Hagerty\u2019s house, a key location in the show. After searching the elegant Garden District to no avail, Willimon happened to be back at the edge of Bywater, looking across the Mississippi, and found it: a two-story house with a balcony that feels like a ship\u2019s prow, where an explorer might look out at expanses of water and sky and grassy levee and see the edge of the world. \u201cEverything started to click,\u201d he said. \u201cIt suddenly became Tom Hagerty\u2019s house almost instantly, and I started writing to the architecture.\u201dAnd the river itself, the wide earth-colored force that has both cradled and menaced the below-sea-level city for centuries, is the site of a tragedy essential to the plot.As befits a show about the future, \u201cThe First\u201d is full of neat gadgetry and believable technology like reliable self-driving cars, augmented reality and Google Glass-ish personal communication hubs. (The only thing that seems far-fetched is the implication that by 2031 listening to voice mail messages will have made a comeback.) New Orleans was also convenient to real-life NASA facilities like the John C. Stennis Space Center, a rocket-testing facility (and summer space camp site!) on the Mississippi border, and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston.

She spoke with the aerospace engineer Jeanette Epps in preparation for her role as Kayla Price \u2014 who, like Ms. Epps, is a black female astronaut. \u201cI wanted to speak to someone who looked like me, and who potentially had a similar experience of the world,\u201d Ms. Hamilton said. The conversation was grounding, she said. One of the topics that the two women spent time on was death. \u201cI mean, here you are, actually going into a profession where you could die, and not come back to earth,\u201d she said.Price butts up against some of the uglier realities that, perhaps no surprise, still plague us in even a hopeful future. In this way, she provides the flip side to Mr. Willimon\u2019s belief that the impulses that propel us to the stars are timeless; so too are the ones that drag us back to earth.\u201cIt\u2019s both a noble pursuit and it has potentially really damaging and selfish aspects to it as well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think those two things go hand in hand. You can applaud someone who discovered the North Pole, but you can ask yourself the question, well, at what cost? What did that person put their family through? How much ambition was part of that? It wasn\u2019t purely a selfless act.\u201dAdvertisement"}

With their focus on family (the couple have five children), the Gaineses became unlikely stars by celebrating the virtues of responsible home stewardship, rather than trying to turn run-down properties into profit centers.Back when banks were handing out mortgages as if they were lollipops, the fun was in seeing what all that easy money could buy: 6,000-square-foot McMansions in freshly landscaped exurbs; high-rise condos with granite counters, marble tubs and top-of-the-world views.And when most shows of the pre-2008 era did feature older, more modest houses, as on \u201cBought & Sold\u201d (HGTV), \u201cFlip This House\u201d (A&E) and \u201cThe Real Deal\u201d (TLC), it was to illustrate how easily those homes could be turned into cash machines.As the foreclosures piled up, however, networks like HGTV and DIY faced the problem of how to keep broadcasting houses 24/7 to a public traumatized by them.The Recovery Threw the Middle-Class Dream Under a BenzThe Epicenter of the Housing Bust Is Booming Again. (That\u2019s a Warning Sign.)The Great Recession Knocked Them Down. Only Some Got Up Again.In the immediate aftermath of the crash, some HGTV shows were scrubbed midproduction because they no longer suited the recessionary times, recalled Kathleen Finch, the chief lifestyle brands officer for Discovery, which owns the network. HGTV also stopped telling viewers that if they remodeled their bathroom or kitchen, it would increase the value of their home.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t responsible information,\u201d Ms. Finch said. \u201cThere was no guarantee.\u201d\u201cFlip This House\u201d was canceled in 2009, and one of the show\u2019s high-flying speculator couples later filed for bankruptcy, caught short like so many Americans when the tide turned.The Bravo show \u201cMillion Dollar Listing,\u201d which followed a group of luxury-car-driving real estate agents in Los Angeles, was a hit before the collapse and managed to survive afterward. It made occasional references to the dire market, but still seemed cocooned in a wealth bubble, out of touch.It wasn\u2019t until DIY debuted \u201cRehab Addict,\u201d in 2010, that viewers glimpsed a new spin on the old dream of happiness through homeownership. The show\u2019s star, Nicole Curtis, wasn\u2019t your average greed-head flipper. Befitting a financially humbled nation, the single mother was instead a recycler.\u201cI restore old homes to their former glory,\u201d she announced during the opening credits.\u201cI\u2019m, like, 60 days from being bankrupt,\u201d she told the camera, echoing the financial insecurity of viewers in those years.\u201cThere was a lot of hand-wringing over that show,\u201d Ms. Finch said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how our audience would react to it.\u201dBut built into the premise was a twist: The hosts had Great Recession bona fides. When the real estate market tanked, so did their business, forcing them to downgrade to a $700-a-month apartment. They began feeding off fellow casualties of the mortgage crisis, flipping foreclosures, short sales and bank-owned properties.Many of today\u2019s home shows, with names like \u201cMaine Cabin Masters,\u201d \u201cLakefront Bargain Hunt\u201d and \u201cTiny House, Big Living,\u201d suggest that TV networks, and viewers, have learned the perils of overreach. But spend some time watching house porn and you can detect the old exuberance creeping back in.With the stock market roaring, the genre seems to be entering a gilded age. Netflix\u2019s entry, \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Extraordinary Homes,\u201d leaves viewers gawking at out-of-reach luxury homes. Apple, as part of its $1 billion initiative to make itself into a major producer of new programming, plans to unveil a similar series, \u201cHome,\u201d next year.Perhaps, like savvy investors, the couple sensed another bubble about to burst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quebec Election Looms but a Traditional Issue Doesn\u2019t: Independence", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONTREAL \u2014 Rosalie Pelchat is typical of the younger generation of Quebecers here. She switches effortlessly from French to English. She spends hours each day surfing Facebook or watching Netflix in the language of Shakespeare.And, like many of her generation, she is uninterested in fighting for an independent Quebec.\u201cWe don\u2019t feel the same insecurity about language as our parents\u2019 generation did,\u201d Ms. Pelchat, a 17-year-old science student, said in the cafeteria at Coll\u00e8ge de Maisonneuve, a Francophone college. \u201cWe are better off economically in Canada and open to the world. Talk of independence is a total turnoff.\u201dAs Quebecers prepare to go to the polls on Oct. 1 in provincial elections, the polarizing issue of whether the province should secede from Canada has been sidelined for the first time in decades. It underscores how the culture wars of the past have shifted in this Francophone province where language and culture are deeply bound up with identity.Instead of focusing on Quebec\u2019s independence, the campaign has been dominated by talk of education, health care and, especially, immigration. The center-right party is trying to appeal to Quebecers by proposing that the province\u2019s autonomy be preserved by limiting immigration and imposing a \u201cvalues test\u201d and a \u201cFrench language test\u201d on newcomers.Even the nationalist, independence-seeking Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has vowed that it would not hold a referendum on independence until after 2022, a tacit acknowledgment that the subject, at least for now, is not a vote winner.For the younger generation, aspirations of becoming a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Bill Gates appear to have pushed the constitutional preoccupations of the past to the background.In a more than two-hour debate among party leaders this month, the independence issue barely registered while the leaders clashed over Mr. Legault\u2019s proposals to expel immigrants who fail to pass a French language test after three years in the province.\u201cIf you look at what is happening in Spain, we see powers being stripped away from Catalonia, whereas in Quebec, the province has mastered more and more areas of decision-making,\u201d Mr. Cardinal said. \u201cThe fight for independence is no longer seen as worth fighting for.\u201dIt is hard to overstate how far attitudes in Quebec have changed.The province was ceded to Britain in the 18th century, but Francophones can trace their roots to 17th-century French settlers who sailed up the St. Lawrence River. During the heady years of the 1970s and early 1980s, Quebec was bubbling with agitation for independence. In those years, Francophones who spoke French in public could still be heckled with \u201cSpeak white!\u201d or English.But the balance of power gradually shifted after the governing Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois passed Bill 101 in 1977, a measure requiring that French be the language of government, the courts and commerce. Fearful that the country could be ripped apart, dozens of companies, including the Bank of Montreal, moved their headquarters to Toronto.The first referendum on whether Quebec should secede from Canada was in 1980; the \u201cno\u201d side won by nearly 20 percentage points. Then, in 1995, Quebecers voted by a tiny majority, 50.58 percent, to remain in Canada.By that time, Bill 101 had been in force for nearly 20 years. Though the law may have unnerved many investors, it engendered feelings of cultural confidence, Mr. L\u00e9ger said, making many Quebecers feel more secure living in English-majority Canada.Still, however much the issue has faded from the debate, secession is supported by a vocal minority.If an independent Quebec was able to keep the nearly $60 billion in taxes it sent each year to the federal government, he contended, Quebecers would, on the whole, be better off.\u201cCanada has far more cultural similarities with the United States than Quebec has with Canada,\u201d he said in fluent English. \u201cBut Canada wouldn\u2019t want to merge with the U.S. and have the U.S. decide its destiny. In the same manner, we don\u2019t want Quebec to be subordinate to Canada.\u201d\u201cLook at NAFTA negotiations: We have to beg Justin Trudeau, who\u2019s in thrall to big business, to keep Quebec\u2019s interests in mind on agriculture and environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could better safeguard Quebec\u2019s interests if we were independent and had our own seat at the table.\u201dBut even those seeking independence acknowledge that independence-seekers are faltering.M\u00e9lissa G\u00e9linas, 32, a postdoctoral student in Indigenous studies at Montreal\u2019s Concordia University, studied in Britain and Toronto, loves Margaret Atwood and prides herself on speaking excellent English. She also dreams of an independent Quebec.\u201cWe are a nation of Francophones in North America that can function quite well on its own,\u201d she explained before quickly adding: \u201cRealistically, I don\u2019t think it will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

You\u2019re in a New York City that looks like today\u2019s New York but isn\u2019t. A winged \u201cStatue of Extra Liberty\u201d towers in the harbor. Humans rent themselves out in a turbocharged gig economy, while Muppet-like robots hustle chess games in the park. Tiny wheeled \u201cpoop bots\u201d trudge the sidewalks cleaning up dog waste. (The subways \u2014 well, the subways are still recognizably lousy.)On these retro-techno streets (basically, the future as imagined in 1980) we find Owen (Jonah Hill) and Annie (Emma Stone), two strangers who meet as subjects in a dodgy trial for psychiatric medication that promises to give its users\u2019 subconsciouses a deep cleaning by inducing dangerous, therapeutic dreams.Owen, the disdained younger son of a plutocrat family (they made their fortune in poop bots), is scraping by on temp jobs and haunted by hallucinations. The street-savvy Annie has gotten hooked on illicit samples from the drug trial that allow her to re-experience a defining trauma. He joins the experiment to earn cash; she joins to get a fix.The first episode mostly follows Owen\u2019s story, the weaker of the two. His humiliation by his family of entitled bros (with Gabriel Byrne as the pushy paterfamilias) plays like \u201cSuccession\u201d with extra psychosis. Mr. Hill is so subdued and mumble-mouthed he seems to be performing under local anesthesia.In Episode 2, Annie crashes the narrative, driven by guilt over the disintegration of her family and a generalized rage at the world. Ms. Stone plays her like she\u2019s packed with gunpowder. She blackmails her way into the trial, telling her unfortunate target that she\u2019s not crazy, \u201cI\u2019m just goal-oriented.\u201d In the lab, she and Owen are assigned honeycomb-like pods and set to the job of dreaming.The experiment is itself a family drama. Dr. James Mantleray (a wonderfully pompous Justin Theroux, in a Warhol moptop) has a long-simmering resentment of his mother, Greta (Sally Field), a best-selling pop-psych author, and he\u2019s channeled his issues into his anthropomorphized computer. The machine \u2014 revealingly named GRTA \u2014 inevitably glitches, threatening both science and subjects: My Mother, the HAL 9000.Based on a Norwegian series about the Walter Mitty delusions of a psychiatric patient, \u201cManiac\u201d was created by Patrick Somerville, a former writer for \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d You can catch echoes of that metaphysical drama\u2019s cosmic oddball moments here.But the real surprise is Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directs all 10 episodes and is known for shooting Season 1 of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d \u201cManiac\u201d is as playful and vibrant as that series was gothic and dark, lit in neon pink and electric blue, borrowing aesthetics from Japanese design and the \u201clate \u201970s electronic toys\u201d section of eBay.Much of the action takes place in Annie and Owen\u2019s shared dreams, where they must combat their personal demons, often with small-arms fire. Mr. Fukunaga jumps genres ably in these segments. One, involving the heist of a lemur, is like a Coen Brothers screwball caper; another is convincing \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d high fantasy. (Their computer-engineered phantasms are less like chaotic actual dreams and more like a sampler of the Netflix recommendations menu.)But for all its invention, \u201cManiac\u201d keeps the \u201cInception\u201d convolutions to a minimum, toggling intelligibly between the lab and the flights of fancy in Annie and Owen\u2019s heads.In dreamspace, he\u2019s freed of his meekness, she of her self-flagellation. Yet in every incarnation \u2014 mobster, diplomat, secret agent \u2014 they encounter figures from their real-life history. For Owen, it\u2019s his brother Jed (Billy Magnussen), a manipulative imp; for Annie, her estranged sister, Ellie (Julia Garner). They become like partners in a two-player video game, in which the boss to be conquered is the familial past.Occasionally, all this psycho-gaming slips into dorm-room heavy-talk about what it all means, man; \u201cOur brains are just computers that make our life stories make sense,\u201d Owen says, as if we haven\u2019t been watching a series about precisely that. And the series seems to realize that Annie\u2019s arc is the more involving of the two, shifting focus to it over its run.But \u201cManiac\u201d is inventive and well-paced enough (the episodes clock in at a welcome 40 minutes or less) to breeze past its missteps. If you can resist a story line in which Ms. Stone relives a defining catastrophe in the person of a cynical elf warrior, your \u201cdefense mechanisms,\u201d as Dr. Mantleray would put it, are stronger than mine.In an age of desiccated puzzle-stories, \u201cManiac\u201d puts emotion first, even at the risk of sentimentality. It\u2019s a heart-shaped Rubik\u2019s Cube, a funny, consistently surprising fable of broken machines trying to reassemble themselves.Advertisement"}

The host Michael Che made a joke about it after six awards, James Corden after nine. The tension and embarrassment in the Microsoft Theater were palpable when an African-American, Regina King, finally won, for best actress in a limited series in Netflix\u2019s \u201cSeven Seconds.\u201dMeanwhile, the evening \u2014 beginning with that musty, tinny, only slightly funny production number \u2014 was proving another and more immediate negative: that the Television Academy and NBC hadn\u2019t solved the problem of how to make the Emmys broadcast funny, vibrant and relevant in the peak-TV era.That the show was more self-congratulatory and backward looking than usual could be blamed partly on its 70th anniversary status, which occasioned a short film montage of Emmys history and a long, charming but not otherwise necessary appearance by the 96-year-old Betty White.But the real problem was simply a preponderance of bad ideas and feeble writing, typified by a recurring series of skits featuring Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen as bored and clueless Emmys \u201cexperts\u201d that set back the alt-comedy cause by decades. (And whose idea was it to have an animated Rick from \u201cRick and Morty\u201d ask, \u201cHow do you think \u2018Atlanta\u2019\u2019s doing?\u201d at a point long after \u201cAtlanta\u201d had lost in five of its six categories?)The show\u2019s producer, Lorne Michaels, won an award for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and ended his acceptance speech with a dig at those who have predicted the demise of the broadcast networks, still the home of the major awards shows. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, accepting one of the broadcast networks\u2019 only two awards, the other going to the director of the Oscars. The networks may have been the one significant group to do worse on the night than people of color.A couple of tweaks to the usual award show format jointly contributed to the broadcast\u2019s anemic feel. Separating the awards by category \u2014 so that all the comedy, limited-series and drama awards, except for outstanding series, were presented in succession \u2014 robbed the evening of some of its texture and suspense. The \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d sweep was apparent within the show\u2019s opening half-hour, making the show\u2019s outstanding comedy award a few hours later an anticlimax.The decision to have the nominees\u2019 names read in prerecorded voice-overs may have saved time, and reduced the possibility of gaffes and mispronunciations by the presenters. But it, too, sucked tension out of the proceedings, and the abrupt shifts from the presenters\u2019 patter to the announcements of the winners were jarring. (It also tended to highlight the banality of most of the patter.)At a time of cataclysmic change in the country and in the TV industry, it\u2019s an accomplishment of a perverse kind to put on an awards broadcast that feels flat, inessential and, despite its insistent topicality, out of touch. It felt appropriate that the night\u2019s big finish was an award for a show, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d that hadn\u2019t had a new episode for over a year.Advertisement"}

Mr. Ansari, in jeans and a red plaid shirt, responded by saying Charleston was \u201creally one of my favorite places,\u201d before beginning a comedy set testing out new material.He added: \u201cI continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture.

He also yanked a girl\u2019s ponytail (instead of just moving away) because it was bothering him, and asked another peer to be his \u201cpractice girlfriend\u201d in order to learn the ropes of dating. By the end of the season, it felt to me that regardless of the intentions of the creator Robia Rashid, \u201cAtypical\u201d was a step backward in onscreen autistic depictions.Season 2 corrects another major problem from Season 1: The framing of Sam, and, by extension, his autism, as the forces tearing his family apart. Instead, it is his mother\u2019s infidelity and his sister\u2019s self-sabotaging streak that take center stage; Elsa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) desperately seeks forgiveness from her husband, Doug (Michael Rapaport). Casey (Bridgette Lundy-Paine) struggles to adjust to private school life and her evolving sexuality. Each member of the family has his or her own engrossing story, and this time, refreshingly, Sam and his autism aren\u2019t portrayed as the source of their misery.And the other characters remain bizarrely tolerant of Sam\u2019s often misogynist behavior. His former therapist Julia, for example, gets calls from him every day. This is after Sam broke into Julia\u2019s house and declared his love for her in Season 1. Even stranger, she feels guilty and apologizes for shouting at him after this profound violation.If a teenage boy breaks into his therapist\u2019s house and then calls her every day after she stops seeing him as a client, it\u2019s time to get a restraining order, not to apologize. No one in Sam\u2019s life seems willing to explain to him that his behavior is inappropriate \u2014 except in one refreshing instance where his guidance counselor informs him that he cannot, in fact, write in his college application essay that his greatest achievement is seeing an exotic dancer\u2019s breasts.Still, I\u2019m no longer filled with dread at the thought of more episodes, as I was after watching the first season.

They\u2019re so competitive.\u201dWhat books are on your nightstand?\u201cThe Silence of the Girls,\u201d by Pat Barker, which I\u2019ve just finished. A very good, very raw rendition of the Trojan War from the point of view of the women.A new book, \u201cOperation Columba: The Secret Pigeon Service,\u201d by Gordon Corera.And an old book, \u201cEvidence in Camera,\u201d by Constance Babington Smith, the story of photographic evidence during World War II. The latter two are for research for a novel. (I\u2019m not writing about pigeons.)And they may not be books but there are a lot of back issues of The New Yorker as well. Few things make me happier than a New Yorker cartoon.What\u2019s the last great book you read?What classic novel did you recently read for the first time?What do you read when you\u2019re working on a book? And what kind of reading do you avoid while writing?I tend to avoid fiction if I\u2019m writing it. I avoid good books and writers I admire in case they make me feel deflated about my own writing, and I avoid mediocre books (I get sent a lot) because they make me feel deflated as well. I tend to read nonfiction when I\u2019m writing, usually research. I read less and less fiction these days. I hold Netflix responsible.What\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?Sleep, sleep and more sleep.What moves you most in a work of literature?The death of animals. I have never recovered from the death of Ginger in \u201cBlack Beauty.\u201d Not joking.Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?I don\u2019t avoid anything as such; I\u2019m willing to give most things a go. But I don\u2019t read much romance or sci-fi, and I tend to read very little crime these days. I don\u2019t like all those \u201cwomen in jeopardy\u201d novels either, and there seem to be an awful lot of them.How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?Paper, simultaneously, several at a time, night, trains, planes, cars.How do you organize your books?Very badly.What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?A lot of books about nutrition. I\u2019ve been obsessed for years.What\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\u201cThe Adventures of Augustus\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a book within a book, in my novel \u201cGod in Ruins.\u201d My British publishers made a special little edition as a gift so it looks like a real book. Which it is in my head, of course.Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?Heroes: Ratty and Mole in \u201cThe Wind in the Willows,\u201d by Kenneth Grahame; Elizabeth Bennet in Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d; and Christopher Tietjens in Ford Madox Ford\u2019s \u201cParade\u2019s End.\u201dI thought long and hard about villains and realize I don\u2019t really have any. I don\u2019t think I rate characters by their morality.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?Voracious. All my childhood books stick with me and still continue to influence me today. \u201cThe Wind in the Willows\u201d; Lewis Carroll; all of E. Nesbit\u2019s books; Susan Coolidge; Richmal Crompton\u2019s \u201cJust William\u201d \u2014 all were profoundly important one way or another.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?\u201cDebrett\u2019s A-Z of Modern Manners.\u201dYou\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?Oh, lord, I would never invite writers. They\u2019re so competitive.Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?Many, many, many. All of which shall be nameless.Whom would you want to write your life story?Absolutely no one. If I was alive I would arrange to have them killed and if I were dead I would come back and haunt them. I can\u2019t think of anything more horrible.How do you decide what to read next? Is it reviews, word-of-mouth, books by friends, books for research? Does it depend on mood or do you plot in advance?It\u2019s fairly random. One book tends to lead to another.What do you plan to read next?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s and Comcast\u2019s Fight for Sky May End in Awkward Impasse", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTwo foes end up on the same team after an unlikely twist of fate. As the drawn-out battle for Sky enters its final weeks, what sounds like the premise for a bad movie may become reality for the Walt Disney Company and Comcast.Unless one of the American media giants backs down by Saturday, Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel will stage an auction for the pay-TV group. Bidding is already stretched: Comcast\u2019s offer of \u00a314.75 per share, worth \u00a326 billion ($34 billion) overall, would earn the buyer a return on investment of just 6 percent in 2020. Twenty-First Century Fox, parts of which are being absorbed by Disney, has bid \u00a314 per share for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t already own.One outcome is that Disney and Fox put in a knockout offer. The Mouse House wants to launch a streaming-video subscription service to rival Netflix. Sky\u2019s 23 million European subscribers would be the ideal launchpad, and would allow Disney to reclaim the British rights to movies like \u201cMoana.\u201d Its DisneyLife subscription product is flailing in Britain, partly because it has the rights to just 16 of the 55 Disney and Pixar movies released in the last five years, according to Bernstein.Yet Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, has deeper pockets. A bid of, say, \u00a316 per share would push the cable group\u2019s net debt to 3.1 times 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with 3.7 for Disney, according to Breakingviews calculations. Mr. Roberts is eyeing international expansion through Sky and reckons he can slash costs at the combined group.If Comcast wins the auction, Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s C.E.O., would have to decide what to do with the 39 percent of Sky he\u2019s buying from Fox. Accepting the bid would bring in \u00a310 billion or more in cash. But the stake might also prove a useful bargaining chip. Mr. Iger could offer it to Comcast down the road in return for movie and television rights owned by Sky, or some other swap involving Hulu.Until then, the two media giants would be at an impasse. Disney would have economic exposure to Sky but no control over the British group. Comcast would control the board but couldn\u2019t pass special shareholder resolutions without its rival\u2019s support. Crucially, it would lose a share of the dividends paid by the British broadcaster. The joint venture would be an awkward end to an overpriced deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Tumultuous Week for Justin Trudeau: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo much for a quiet end to the lazy days of summer in Canada.And in case you were enjoying the last days of August and need to catch up, here are some highlights from our coverage this week:White House Gives Canada More Time to Rework NaftaNafta Is Suddenly in Doubt, and Canada ReelsTrump Approach on Nafta Relieves Automakers\u2019 Worst FearsTrump\u2019s Tariffs on Canadian Newsprint Are OverturnedNafta wasn\u2019t the only source of turmoil and potential political trouble for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau this week.The already overheated debate over expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta to an oil tanker port in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby became even hotter on Thursday when the Federal Court of Appeal slapped down the government for not conducting sincere and meaningful consultations with Indigenous people. The court also ordered the National Energy Board to look at the environmental effects of more tankers in the waters off British Columbia\u2019s coast.Though the project is unpopular with many Liberal supporters, the government had solidly backed the expansion of the pipeline it is soon to purchase, in part as a way to get Alberta onside with its carbon tax program. So it wasn\u2019t surprising to see an angry Rachel Notley, Alberta\u2019s premier, appearing on television a few hours after the news broke to announce that her province\u2019s government was pulling out of the carbon reduction program until construction workers actually start building the pipeline expansion.But Ms. Notley, whose political fortunes also rest on the project, wasn\u2019t the only person with tart words for Mr. Trudeau. Many Indigenous groups, who were the main applicants in the lawsuit, called on the prime minister to kill the expansion, as did environmentalists and politicians on the left.Some are opposed because the pipeline mainly carries oil from Alberta\u2019s oil sands, which they regard as a particularly polluting energy source. Others, including John Horgan, the premier of British Columbia, fear catastrophe if a tanker sinks or splits open off the province\u2019s coast.On the other side, Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, charged that Mr. Trudeau had bungled the issue.So what\u2019s a prime minister to do?As part of his oft-stated position that Canada needs the economic strength of its energy industry as it deals with climate change, Mr. Trudeau announced in May that the government would buy Trans Mountain from its American owner. That company, Kinder Morgan, had earlier abandoned plans to expand the pipeline over opposition from British Columbia\u2019s government.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s promise to finish the project has made the government a player in the energy industry for the first time since it created and owned Petro-Canada. And that\u2019s led to criticism from the right, even among those who support pipelines.Opponents of the expansion were quick to portray the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision as a crippling blow to the expansion plans. But legal experts I spoke to, and even the ruling itself, suggest that description might be a vast overstatement.The ruling does not give Indigenous groups an effective veto over the pipeline, nor does it require the government to negotiate with the groups. The government does, however, have to go back and do a better job of consulting with them, a process experts say could take as little as six months.As for the marine review, the government claims to have already assessed those issues, just not through the National Energy Board. So that may be cleared up just as quickly.Taking care of the legal questions, of course, will only get pipeline construction crews to work. Calming the political tensions won\u2019t be as easy. For Mr. Trudeau, the biggest challenge may be stopping Trans Mountain from turning into something that ultimately satisfies no one.Last year Catherine Porter, our Toronto bureau chief, wrote about an ambitious project that was then underway on British Columbia\u2019s west coast: Canada\u2019s first Haida-language feature film.\u201cEdge of the Knife\u201d will debut at the Toronto International Film Festival next Friday, Sept. 7.

In this telling, the wildman loses his mind after the death of a child, and is brought back to his community through a healing ceremony.Our colleagues at Watching, The Times\u2019s guide to viewing on screens of all sizes, have come up with their September list of recommendations for Netflix subscribers in Canada. This month\u2019s films include the critically acclaimed superhero epic \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d and \u201cJane,\u201d a documentary about the chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall by Brett Morgen, featuring an original soundtrack by Philip Glass.

Despite their alleged dietary habits, the wolves are the area\u2019s most appealing inhabitants and not just because they don\u2019t come across as dangerous or damaged as the human residents. Unlike all the scowling men and women, these howling beauties \u2014 who look as well-groomed as they appear well fed and trained \u2014 are also fun to watch.The director Jeremy Saulnier has a gift for seizing your attention with arresting, harmoniously balanced images that somehow seem to either briefly slow down or even freeze a movie. These visual grabbers have real pop and work somewhat like narrative punctuation by accenting a moment, a milieu or a character. (Here, he draws you in quickly with an assembly of wolves and a solitary child.) The movie keeps moving, the story keeps flowing, but these images \u2014 which feel suspended between cinema and still photography \u2014 create a pause in the action that your anxious imagination can\u2019t help but fret over. That\u2019s especially true because Mr. Saulnier\u2019s images are often in service of spooky, blood-drenched tales.The story is a mess, but the setting, animals and actors make for solid bait. A retired naturalist who has written about wolves, Core travels to Keelut after receiving a letter (a genuine paper missive) from Medora (an egregiously misused Riley Keough), who says that her son has been snatched by wolves and that the authorities are useless. For reasons that remain inexplicable at best (he\u2019s got family troubles and appears depressed), he buys Medora\u2019s tale and is soon impassively hunkered down in her home as she spins a story that seems a whole lot like a web. By the time she\u2019s meandering around naked in the middle of the night wearing a wolf mask you\u2019re wondering why Core hasn\u2019t booked a seat on the next plane out.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

Watch the eight half-hour episodes in a row if at all possible; the narrative effect is cumulative.\u201cForever\u201d is occasionally funny, though more quirky than ha-ha-ha, but it is also quite sad. It\u2019s very comfortable around its characters\u2019 loneliness, the slow despair of \u201cthe devil you know\u201d choices and the alienation of midcentury houses that are so well maintained they\u2019re more mausoleum than home.I\u2019m choosing to believe that the slight shortcomings of this sophomore season of the mockumentary \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d are, themselves, a spoof on the fact that true crime shows are almost never as good in their second seasons. Luckily, \u201cVandal\u201d still finds plenty to have fun with. This eight-episode season focuses on the Turd Burglar, who has committed a series of poop-related crimes at a prep school. A class weirdo named Kevin (Travis Tope) has confessed \u2026 but something is amiss.Season 5 of this beautiful, tragic comedy about fame and depression hits some of the highest points the series has ever achieved. BoJack (voiced by Will Arnett) continues to be miserable but hauntingly eloquent about it. This season\u2019s best arc comes from BoJack\u2019s ridiculous \u201cTrue Detective\u201d-like series, although the best episode (Episode 6) isn\u2019t connected to that at all.

{"Headline": "Les Moonves Said to Be Negotiating Possible Exit From CBS", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moonves has been talking to the board about his possible departure as chief executive, including terms of a payout that would be far less than $180 million, the amount specified in his employment agreement should he leave the CBS Corporation, according to three people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private bargaining agreement.The multiple allegations of sexual harassment against Mr. Moonves have partly motivated the talks, which could still break down. Should Mr. Moonves depart, his chief lieutenant, Joseph Ianniello, is likely to be named interim chief executive, two of the people said.During his tenure, Mr. Moonves, 68, has helped transform CBS from a last-place network into the most watched channel for the last decade, with hits like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cSurvivor.\u201d That success has made Mr. Moonves one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood and his possible departure has put the future fortunes of the company into doubt.For over a month, Mr. Moonves has been grappling with the two separate but equally fateful issues. In addition to the harassment allegations against him, Mr. Moonves is involved in a legal dispute with Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of CBS. An exit with a significant cash payout for Mr. Moonves before a trial that may decide control of the company could be seen as a beneficial outcome for all parties, according to the people.Earlier this year, Mr. Moonves and the network\u2019s independent directors mounted a legal challenge to Ms. Redstone, 64, in an attempt to stop her from merging the network with Viacom. The trial is set to begin Oct. 3 in Delaware Chancery Court. At the same time, the board is investigating claims of sexual harassment against Mr. Moonves and allegations of a broader culture of harassment at CBS, most notably in its news division.Both issues complicated the interplay among directors, and exposed its factions, with one group apparently loyal to Ms. Redstone, another to Mr. Moonves and others debating which direction the company should take.In a statement at the time, Mr. Moonves said: \u201cI recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2014 and abided by the principle \u2014 that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career.\u201dShortly after the article was published, the CBS board enlisted two law firms to lead an inquiry into the claims against Mr. Moonves and the wider workplace culture at the network. The board soon after folded a separate examination of CBS News \u2014 underway since March \u2014 into the larger investigation.The board hired Nancy Kestenbaum of Covington & Burling and Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton to conduct the inquiry. Ms. White led the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration and was previously the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Ms. Kestenbaum was also a federal prosecutor with the same district. The investigation into CBS News is being led by the law firm of Proskauer Rose.Mr. Moonves had recused himself from any matters related to the investigation, and a three-member committee \u2014 Bruce S. Gordon, Linda Griego and Robert N. Klieger \u2014 has been appointed to oversee the inquiry. The makeup of that panel reflects the fractious board itself.Mr. Klieger, a lawyer based in Los Angeles, occupies one of three CBS board seats appointed by Ms. Redstone\u2019s family company. (In addition to Mr. Klieger, Ms. Redstone and David R. Andelman, a Boston-based lawyer who has represented the Redstone family in the past, make up the Redstone family\u2019s board seats.)Ms. Redstone commands both CBS and Viacom by owning 80 percent of voting rights, and the legal battle is being waged to water down that stake in CBS.Ms. Redstone had asked the boards of CBS and Viacom to explore the possibility of a merger to protect themselves from the onslaught of technology giants like Netflix, Amazon and Facebook, which have taken ad dollars and eyeballs away from the traditional players.Mr. Moonves and the majority of the CBS board, however, concluded a combination would not benefit CBS\u2019s shareholders. The company has a far more robust business, while revenue at Viacom, which includes the cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, has been shrinking over the last few years.Ms. Redstone has countersued, claiming Mr. Moonves had effectively forced the CBS board to take legal action against her lest he leave the company.Mr. Moonves draws an annual pay package worth $69.3 million. His employment agreement included a provision that would pay him more than $184 million in pay and benefits as part of his exit if the board fires him without fault, or if he leaves because of the legal dispute.Last month, the CBS directors who are unaffiliated with Ms. Redstone filed requests to seek more information about how her family company, National Amusements, handles the voting shares of its own company and that of CBS.Lawyers for the network suggested in court proceedings that Ms. Redstone\u2019s control of the shares could be in doubt because she\u2019s acting at the behest of her father, Sumner Redstone, 95, who has been in ill health for several years. Mr. Redstone owns the controlling shares, and he does not speak and is being fed through a tube.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Forever\u2019 Is a Thrilling Story of Boring Love", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne year, after 14 straight annual fishing trips, June (Maya Rudolph) and Oscar (Fred Armisen) decide to change up their routine and go skiing. Neither of them has ever skied before. They are middle-aged. It is perhaps too late for all this. They find themselves, freezing and unsteady, tottering on a bunny hill.The series sets its tone, and the terms of June and Oscar\u2019s marriage, in a jazz-scored opening montage. Vignettes pass from right to left: they meet, they fall in love, they move in together, they brush their teeth, they go fishing, they go fishing, they go fishing. It\u2019s a picture of a sweet, dull life, and the visual effect is of panning from room to room, unable to move backward and change direction.The pair have a bantering, best-pals rapport, passing time on a long drive by debating the best way to spend a half-hour. (Sex comes well down the list, after getting a massage and looking at your phone, and they both agree that thirty minutes is \u201ca little long.\u201d) Materially comfortable and unencumbered by children, they have the life rhythms of a prematurely retired couple, though they both work.The hitch, as the opening suggests, is that June is ready for something different and Oscar is not. Things do change, and this is where I must get vague.That\u2019s all true, and thus I\u2019ll zip it about most of what happens beyond the first episode. You will think you have figured out what kind of show \u201cForever\u201d is, and you will be wrong, and you will figure it out again, and you will be wrong again. (The show is best binged quickly; if it\u2019s not for you, you\u2019ll probably know three episodes in.)But in another sense, \u201cForever\u201d is the same story from beginning to end. It\u2019s a narratively nimble show that\u2019s thematically about routine, emotional fidelity and the possibility, or impossibility, of reinvention.Mr. Armisen is right about half the time as Oscar, a variation on the neurotic, young-old-man character that he played in half his \u201cPortlandia\u201d roles. Maybe because of that history, and his tendency to push his characters to an unsettling, staring-too-long grotesqueness, his character lacks the gravity he needs in the more serious moments.If \u201cForever\u201d were a movie \u2014 which it easily could have been \u2014 you\u2019d say it has third-act problems. The story seems to spiral away from it in the last couple of episodes, and the ending feels like it\u2019s giving itself credit for resolving issues it hasn\u2019t fully addressed.But \u201cForever\u201d dares enough, and pulls off a high enough percentage of what it tries, that I found it worth the trip. It manages to be at the same time slice-of-life and cosmically absurd, reflective and irreverent, fantastical and grounded.One of the best episodes shifts focus entirely, to a different couple who have a conversation that is not about June and Oscar but neatly describes their dilemma. One of them questions the concept of monogamy: \u201cThings change, people change and then you want something different.\u201d The other counters, \u201cIf you\u2019re with someone you love, you\u2019ve got to fight for it.\u201dA typical romantic comedy would leave no doubt that the second answer is the right one. \u201cForever\u201d is willing to give both a hearing \u2014 and to understand that most people, who can live their lives only forward, will never know if a different answer would have been better for them.It\u2019s a tricky combination of tones \u201cForever\u201d is aiming for, simultaneously heartfelt and ambivalent. But if the show sometimes gets out over its skis, I give it credit for being willing to strap them on.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Lawmakers Pass Nation\u2019s Toughest Net Neutrality Law", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe California bill is viewed as even stronger and more consumer-friendly than the original measures carried out by the Obama administration and abolished in December by the Trump-era Federal Communications Commission. It is sure to set up a fight between broadband providers, which say strict rules would increase their costs, and consumer groups, which seek to ensure that all traffic on the internet is treated equally.If Gov. Jerry Brown signs the bill, California would become the fourth state to create a net neutrality law since the federal rollback, but it is considered the most significant. \u201cThis bill would set a tremendous precedent, with the power to shape the internet market not just in California but across the country for the betterment of consumers,\u201d Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, said in a statement.The F.C.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The bill was passed by the State Senate on Friday and the State Assembly on Thursday, both by large margins.\u201cWhen Donald Trump\u2019s F.C.C. decided to take a wrecking ball to net neutrality protections, we knew that California had to step in to ensure our residents have access to a free and open internet,\u201d State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat and one of the bill\u2019s authors, said in a statement.Lawmakers in California are seeking to bar internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing down the transmission of web traffic to the state\u2019s broadband customers. The bill would also prohibit promotions of free streaming for apps, a practice that can stifle the businesses of other websites that don\u2019t have the resources to offer such promotions.The bill would ensure that consumers would not be charged extra for access to websites. Consumers would also be guaranteed that video streams from any site like Netflix, Vudu or Hulu would be delivered to a mobile device or an internet television at the same speeds and quality.The bill would become California\u2019s second major internet law passed in the last few months. In June, the state adopted an internet privacy law, the first in the nation. It gave California internet users the ability to know what information a company like Facebook or Google was collecting, and how it was being used and shared with third parties. The law also gave them the right to stop data collection.The law would face fierce resistance from telecommunications companies. Through their trade group, USTelecom, broadband providers lobbied against the bill, warning that the rules on their management of traffic would stifle innovation and hinder business models.Lawmakers said internet service providers had already indicated to them that they would sue to overturn a net neutrality law. \u201cWe will fight with everything we have to defend it,\u201d Mr. Wiener said in a news conference.Some legal experts say the F.C.C. did not have the authority to prohibit state net neutrality laws. In a separate court battle, a federal appeals court will decide if the commission\u2019s rollback was legal.Federal net neutrality rules have been challenged in lawsuits several times over the past decade and the issue could eventually wind up before the Supreme Court.\u201cThe internet must be governed by a single, uniform and consistent national policy framework, not state-by-state piecemeal approaches,\u201d Jonathan Spalter, president of USTelecom, said in a statement.Governor Brown, a Democrat, has not indicated his view on the bill, but it was widely supported by Democrats in the Legislature and by federal Democratic lawmakers from California like Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader. Mr. Brown has until the end of September to decide on the bill, and he is expected to be intensely lobbied by telecommunications companies and consumer groups. In 2017, telecommunications providers fought against a state broadband privacy bill, which the Legislature never passed.\u201cTelecommunications companies have tremendous power and sway in California, so we know the fight is not over,\u201d said Barbara van Schewick, a professor of law at Stanford University, who has been a strong proponent of net neutrality laws.The California bill is the most significant victory for supporters of net neutrality rules since the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, scrapped federal regulations last year. Net neutrality advocates view broadband providers as important utilitylike services like the phone, saying that without the rules, big players with deep pockets have an unfair advantage.Mr. Pai viewed the rules as burdensome. Telecom companies said they wanted to experiment with business models such as free streaming promotions over mobile phones with business partners. The broadband providers promised they would not block or intentionally slow down other websites in an anticompetitive manner.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Netherlands, a Tax Avoidance Center, Tries to Mend Its Ways", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE HAGUE \u2014 The Netherlands wants you to know that it is not a tax haven. But Menno Snel, the country\u2019s No. 2 finance official, grudgingly acknowledges that the Dutch have become experts at something else: aggressive tax planning.That\u2019s backed up by the amount of money pouring across its borders. For tax avoidance purposes, the Netherlands offers the status of a European country, while allowing big multinationals, like Google and Ikea, to move global profits through Dutch subsidiaries, drastically lowering their tax payments.The atrium of the Dutch Finance Ministry, where Mr. Snel works, is even adorned with full-grown potted palms that give it a whiff of a tropical tax haven. The suggestion of any parallel is probably unintentional.In any case, the Dutch position as a tax avoidance center could be about to change. In a major reversal, the Finance Ministry this week submitted proposals to Parliament that would shut down the benefits that made the Netherlands a magnet for international corporations \u2014 especially American ones, like Netflix, Nike and Uber. Debate on the measures is expected to continue through December.Under the proposals, the Netherlands plans to impose levies on profits being transferred to tax havens and to block companies from exploiting inconsistent national laws to take the same deduction twice. Whether those proposals will get past the array of accountants, lawyers and consultants who help foreign companies reduce their tax payments, and who have voiced opposition to the changes, is not yet clear.Mr. Snel, whose formal title is state secretary of finance, said in an interview, \u201cWe must be fair in recognizing that some companies are misusing the open tax system that the Netherlands has.\u201dAmid a popular backlash against what many see as multinationals gaming the system, tax change has been a hot political issue in the Netherlands this year. In addition, legislators must close loopholes to avoid breaching new European Union rules that take effect in 2019.Tax cuts in the United States also affect the appeal of the Dutch system. At the same time, new rules passed in Washington make it harder for companies to stash profits overseas.As a relatively affluent member of the eurozone, the Netherlands offers a reliable court system and lack of official corruption not always present in island tax havens. It also boasts a comprehensive network of tax treaties with almost every nation, and little or no tax on money passing through the country. It is easy to move money in, and easy to move it out.The Netherlands has been especially popular with American corporations. Google and IBM have big presences in the country, as do such service providers as the law firm Baker McKenzie and the accounting company Deloitte. Fiat Chrysler is technically a Dutch company. Nike has its European headquarters in Hilversum, just south of Amsterdam.The sports apparel maker used a common, legal method of shifting profits to a tax haven, according to the consortium\u2019s research. First, it allocated ownership of its \u201cswoosh\u201d trademark and other intellectual property to a subsidiary in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. Then, its subsidiary in Hilversum paid royalties for the use of the trademarks to the Bermuda unit. The royalties counted as business expenses and in that way avoided taxation in the Netherlands.\u201cNike fully complies with tax regulations, and we rigorously ensure our tax filings are fully aligned with how we run our business,\u201d the company said in a statement to The Times.At least until recently, the Dutch Finance Ministry was a willing enabler for such arrangements. Corporate accountants and lawyers could call at the ministry for preapproval of their strategies. The Netherlands long justified its laws by arguing that they encouraged multinational companies to establish their headquarters in the country, creating jobs and investment.More recently, however, legal thinking and public opinion have turned.In national elections last year, almost all the major political parties promised change. And the public anger has provided political impetus for the government.Mr. Snel, a member of the Democrats 66 party, a socially liberal partner in the governing coalition, is credited by many activists for pursuing the task with more zeal than his predecessors.\u201cMenno Snel is being more proactive and more constructive in addressing tax avoidance,\u201d said Francis Weyzig, a tax policy expert in The Hague for the charity Oxfam, which argues that island havens steal revenue from developing countries. \u201cDefinitely, there has been a change.\u201dFor example, Mr. Snel has proposed measures to prevent companies from exploiting inconsistencies in national rules that allow profits to fall through the cracks, avoiding taxation.Other provisions he has proposed oblige lawyers and accountants to disclose information about questionable arrangements. The Netherlands will also limit the size of deductions that companies take for interest payments, a measure aimed at another popular method for shifting profits to tax havens. In that arrangement, firms take out loans in low-tax countries but allocate the interest to the Netherlands, where it is deductible as an operating expense.But tax is a big business for the Netherlands, leaving open the possibility that vigorous objections from multinationals could weaken efforts to retool the system.\u201cThe Netherlands is not serious about ending its tax haven status,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament who is the Green Party\u2019s spokesman on tax policy. He noted that the Netherlands had resisted attempts to prevent European countries from competing to have the lowest corporate rate.\u201cCompanies that want to come to the Netherlands and set up a genuine business \u2014 the question is whether you would scare them off by being too strict,\u201d said Bartjan Zoetmulder, a tax partner at Loyens & Loeff, a big Dutch law firm.So far, there are no signs of mass unemployment among the thousands of Dutch lawyers, accountants and notaries who specialize in working with foreign corporations. Many young people still regard tax advising as a lucrative career with a future, a sign they do not expect the changes to undercut the appeal of the Netherlands.Enrollment in courses for budding tax consultants \u201chas never been so high,\u201d said Jan van de Streek, a professor at the University of Amsterdam who teaches tax policy, with a hint of chagrin.And lately there has been public outrage over an exemption for shareholder dividends that is seen as benefiting Shell and Unilever, two of the Netherlands\u2019 biggest corporations, at the expense of ordinary citizens.Mr. Snel said that Dutch officials would continue to consult with businesses, but would apply stricter standards that were either in place or would go into force in coming years.

{"Headline": "Sure, It\u2019s Only September, but the Oscar Race Is in Full Swing", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe CarpetbaggerTORONTO \u2014 The 2018 award-season aspirants will include superheroes, space travelers and Lady Gaga, but will their movies prove popular enough to assuage the fears of an academy that nearly introduced an Oscar just for blockbusters? With three significant fall film festivals now on the books, including the Toronto International Film Festival heading into its final weekend, and with a few impressive holdovers from earlier in the year still making waves, it\u2019s time to take a look at the clarified landscape of Academy Award contenders. Here are some of the movies and performances that your new Carpetbagger expects will be in the running for the six biggest Oscars.A clutch of new films that made their debuts over the last few weeks at the Venice, Telluride and Toronto festivals may also become big hits on the way to a best picture nomination. The sky is the limit for the well-reviewed musical romance \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d which Bradley Cooper directed and stars in opposite Lady Gaga. \u201cGreen Book\u201d came into Toronto amid low expectations and emerged a ferocious crowd-pleaser: A racial-issues dramedy in the vein of \u201cThe Blind Side\u201d and \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d the film stars Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali as mismatched personalities on a road trip through the Deep South. And though the man-on-the-moon biopic \u201cFirst Man\u201d was hit by an unexpected controversy over whether the American flag appeared prominently enough, critics and audiences alike should take to the story of astronaut Neil Armstrong (played by Ryan Gosling) when the film is released in October, its grosses likely to be goosed by an exceptional IMAX sequence set on the lunar surface.Both Mr. Cooper and the \u201cFirst Man\u201d helmer Damien Chazelle have a strong shot at making the best director lineup, though they\u2019ll be challenged by another group of recent Oscar victors. In 2017, the Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMoonlight\u201d won best picture over Mr. Chazelle\u2019s \u201cLa La Land,\u201d and Mr. Jenkins is back with \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk,\u201d an intimate story of love tested by racial injustice. In 2014, Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d won best picture while Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n took home best director for \u201cGravity\u201d; both men are in the mix again this year: Mr. McQueen with \u201cWidows,\u201d a galvanizing, female-led crime thriller, and Mr. Cuar\u00f3n with \u201cRoma,\u201d a black-and-white Netflix drama drawn from the director\u2019s Mexico City childhood.And then there are the contenders yet to screen, including a Dick Cheney comedy from \u201cThe Big Short\u201d director Adam McKay and possibly even \u201cThe Mule,\u201d an undated drama from Clint Eastwood, whose film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d was a blockbuster best picture nominee in 2015.If \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d proves to be an award-season hit, Mr. Cooper may set a record for the most Oscar nominations a single person has earned for one film: In addition to directing and starring, he also produced it, co-wrote it and had a hand in the songs. Of those potential nominations, the likeliest win will be for best actor. As a veteran crooner whose drinking increasingly gets the best of him, Mr. Cooper is the current front-runner in a category that is not yet filled with sure things.Still, from the films already screened, expect consideration for Mr. Gosling in \u201cFirst Man,\u201d the latest in the 37-year-old star\u2019s recent series of stoic leads, as well as outside bids for Robert Redford\u2019s cinematic swan song in \u201cThe Old Man & the Gun\u201d and Ethan Hawke\u2019s acclaimed turn in the spring indie \u201cFirst Reformed.\u201d More muted performances from Hugh Jackman in the political drama \u201cThe Front Runner\u201d and Lucas Hedges as a teenager sent to gay conversion therapy in \u201cBoy Erased\u201d may struggle to find traction against the flashy transformations offered by Christian Bale as Dick Cheney in Mr. McKay\u2019s movie and Rami Malek as the Queen singer Freddie Mercury in \u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\u201dThe Bagger is also curious about whether Mr. Mortensen and Mr. Ali will both submit themselves as leading men for \u201cGreen Book,\u201d or whether one will indulge in category fraud and drop down a rung to the supporting actor race. While it\u2019s rare for two men from the same movie to make the best actor lineup, they have a good shot in a weak year, and Mr. Ali deserves a second nomination after recently winning the Oscar for his supporting role in \u201cMoonlight\u201d; his prickly, precise work as a pianist dealing with racism in \u201cGreen Book\u201d offers nuance the film would otherwise lack.A similar uncertainty makes the best actress field hard to predict, since \u201cThe Favourite\u201d fields three women, each of whom could position herself as a lead: Olivia Colman shines as a diminished Queen Anne manipulated by two crafty women in her court, played with comic precision by Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. Two more royal schemers are still to come in \u201cMary Queen of Scots,\u201d which stars Saoirse Ronan in the title role and Margot Robbie as her rival, Queen Elizabeth I; both Ms. Ronan and Ms. Robbie were nominated for best actress last year and could return to that category once again.Three of last year\u2019s Oscar nominees could figure into this year\u2019s supporting actor race, making it a familiar bunch: \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d breakout Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays a young man wrestling with his drug habits in \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d; Daniel Kaluuya, so sympathetic as the lead of \u201cGet Out,\u201d is terrifying as a murderous henchman in \u201cWidows.\u201d Sam Rockwell, who won the supporting-actor Oscar last year for \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,\u201d may return to the field for his work as George W. Bush in Mr. McKay\u2019s Cheney movie, though until the film screens, we won\u2019t have a clear idea who is the standout. (Perhaps Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld?)If \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d end up in best picture contention, each could push a never-nominated actor into this category: Sam Elliott brings heart to the former as Bradley Cooper\u2019s older brother, while Michael B. Jordan is so ferocious in \u201cBlack Panther\u201d that his character Killmonger has already become one of the year\u2019s most-talked about villains. The supporting-actor race will also probably make room for Mr. Grant in \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d Outside bids could potentially include \u201cBoy Erased\u2019s\u201d Russell Crowe as a religious man in turmoil over his gay son, and Adam Driver and Topher Grace filling out the cast of \u201cBlacKkKlansman.\u201dShould Ms. Colman drop down to the supporting-actress category for \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d she would probably coast through Oscar season, picking up trophies right and left, but other contenders in that category include Claire Foy as Neil Armstrong\u2019s wife in \u201cFirst Man,\u201d Amy Adams as the vice-presidential spouse Lynne Cheney in Mr. McKay\u2019s movie and two fiercely loving mothers, Ms. Kidman in \u201cBoy Erased\u201d and Regina King in \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d Should \u201cWidows\u201d hit big, the Australian actress Elizabeth Debicki could break through, but the most interesting contender is Tilda Swinton, who plays three separate roles in \u201cSuspiria,\u201d one of whom is an elderly male psychiatrist. Perhaps she could give the men gunning for best supporting actor a run for their money.Advertisement"}

But the result came as a relief to HBO, which can now say that it has technically finished in first place among all broadcast and cable networks for 17 years running.The rest of HBO\u2019s awards were spread among several shows in acting categories, including wins for Henry Winkler (\u201cBarry\u201d), Bill Hader (\u201cBarry\u201d), Thandie Newton (\u201cWestworld\u201d) and Peter Dinklage (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d).In his acceptance speech, Mr. Dinklage called out the show\u2019s creators, David Benioff and Dan Weiss, saying: \u201cThank you Dave and Dan for changing my life. I cannot walk down the street anymore.\u201d\u201cThe Americans,\u201d the FX spy drama that concluded earlier this year, won two awards, including best actor in a drama for Matthew Rhys. The FX drama had won only two Emmys across its previous five seasons, but voters decided to give it some love on its way out, as they had with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201dNetflix spent handsomely on Emmy campaigning this year, opening a space in Hollywood to showcase its fare and advertising on billboards along the Sunset Strip. But it wasn\u2019t the only company to hype its wares. So-called For Your Consideration events \u2014 panel discussions where voters have access to stars, canap\u00e9s and booze \u2014 filled the schedules of the more than 23,000 members of the Television Academy in the run-up to the ceremony.Last year, there were 61 academy-sanctioned events in Los Angeles and New York during Emmy campaigning season. This year, that number ballooned to 116, according to a spokesman for the academy.Lorne Michaels, the 73-year-old impresario behind \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and NBC\u2019s late-night lineup, also had a big night. Not only did he leave the Microsoft Theater with the Emmy for best variety sketch series, he also produced the broadcast for NBC. It was his second time at the helm, having last overseen the Emmys broadcast in 1988, when the \u201cDynasty\u201d star John Forsythe was the host.In addition to giving the hosting job to Mr. Jost and Mr. Che, Mr. Michaels recruited a number of current and former \u201cS.N.L.\u201d cast members. The show began with a satirical musical number on Hollywood\u2019s diversity problem, led by two stalwarts of the show, Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon.\u201cYup, we solved it!\u201d Mr. Thompson exclaimed.Andy Samberg and RuPaul joined in, along with a group of Broadway-style hoofers identified as the One of Each Dancers.In a taped segment midway through the broadcast, the show returned to diversity as a theme, with Mr. Che handing out \u201creparations Emmys\u201d to black actors from past shows, including Jimmie Walker and John Witherspoon.The focus on diversity became ironic as the night wore on, with one white person after another delivering acceptance speeches. Before the ceremony was done, there were victories for actors and performers of color \u2014 including Regina King, for the Netflix limited series \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d; Ms. Newton, for her work on HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d; and RuPaul, of VH1\u2019s \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d \u2014 but the great majority of winners did not reflect the night\u2019s theme.The \u201cS.N.L.\u201d influence held fast throughout the night, with Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, stars of a new Amazon show, \u201cForever,\u201d appearing in a series of awkward-on-purpose sketches and an out-of-breath Will Ferrell presenting the award for best comedy series.In a way, it was surprising to see the New York-based \u201cS.N.L.\u201d front and center at the Emmys. The Television Academy, the main body behind the awards, has looked askance at the show for most of its 43-year run. But that has changed, with \u201cS.N.L.\u201d having won half of its 62 Emmys in the past five years.\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d a series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino about a housewife who tries her luck as a comedian in 1950s New York, had a big night, taking five awards, including best comedy series.It was the first time Amazon had won a top show award at the Emmys, and the first time a streaming service had taken the best comedy award.Rachel Brosnahan, who plays the show\u2019s title character, won for best actress in a comedy, the first new winner in that category in seven years. (With HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d sidelined this year, Julia Louis-Dreyfus hit the pause button on her record-breaking Emmy run.) Ms. Sherman-Palladino won for directing and writing, in addition to the best comedy series award. And Alex Borstein, who plays Mrs. Maisel\u2019s manager, took the award for best supporting actress.The triumph of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d was a blow to the avant-garde FX comedy \u201cAtlanta,\u201d a critical favorite. Donald Glover, the show\u2019s star and creator, took the prize for best actor in a comedy last year. This time, he lost out to Mr. Hader, who plays a hit man trying to make it as an actor in \u201cBarry.\u201d74 PhotosIn the late-night battle, John Oliver\u2019s weekly HBO show, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d took the best variety talk category for a third year in a row, besting his former colleague at Comedy Central, Stephen Colbert, the host of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS.But the issue was largely absent from this year\u2019s ceremony, with no one mentioning Mr. Moonves from the stage.In his opening remarks, Mr. Che broached the topic, welcoming \u201cthe many, many talented people in Hollywood who haven\u2019t been caught yet.\u201dWith President Trump still deeply unpopular in Hollywood, the hosts, presenters and winners referred to him only in veiled terms, if at all, which stood in contrast to this event in each of the last two years.Mr. Che and Mr. Jost did not invoke his name in their opening remarks. And most winners stayed away from third rail political fare.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the actress Thandie Newton. She is British, not American.An earlier version of this article misidentified the award presented by Will Ferrell. It was the award for best comedy series, not the final award, which was for best dramatic series.Follow John Koblin on Twitter: @koblinAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Unveils Bigger iPhones at Higher Prices, and a Heart-Tracking Watch", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has long had a playbook for iPhones, its most important product: Keep rolling out bigger, faster and more expensive models.On Wednesday, it repeated that strategy by introducing another round of iPhones that are \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 bigger, faster and more expensive. The model with a 6.5-inch screen, the iPhone XS Max, is Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone ever and will start at $1,100. (And, yes, its name is a mouthful.) Last year when Apple debuted its iPhone X, the starting price was $1,000.More notable, perhaps, was how much Apple is now evolving its smart watch into a clearly health-related device. The company showed off a new Apple Watch with an electronic heart sensor approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That could lead to new implications for health care \u2014 and prove to be a major selling point for a device that has played second fiddle to the iPhone.Apple on Wednesday unveiled the iPhone XS, a premium model with a 5.8-inch screen, and the iPhone XS Max, with a 6.5-inch screen, its biggest-ever smartphone. The company also showed the iPhone XR, an entry-level model with a 6.1-inch screen.The iPhone XR will come in white, black, red, blue and yellow, and is just as fast as the XS models. It has a single-lens camera, unlike the XS models, which have dual-lens camera systems. And it uses LCD, a less expensive screen technology than the OLED used for the XS, and the casing is made of aluminum, unlike the stainless steel that the premium phones are composed of.It\u2019s obvious why Apple and other phone makers like Samsung keep enlarging their phones: Phones with bigger screens are selling well. When presented with the choice between a small phone and a bigger one, most people will go with the latter. That\u2019s similar to how just about everyone wants a big-screen TV.But for mobile phones, there are trade-offs. For one, the larger phones are more difficult to use with one hand. With last year\u2019s 5.8-inch iPhone X, it was difficult to reach your thumb across the screen to type a keystroke or hit a button inside an app.The larger screens raise an important question about design. Will Apple do much in the near future to improve one-handed use?When Apple\u2019s screen sizes started growing with the iPhone 6 in 2014, the company released a software shortcut, called Reachability, through which users can tap the home button twice to lower the top of the screen and make it easier to reach buttons up there. That feature still exists for the new iPhones, but the lack of a home button makes it more difficult to use \u2014 instead of double tapping the home button, now you swipe down from the bottom of the screen.As Apple has made its phones larger and faster, it is also charging more for them. The company said the new iPhones would start at $750, $1,000 and $1,100. The starting prices last year were $700, $800 and $1,000.Unit sales of the iPhone were about flat in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier, but iPhone revenue rose 20 percent, to $29.9 billion. Something else that rose 20 percent? The average selling price of the iPhone.By going bigger, Apple is trying to grow not just by raising prices but also by getting customers to use their devices even more. Research shows people with larger smartphones use them more, particularly to watch movies and play games.That\u2019s good for Apple. A central part of its strategy is to get existing iPhone owners to pay for more services on their phones, like Netflix and HBO. For each subscription bought via its App Store, Apple takes a 30 percent cut for the first year and 15 percent for each subsequent year. That bet seems to be working: Apple\u2019s services revenue rose 31 percent to $9.55 billion in the latest quarter.The iPhone is old enough now that figuring out what to call the new versions each year has become tricky. Last year, on the device\u2019s 10th anniversary, Apple skipped the iPhone 9 and went straight to the iPhone X. (But it pronounced the model \u201cten\u201d and not \u201cX.\u201d)That X has now created an awkward situation for Apple. The company has typically appended an S to the name of the second iteration of each generation of phones, like the iPhone 5S, 6S and so on.But this year, that meant calling it the iPhone XS. Never mind that XS is the abbreviation for extra small \u2014 not an adjective Apple wants for its $1,000 phones \u2014 but say \u201cXS\u201d out loud. In the age of smartphone addiction and devices that cost as much as some refrigerators, \u201ciPhone Excess\u201d may not be great for branding.Instead, the new iPhone XS is pronounced \u201ciPhone 10S,\u201d or as the audience at the Apple event quickly realized, \u201ciPhone Tennis.\u201dAdd the new iPhone XS Max to the mix and you\u2019ve got \u201ciPhone Tennis Match.\u201dApple introduced the Apple Watch Series 4, which it has designed to be more of a health aid.It\u2019s the first redesign of the company\u2019s smart watch since it was introduced in 2015. The new watch is slightly thinner, but the black frame around the screen \u2014 what is known as the bezel \u2014 has been removed to create a larger display area.Apple said that the new watch would be the first over-the-counter ECG device offered to consumers and that it had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (Apple may want to check its claim of being first, as other companies said they had been ahead of it with the agency in this regard.)The device\u2019s new health features are sure to increase Apple\u2019s dominance of the smart watch category \u2014 and they underscore the company\u2019s focus. When the watch was first released, critics and consumers were confused about its utility. Over time, Apple has refined the device to focus on its health and fitness capabilities. Now the narrative is clear: Get this watch, if you want to live.The Apple Watch will be available in several colors and band styles; watchbands from older models will work on the new model. The Watch starts at $399. It will begin shipping on Sept. 21.\u201cThe F.D.A. worked closely with the company as they developed and tested these software products, which may help millions of users identify health concerns more quickly,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a statement.Apple\u2019s formal entrance into medical devices brings heft to the idea of tracking health with consumer wearables. Until now, they were largely limited to the casual counting of steps or watching heart rates climb at the gym. At Wednesday\u2019s event, Apple featured remarks from Dr. Ivor Benjamin, the president of the American Heart Association, who described the ability of wearable devices to measure heart rhythms as \u201cgame-changing, especially when evaluating atrial fibrillation \u2014 an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase a person\u2019s risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.\u201dEven Vic Gundotra, the chief executive of AliveCor, which sells a wearable device with similar heart-testing capabilities, said Apple\u2019s decision to enter the market would make consumers\u2019 use of electrocardiograms take off.The readings may not always be helpful, and doctors are advised not to use electrocardiograms as a screening tool for someone without symptoms, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.\u201cPeople are going to start looking at their watch as if something is wrong,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the material that aluminum is replacing in the iPhone XR. It is replacing the stainless steel casing, not glass.Advertisement"}
