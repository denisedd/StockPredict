{"Headline": "LendingClub Founder, Ousted in 2016, Settles Fraud Charges", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySan Francisco \u2014 Renaud Laplanche, a leading figure in Silicon Valley\u2019s effort to challenge the financial industry, reached a settlement with federal regulators on Friday over accusations that he had fraudulently inflated his company\u2019s returns.The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mr. Laplanche, the founder and former chief executive of the start-up LendingClub, with improperly changing some of the company\u2019s lending products to make it look more healthy.Mr. Laplanche had been a widely respected figure in both the technology and financial industries. But his board said that he had made several improper decisions.Under the settlement with the S.E.C., Mr. Laplanche neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. But he agreed to be barred from the securities industry for three years and pay a $200,000 fine.Mr. Laplanche, who founded a competitor to LendingClub after his resignation, said that the penalties would not force him to change his role at his new start-up, Upgrade, because the two companies have different structures.\u201cI am pleased to have worked out a settlement with the S.E.C. to put to rest any issues related to compliance lapses that might have occurred under my watch at Lending Club,\u201d Mr. Laplanche said in a statement.The commission also reached a settlement with LendingClub\u2019s former chief financial officer. In addition, the company will pay a $4 million penalty for the problems that occurred under Mr. Laplanche\u2019s leadership.But the S.E.C. said that the company promptly fixed the problems and \u201cprovided extraordinary cooperation with the agency\u2019s investigation.\u201dThe chairman of LendingClub\u2019s board, Hans Morris, said that the S.E.C.\u2019s charges helped validate the board\u2019s decision to remove Mr. Laplanche in 2016.\u201cThe board\u2019s decision was not made lightly but the violation of the company\u2019s business practices along with a lack of full disclosure by Mr. Laplanche during the review was unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Morris said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWe have full confidence in our new management team and we are a better company today.\u201dMr. Laplanche founded LendingClub in 2006 and turned it into one of the most prominent start-ups to take on the banks and other financial giants using new technology. The company gave out personal loans, mostly to people who wanted to refinance credit card debt, and sold the loans to investors.Supporters of the company, and the industry it spawned, said it could replace traditional methods of getting loans. The company drew in luminaries like Larry Summers, the former Treasury Secretary, and John Mack, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, to its board. When LendingClub went public in 2014, it was one of the largest initial public offerings that year by a technology company.After Mr. Laplanche\u2019s departure in 2016, the board said he had not been transparent with them at several different points, including about loans that Mr. Laplanche and his family members had taken out from LendingClub.The charges announced by the S.E.C. do not touch on most of the accusations the company has made against Mr. Laplanche. In the order released Friday, the regulators focused on funds that LendingClub had overseen on behalf of investors and that were used to buy LendingClub loans.According to the S.E.C., a division of LendingClub under Mr. Laplanche\u2019s direction had adjusted how the funds were managed without telling investors, in order to create demand for some of the loans that LendingClub was handing out.LendingClub has struggled to recover from the scandal surrounding Mr. Laplanche\u2019s departure. The company\u2019s shares are worth only slightly more today than the low they hit after his resignation, though they rose modestly on Friday after the settlement was announced.Mr. Laplanche\u2019s new company, on the other hand, has been growing quickly. It recently announced that it had issued over $1 billion of loans and had closed a series C funding round.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jaguar\u2019s Electric E-Type Marries \u201960s Sex Appeal and Tomorrow\u2019s Tech", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsMONTEREY, Calif. \u2014 No less an authority on the subject of breathtaking automobiles than Enzo Ferrari described Jaguar\u2019s E-Type after its debut at the 1961 Geneva Motor Show as the most beautiful car in the world. Almost 60 years later, that assessment still rings true.An incredible tribute to its enduring design and fashion, this observation explains the E-Type\u2019s growing value as an investment and the decision by Jaguar Land Rover to restore and resell them to wealthy collectors through its recently established Classics division. But Jaguar is not content to merely revive E-Types to their former glory \u2014 the company is offering to retrofit them as fully electric machines: the E-Type Zero.It only made sense that Jaguar chose Monterey to showcase one of the most expensive cars it has ever thought of selling: An E-Type fully restored by Jaguar \u2014 including a refurbished gas powertrain \u2014 converted to electric power to earn its Zero designation will cost $375,000 or more.The electric E-Type\u2019s near-silent operation might have gone undetected by passers-by, but its stunning lines continued to reel them in as it slipped along Monterey\u2019s sleepy streets. Acceleration is strong \u2014 aimed to approximate the original gasoline car\u2019s performance, the electric E-Type reaches 60 miles per hour in under seven seconds, although it could undoubtedly be made to do so faster without much technical issue.\u201cThe idea is to keep the car driving and performing as it would have with a gasoline engine,\u201d said Tim Hannig, the director of Jaguar Land Rover Classic. Putting the 40 kWh lithium-ion battery under the hood and the electric motor in the transmission tunnel, he explained, helped the electric Jaguar mimic the original car\u2019s weight distribution.Jaguar will also offer the conversion service to current E-Type owners, so the layout of the battery and motor should ensure the car\u2019s handling dynamics are familiar to those willing to hand over such a cherished possession for retrofitting.And the electric roadster does indeed drive much like any impeccably restored E-Type, with alert steering, strong four-wheel disc brakes and what, in 1961, amounted to a silken ride. But it also feels quick in a different way, with maximum torque available from the moment you touch the accelerator making for instant, linear acceleration. The missing exhaust note will disappoint many enthusiasts, but the curvaceous E-Type \u2014 and the business of driving it quickly \u2014 hardly lose their appeal on account of electric power.There are limits, however. Jaguar said the 220 kW (or 295 horsepower) electric motor could probably match the gas-powered original\u2019s 150 m.p.h. top speed, but the E-Type Zero would top out slower to optimize range and acceleration. The company said it had targeted a range of more than 170 miles on a charge.Without looking under the hood \u2014 or hearing it on the move \u2014 there is little hint the E-Type Zero is an electric conversion. There is the conspicuous omission of the E-Type\u2019s signature tailpipes, a rotary dial on what would have been its transmission tunnel and, on this particular car, a custom dashboard to monitor the proceedings. A conventional dash with all its gauges in place, save a single unit in place of the tachometer to relay the electrical goings-ons, will be an option on retrofitted vehicles.Elana Scherr, former editor of Hot Rod, said she supported any technological changes that encourage an owner to drive more often is a positive. \u201cIf this conversion makes someone who was feeling guilty about the environment, or worried about mechanical breakdown more likely to take an E-Type out into the world and let the rest of us see it, thumbs up for that,\u201d she said.Where many automakers have relied on existing, proprietary electric motors from third-party suppliers, Jaguar Land Rover \u2014 a relatively small company by industry standards \u2014 has developed its own motor for the new I-Pace crossover and future models, which could include a flagship Jaguar XJ sedan and an S.U.V. hinted at by a trademark application for the Road Rover.\u201cWhen carmakers were threatening to produce electric cars at scale, most of us in the enthusiast community thought, \u2018game over,\u2019\u201d said Eddie Alterman, editor in chief of Car and Driver. \u201cBut then Tesla happened, and it made priorities of style and performance.\u201dThe electric E-Type, he said, \u201cis proof that E.V. powertrains can add new chapters to old books.\u201dApart from a way to help separate the wealthy from their money, the electric E-Types that Jaguar will be building and retrofitting \u2014 in Coventry, England, and at a new Jaguar Land Rover Classic operation soon to open in Savannah, Ga., \u2014 can be seen as a clever way to highlight the company\u2019s commitment to new technology while showcasing its own greatest design hit.But with the cost of the conversion expected to be around $75,000 for owners who already possess a pristine E-Type, it will be a while before the roads are filled with machines just like these \u2014 even if collectors will be pleased to know that the conversion is reversible.John Voelcker, former editor of the website Green Car Reports, said the idea of electrifying old cars may have a future. \u201cThey don\u2019t offer exhaust rumble, but they\u2019re far smoother, calmer, and more pleasant to drive in traffic,\u201d he said.A small but growing number of businesses specialize in electric conversions of the sort Jaguar Land Rover Classic will offer. Zelectric Motors of San Diego customizes owners\u2019 old Volkswagens and Porsches with fully electric powertrains.But Ms. Scherr, the former Hot Rod editor, said she worried something would be lost in transformation, particularly when it came to the E-Type.\u201cThere is a beauty to seeing how people engineered things in any given era,\u201d she said. \u201cTo tilt the bonnet up on an unmodified E-Type is to time travel into the head of an engineer in England, in the mid-60s, solving problems with the knowledge and the technology of the day, and that\u2019s really cool.\u201dMs. Scherr said she hoped that many E-Types would remain the gas-powered vehicles they had been intended to be, and likened retrofitting to plastic surgery.\u201cSure, everyone looks young and similar, but there is some nobility to aging and wearing the changes that time wrought,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is something that looks wise about an original car with its original parts. Even if it is actually very foolish.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Chief Elon Musk Is Sued by S.E.C. in Move That Could Oust Him", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, was accused by federal regulators on Thursday of misleading investors with false public statements, a move that could force him out of the company\u2019s leadership.The suit seeks to bar Mr. Musk, who is also Tesla\u2019s chairman, from serving as an executive or director of publicly traded companies like Tesla. Such a punishment is one of the most serious remedies the S.E.C. can impose against a corporate executive.The case is likely to send shock waves across corporate America and could lead to a re-evaluation of how companies use Twitter to communicate with the investing public.The S.E.C. said Mr. Musk \u201cknew or was reckless in not knowing\u201d that his statements were false or misleading. \u201cIn truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,\u201d the S.E.C. said in its lawsuit.In a statement distributed by Tesla, Mr. Musk said: \u201cThis unjustified action by the S.E.C. leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed. I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u201dThe S.E.C. approached the Tesla chief with an offer to settle the case, according to a person familiar with his thinking, but he refused to negotiate, adamant that he had done nothing wrong. A person briefed on the talks said they fell apart Thursday morning, setting the stage for the S.E.C. to vote on the action.Tesla itself was not named as a defendant.A Silicon Valley veteran who joined in founding the company 15 years ago, Mr. Musk is widely regarded by analysts and investors as the creative engine behind Tesla. It has become the most valuable American carmaker, with its stock worth more than $50 billion.The shares tumbled more than 12 percent in after-hours trading after the S.E.C. filed its lawsuit.The S.E.C. issued a round of subpoenas to Tesla and the financial institutions it eventually hired for advice on a potential conversion into a private company. The agency also interviewed a number of Tesla board members, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The complaint said Mr. Musk \u201cknew that he had never discussed a going-private transaction at $420 per share with any potential funding source.\u201dThe S.E.C. said that Mr. Musk had been in a persistent feud with investors who were betting that Tesla shares would fall. The complaint notes that Mr. Musk had discussions in late July with a foreign investment fund that had recently acquired a 5 percent stake in Tesla. In those discussions, Mr. Musk said he was thinking about taking Tesla private, but regulators said nothing formal was agreed on.The lawsuit is the latest in a series of escalating problems for Tesla and Mr. Musk. The company has been struggling to achieve the ambitious production targets that Mr. Musk had publicly outlined. He has made a series of unusual public comments or appearances, including an internet interview in which Mr. Musk appeared to smoke marijuana.The action by the S.E.C. is solely related to events surrounding Mr. Musk\u2019s comments on Twitter. But regulators had been investigating Tesla even before the tweet, and are more broadly examining whether Tesla misled investors about its production goals.Federal prosecutors in California have also sought information from Tesla, an inquiry that appears to be at an early stage.Tesla\u2019s directors issued a statement affirming that they are \u201cfully confident in Elon, his integrity and his leadership of the company.\u201dThe action against Mr. Musk, 47, is one of the most significant by the S.E.C. during the Trump administration, which has been criticized for focusing on smaller cases. The agency seldom tries to bar a figure as prominent as Mr. Musk permanently from the securities industry.When S.E.C. lawyers accused the billionaire Mark Cuban of insider trading in 2008, for example, they did not seek such a ban. Mr. Cuban won the case at trial. When they settled a case against the hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen for failing to supervise his $13 billion hedge fund, SAC Capital, where several portfolio managers were charged with insider trading, the S.E.C.\u2019s lawyers required Mr. Cohen to stop managing investors\u2019 money only for a period of two years.\u201cThis case demonstrates our commitment to holding individuals accountable for violations,\u201d said Steven Peikin, the S.E.C.\u2019s co-director of enforcement. \u201cNeither celebrity status nor reputation as a technological innovator provide exemptions from the securities laws.\u201dThe S.E.C. complaint is quite detailed in describing the events that led to Mr. Musk\u2019s fateful tweet.The filing said that on Aug. 2, five days before he sent the tweet, Mr. Musk sent an email to Tesla\u2019s board, chief financial officer and general counsel with the subject line: \u201cOffer to Take Tesla Private at $420.\u201d Mr. Musk said he wanted to put the matter up to a shareholder vote \u201cat the earliest opportunity,\u201d the complaint added, and wanted to do so partly because of the attacks on the company\u2019s stock from bearish investors known as short-sellers.Mr. Musk, according to the lawsuit, told Tesla\u2019s board that the $420 figure was based on a 20 percent premium to the stock\u2019s Aug. 2 closing price. He then rounded it up to $420 after his girlfriend told him of the number\u2019s significance for marijuana smokers and thought it would be funny.The board on Aug. 3 authorized Mr. Musk to start talking to some investors about the plan to go private and asked him to report back on those conversations, the complaint said. Mr. Musk had a conversation with at least one large investor, it added, but before anything was close to completion, he began posting statements on Twitter about taking the company private on Aug. 7.The S.E.C. said that in the ensuing days, Mr. Musk did nothing to clarify his statements and threw fuel on the fire with additional posts on Twitter.The case against Mr. Musk is noteworthy also for the speed with which the S.E.C. brought it. Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, said the case was \u201cdone in record time,\u201d adding, \u201cUsually there is much more opportunity for the defendant to be heard and make formal submissions.\u201dMichael Liftik, a lawyer with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and a former S.E.C. attorney who helped write the commission\u2019s policy on social media posts, said the investigation was most likely straightforward.\u201cIt was one tweet \u2014 it is one sentence,\u201d Mr. Liftik said. \u201c\u2018Funding secured\u2019 is a definitive declarative sentence and it didn\u2019t leave him any wiggle room.\u201dThe S.E.C. policy, adopted in 2013, permits a corporation to disclose market-moving information on Twitter as long as it has given investors advance notice that it may do so. Tesla had done that and said Mr. Musk\u2019s Twitter account is one place the company might make significant corporate announcements.The episode arose as Mr. Musk had made a priority of smoothing out the assembly of a crucial new product, the Model 3 sedan. In a bid to lift output to 5,000 vehicles a week, he stalked around the plant in Fremont, Calif., joining in to help solve bottlenecks and other problems and sometimes sleeping on the factory floor.Cash has also been a problem for Tesla. Besides spending to ramp up Model 3 production and develop future vehicles, Tesla faces two significant bond payments that could put further stress on its reserves. Most analysts believe Tesla will have to raise additional capital from investors to meet those obligations, but Mr. Musk has said it has no plans to do so.In recent months, as he has juggled Tesla\u2019s production and financing demands, there has been talk about installing a chief operating officer to enable Mr. Musk to take a reduced role in day-to-day operations. But there has been no sign of any active search, and there is no evident internal candidate for such a role.While Model 3 production has accelerated significantly this year, it is unclear how smoothly the process is running. Some owners have complained that cars arrived with crooked panels and other flaws. Hundreds of Model 3s have been parked in lots around California and other states, some needing repairs before they can be delivered.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the body style of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 car. It is a sedan, not a roadster.Neal E. Boudette and David Gelles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the Attack Against Climate Change", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThousands of organizations around the world are trying in big ways and small to confront the challenges of climate change. Here are 10 examples.Coral reefs are beautiful to look at, but they also play a crucial role as coastal barriers when storms or flooding hits, absorbing about 97 percent of wave energy.But because of rising temperatures, coral cover in the Caribbean is estimated to have decreased by about 80 percent in the last few decades, said Joseph Pollock, Caribbean coral strategy director at the Nature Conservancy. He added that in 2016, a marine heat wave was estimated to have killed about a third of the shallow corals on Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef.Coral mating works this way, Dr. Pollock said: Many coral species spawn by putting out bundles of eggs and sperm one night a year.\u201cIt\u2019s like the craziest singles bar ever,\u201d he said.Researchers know when those nights are, so they go out, collect the eggs and sperm and then mix them together to cross-fertilize, grow them for a few days or weeks until they become coral juveniles, then place them back in the sea.The survival rate is about 10 percent, Dr. Pollock said, but that\u2019s much better than the survival rate without the help of the scientists. And compared with other restoration techniques, the cross-fertilization creates greater genetic diversity, and that creates more resilience.The work is focused on the Caribbean now, but Dr. Pollock said the hope is that it can be used throughout the world.\u201cThe aim of the work is to develop tools and techniques that are low cost and don\u2019t require a huge amount of super specialized personnel and infrastructure,\u201d he said.One benefit of the solar microgrids is that they can store solar power \u2014 allowing them to operate if the main power source is disrupted \u2014 which solar panels alone can\u2019t do.So far, 28 microgrids have been installed, serving close to 100,000 people, Mr. Marvel said, and 30 more are almost finished. The cost, covered by donations from companies and individuals, is about $25,000 to $30,000 per solar hub.Almost all of the power on the island is supplied by fossil fuels, but Puerto Rico is \u201can ideal locale to use solar power and renewable energy because it has so many more solar days than in many parts of the world,\u201d said Mr. Marvel, whose offices are based in Manhattan and San Juan. \u201cWe want to keep the candle burning with solar energy, not fossil fuel.\u201dThe role that soil plays in climate change is often ignored, but changing the way it is managed could have a big impact on global warming.Unfortunately, most soil has become less productive, with environmental consequences, said Michael Doane, managing director for agriculture and food systems at the Nature Conservancy. That\u2019s because it has been eroded through too much tilling, lack of adequate ground cover and a failure to diversify crops.\u201cThis living ecosystem has become dead and we\u2019re trying to bring it back to life,\u201d Mr. Doane said.One solution is using plants \u2014 either rotating crops or using ground cover such as grass, depending on what\u2019s needed to repair the soil \u2014 to cover the soil before and after the main cash crop is planted. Diverse plant cover has been found to make the soil healthier and helps control weeds, Mr. Doane said.\u201cWe want to try to avoid soil bare of plant cover,\u201d he added. \u201cInstead, our vision is a continuous living cover.\u201d Calling it \u201cnature\u2019s solution to climate change,\u201d he said the process of photosynthesis \u2014 where plants store the carbon in the soil and release oxygen \u2014 could be \u201ca very cost-effective way to mitigate climate change.\u201dThis won\u2019t work on every farm, because each is different, but \u201cwe know this works for many farmers in many situations \u2014 we have good data on that,\u201d Mr. Doane said.And the process can make farms more productive by creating soil that can better hold water and recycle nutrients, meaning farmers can spend less money on fertilizer.\u201cIf we\u2019re going to solve climate change,\u201d he said, \u201cWe have to find economic solutions for people who don\u2019t know they\u2019re solving climate change.\u201dKeeping cool is becoming more and more difficult as temperatures across the world spike. In addition, air-conditioning uses hydrofluorocarbons, which contribute substantially to global warming.One solution, which numerous cities around the world have embraced, is called cool roofs, which is simply painting dark rooftops with a reflective white paint or wrapping them with a light membrane that reduces the absorption of heat. This not only addresses the \u201curban heat island\u201d effect \u2014 urban areas tend to be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas due to human activities \u2014 but also helps decrease strain on electric grids and alleviate air pollution.DuPont, which has a research center in Hyderabad, owns Tyvek, a synthetic material that is often used in construction and can cover dark roofs. The company donated the material to cover 25 roofs in the city. Both paint and the coverings are considered equally effective, Ms. Jaiswal said.Cool roofs can reduce indoor temperature by three to nine degrees Fahrenheit, she added, for as little as seven cents a square foot or $4 a home.As incomes and temperatures rise, so is demand for air-conditioning, she said. An important aspect of addressing climate change will be both developing more environmentally friendly units and reducing the demand for them.Both Indian cities are now developing a citywide cool-roofs policy mandating them for all municipal buildings and working with business leaders\u2019 corporate responsibility programs to expand them throughout the cities.For relatively little cost, Ms. Jaiswal said, cool roofs are \u201csaving lives, reducing temperatures and responding to climate change.\u201dPlastic Bank, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, started its work in Haiti three years ago; now about 2,000 collectors there can either receive cash, buy goods or services \u2014 such as cooking oil, LED lights or topping off pay-as-you-go cellphones \u2014 at one of the 40 recycling outlets around the country. They also have the ability, through the Plastic Bank\u2019s app developed in partnership with IBM, to transfer the money into an online savings account.The company also trains and supports local people who run the recycling outlets.The Plastic Bank has expanded to Brazil, and Indonesia; this month, it opened its first site in the Philippines and in the first week, Mr. Katz said, collected around 120,000 bottles.Constance Okollet had never heard of climate change, but she knew that her village in Uganda had been devastated by a 2007 flood that affected most of the country. She knew the weather was growing increasingly unpredictable, making the farming of the typical crops such as maize, sorghum and millet ever more difficult and sending a population that had been poor but self-sufficient spiraling into destitution.Once at the meeting, she said: \u201cThey kept talking about climate change and I asked, \u2018What are you people talking about? What do you mean by that?\u2019\u201dShe learned. And she and other members of the network (which now includes some men) have since begun awareness education about climate change \u2014 its impact and how to adapt \u2014 through workshops in churches and wherever people gather.Two years ago, 60 members of the network were also flown to Nairobi, Kenya, to learn how to make and sell charcoal briquettes; deforestation means firewood is scarce and the briquettes in any case are greener. They mix ash, dry leaves and water, which when dried, actually even cook better than wood, she said.\u201cWe also sell the briquettes to make money \u2014 even $1 can help,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can pay your school fees or start a small business, and you don\u2019t have to take a loan from the bank.\u201dPeatlands may not be the first thing people think about when focusing on climate change, but the abandonment of drained peatlands in parts of Russia has created not only widespread land degradation, but also huge quantities of carbon dioxide, through peat oxidation. And carbon dioxide contributes to global warming.\u201cPeatland ecosystems play a crucial role in global climate,\u201d said Dr. Bednar, noting that they store several times more carbon dioxide, the leading greenhouse gas than any other ecosystem. As such, he added, \u201cthe world\u2019s peat bogs represent an important \u2018carbon sink\u2019 \u2014 a place where carbon dioxide is stored below ground and can\u2019t escape into the atmosphere and exacerbate global warming.\u201dDr. Bednar offered one staggering number: Peatlands cover only 3 percent of the global total land area, but emit twice as much carbon dioxide as the world\u2019s forests, which cover more than 30 percent. The peatlands drained by people are prone to fires and the accompanying smoke spreads long distances, creating serious health problems.Available since 2009, but in the process of being updated for release at the end of the year, it is for at all ages and all forms of education, said Frank Niepold, a senior climate education program manager for NOAA and lead author of the guide.\u201cIn the 1990s, less than 1 percent of the national standards for science education was related to climate change. Now about 30 percent is,\u201d he added.Mr. Niepold estimated that over 50 percent of children in kindergarten through 12th grade nationwide are learning from all or some of the climate literacy framework, and \u201cwe\u2019re on our way to 75 percent,\u201d he said.\u201cStudents are aware of climate change and want to know more and want to be part of solving it,\u201d Mr. Niepold said. \u201cAnd they know that requires an understanding of the fundamentals.\u201dWhen Laura Stachel, an obstetrician, took a two-week trip to a remote hospital in Nigeria 10 years ago, she was interested in maternal health, not solar energy. But what she saw there changed her mind and her life.She knew maternal mortality was high: Worldwide, Dr. Stachel said, about 300,000 women and two million newborns die every year from pregnancy and childbirth complications. But she did not realize the extent of what has been called energy poverty.The hospital in northern Nigeria that she visited did not have electricity for 12 hours a day. Daytime cesarean sections were done by ambient light, and once, when it occurred in the middle of the night and the power went out, one was performed by the light of Dr. Stachel\u2019s headlamp.She told the stories to her husband, Hal Aronson, who holds a doctorate in environmental sociology and has focused on solar energy issues for years. He designed and built what is now called a Solar Suitcase: solar equipment that is easy to transport, install and use in areas where power supplies are unreliable.Working in partnership with nonprofits and United Nations agencies, about 3,500 facilities in 27 developing countries around the world have received the Solar Suitcases. It costs $3,000 to support a clinic with a Solar Suitcase for five years, Dr. Stachel said, including all the equipment, transportation and training.The organization also works to train local people to install and maintain solar power.The health impact is clear, but so is the impact on the environment, she said. Diesel fuel generators and kerosene lamps are polluting and generate carbon dioxide. But perhaps even more important, the move toward solar would reduce the reliance on fossil fuel \u2014 something that some major American hospitals are now trying to do.\u201cWe could leapfrog right past that and go right to clean, green electricity,\u201d she said.Supermarkets around the world are major users of hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, which contribute to ozone depletion and global warming \u2014 and in Chile, they are the biggest user. So, it is fitting that a supermarket chain called Jumbo has become the first in the country to adopt new refrigeration technology that is far more climate friendly than traditional methods.So far, Jumbo has installed the systems in three supermarkets in Chile and will convert four more stores in the near future, said Claudia Paratori Cort\u00e9s, coordinator of the Ozone Unit in in the Office of Climate Change in Chile\u2019s Ministry of Environment.Ms. Cort\u00e9s said comparisons between two types of refrigeration \u2014 transcritical C02 and one containing hydrofluorocarbons \u2014 found that the transcritical C02 systems were 20 percent to 40 percent more energy efficient, saving around $20,000 annually.In addition, she said, the residual heat from the transcritical CO2 systems can be used to heat water and therefore save energy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Artists Would Do if They Could Fly to the Moon", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a statement, Mr. Maezawa pondered what might have happened if Picasso or John Lennon had been able to voyage in outer space. \u201cWe all have the ability to dream dreams that have never been dreamed,\u201d he said. \u201cTo sing songs that have never been sung, to paint that which has never been seen before.\u201dThe journey isn\u2019t scheduled until 2023 \u2014 \u201cif everything goes 100 percent right,\u201d Mr. Musk said \u2014 but The Times took the opportunity to ask eight artists to do a little dreaming of their own, and to put in pitches for the project. In our version, the budget is unlimited, and (unlike the real mission) a lunar landing is allowed.The only requirement was that they ignite imaginations. These are edited excerpts from some recent conversations.I like that this project is about art rather than science. So my proposal is to turn the moon itself into an art project: It\u2019s a sphere and I want to turn it into a perfect square. That\u2019s the dream.My son Noam is an astrophysicist at the Leibniz Institute in Germany, and we did some calculations about how it could work. We thought the best way would be to paint sections of it black, so they no longer reflect the sun\u2019s light. To account for the curvature, you\u2019d need to paint four spherical caps on the moon\u2019s surface. That would create a kind of frame that looks square when you see it from earth.I get that it\u2019s probably not the cheapest concept \u2014 our estimate is about $10 trillion for paint costs alone \u2014 but I like the way that it would transform the moon into a work of contemporary art. Think of how amazing it would be to watch the phases shift; the light come across the visible portion, the craters, the Sea of Tranquillity, all framed by this rigid black square. Like a Malevich or Mondrian painting hanging in the sky. Literally a lunatic project.(Mr. Libeskind is an architect whose practice is based in New York.)A change in perspective is the source for any kind of art. Without shifting perspectives, we will never have a complete view of anything \u2014 the political, personal, or social. The intensity of lifelessness on the moon, the impossibility of species existing there, is a mirror. It makes us appreciate even more the precious miracle of life on this planet.So what I can put on the moon is an observation: My insignificance in relation to the universe, and to use that as a point of view for planet earth. Without knowing other celestial bodies, we cannot truly understand what our own planet is about.(Mr. Ai is an artist whose studio is in Berlin.)Gil Scott Heron wrote that famous poem, \u201cWhitey on the Moon\u201d: \u201cThe man just upped my rent last night / Cause whitey\u2019s on the moon / No hot water, no toilets, no lights / But whitey\u2019s on the moon.\u201dI got thinking about a moon colony, which plenty of people have talked about pretty seriously over the years. So what I\u2019d do is this: For every female child born on Earth, one sexist, white supremacist adult male would be shipped to the moon. They could colonize it to their heart\u2019s content, and look down from a distance of a quarter-million miles. It\u2019s a monochrome world up there; probably they\u2019d love it. The colony would be hermetically sealed. And the rest of us could enjoy the sight of them from a safe distance. Maybe there could be some kind of selection ritual involved, something to do with menstruation and the tides \u2014 a touch of nature, to add a bit of irony justice to the endeavor.For the supremacists, maybe traveling so far from home would help inspire a different worldview. And for the rest of us down on Earth, perhaps this is an opportunity to focus on the nature of our home planet with the same dreamy reverence we once reserved for the moon.(Ms. Walker is an artist based in New York.)The first thing to say is that I\u2019d be first in line. A while back, I was artist in residence at NASA: I think it\u2019s kind of amazing for Yusaku Maezawa to make that offer.Their plan is just to circle around the moon rather than land, so I think I\u2019d find it hard to make any work up there: There\u2019d so much going on out of the window that you couldn\u2019t think about missing one second. The moment where you come around and see the earth rise \u2014 so many people have imagined what it\u2019d be like actually to see that. You\u2019d go out of your mind with happiness.I played at the celebrations at the Kennedy Center for John F. Kennedy\u2019s 100th anniversary last year, and I\u2019ve thought a lot about his writings on the space program. He said the most beautiful things: \u201cI look forward to an America that is not afraid of grace and beauty.\u201d I keep that in my heart. It\u2019s so antithetical to what\u2019s going on now.(Ms. Anderson is a musician and artist based in New York.)I\u2019m not opposed to the idea of space exploration; it\u2019s interesting, especially deep-space observation. But the whole idea of corporate space travel seems pretty strange to me: I think it\u2019s a kind of bailout plan for oligarchs, in case earth becomes unlivable. The ultimate gated community.So my idea would be to take the other seven artists and convince them not to blast off to the moon at all, but to create a space habitat right here on Earth. There are so many places that currently aren\u2019t livable: conflict zones, areas that suffer from great poverty and environmental devastation. Other places are barely livable; people need to work three jobs in order to survive. Public space is almost extinct in many areas of the world. We\u2019d create an environment rich in oxygen, have plants grow, and the other artists and I could work and create. This is about recycling dysfunctional civilizations as livable habitats.Yusaku Maezawa asks what Picasso could have been able to make if he had seen the moon up close. So maybe they should create a clone of Picasso; he could go off and explore, leaving the rest of us down here to get on with creating space.(Ms. Steyerl is an artist and writer based in Berlin.)Photography has already captured so much of outer space that as a painter it would be very difficult to add to that. The stark contrast between horizon and space makes me think that you\u2019d need hard-edge abstraction to capture it \u2014 strong contrast between light and dark, very little color.One thing I\u2019d try and figure out would be the profound ambivalence any human would feel finding themselves in a place where they\u2019re not able to survive. The only way I could grasp the absurdity of having thought that I wanted to be there in the first place is to resort to humor. I think my first creative act after landing on the moon would be to unzip my spacesuit and pee into gravity-less space, in a futile effort to mark my territory.(Mr. Fischl is a painter and sculptor based in Sag Harbor, N.Y.)A few years ago, I did a project with the European Space Agency where they invited artists to go up in what they call the \u201cvomit comet\u201d \u2014 a plane that flies parabolic maneuvers high in the atmosphere, to create the sensation of weightlessness. They use it for training astronauts; you get about 30 seconds of zero gravity at a time. I took a series of self portraits in zero gravity: Me floating in space. So maybe I would be qualified for a moon mission. I\u2019ve already done some of the training.To me, the most interesting thing about the moon is the dark side: The side we never see from Earth. The first astronauts were nervous when they went around the moon, because you lose radio contact until you reappear around the other side. So I\u2019d want to photograph that, and keep photographing as we came around and as the Earth rose again. From the Earth you can\u2019t change the angle you look at the moon \u2014 we\u2019re stuck with the same angle and depend on the light of the sun \u2014 whereas in a spacecraft you can maneuver freely. I\u2019d want to use that, and photograph from every angle I could.(Mr. Ruff is a photographer based in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany.)I\u2019ve filmed three solar eclipses over the years, so the moon has always been a principal player in my work. I collect stones, so if I got to land on the moon rather than just orbit it, the surface would immediately excite me: the moon rock itself; all those meteorites, billions of years old.I\u2019d want to make a film about the experience simply of being on the moon, concentrating on the detail of it, exactly what it was like. I wouldn\u2019t try to pre-imagine the experience; I\u2019d just observe. Absorb as much as I can.Honestly, though, I\u2019d be most excited by the relative weightlessness of the moon. I limp because of arthritis, so the fact that there\u2019s one-sixth gravity up there would be hugely liberating. I\u2019m known for my static camera positions, but on the moon I could be mobile, and able to carry my camera. That alone would be amazing.(Ms. Dean is an artist and filmmaker based in Los Angeles.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk Had a Deal From the S.E.C. It Fell Apart in a Morning.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Thursday began, Elon Musk had a deal on the table.After days of tense negotiations, the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawyers for Mr. Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, had agreed on a settlement that would bring to a close a drama that has riveted Wall Street and Silicon Valley for the past two months.Under the terms of the agreement, what started on Aug. 7 \u2014 when Mr. Musk posted on Twitter that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private for $420 a share \u2014 would end with some modest penalties and Mr. Musk staying on as chief executive, according to two people briefed on the talks.The plan, as it was negotiated by lawyers, was for Mr. Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla within 45 days and not resume that post for two years. The company, also a party to the proposed agreement, would add two new directors to its board. Mr. Musk and the company would pay tens of millions of dollars in fines, according to the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The negotiators planned to announce the agreement on Thursday after the markets closed.The settlement with the S.E.C. was a \u201cneither admit nor deny\u201d deal, meaning that Mr. Musk would not have acknowledged knowingly committing a violation. Mr. Musk, however, would not have been allowed to publicly state that he had done nothing wrong \u2014 and that was something he couldn\u2019t accept, according to three people familiar with the talks.So on Thursday morning, as settlement papers were being drawn up and news releases were being drafted, Mr. Musk walked away. Lawyers, Tesla executives and advisers to the company were stunned that he would turn away from such a favorable settlement.\u201cThe company\u2019s brand and stock will suffer if he leaves,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, an auto analyst at Gartner. \u201cBut I hate to say it, they might be better off.\u201dOn Friday, the S.E.C. set a date of Feb. 1 for a preliminary hearing on the case, leaving plenty of time for Mr. Musk to change his mind and agree to a settlement, albeit a potentially less favorable one. But the lawsuit, which could take years to come to trial, will cast a cloud over the company as long as the matter remains unresolved.In recent weeks, the S.E.C. was preparing to send Tesla a Wells Notice, signaling that it intended to bring civil charges against the company and Mr. Musk. But by Thursday, after the settlement talks fell apart, the S.E.C. narrowed its focus. Instead of looking to settle with the company and Mr. Musk, it sued Mr. Musk alone, according to a person close the company.After the commission began to investigate Mr. Musk\u2019s assertion on Twitter, his lawyers sent two lengthy letters to regulators making their case that he had done nothing wrong, according to that person.The letters outlined meetings that Mr. Musk had had with officials from a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, which had led him to believe he had financial support to take Tesla private, the person said.On an evening in March 2017, for example, Mr. Musk and Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer dined at the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., with Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, and Yasir Al Rumayyan, the managing director of the Saudi Public Investment Fund. During the meal, the letters said, Mr. Rumayyan raised the idea of taking Tesla private and increasing the Saudi fund\u2019s stake in it.More than a year later, the lawyers said, Mr. Musk and Mr. Rumayyan met at the Tesla factory on July 31. When Mr. Rumayyan spoke again of taking the company private, Mr. Musk asked him whether anyone else at the fund needed to approve of such a significant deal. Mr. Rumayyan said no, according to the person familiar with the letters.Representatives for Mr. Ellison and the Saudi investment fund did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday evening. People familiar with the workings of the Saudi fund previously said it had taken none of the steps that such an ambitious transaction would entail, like preparing a term sheet or hiring a financial adviser to work on the deal.Mr. Musk and other Tesla executives told Tesla\u2019s board about the talks with the Saudis, the lawyers wrote, according to the person familiar with the letters. On Aug. 3, Mr. Musk shared his idea for the $420 share price with the board.It was an Aug. 7 Financial Times story that spurred Mr. Musk to action, the lawyers said in the letters to the commission. An alarm bell went off when he saw the newspaper\u2019s report that the Saudis had built up a significant stake in Tesla. He feared that word would get out that a deal to take Tesla private was possible. So he began to tweet, the lawyers said.His tweets, the lawyers wrote, were sent in good faith. He believed that the Saudis were capable of doing a deal and interested in doing one, and that what remained was a matter of details, according to the person familiar with the letters.One sticking point for Mr. Musk in the tentative S.E.C. settlement was the particular statute which he was said to have violated.That statute contains language about misleading investors. Mr. Musk\u2019s lawyers wanted the commission to change its claim to say he was merely negligent in his statement, according to a person familiar with the details of the negotiations.Mr. Musk was concerned about what those terms might mean for his other businesses, SpaceX and the Boring Company. He was worried the agreement could jeopardize those companies\u2019 ability to continue working for the government, the person said.In a statement after the commission filed its suit on Thursday, Mr. Musk called the agency\u2019s enforcement effort \u201cunjustified.\u201d\u201cI have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors,\u201d he said. \u201cIntegrity is the most important value in my life, and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s decision to back away from the settlement could complicate Tesla\u2019s future. He has said the company will be consistently profitable by the end of this year, propelled by sales of its newest car, the midsize Model 3 sedan. But Tesla has struggled to meet its production targets for the Model 3, and has continued to burn through cash while two bond payments totaling more than a billion dollars will come due in the next six months.Tesla had $2.2 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, but has been using up nearly a $1 billion every three months. It also has about $11 billion in debt, and owed its suppliers $3 billion as of June 30.Mr. Musk has said Tesla won\u2019t seek additional capital. But Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, said he believed Tesla will have do so in the first half of 2019.Mr. Musk\u2019s legal troubles will only make it more difficult for the company to issue bonds or secure other financing.\u201cThe best case is they can get access to capital but it\u2019s more expensive than they would like,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cThe worst case is they won\u2019t be able to raise capital.\u201dAnother uncertainty for investors is who will ultimately be at the helm of Tesla. Mr. Musk is Tesla\u2019s visionary, much like Steve Jobs was at Apple, Mr. Nelson said, and belief in him is one of the reasons investors have bet on Tesla shares.\u201cHe\u2019s critical, in our opinion,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.Neal E. Boudette contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Are Pushing for Less Disclosure. Is That Good for Investors?", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchLouis Brandeis, before his nomination to the Supreme Court, observed that \u201csunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\u201dThe federal securities laws were built around this concept, that more information to investors is the best protection.Ten years after Lehman Brothers\u2019 bankruptcy, corporations are pushing to restrict how much, and how frequently, they must provide information. With a strong economy, low unemployment and the stock market near record highs, executives are striking back at rules they believe hamper their ability to make profits \u2014 even as they make more than ever. The common complaint is that disclosure requirements force companies to focus on the short term at the expense of making investments that may pay off years later.The tweet raises a number of questions. Is less disclosure better for corporate America? If so, are six months the right interval? Could information be released annually, or perhaps just left to the best judgment of corporate managers about what should be disclosed? That is how most private companies, like Uber and Airbnb, are allowed to operate, because they have chosen not to tap the public markets for capital.Jay Clayton, the S.E.C.\u2019s chairman, has asserted that protecting the \u201cMain Street investor\u201d is a key mission for the agency. But the recent thrust of the S.E.C. appears to be moving away from disclosure and toward allowing companies to put out less information to the investing public.In a recent meeting about entrepreneurship, Mr. Clayton said he wanted to make it easier for retail investors to buy shares in private companies, noting that these can be \u201cpretty risky\u201d but that \u201cpeople want that.\u201d Private companies have minimal disclosure obligations, which was one reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, floated the idea of taking his intensely scrutinized company private.Lawsuits against management and directors for failing to fulfill their fiduciary duties, or against a company for making faulty or incomplete disclosures, are the best way for shareholders to police companies. These lawsuits are the bane of corporate management.Does that mean the idea is dead, or is the S.E.C. just waiting for the right company to request dispensation to limit shareholder access to the courts for challenging management? Once the S.E.C. permits arbitration of claims, companies can be expected to jump on board quickly.What is the best protection for shareholders? The S.E.C. does not review whether an investment is a good one, only whether enough information is available to judge the potential risks and rewards.

I have a feeling that\u2019s going to happen with us. In different ways, that\u2019s going to happen with us.\u201dWell, we can all rally around the \u201cdifferent ways.\u201dNononono. If we start going back over all the things we knew before Donald Trump was elected president, we will all fall into a deep depression. Pick yourself up. It\u2019s almost autumn, and remember, Donald Trump is having a worse week than you are.About the anonymous official\u2019s Op-Ed: Trump has of course been trying to prove it\u2019s all terribly wrong. For instance, the author had bemoaned the fact that \u201cin public and in private,\u201d the president \u201cshows a preference for autocrats and dictators\u201d like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un.Trump responded with a tweet. What do you think he said?A) \u201cNobody loves democracy more than Donald!\u201d B) \u201cKim Jong Un of North Korea proclaims \u2018unwavering faith in President Trump.\u2019 Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!\u201dYeah, yeah. You show you\u2019re not cuddling up to dictators by thanking a dictator for his support. But then we moved on to Stage 2, when he went off to Montana to prove that he hasn\u2019t \u201clost it.\u201d And gave that Lincolnesque speech. \u201cOur ancestors built the railroads, linked the highways,\u201d Trump somberly told his audience. \u201cAnd they proudly planted an American flag on the face of the moon, which is not shown in that movie.\u201dHmmm. Willing to let pass the idea that it was our ancestors who went to the moon. But where did the movie come from? Trump had lurched into a mini-tangent about the fact that \u201cFirst Man,\u201d a soon-to-be-released film about the astronaut Neil Armstrong, does not include a scene showing the flag being put on the moon. You\u2019ll recall that the unnamed official of Op-Ed fame complained that meetings with the president constantly \u201cveer off topic and off the rails.\u201d Just listening to the Montana speech, you could hear it happening. The man cannot keep one thought in his mind for more than two seconds. Try to imagine Abraham Lincoln telling the folks at Gettysburg \u201cthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and \u2026 you know they really need to install a telegraph system in the White House.\u201dTrump was supposed to be in Montana to stump for the Republican running against Senator Jon Tester, who earned the special enmity of the president when he opposed the nomination of Dr. Ronny Jackson to become head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. \u201cOne of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever seen is when Jon Tester and what he did to a great, great man \u2026\u201d our president told the crowd. Jackson, he added somberly, was \u201cactually the doctor that gave me my physical. And he said that I\u2019m in great shape.\u201dThe president was certainly bitter, complaining about the \u201clies\u201d that had been told about Jackson until suddenly, out of nowhere, he demanded: \u201cDo we love Sean Hannity by the way? Right?\u201dAnd then a complaint about how Hannity allowed \u201call these losers\u201d on Fox who say \u201cDonald Trump, he\u2019s lost it up here.\u201d Who do you think is worse, Elon Musk or Donald Trump?

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Trump\u2019s Trade War Finally Hits Consumers", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA refresher on why this is happening: The tariffs aim to pressure China into changing longstanding trade practices that Mr. Trump says hurt the U.S. The administration says China could win relief by giving U.S. companies more access to its markets, among other things.What is clear is that U.S. consumers will start to bear the cost of American protectionism.In approving the deal, the Justice Department decided that combining an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager wouldn\u2019t reduce competition. It appears to be another sign that vertical mergers, where two companies in different industries combine, are acceptable to the Trump administration. (Its effort to block AT&T from buying Time Warner increasingly looks like a political anomaly.)The move augurs well for CVS\u2019s bid to acquire the insurer Aetna \u2014 and for many more potential tie-ups. With Amazon looming over the sector, other companies may be tempted to take the merger plunge.Coke would be a different player. The company is openly pushing into new markets to offset slowing soda sales. (See: its $5.1 billion deal for Costa.) The company says it\u2019s watching the growth in cannabis-infused drinks for now, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine buzz-inducing Coke products hitting store shelves.In a note to clients, the analyst, Mark May, said that breaking up the company could yield two successful businesses: a retail company with an enterprise value of $400 billion and a cloud-computing business worth $600 billion. It would also help Amazon avoid antitrust scrutiny at a time when President Trump appears to be focused on the company.So far, investors appear uneasy with the idea. Amazon shares fell 3 percent after the report was published.The sting isn\u2019t necessarily that Lucid secured funding from the Saudis when Elon Musk couldn\u2019t (though that has to hurt a little). It\u2019s that Tesla, already grappling with competition from traditional carmakers like General Motors and Daimler, must now contend with a well-funded upstart that wants to grab the luxury end of market.Tesla investors can only hope that Mr. Musk, who has seemed distracted lately, can focus on beating the competition.The timing of the trip is uncertain: Elon Musk, SpaceX\u2019s C.E.O., said that the so-called B.F.R. spacecraft would not be ready until 2023 at the earliest.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Maezawa would talk about the cost. But Mr. Musk did say that developing the rocket would cost $2 billion to $10 billion, and that Mr. Maezawa\u2019s ticket was a significant investment in the project.First: \u201cSo you are a charity?\u201d This view suggests that women need help from altruistic donors to get their businesses going. Second: \u201cAh! You are a social impact fund!\u201d This response insinuates that women cannot possibly make you rich, so there needs to be a social mission attached to give an investor something virtuous to talk about at dinner parties. Third: \u201cGreat, but why would you limit yourself?\u201d This may seem like a fair comment, but if you asked me about my deal flow I would tell you that I reviewed more than 100 opportunities in six months and was blown away by the quality of applications.In fact, she writes, she wants to make money, and the firm\u2019s approach allows her to identify opportunities that \u201care largely overlooked \u2014 and therefore attractive.\u201dDealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "The Metamorphosis of Silicon Valley C.E.O.s: From Big to Boring", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the Art\u201cI don\u2019t know what a Twitter C.E.O. should look like,\u201d Mr. Barton said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look like what a C.E.O. of Twitter should look like.\u201dThe congressman had a point. Mr. Dorsey \u2014 who sported a nose ring, a popped-collar shirt and a craggy Moses beard \u2014 looked more like a hipster version of a Civil War officer than a tech icon. Yet more striking than his look was his manner before skeptical lawmakers.Faced with tough questions, Mr. Dorsey did not mount an aggressive defense of his company and his technology, as an earlier generation of tech leader might have. Instead, he demurred, conceded mistakes and generally engaged in a nuanced and seemingly heartfelt colloquy on the difficulties of managing tech in a complex world. Even in response to Mr. Barton\u2019s comment about his look, Mr. Dorsey was solicitous. \u201cMy mom agrees with you,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony prompted questions about what we expect from tech leaders today \u2014 and how thoroughly what we expect has been upturned in the last few years. Since the 1980s, a common leadership archetype has loomed over the tech business: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Sometimes unconsciously and often deliberately, a generation of tech leaders attempted to ape the Apple and Microsoft founders\u2019 charisma, their quirks, their style and above all their irrepressible, hard-charging confidence, to say nothing of arrogance.That is, Mr. Dorsey sounded less like a quotable visionary who can see beyond the horizon and more like what he actually is and ought to be \u2014 a thoughtful, accessible, transparent and, despite the beard and nose ring, kind of boring manager of a serious company whose decisions have world-changing consequences.When it comes to tech C.E.O.s, boring is the new black. Under the glare of global scrutiny, the daring, win-at-all-costs ethos that defined so much of the tech industry in the last couple of decades has been undergoing a thorough metamorphosis.Google once played up the nerdy antics of its founders, but now the company\u2019s leaders are almost unidentifiable ciphers. Larry Page, who runs Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has become a recluse, and even Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s achingly pleasant chief, declined to appear at last week\u2019s hearings.Oh, and I almost forgot about Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O. In my defense, everyone forgets about Mr. Nadella.\u201cA start-up that has five million people using it \u2014 that\u2019s small for Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s a tremendous number of people, and so even they have a large amount of responsibility in the world,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.The tech press has also gotten tougher. Once, novelty alone would merit coverage, but in the social media age, even the tiniest misstep can be ruinous. It has become crucial to get a leader who doesn\u2019t speak out of turn.Mr. Musk\u2019s odd behavior underlines the tensions at play as understated style takes over tech. There is a reason that a big, Jobsian personality was once so prized. Tech companies are leaps of faith. In their early days they exist on the knife edge of oblivion, and it is often only through a founder\u2019s force of personality that investors, employees and the media take any notice. The most beloved founders possess an uncanny genius for selling the world on ideas that look useless, pointless or impossible before we all realize we can never live without them.Though he has made good on only some of those points \u2014 Tesla is now struggling to fulfill orders for the Model 3, the \u201ceven more affordable\u201d car in the plan \u2014 posting the plan was part of an impish ploy to generate publicity for what looked like an outlandish idea. That ploy worked; ever since, Mr. Musk has leveraged his growing celebrity as if it were a currency.Every few months, he makes new promises about this or that amazing thing coming soon. Each time, he reaps more attention and financing and, eventually, builds real cars that are sold to real people. In this way, Mr. Musk\u2019s personality became a key element of not just his companies\u2019 brands, but their business models.But it\u2019s a tricky, high-stakes gamble. For one thing, Mr. Musk has to deliver on his promises. More recently, another problem has eaten at this strategy: The future has been getting less obviously wonderful, so it\u2019s hard to take any tech chief\u2019s assurances that their new thing will indeed be as great for the world as they say.\u201cI tried to convince people to slow down A.I.,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cThis was futile. I tried for many years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.\u201dThus, the tension: On one hand, Mr. Musk wants us to believe that everything he\u2019s building is going to turn out wonderfully. On the other, he\u2019s telling us to be very scared. This sounds like a contradiction, but in its admission of doubt and complexity, it\u2019s actually a pretty good picture of the future.No wonder he sounds crazy. No wonder everyone else is going for boring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Limiting Ammunition to Thwart Gun Violence", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.Over the years, each mass shooting in America renews a stalled debate about gun control. But in those conversations, far less attention is paid to ammunition. Without bullets, however, a gun is a useless piece of metal. And so a growing number of gun control advocates are arguing that tightening rules on the sale or purchase of ammunition is potentially a useful way to lessen gun violence.California already enforces some of the most restrictive gun laws in the country, and it is now leading the drive for more limits on ammunition. Gun control advocates in the state have pushed to limit internet sales, ban large-capacity magazines, require sellers to have licenses, raise taxes on bullets, and mandate serial numbers or other traceable markings so the police can more easily track them.The idea of regulating guns by tightening controls on bullets is not new and has been floated over the years by a diverse mix of public figures, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and the comedian Chris Rock. But gun rights advocates, who see such regulation as an end-run around the Second Amendment, say these measures are expensive, ineffective and put an undue burden on lawful gun users, including hunters, range regulars and sport shooters.Over the next several months, we will explore the regulation and commerce of ammunition, with a mix of stories focused on topics like how law enforcement uses shell casings to solve crimes, why millions of Americans make or reload their ammunition at home, and how hunters, concerned about poisoning scavengers, are leading the effort to shift toward non-lead bullets. We began this week with a look at California and its position on guns and ammunition, and how the state has emerged as the battleground for this conversation and debate.Read more here about how ammunition is easier to buy than cold medicine in many states.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)More than 16,000 plants line Salesforce Park, which features geometric metal beams and lattices, a winding pedestrian path and motion-activated fountains that turn on when buses pass through the Transbay Transit Center underneath.Perched 70 feet above street level, the rooftop space was conceived as a green respite in downtown San Francisco, according to a placard along the walkway.\u201cThe High Line is wonderful, but was not a precedent because it was being designed at the same time and does something different for its urban area,\u201d Mr. Clarke said.

It called for constitutional changes and an overhaul of the military and named army officials who should stand trial._____\u2022 The fog of war?Kremlin officials said that Syrian forces accidentally shot down a Russian military plane, like the one pictured above, in the worst case of friendly fire for Russia in the Syria war.But the risk of escalation was tamped down when President Vladimir Putin laid the blame not just on Israel, but on \u201ca chain of tragic accidental circumstances.\u201d_____Mr. Maezawa, founder of the Japanese online clothing company Zozo and a former rock drummer, pictured above with Mr. Musk, plans to take up to eight artists with him._____Tips for a more fulfilling life.\u201cWe believe that a very large number of women do not desire to vote.

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Trump\u2019s Potentially Permanent Trade War", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cMy view is that Trump has accelerated and amplified latent anti-trade and anti-globalization populist forces. And I think this represents a systemic break with the past 75 years. Trump\u2019s successor is unlikely to go back to the postwar model of American leadership of the world economic system along liberal free trade and investment lines.\u201dMore from Andrew:In the age of Trump, the extracurricular activities of public company executives \u2014 and the benefits and risks the activities may pose for the companies that made the executives wealthy \u2014 have created new corporate governance questions.\u201cA press organ creates a problem for your primary enterprise that I think a board should have some concern over,\u201d said Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Mr. Benioff told Andrew that he informed the board when he began thinking about buying Time, and emphasized that the magazine would be separate from Salesforce. But Mr. Bezos said the same thing about the Post.It isn\u2019t clear whether the inquiry is of a criminal or civil nature. But the request for documents is likely to center on Tesla\u2019s accounting practices, the adequacy and accuracy of its public disclosures, and whether executives sought to mislead investors. The company says that it is cooperating.Tesla shares were down about 3 percent yesterday.The job seekers, in collaboration with the Communications Workers of America and the American Civil Liberties Union, filed charges with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday against Facebook and nine employers. The employers appear to have used Facebook\u2019s targeting technology to exclude women from the users who received their advertisements, which highlighted openings for jobs like truck driver and window installer.Through the first six months of 2018, capital spending increased to $341 billion, up 19 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to Goldman Sachs. But companies were spending even more to repurchase shares. Buybacks jumped 48 percent, to $384 billion in the first six months of the year; for the first time in 10 years, buybacks are accounting for the largest share of cash spending by companies in the S. & P. 500.Female employees at start-ups appear to own just 47 cents of equity in their companies for every dollar owned by a male employee, according to a new study. The discrepancy is even more stark for female founders: They own 39 cents for every dollar owned by a male founder.Carried out by the equity advisory firm Carta, the survey is based on data from 6,000 U.S. companies across a range of industries.After the financial crisis, private equity giants like Blackstone and K.K.R. began to de-emphasize the kind of leveraged buyouts that created their empires in favor of a different kind of service: lending money.Many analysts think that this poses fewer risks to the financial system than the banks that nearly cratered the economy a decade ago. But there is a danger that private equity lending is getting too risky. As Howard Marks of Oaktree, a big investment firm, warns: \u201cWe don\u2019t see the flaws until the things are tested.\u201d And when interest rates rise, cracks may start to appear.DealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Get in Bed With Skynet", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobot furniture is happening. This is the single greatest thing to happen to humanity ever, the robots told us to say.Yes. The answer, of course, is robots.Inside a model studio apartment at the Eugene, an 844-unit building on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, sits a blocky, Swiss Army-knife-like unit that looks a little like two-sided armoire with lots of compartments. It\u2019s called Ori. Ori runs on a track and can be activated by voice command (\u201cAlexa, have Ori make my bed!\u201d) or by the touch of a square black button or a smartphone app. The furniture glides in and out of the living space. In a marketing video, jaunty indie pop plays in the background as a desk retracts into the Ori to create enough space for a woman to unfurl a yoga mat. Later, a man lies on a couch as a table with a glass of white wine moves to his meet his hand. Earlier this summer, he gave me a tour of his engineering lab in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. Drawing on a white board with a purple marker, he showed me what he hopes the future of home floor plans will look like, with a two-sided map of both the floor and the ceiling. In his version, most of the furniture was laid out on the ceiling side. \u201cThe floor is now free,\u201d he said. (Bumblebee\u2019s promotional videos also highlight the clear-floor-space potential for home yoga.)He and his engineers had set up a model room, a cube-like space with green screen walls. A queen-size Tuft & Needle mattress was suspended from the ceiling by four white seatbelt-like hoists. Mr. Murthy pulled out an iPad and showed me how to move it up and down. The bed moved fairly slowly, lights blinking around it as it rose and dropped. The white storage boxes dropped down more rapidly. The whole thing had the feel of a futuristic garage, with tracks, sleek white hoists and sensors that would pause the system if anyone ran underneath.After running the bed up and down a couple times, I asked if I could test out the optional inventory feature, which uses tiny cameras pointed downward into the storage boxes. (Having so many cameras right next to one\u2019s bed might make any reasonably skeptical person wary; Mr. Murthy insisted that they couldn\u2019t capture sound or anything outside their field of view.) The only items I had with me were a phone, reporter\u2019s notebook and a pen, so I dropped the notebook into the box. A few seconds later, on Mr. Murthy\u2019s iPad, it registered as pad of lined paper. Of course, people have long been looking for ways to save space and money on furniture. Nearly 120 years ago, William Murphy, a San Francisco man living in a one-room apartment, patented the Murphy bed, which remains a small-space staple today. It\u2019s basically a bed on a hinge that you can fold into a wall cabinet \u2014 and the setup for countless silent-film physical comedy bits.Founded in the 1940s, Ikea soon made trendy, modern furniture cheap, by flat packing it and telling customers to put it together it themselves. The Swedish company made major U.S. inroads starting in the 90s, when its hallmark pictorial directions and tiny assembly tools were the setup for countless couple and roommate arguments.More recently, it\u2019s possible to get a nice, relatively inexpensive mattress rolled up, boxed and shipped to you in two to five business days after ordering it online, thanks to companies like Casper and Tuft & Needle. Appliances like ovens and refrigerators now come with Wi-Fi-enabled options that allow you to start roasting a turkey while you\u2019re still at the office or, if you\u2019re so inclined, check Facebook from your fridge door.But household furniture is one of the few categories that has yet to be meaningfully upended by technology. Many people live with the same basic forms of chairs, tables or beds that our parents and grandparents did. If modern life means we can summon a car or a meal via smartphone at any time of day, shouldn\u2019t we be able to rearrange our homes in kind of the same way?Hasier Larrea, the founder and C.E.O. of Ori, said he wondered what would happen \u201cif you could bring the power of robotics into interior spaces,\u201d and move furniture around a room \u201clike apps on an iPhone.\u201d Along with his co-founders at M.I.T. and designer Yves Behar, Mr. Larrea came up with Ori, short for Origami. He said the company will soon launch movable walls that can open and close off rooms, as well as furniture that will deploy from the ceiling.\u201cOn the one hand you have mass urbanization and the challenges that brings, to affordability of housing,\u201d said Mr. Larrea. \u201cAnd then on the other hand, you have all these trends toward the internet of the things. These two trends are going to converge.\u201dChris Gerrick, a Seattle-based architect with Olson Kundig, said he\u2019s been talking to a few clients about how to design homes that keep the possibility of robotic furniture in mind. \u201cI think spatially, it\u2019s a really interesting idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBack in the day it was mechanical tech driving the technology, like with Murphy beds. Now it\u2019s digital.\u201dMr. Murthy\u2019s Bumblebee is one of the systems Mr. Gerrick has been working with. \u201cHousing is at such a premium and yet everyone is doing it the same,\u201d said Mr. Murthy.Neither Bumblebee nor Ori\u2019s robotic furnishings are available to consumers directly, though developers and landlords can buy them and renters in certain cities can try them out. Bumblebee Spaces have been set up in a handful of apartment buildings in Seattle and San Francisco, including a new Starcity co-living space in San Francisco\u2019s South Beach neighborhood. (Typically, renters will pay a monthly premium that\u2019s slightly more than what they\u2019d pay for a non robotically-furnished apartment.)\u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me we\u2019re stuck in a centuries-old model for building a major consumer product,\u201d said Jon Dishotsky, the C.E.O. of Starcity. Founded in 2016, the company operates co-living spaces in Los Angeles and San Francisco targeted at young professionals who rent bedrooms, grown-up dorm-style, with weekly house dinners and other group events. \u201cWe\u2019d love to see if this can really scale to hundreds of thousands of units.\u201dOf course, there\u2019s probably a reason we haven\u2019t yet let robots take over our home furnishings. What if there\u2019s a power outage? Do you have to sleep on your yoga mat? Mr. Larrea said Ori furniture is light enough to move manually if necessary. Mr. Murthy said Bumblebee recommends a backup power generator or offers an optional upgrade with enough built-in power to run the system a handful of times in the case of an outage.Bumblebee\u2019s premise that much of your daily life will unfold beneath at least 260 pounds of furniture suspended overhead also prompts some questions about its safety. Mr. Murthy said he\u2019s spent years testing the product, first in his own home and then in the lab, and that it is designed with numerous safety sensors. The units comply with existing building codes that allow for overhead plumbing, lighting fixtures and electrical wiring, according to Mr. Murthy. (Bumblebee won\u2019t work in every building \u2014 ceilings need to be at least eight feet high, ideally nine or ten.)Even the most gung-ho developers say they are approaching robotic furniture with caution. Ms. Masi said Brookfield is retrofitting existing units to work with Ori, testing it in various layouts. But they might start building with it in mind in the near future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of curiosity like, \u2018wow, this would be a game changer,\u2019\u201d she said.Andrew Freedman recently moved to San Francisco for a job as a government consultant on implementing legalized marijuana. He\u2019s paying $2,600 a month to live in Starcity\u2019s Bumblebee apartment, a spacious white bedroom in a renovated Victorian with high ceilings, a bay window and a bed that deploys from the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to explain it to people and it takes awhile, so I show them the YouTube video,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have tons of questions.\u201d Advertisement"}

That legal battle was also settled Sunday night, and the company added six new directors, including three women.Not much will change for CBS in the short term, with Mr. Moonves\u2019s top lieutenant, Joseph Ianniello, taking over as interim C.E.O.His departure comes at a tough time for Alibaba and its peers. Beijing is tightening control of tech companies, which has squeezed a top rival, Tencent. And the Chinese economy is slowing, wounding competitors like JD.com.Volvo\u2019s C.E.O., Hakan Samuelsson, told the FT that \u201cconditions right now are not optimal,\u201d adding that outcomes of trade discussions between China, Europe, and the U.S. were \u201creally difficult to predict.\u201d He said that prospective investors, particularly Swedish pension funds, could be hurt by a drop in valuation. Instead, Volvo would prefer \u201cstable market conditions.\u201dThe company is taking steps to avoid U.S. tariffs, including shifting production of some models to Sweden to avoid a levy on Chinese-made vehicles. Mr. Samuelsson said that an I.P.O. was still in the cards \u2014 but that there was \u201c no hurry.\u201dRobert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, are trying to reach an agreement on a plan to cut tariffs on industrial goods to zero and prevent President Trump from carrying out a threat to impose 25 percent levies on car imports. An accord is unlikely on Monday, but businesses on both sides of the Atlantic will be looking for signs that the two sides are making progress.A German court will start hearing evidence today in a lawsuit filed by Volkswagen shareholders over the carmaker\u2019s emissions-testing scandal. The plaintiffs say that Volkswagen violated its responsibility to them when it used illegal software to cheat on emissions tests \u2014 and they\u2019re seeking billions of euros in damages.A victory may make amends for Elliott\u2019s failed bet in 2008 against Volkswagen shares. The hedge fund has claimed that market manipulation was to blame in that case, but courts never agreed.Higher prices would mean China\u2019s leaders would have to be careful as they seek ways to bolster slowing growth, lest their efforts drive up prices still further. The trade war with the United States could also lead to higher prices for Chinese consumers and companies as tariffs raise the cost of imported goods.Chinese economists say that there is no cause for alarm, and that some price increases may be temporary. But the consumer price index may understate the situation, so expect close scrutiny of prices over the coming weeks.Some investors and employees have said that the approach has stunted growth. But the company is worth $12.3 billion, its user base is expanding and there is wide speculation that it will go public next year. Which side is correct?

{"Headline": "Tesla Shaken by a Departure and What Elon Musk Was Smoking", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a moment, it looked as if Elon Musk and Tesla had put a summer of turbulence behind them. The moment was very brief.The developments, which brought new scrutiny of Mr. Musk\u2019s behavior and managerial fitness, rattled investors who have lately endured many challenges to their faith. Tesla shares ended the day off 6 percent and are at their lowest level since April. But while the decline was sharp, it was not sudden.\u201cThe level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations,\u201d Mr. Morton said in a statement included in the filing. \u201cAs a result, this caused me to reconsider my future.\u201dHe went on to say, \u201cI want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla\u2019s leadership or its financial reporting.\u201dAfter the company dropped its pursuit of a stock buyout, it seemed ready to focus on its strategic goals: production of the crucial Model 3 sedan and a push to deliver profits. But analysts said the sudden exit of Mr. Morton \u2014 the latest in a growing exodus of top Tesla executives \u2014 prompted new questions about the company.\u201cLosing a chief accounting officer so quickly at a time when the company\u2019s finances are under pressure does not give good optics,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \u201cIt gives the implication that the executive was uncomfortable with the situation or with putting his name on something.\u201dThere is no question that Tesla\u2019s culture is different from that of conventional automakers or even other Silicon Valley companies \u2014 like the data storage company Seagate, Mr. Morton\u2019s last employer. That is largely by Mr. Musk\u2019s design, and certainly reflects his outsize presence. His web appearance late Thursday was the latest evidence.He was the guest of the comedian Joe Rogan, an advocate for legalizing marijuana, and the repartee included an exchange over what Mr. Musk was smoking.\u201cIs that a joint, or is it a cigar?\u201d Mr. Musk asked after his host took out a large joint and lit it up.\u201cIt\u2019s marijuana inside of tobacco,\u201d Mr. Rogan replied, and he asked if Mr. Musk had ever had it.\u201cYeah, I think I tried one once,\u201d he replied, laughing.The comedian then asked if smoking on air would cause issues with stockholders, to which Mr. Musk responded, \u201cIt\u2019s legal, right?\u201d He then proceeded to take a puff. Marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use in California, where the interview was recorded.After Mr. Musk announced on Aug. 7 that he intended to take Tesla private at $420 a share, there was speculation that the figure was chosen because \u201c420\u201d is a code for marijuana in the drug subculture.\u201cIt seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dEven though the plan to go private has been set aside, its repercussions continue. The San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet about having \u201cfunding secured\u201d \u2014 a proposition that proved dubious \u2014 as well as broader issues surrounding company disclosures about production goals with the midsize Model 3, which Tesla is counting on to drive up revenue and stabilize its finances. Shareholder lawsuits are also cropping up.After declaring aggressive output goals for the new model, Tesla has struggled for the last 12 months to smooth out glitches and bottlenecks in its assembly process. Mr. Musk has vowed that Tesla will report profits in both the third and fourth quarters, a forecast based on production of 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week.Analysts think the company has been averaging close to 4,000 cars a week or fewer since then.And investors have remained on edge as the stock declines \u2014 it closed Friday at $263.24 \u2014 and Mr. Musk continues to draw attention away from strategic priorities, often through impulsive outbursts on Twitter.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Tesla and Elon Musk to grow up,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader. \u201cThe company has problems, and it seems the board and investors need to start speaking up about how the company is being run. Maybe behaving like that is cool to some people, but doing it while running the company with other people\u2019s money is really not cool.\u201dA company spokesman, Dave Arnold, had no comment.Mr. Musk has made Tesla\u2019s brand inseparable from his own image. He is not only chief executive of the 15-year-old company but also its chairman and largest shareholder. Now that Tesla is remaining a public company, it will be up to its board to determine if and how his role might change.If he is feeling any insecurity, it was not reflected in his webcast with Mr. Rogan. He appeared at ease, sipping whiskey, and spoke, at one point, about artificial intelligence and how it could not be controlled.\u201cYou kind of have to be optimistic about the future,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in being pessimistic. I\u2019d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu and Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cheaper Battery Is Unveiled as a Step to a Carbon-Free Grid", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLithium-ion batteries have become essential for powering electric cars and storing energy generated by solar panels and wind turbines. But their drawbacks are also by now familiar: They use scarce minerals, are vulnerable to fires and explosions, and are pricey.A plentiful, safe and more affordable alternative would be worth a lot.On Wednesday, an energy company headed by the California billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong announced that it had developed a rechargeable battery operating on zinc and air that can store power at far less than the cost of lithium-ion batteries.Tests of the zinc energy-storage systems have helped power villages in Africa and Asia as well as cellphone towers in the United States for the last six years, without any backup from utilities or the electric grid, Dr. Soon-Shiong said.\u201cIt could change and create completely new economies using purely the power of the sun, wind and air,\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong, a surgeon and a biotechnology entrepreneur, said in an interview in Los Angeles before the announcement.The battery units, in conjunction with solar arrays, can be combined to create a microgrid system powering a village or a larger area, Dr. Soon-Shiong said. They have been deployed to support 110 villages in nine countries in Asia and Africa \u2014 including places that otherwise relied on generators or even lacked electricity, he said.The International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank fostering private-sector projects in developing countries, was an early investor in NantEnergy, and an agency representative sits on the company\u2019s board.The United States Department of Energy made development grants to NantEnergy (formerly known as Fluidic Energy) totaling $5 million, Dr. Soon-Shiong said.NantEnergy, based in Phoenix and in El Segundo, Calif., says it expects to expand the use of its product in telecommunications towers and eventually extend it to home energy storage, beginning in California and New York. Beyond that, it anticipates use in electric cars, buses, trains and scooters.His energy company says it is the first to commercialize the use of zinc air batteries and has more than 100 related patents. It is taking orders for delivery next year and sees the potential for a $50 billion market.Dr. Soon-Shiong said the cost of his zinc air battery had dropped steadily since development began. NantEnergy says the technology costs less than $100 per kilowatt-hour, a figure that some in the energy industry have cited as low enough to transform the electric grid into a round-the-clock carbon-free system.The prevailing cost of lithium-ion technology varies, depending on the scale and application. Yogi Goswami, distinguished university professor and director of the Clean Energy Center at the University of South Florida, estimated that it is most likely $300 to $400 a kilowatt-hour.Engineers want to turn the dam into a vast reservoir of excess electricity from the solar farms and wind turbines that represent the power sources of the future.\u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d Dr. Goswami, who was not involved in the effort, said of the advances claimed by NantEnergy. \u201cYou have to have storage.\u201dDr. Goswami said he warned in congressional testimony a quarter-century ago that storage advances would be needed as the use of solar and wind power grew. That imperative has been somewhat overshadowed as the fracking boom made natural gas plentiful.\u201cUntil recently it didn\u2019t make any sense to worry about storage because we had cheap gas,\u201d said Mark Cooper, senior research fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at the Vermont Law School.But energy storage is increasingly needed to manage the ebb and flow of solar and wind energy that sometimes forces places like California to pay other states to take surplus power. And that need is driving innovation and decreasing cost.\u201cObviously it comes at a point where everyone is already looking for storage,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cCapitalism isn\u2019t going to deal with a problem where there isn\u2019t scarcity. In capitalism what we get is relentless reductions in cost.\u201dIn addition to their deployment in Asia and Africa, NantEnergy\u2019s batteries have been used to power more than 1,000 communications towers in the United States, Latin America and Southeast Asia. They include a Duke Energy location in North Carolina that withstood the effects of Hurricane Florence recently and Hurricane Irma last year.Sherif Abdelrazek, a senior engineer at Duke Energy, said that because the zinc air battery does not pose fire hazards as lithium-ion batteries can, it does not need external cooling systems to prevent overheating.The system\u2019s success means the Duke tower no longer needs to be connected to the electric grid, he said. As a result, 13 acres of land in the Great Smoky Mountains that was used for power lines is being turned over to the National Park Service.NantEnergy\u2019s announcement that it had reached the $100-per-kilowatt-hour threshold made the device even more attractive, Mr. Abdelrazek said.The product design is simple: plastic components and shell casing, a circuit board and zinc oxide, all in a package the size of a briefcase.In charging the batteries, electricity from solar installations is stored by converting zinc oxide to zinc and oxygen. In the discharge process, the system produces energy by oxidizing the zinc with air.The NantEnergy battery can provide power for up to 72 hours on a single charge, meaning it could have lasted throughout the period of cloud cover and stormy weather from Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas.Dan Reicher, an assistant secretary of energy in the Clinton administration, said successful development of a rechargeable zinc air battery could be a milestone in energy storage. He said the challenge had been to make such batteries reliable for continuous use. \u201cThat\u2019s an attractive characteristic if it\u2019s true,\u201d he said.But he cautioned that a battery\u2019s cost per kilowatt-hour depended on the application and scale. And he said the company\u2019s technology would have to live up to scrutiny. \u201cPeople do make claims and offer what they feel like is a legitimate set of data,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always elated to hear progress in storage, but you have to be careful.\u201dLyndon Rive, a co-founder of SolarCity \u2014 now a part of his cousin Elon Musk\u2019s company, Tesla \u2014 said recently that solar and storage innovations were likely to transform the electricity market. \u201cOver all, the trajectory is for solar to be the No. 1 source,\u201d said Mr. Rive, who left Tesla after the two companies merged two years ago.Dr. Soon-Shiong said he knew Mr. Musk \u2014 a fellow South African native \u2014 and considered him a visionary for his accomplishments in electric vehicles and energy storage. \u201cWe both are trying to make the world a better place,\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong said.Tesla has based its businesses on lithium-ion technology, and Mr. Musk has told shareholders that the company may get the cost of lithium-ion cells down to $100 a kilowatt-hour this year.NantEnergy made its announcement weeks after California mandated 100 percent carbon-free electricity in the state by 2045. Legislators have also approved a bill providing about $1 billion in subsidies for residential energy storage.\u201cCalifornia is obviously in need of that kind of breakthrough to meet our goals,\u201d said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group. \u201cI cannot claim to be in absolute certainty that this is everything they say it is, but it\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s this kind of breakthrough that we expect from our innovators.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of a California move to provide subsidies for energy storage. Such a bill has been approved by legislators; it has not been signed into law.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: Home Cooks Can Now Sell Their Food in California", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.In many parts of the world, it\u2019s the most normal thing: selling food that you make at home. But when Hai Ngoc Lam arrived in the United States five years ago from Vietnam, he found out what other would-be food entrepreneurs here already knew: It\u2019s illegal in California.\u201cIt\u2019s amazing for me,\u201d said Mr. Lam, who with his husband, Joe Acanfora, runs an under-the-radar business selling home-cooked Vietnamese food in the Bay Area.The law, which limits licenses to those with maximum revenue of $50,000 from home cooking, comes into effect in January and will apply only to counties that choose to participate. A small category of food considered the riskiest \u2014 oysters and raw meats among them \u2014 are not allowed.The goal of the law is to \u201creclaim cooking as a means of economic empowerment for the people who need it the most,\u201d according to the bill\u2019s main author, Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia, Democrat of Coachella.The law\u2019s supporters say it will be most helpful for people hoping to get a toehold in the food business \u2014 especially women, people of color and immigrants, many of whom can use social media as a way to connect with customers.\u201cTechnology is making it easier for people to cook at home and sell it,\u201d said Matt Jorgensen, the coordinator of Creating Opportunities, Opening Kitchens (the C.O.O.K. Alliance), an organization that helped sponsor the bill. \u201cIt\u2019s a class of domestic and local labor that hasn\u2019t been able to think of themselves as legitimate entrepreneurs.\u201dMr. Jorgensen says California is the first state to legalize home cooking but that similar laws in other states are already in the works.Starting a food-truck business in the Bay Area typically costs more than $100,000, Mr. Jorgensen said. A home-cooking license, including a mandatory inspection, will cost around $500, he estimated.Before moving to the United States, Mr. Lam ran a small restaurant in Vietnam, a business that his late grandmother started in her kitchen. Mr. Lam hopes to continue that tradition in America.\u201cIt\u2019s my dream come true,\u201d he said.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)In the age of online retail, flea markets are withering away on the East Coast \u2014 no one wants to bundle up on winter mornings to scour for merchandise. But in Los Angeles, good weather, job scarcity and higher commercial real-estate costs are the backdrop of a thriving swap-meet scene.At the Melrose Trading Post in West Hollywood, there are so many sellers that there is now a lottery for spots. And at the Rose Bowl flea, Americana from every era proliferates: vintage Playboys, gramophones, \u201cFree O.J.\u201d shirts from back when O.J. Simpson was on trial.One seller said he was fascinated by the clientele: driven by a compulsion to acquire, yet seldom displaying any serious inclination toward power and wealth. \u201cThe biggest thrill wasn\u2019t really making a profit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was finding that new rare piece for the collection.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Justice Department Is Examining Tesla After Musk Comment", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla said on Tuesday that the Justice Department had requested documents from the company after its chief executive, Elon Musk, abruptly announced that he had lined up funding to convert the publicly traded electric-car maker into a private company.The request for information suggests that the Justice Department has opened a preliminary investigation into Mr. Musk\u2019s market-moving Twitter post on Aug. 7 about the potential buyout.The Justice Department inquiry, along with an intensifying Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Tesla\u2019s practices and communications, substantially increases the risks facing the embattled company. Tesla already is under intense financial pressure, with its shares down 25 percent since early August, and the government investigations introduce the possibility of costly penalties or other sanctions.The Justice Department inquiry is being handled by the United States attorney\u2019s office in San Francisco, according to a person familiar with the matter. It is unclear whether the inquiry is criminal or civil or whether it is at such an early stage that the question has not been settled.While the specific scope of the Justice Department inquiry isn\u2019t known, prosecutors in investigations like this one might look at a company\u2019s accounting practices, the adequacy and accuracy of its public disclosures and whether executives had sought to mislead investors.Tesla said the Justice Department\u2019s request was not a subpoena but rather a \u201cvoluntary request for documents.\u201d The company added: \u201cWe respect the D.O.J.\u2019s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received.\u201dThe tweet blindsided Tesla\u2019s board and ignited a rally in Tesla\u2019s shares. It soon became clear that Mr. Musk had not nailed down the billions of dollars in outside funding that would be required for such a deal. Nor had he retained any banks to assist in the fund-raising process.As part of the investigation, the S.E.C. in the past month has sent subpoenas not only to Tesla but also to financial institutions that it hired to explore the going-private transaction, according to people briefed on the subpoenas. Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake, a large investment firm, both received subpoenas demanding materials about their interactions with Tesla, the people said.It is not clear whether the Justice Department inquiry is, like the S.E.C.\u2019s, focused on a wide range of issues at Tesla or in particular on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Musk\u2019s Twitter post.Mr. Musk and the company he helped found have been bouncing from crisis to self-inflicted crisis in recent months.As the pressure mounts, Mr. Musk has retained his own lawyers to represent him in the government investigations, separate from the law firms hired by the company and its board.Lawyers from Hughes Hubbard & Reed \u2014 including Roel C. Campos, a former S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 are representing Mr. Musk in connection with the S.E.C. investigation, according to three people familiar with the arrangement. Mr. Musk has also hired Steven Farina, a partner at Williams & Connolly who specializes in government investigations and accounting malpractice, to represent him, two of the people said.A request for documents from a United States attorney\u2019s office would often be a sign of a criminal investigation. But federal prosecutors sometimes proceed with civil, not criminal, cases. They generally do so when the conduct they are investigating does not clearly violate a criminal statute or when prosecutors\u2019 main goal is to stop someone from a specific type of behavior. Civil lawsuits also carry a lower burden of proof than criminal cases.The news of the Justice Department inquiry sent Tesla\u2019s shares down more than 3 percent on Tuesday.David Gelles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nio\u2019s Share Surge Takes It From Carmaker to Tech Star", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsElectric-car maker Nio shifted quickly into a new gear. On the second day of trading after its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, its shares zoomed up 76 percent. That transformed China\u2019s answer to Tesla from a carmaker into a tech star.Some deserved skepticism forced Nio to sell its stock at the low end of the indicated price range. For a fleeting moment, its valuation \u2014 nearly $7 billion at Wednesday\u2019s close \u2014 just about suited the sector in which it operates. Applying rival Geely\u2019s net profit margin of nearly 12 percent and its valuation of seven times its forecasted earnings implied a bottom line of just over $1 billion for Nio. That would conceivably be within reach if it could run its manufacturing partner\u2019s factory at full capacity and then sell every single one of the 120,000 vehicles produced.With a valuation of $13 billion, much higher expectations kick in. Nio would have to churn out more than twice as many vehicles as current capacity allows and find buyers for all of them. As of August, Nio had delivered just about 1,600 cars, generating $7 million in revenue at a big loss.Chinese tech hype may explain the enthusiasm. Nio touted connected cars serviced by a dedicated app and partnerships with Tencent and JD.com for music streaming and e-commerce. These kinds of services resonate with investors. Shares of market debutants from China on the N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq, excluding Nio, have averaged 64 percent increase this year, according to Dealogic. For all new listings in the Big Apple, the rise is a more muted 28 percent.Tesla, too, trades at over 100 times estimated earnings for 2019. Nio may have belatedly captured some of that exuberance. It is nevertheless an unexpected, and implausible, U-turn.Advertisement"}

What are the challenges to broader deployment of batteries in the energy sector?The biggest issue has been cost. Batteries have been very expensive, but that\u2019s changing fairly quickly. Just as with the rapid drop in price in solar panels, batteries to store electricity have rapidly declined in cost, most likely making them more affordable within the next few years.California is also likely to be a major driver in the expansion of battery storage. The State Assembly recently passed a measure to provide about $1 billion to help homeowners purchase batteries for their homes. The state created a similar program for solar that led to one million solar roofs and helped make California by far the leader in residential solar installations.How has tech changed the power grid as a whole?Just in the last decade, the 100-year model of utilities producing electricity and selling power to consumers was turned on its head. Improvements in solar panel efficiency and lower product cost enabled consumers on a wide scale to produce their own power and sell it back to the electric grid.The grid was never designed to be a two-way street. So that has led to a reimagining of it. Utility companies must rethink the services they provide. No longer just power companies, utilities provide new services like vehicle charging stations for the growing number of electric cars.Along with producing their own power, people now benefit from improvements in energy efficiency, which has resulted in flat or reduced electricity use across the country \u2014 another adjustment for the power companies. Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, highly efficient appliances and smart technology have changed the way we use power.What kind of tech setup do you have for work? The alternative energy beat often is data driven, so tech is critical. Google Sheets and Excel help me manage data from the United States Energy Information Administration, the Solar Energy Industries Association and the California Solar and Storage Association.I also check some of the latest developments in alternative energy on Greentechmedia.com and Utility Dive. And I consult the Electric Power Research Institute.Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love? How do you use it?Our house is full of computers, mostly Apple \u2014 MacBooks, iPads and iPhones \u2014 though we use other tablets as well. The gadgets get their fair share of schoolwork activity, but they\u2019re also tools of social media, music, art, websites, programming, Hulu and Netflix.Entertainment is big. So there are several gaming systems, old and more recent, like various Nintendo systems as well as Xbox.But as if all of that weren\u2019t enough, my sons built their own computer with money they made during the summer at a fast food chicken restaurant so they could play and make video games they hope to sell. So far they\u2019re planning more than developing, but perhaps that might fall under the category of research.How has the tech industry swept into Los Angeles? And how has the city changed as a result?Without a doubt, energy technology is a staple of Southern California, given that the state is the leader in solar power. Residential solar is prolific.But technology is really changing transportation. Of course, there are Uber and Lyft, but electric vehicles have also given rise to new companies like Tesloop, which will take you from Los Angeles to San Diego in a Tesla for as little as $29 (snacks included). Prices go as high as about $84, and all users have to do is register and request a ride online. My daughter sometimes uses the service to get to and from the University of California, San Diego, where she goes to school, or uses ride shares through social media.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Fans Just Took a Big Hit as Tesla Shares Tank", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt takes a swipe at the market\u2019s embrace of charismatic chief executives. As investors absorbed the gravity of the case, shares of Tesla dropped by nearly 14 percent by the close of trading on Friday.This is how Wall Street is reacting to the news of the S.E.C.\u2019s lawsuit against Elon Musk.The suit centers on Mr. Musk\u2019s statements \u2014 via Twitter \u2014 in August about taking Tesla private, a transaction that did not take place. \u201cAs a result of Musk\u2019s false and misleading statements and material omissions, investors who purchased Tesla stock in the period after the false and misleading statements but before accurate information was made known to the market were harmed,\u201d said the suit, which was filed on Thursday.The commission is trying to show that Mr. Musk never got a firm or detailed offer to take the company private.In a statement distributed by Tesla, Mr. Musk said: \u201cThis unjustified action by the S.E.C. leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed. I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors.\u201d It\u2019s possible that Mr. Musk fights and wins this case.There are three takeaways for investors from the commission\u2019s action.The action was also brought with surprising speed. The commission decided to go ahead with it after Mr. Musk refused to negotiate a settlement, according to a person familiar with his thinking.The regulators may have moved ahead after Mr. Musk backed out because they concluded that they had strong evidence in this particular case. As a result, the action may not signify too much about the overall stance of the commission under Mr. Trump.Still, pursuing this case against a chief executive with a big fan base and a reputation for groundbreaking entrepreneurship carries significant risks for the agency. A victory for Mr. Musk would be a major defeat for the commission.Tesla\u2019s shareholders have to assess what will happen to the company if Mr. Musk is not the chief executive. Sometimes the departure of the boss at a troubled company means the emergence of other problems as the new guard tries to clean house. Changes in corporate leadership in the past have often been followed by bruising financial hits and disruptive moves to overhaul the company that don\u2019t always pay off.Tesla, worth roughly $50 billion on the stock market, is hemorrhaging cash. General Motors, with more or less the same market value, brought in $17 billion of cash last year. True, the stock market\u2019s bears, short-sellers, have placed big bets on a collapse of Tesla\u2019s stock. But they have not had much success. Mr. Musk has convinced many investors that Tesla has an amazing future.After shares dropped on Friday to $265, Tesla\u2019s shares are still changing hands at nearly 100 times the earnings Wall Street analysts expect the company to make next year, a valuation that exceeds that of many successful, fast-growing technology companies.Mr. Musk\u2019s legal problems may now complicate Tesla\u2019s efforts to alleviate a potential cash crunch. The company may need to find over $1 billion to repay convertible debts that come due in the next few months. Analysts have expected Tesla to raise fresh money by selling new shares. But the legal cloud over the company could make it harder to quickly raise capital in the market.The commission\u2019s suit may go down as a famous reminder to investors that wildly bullish statements from chief executives should be treated with skepticism. But Tesla\u2019s run reveals that investors\u2019 willingness to believe in a good story can still grip the American stock markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Elon Musk Turned Down a Fraud Settlement With the S.E.C.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the commission convinces a jury that Mr. Musk misled investors, he could be blocked from serving as an executive or director of any public company. That could force him to assume a different position at Tesla. It could also affect his other companies, SpaceX and the Boring Company, were they to go public, and potentially harm their ability to raise money from investors.Andrew\u2019s take:Mr. Musk will want to prove that his intent wasn\u2019t to mislead investors, probably by demonstrating that he had real conversations to take the company private. But his intent is almost beside the point. He can be found guilty simply for being \u201creckless.\u201d And na\u00efvet\u00e9 isn\u2019t a defense.This is turning into a sad story for Tesla\u2019s employees, investors and ultimately everyone who has followed Mr. Musk\u2019s efforts to transform the auto and energy industries.The data suggest that companies still feel confident enough about the economy to strike big deals. Much of this year\u2019s activity was driven by giant takeovers like Walt Disney\u2019s acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox and T-Mobile\u2019s proposed acquisition of Sprint.What remains to be seen is whether trade wars and other economic sandbags will weigh down the M.&A. run.In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors, one of the world\u2019s largest fund managers, pushed companies to put more women on corporate boards. FactSet has crunched the numbers, and there\u2019s a long way to go:\u2022 Companies in the Russell 3000 stock index with no female board members declined to 18 percent, from 23 percent.\u2022 Companies in which women hold 15 percent of the board seats or less decreased to 47 percent, from 58 percent.\u2022 The boards of 22 companies are equally split between men and women, while women make up the majority at 14 companies, up from five.\u2022 Just 5 percent of companies in the index are led by women, unchanged from March 2017.The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds. Every time since 1960 that it has inverted \u2014 when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates \u2014 a recession has followed. For much of this year, the spread has been at its narrowest level in more than a decade. Many economists believe it will invert next year.Six-year-old Bytedance, which was said to be seeking around $3 billion in the current round, started out by using artificial intelligence to personalize content for users but has successfully branched out into short-video via a service called Douyin, known as Tik Tok abroad. That service had 500 million monthly active users as of July. It also owns the Musical.ly app, which has about 100 million users and is being merged with Tik Tok, the company said in August.One reason for investor caution: With companies like Tencent getting involved in short video, Tik Tok may struggle to grow in a saturated market.But he also wonders what might happen if other companies embraced its vision:If Apple\u2019s more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech\u2019s dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks.The financial crisis ruined Goldman Sachs\u2019s reputation in the eyes of the public. Ten years on, it is finally out of the doghouse.But let\u2019s not get carried away.

{"Headline": "Chinese I.P.O.s Are Bringing Casino Trading to New York", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsChinese start-ups are bringing the volatility of their homeland markets to New York.The Tencent-backed news aggregator Qutoutiao more than doubled its share price on its first day of Nasdaq trading, before tumbling on the second. The luxury electric-car maker Nio, which has a market capitalization of almost $9 billion, seesawed almost as much. Small free floats and untested business models are partly to blame, but the erratic behavior will hurt future debuts.Qutoutiao, an unprofitable start-up that gives cash rewards to its readers, priced its shares at the bottom end of a marketed range last week. Investors, it seemed, were put off by a lack of important operating licenses, and other signs of a rushed sale. But the shares rose nearly 130 percent from their listing value on the first day \u2014 only to crash 40 percent in the next session. Nio, China\u2019s answer to Tesla, had a similar ride. It priced at the low end of an ambitious range and had a damp start, but its shares soared nearly 80 percent on the second day.In both cases, the oscillations \u2014 more frequently seen in mainland exchanges \u2014 triggered trading halts.One credible explanation for the roller coaster effect is the small quantity of shares actually sold by Chinese debutantes, either because of stubborn founders, weak investor demand or both. Just 16 percent of Nio was sold. Qutoutiao put roughly 5 percent of itself on the market. That amplifies market mood swings.Overall, the eight largest Chinese companies making U.S. debuts this year sold between 4 and 19 percent of their shares, according to the data provider Dealogic. That compares to between 14 and 86 percent for the top non-Chinese companies listing on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.Either way, trading with Chinese characteristics has damaging consequences. With even companies like the $27 billion shopping app Pinduoduo whipsawing this year, large institutional investors may be put off further listings, making it ever harder to build credible shareholder books. That would only accentuate the gambling problem further.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Are Robots Coming for Your Job? Eventually, Yes.", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsGreetings from the real economy. I\u2019m Steve Lohr, a tech reporter for The Times, and I tend to focus on the effects of technology beyond Silicon Valley. No question, the Valley is a wellspring of innovation and home to the ascendant digital corporate giants, both feared and admired. But it\u2019s just a sliver of the $20 trillion American economy.Technology is only a tool in service of greater ends, and those ends presumably extend beyond creating billionaires and enriching investors. The larger agenda, in economic terms, includes growth, productivity, living standards and jobs.Let\u2019s take one of those economic ingredients \u2014 jobs.Forecasts of technology\u2019s impact on jobs run the spectrum from apocalyptic to sanguine, depending largely on the pace of progress in artificial intelligence. But there is a consistency to the serious research on the coming course of automation: In the near term, occupations are more likely to be transformed by digital technology than destroyed by it.The work of the future, it seems clear, is going to be digitally inflected. Software skills are increasingly essential to every field. Most tech workers no longer work in the tech industry, and that trend is accelerating.These efforts are typically not far along yet, but the ones that seem to work best are collaborations \u2014 public-private partnerships that also involve nonprofit organizations and educational institutions.A new project adopting the collaborative model was announced this month in New Haven. The goal, said Gov. Dannel Malloy, is \u201ccultivating the tech work force talent of tomorrow.\u201d The new venture aims to double the number of software engineering graduates in Connecticut over the next several years.Its educational partner is a college-alternative start-up, the Holberton School. Founded in 2015 in San Francisco, Holberton offers a two-year program to create software engineers. Its graduates now work for companies like Apple, IBM, Dropbox and Tesla. The school charges no tuition, but graduates who get jobs pay the school 17 percent of their salaries for three years.After the Connecticut announcement, I caught up with Holberton\u2019s founders, Julien Barbier and Sylvain Kalache, both alumni of Silicon Valley companies. Their school is designed around projects and peer learning with mentors, but no formal teachers.Technical skills are only part of the program. Writing white papers, project reviews and public speaking are also emphasized. Critical thinking, teamwork and learning to learn are the higher-order skills.Technology changes too fast, Mr. Barbier said, for expertise in a particular set of software tools to be a lasting asset in the labor market.\u201cIn two years, you do learn a craft that is in demand,\u201d said Mr. Barbier, Holberton\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut this is really about self-learning. If you can train yourself, you\u2019re never going to obsolete.\u201dIn San Francisco, Holberton has enrolled a total of 300 students since it opened its doors two years ago and, with added space, hopes to bring in 1,000 students a year before long. At the New Haven school, which begins next year, Holberton plans to start with 30 to 50 students and then expand rapidly.Its model has made encouraging progress. But the big question for all the experiments intended to prepare people for the future of work is whether anything can scale up to the size of the challenge that America faces.Some tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk Steps Down as Chairman in Deal With S.E.C. Over Tweet About Tesla", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk, under pressure from his lawyers and investors of Tesla, the company he co-founded, reached a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday to resolve securities fraud charges. The settlement will force Mr. Musk to step aside as chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine.The deal with the S.E.C. will allow him to remain as chief executive, something he could have jeopardized if he had gone to battle with the agency.It is not clear why Mr. Musk changed his mind so quickly.People familiar with the situation, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said lawyers for Mr. Musk and the company moved to reopen the talks with the S.E.C. on Friday. During that time, one of Tesla\u2019s lawyers became instrumental in securing a deal with the S.E.C., according to a person familiar with the negotiations.The whipsaw events of the past few days followed a series of self-inflicted wounds by Mr. Musk.His tweet about taking his company private, along with attacks on critics on social media, raised concerns with investors about whether Mr. Musk has become too focused on criticism from so-called short-sellers who had been making bets against him and Tesla. The company has recently been struggling to meet audacious production goals for its Model 3 sedan.Mr. Musk is widely regarded by analysts and investors as the creative engine behind Tesla, and he has helped the company become one of the most valuable American carmakers. But Tesla has lurched from crisis to crisis over the past year, and has since scrambled to contain the fallout from Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet.The company, whose shares have been hit hard since the S.E.C. filed the lawsuit, did not immediately comment on the settlement. On Friday, its stock dropped almost 14 percent.Tesla, which is also settling with the S.E.C., will pay a $20 million penalty. The company was not charged with any fraud.In addition, the company will add two independent directors and take steps to monitor Mr. Musk\u2019s communications with investors. It will also create a permanent committee of independent directors to monitor disclosures and potential conflicts of interest.Jay Clayton, the S.E.C. chairman, said the settlement with Mr. Musk and Tesla sent a message that \u201cwhen companies and corporate insiders make statements, they must act responsibly, including endeavoring to ensure the statements are not false or misleading.\u201dIn settling, Mr. Musk neither admitted nor denied misleading investors under the civil fraud charge, which means he cannot later say he did nothing wrong.The settlement with the S.E.C. faulted Tesla for failing to make sure that information important to investors was disclosed in a proper and timely manner.Mr. Musk had a good reason to reopen the settlement talks: The S.E.C., in suing him, had sought to bar him permanently from serving as a top executive or officer of Tesla or any other public company. Under the deal reached on Saturday, he will not only remain as chief executive, but will also stay on as a board member, just not as chairman.\u201cThe total package of remedies and relief announced today are specifically designed to address the misconduct at issue by strengthening Tesla\u2019s corporate governance and oversight in order to protect investors,\u201d said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division.Mr. Musk, according to people familiar with the negotiations, had been concerned about whether settling a civil fraud charge might affect the ability of Tesla and the other companies he runs, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, to raise money from investors in private placements and the debt markets.But a Tesla spokesman said the S.E.C. had granted waivers to all of those companies so his settlement would not be held against them.Waivers in such a situation are not uncommon, legal experts have said.A Tesla spokesman said that Mr. Musk, a billionaire, would be buying $20 million in Tesla stock. The amount of stock being bought by Mr. Musk matches the penalty the company has to pay under the settlement, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan.The S.E.C. reacted quickly after the Aug. 7 tweet, which caused an immediate surge in Tesla shares. Regulators served a subpoena on the company seeking information and moved to take testimony from Mr. Musk and others at the company, people familiar with the matter said.Negotiations toward an initial settlement began about a week ago, after the S.E.C. said it was planning to send an official notice to Mr. Musk and Tesla that it was considering filing an enforcement action, those briefed on the talks said. By their account, all the parties thought a deal had been reached by Wednesday evening, and the plan was for a settlement with Mr. Musk and Tesla to be announced on Thursday.Mr. Musk was said to have backed away from a settlement, in part, because he was concerned that he could not later tell investors that he had not done anything wrong. But the settlement on Saturday requires him to do that.In a so-called \u201cadmit nor deny\u201d settlement, a settling party cannot later disavow the terms of the settlement.After Mr. Musk was said to have rejected the deal on Thursday, his lawyers asked the S.E.C. to wait a couple of days so they could talk him into it, but the regulators said no, said another person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly.Once the S.E.C. sued Mr. Musk, his lawyers continued to talk to him about moving forward with a settlement and eventually he agreed, this person said.In the meantime, Mr. Musk had conversations with investors and friends like Mark Cuban, an entrepreneur who has had his own battles with the S.E.C., and they gave him a sense of how difficult it is to fight one of these suits, even if he eventually won, said people familiar with the negotiations.The parties worked much of Friday and Saturday to get a deal done.The settlement clears a big headache for Tesla, but other problems remain.The S.E.C. is continuing to look into the company\u2019s past claims about its production goals. And now with Mr. Musk agreeing to step down as chairman, Tesla\u2019s board must decide who should replace him.Emily Flitter, David Gelles and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Betting Against Tesla: Short-Sellers Make Their Case", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk says short-sellers are conspiring to bring his company down. Some seasoned investors say it\u2019s just a matter of fundamentals. For the past year, Elon Musk has waged a bitter war of words with short-sellers, the investors who are betting billions of dollars that Tesla will fail.George Noble doesn\u2019t fit that description. Manager of his own hedge fund, Noble Capital Advisors, he rarely comments on Tesla in public or on Twitter, and he comes with an impressive pedigree. He has been following and investing in car companies for nearly 40 years, having started his career an auto analyst and then a rising fund manager at Fidelity in the 1980s.\u201cI\u2019m not one of these individuals with superficial knowledge who\u2019s tweeting garbage on Twitter,\u201d said Mr. Noble, 61. \u201cI\u2019ve followed this industry a long, long time. I\u2019m not a bomb-throwing hack.\u201dThere\u2019s no doubt Tesla and Mr. Musk, the company\u2019s high-profile chief executive, have plenty of detractors, especially on Twitter, where some critics trumpet vitriol and unsubstantiated information about the company and its business. But many of those who believe that Tesla is destined for a major restructuring \u2014 or even collapse \u2014 are buttoned-up investors. They base their view not on antipathy for Tesla or Mr. Musk, but on cold financial calculations, including its heavy debt load and voracious cash burn.\u201cThis isn\u2019t only about Musk,\u201d said Mark B. Spiegel, a managing partner at Stanphyl Capital, which has a large position shorting Tesla. \u201cIt\u2019s about a terrible capital structure, because of the debt, and a stock price that is out of whack with the demand for the product and the competition that\u2019s coming in.\u201dMr. Spiegel said he had spoken out to \u201ceducate people\u201d about Tesla\u2019s finances. \u201cI\u2019m just putting facts out there that counter the claims Musk puts out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t make up reasons to short something.\u201d Tesla did not respond substantively to a request for comment for this article.Here are some of the reasons that skeptics like Mr. Nobel and Mr. Spiegel offer for their position.REASON 1The main reason that Tesla is the most shorted stock on Wall Street is its market valuation of $50 billion. Until recent declines in its stock, Tesla was worth more than General Motors. But in 2017, G.M. sold 9.6 million cars and trucks and made $12.8 billion in pretax profit. Tesla sold just over 100,000 cars in 2017, and lost $2.2 billion.Mr. Noble said the image of an unprofitable company with a lofty market value harked back to the dot-com era, when enthusiastic investors drove up the stock prices of even start-ups that had no revenue and no profits.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cars are cool \u2014 the acceleration, the torque.\u201d But a struggling, highly leveraged company with a valuation of $50 billion, he said, is \u201cone of the biggest bubbles in the market.\u201dREASON 2The argument against Tesla almost always cites its finances \u2014 whose shaky state, Mr. Spiegel contends, is often obscured by the hype over its cars and by Mr. Musk\u2019s own tweets and ambitious ideas, such as an electric semi truck and his hope to transport people through networks of underground tunnels.With cars priced at $70,000 and up, a company selling more than 100,000 a year would normally rake in hefty profits. But Tesla still spends more money than it takes in, consuming nearly $1 billion every three months. Mr. Musk has vowed that a sharp increase in sales of the Model 3 sedan in the current quarter will drive up revenues enough to make Tesla profitable and provide the funds it needs, but short-sellers are skeptical.Gabe Hoffman, 41, general partner at Accipiter Capital Management, a hedge fund that has shorted Tesla, points to the ratio of how much cash Tesla has and could access quickly and how much it owes in the short term. Because of its shortage of cash and all its liabilities, \u201cTesla looks worse than General Motors one quarter before it filed for bankruptcy,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.\u201cTo me that doesn\u2019t sound like a good long-term business model,\u201d Mr. Wolters said.REASON 3The chief of any company needs to be disciplined and to \u201cexecute at a high level,\u201d Mr. Cohodes said. But the string of recent events has convinced him that Mr. Musk is \u201cnot mentally fit\u201d to deal with all of Tesla\u2019s challenges successfully. \u201cI view Elon as a tragic figure,\u201d he added.REASON 4 For Mr. Noble, the biggest doubt about Tesla is whether consumers are actually clamoring to buy its cars. The company has reported that more than 400,000 people have paid deposits of $1,000 each to reserve Model 3s.\u201cThat suggests that every car they make has a paying customer waiting for it,\u201d Mr. Noble said. \u201cThat is the heart of Tesla\u2019s story. That\u2019s why people buy the stock, because it looks like they have unlimited demand.\u201dBut some recent actions by Tesla suggest that may not be the case. The weekend after Labor Day, it held a \u201csales event\u201d at its plant in Fremont, Calif., allowing deposit holders to stroll among several hundred cars and pick one to buy. Hundreds more have been parked for weeks at lots in Burbank and Lathrop, Calif. On Friday, Tesla sent an email to customers and deposit holders inviting them to test drive a Model S or X overnight \u2014 the kind of marketing event that car companies organize to drum up sales.\u201cThat\u2019s inventory,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cEverything they produce is supposed to be delivered or in transit on the way to the customer. If there\u2019s nothing wrong with demand, why are there all these cars in Burbank? Something doesn\u2019t add up.\u201dThe italics emphasizing the adverbial form of \u201cshort\u201d were left to interpretation.

{"Headline": "Tesla Needs to Build Investor Trust. The Exit of Its Accountant Won\u2019t Help.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCompanies can have unconventional chief executives, but not eccentric accounting.The departure of Tesla\u2019s chief accounting officer, David Morton, may be particularly concerning for investors because of its unfortunate timing. Tesla, which has seen its cash stockpile shrink in recent quarters as its debt has grown, is entering a crucial period in which there can be no qualms about its financial statements.Much rides on Tesla hitting certain financial goals. Mr. Musk said last month that he expected the company to be profitable, under generally accepted accounting principles, in the last two quarters of this year. In less precise terms, Tesla also said it expected to show positive cash flows. Its executives have at times also made predictions about its automotive gross margin, which measures how much revenue is left after subtracting the costs closely associated with producing cars. Because such financial benchmarks are derived from inputs that investors often cannot see, Tesla must have their trust.Mr. Morton could not be reached for comment.It\u2019s possible his resignation signifies little. Mr. Morton was not Tesla\u2019s top accountant; that is Deepak Ahuja, the chief financial officer, who has been at the company for the better part of a decade. And in Tesla\u2019s filing on Friday, Mr. Morton said he had \u201cno disagreements\u201d with the company\u2019s financial reporting. \u201cSince I joined Tesla on August 6th, the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations,\u201d Mr. Morton said.Big questions remain, though, and his statement is unlikely to assuage investors.Mr. Morton was previously the chief financial officer at Seagate, a company that makes disk drives for computers. When announcing his appointment, Tesla said he would \u201cbring more than two decades of significant financial and accounting expertise to Tesla.\u201d Did he discover that his new working environment was difficult or in disarray? Was there something he was uncomfortable signing off on?There\u2019s a recent reason Tesla\u2019s high-ranking accountants might feel uncomfortable. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating not only Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets musing about taking Tesla private but also the company\u2019s disclosures about certain production goals. Such investigations can broaden.Before Mr. Musk tweeted about going private last month, Tesla\u2019s promises about becoming profitable seemed to reassure investors. Shares jumped nearly 16 percent the following day. But the turbulence since then has only increased the pressure on Tesla. Not only does the company need to deliver on its promises, investors must be able to trust those results.With the latest executive departure, that just became all the more difficult.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Elon Musk\u2019s Chicago Tunnel: A Breakthrough or a Pipe Dream?", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 When Elon Musk agreed this summer to build a futuristic tunnel to Chicago\u2019s busiest airport on his own dime, many Chicagoans voiced doubt.Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Musk insist the project is moving forward and technically feasible, but some transportation experts say it is unlikely to happen, and if it does, will take longer than promised. Even if Mr. Musk\u2019s engineers can dig a tunnel faster than other companies, his pod system, which the entire project is based on, is still a work in progress.\u201cThere\u2019s an air of unreality to the project,\u201d said Joseph P. Schwieterman, a public policy professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cThere are so many challenges that have to be overcome.\u201dA spokeswoman for Mr. Musk\u2019s tunneling outfit, the Boring Company, declined to comment on the Chicago project or the doubts about its feasibility. But Mr. Emanuel says the project is \u201cabsolutely\u201d still happening. He is betting that Mr. Musk, who has sent rockets into space, can pull off another marvel, this time underground.\u201cWe\u2019ll get all the pieces aligned so it\u2019s on cruise control to keep going,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said in a recent interview, noting that he had eight months left in office and that Mr. Musk is expected to start digging next year.Mr. Musk agreed to cover the $1 billion estimated price tag, though some have knocked the high price that riders would be charged, saying the line would cater to the wealthy.\u201cIt is an amazing and dynamic time,\u201d said Robert Puentes, the president of the Eno Center for Transportation in Washington. \u201cThe pace of change is more rapid than anything I\u2019ve seen in my career.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to sort out the reality from the hucksterism,\u201d said Jon Orcutt, a director at Transit Center, a research group in New York.Mr. Musk, the billionaire behind SpaceX rockets, has pledged to lower the costs of digging underground, with faster machines and fewer workers. The Boring Company has announced similar plans for a tunnel in Los Angeles to ferry people to Dodger Stadium. The company is digging a two-mile test tunnel at SpaceX\u2019s headquarters outside of Los Angeles as a workshop for its ideas.Mr. Emanuel said the \u201cskate\u201d technology is not far-fetched \u2014 it would be a modified Tesla vehicle frame running on a concrete track. The plan for Chicago is separate from the Hyperloop, a similar idea from Mr. Musk that would create a vacuum inside a tube to eliminate air friction, allowing pods to travel much faster.\u201cThe biggest challenge is coming up with the software for the driverless Tesla,\u201d Mr. Emanuel said. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest piece from an engineering perspective.\u201dThe city is currently negotiating a contract with the Boring Company. Mr. Emanuel said he expected it to be approved by the City Council later this year. Then comes the environmental review, a notoriously slow process that could take at least a year.\u201cWe want to look at the project with the degree of healthy skepticism that\u2019s appropriate given Chicago\u2019s track record on projects like this,\u201d said David Greising, chief executive of the Better Government Association.Michael Horodniceanu, the former capital chief at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York, said the project would easily cost more than $1 billion. He compared Mr. Musk to Jules Verne, the 19th century author who had a bold imagination.\u201cI think challenging the system so that people can think differently about how to get things done is a healthy thing,\u201d Mr. Horodniceanu said.In New York, it took more than a year for a gigantic tunnel-boring machine to dig less than three miles for the Second Avenue subway. The machine dug about 40 feet a day \u2014 a slow pace that Mr. Musk has described as more leisurely than a snail, and one he wants to beat.Some have questioned whether the tunnel is the best use of the city\u2019s limited time and resources, especially since it is largely meant for business travelers. A train could carry more than 1,000 passengers, instead of 16.\u201cHe\u2019s proposing a super-expensive, low-capacity project that is consciously targeted toward the well-off,\u201d said Mr. Orcutt, a former official at New York\u2019s transportation department.\"If we succeed, it\u2019s going to be a great thing for the city,\u201d Mr. Musk said at a news conference in Chicago in June. \u201cAnd if we fail, well, I guess me and others will lose a bunch of money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The rocket would not be ready for the trip until 2023, Mr. Musk said, and would cost from $2 billion to $10 billion to develop. He added that Mr. Maezawa\u2019s ticket would make a meaningful contribution to the project\u2019s completion.While SpaceX\u2019s technological achievements are significant, Mr. Musk\u2019s forecasts of SpaceX\u2019s timelines have usually turned out to be far too optimistic.SpaceX successfully launched its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, in February.He also enlisted his engineers to build a submarine-like escape pod to rescue 12 boys and their coach from a cave in Thailand. That proved unnecessary \u2014 the boys were able to swim out with the help of divers.By comparison, SpaceX has been an oasis of calm, launching satellites and spacecraft without incident for most of the year.This is actually the second time that SpaceX has announced that it will fly tourists to the moon and back.With the modernization of electronics leading to smaller satellites and the greater lifting power of newer versions of SpaceX\u2019s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, the market for the Falcon Heavy is dwindling. (The Heavy has yet to make a second flight, although SpaceX lists the United States Air Force and satellite companies as future customers.) Mr. Musk said in February that SpaceX would not go to the expense and effort of making the Falcon Heavy suitable for human passengers.At the same time, SpaceX has begun work on the B.F.R., its next-generation behemoth rocket, more powerful than the Saturn 5 that NASA used for the Apollo missions. The rocket is intended to replace both the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy and is ultimately designed to take 100 people on a journey to Mars.

At the news conference on Monday, Mr. Musk said it was an iteration of the earlier design.So far, seven people have paid for a trip to space, riding on a Russian Soyuz rocket for short stays at the International Space Station.

{"Headline": "Talking U.S. Politics and Mythical Beasts: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn enthusiastic crowd showed up at the National Gallery of Canada for a sold-out New York Times event this week in which Julie Hirschfeld Davis, a White House correspondent, joined Jonathan Martin and Astead Herndon, two of our political correspondents, to talk with me about the state of American politics.The midterm elections in the United States have unusual importance for Canada. Congress will have the final say on whatever President Trump proposes to do with the North American Free Trade Agreement.My thanks to everyone who attended the Times\u2019s event, and my apologies to the many who didn\u2019t get to ask a question before the clock ran out.Next week\u2019s Canada Letter will include a link to a video of the full event. Here\u2019s a glimpse, edited for clarity and brevity:How do Americans feel about President Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada?Julie: The fact that the president is targeting the prime minister and targeting Canada as a country is really sort of the distillation of how he is different from any president we\u2019ve ever seen.Some people really regard it as dangerous because if you think of Canada as somehow antithetical to what\u2019s going on in the U.S., you\u2019re basically jettisoning a lot of history and a lot of common experience and a lot of common values \u2014 decades of a relationship that has been pretty foundational.Jonathan: When he is thinking about Canada, Trump doesn\u2019t have in mind this centuries-long relationship, the blood that American and Canadian soldiers have shed in so many wars. He\u2019s thinking about how can our country get ahead, how can we beat the other guy. And the other guy in this case just happens to be our closest friend and ally as well as neighbor.What\u2019s the overall mood in American politics right now?Astead: Polarized. We are at a moment in which I think both sides have rarely been further away from each other.Another takeaway is that real cultural clashes are happening. The game of politics is no longer existing outside of things like culture or outside of the questions of who we are as Americans. Now it\u2019s really baked in there. You have a president who just likes talking about domestic policy and also weighs in on the cultural event of the day. Whether it is what N.F.L. players are doing on the field or whether it is what the latest celebrity said at the Oscars.Jonathan: Tribal. The driving force now is what political scientists call negative partisanship. People are more energized in opposition to the other side than they are in support of their side. Which is why they\u2019re willing to sort of fudge a little bit when it comes to principles and policy issues if it means sticking to and staying loyal to their team.Are Americans developing a kind of scandal fatigue around Mr. Trump?I think the tendency in these situations is for people to tune it out.Astead: I agree but I would caution against saying it doesn\u2019t matter. We see President Trump having kind of consistent approval ratings, but we don\u2019t know whether these type scandals are actually dampening what could be a better rating.Are any issues rising to the top of the midterm campaign?A couple of weeks ago a court case in British Columbia involving the existence of the sasquatch led us to ask you about mythical creatures in your part of the country. The key takeaway from your replies is that the unknown world mainly reveals itself through sea monsters rather than hairy apelike creatures in Canada. Here are some highlights from your emails. They have been condensed and edited for clarity:Although I\u2019m a dyed-in-the-wool scientist and journalist, I too saw Okie, a.k.a. Ogogpogo, on the same full moon night in the early 1980s when hundreds of other people did.As clearly as a sane person sees, I saw what immediately made me think of the head of an aquatic dinosaur appear, then its body, and finally its tail. Comparing it to buildings on the near shore and taking into account distance, I estimated at the moment that it was about 180 feet long.Yes, I did close my eyes, rub them, shake my head and look again. I remember it remained in sight more than a minute. The next day it was front-page in the newspapers along with a photo someone took, which looked like what I had seen.I\u2019m still a skeptic, ambivalently incredulous and experiencing gut level cognitive dissonance when I remember it. But I saw what I saw.\u2014Douglas Chapman, Peachland, British ColumbiaThis is what makes Canada what it is! Faeries do exist.
