{"Headline": "Why America Should Embrace Market Surveillance in Sports Betting Before It\u2019s Too Late", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewThe American gambling industry and its regulators have an opportunity to police digital sports betting. They should take it before fraud becomes rife.Many bookmakers have made efforts to limit fraud and manipulation, but more can be done to ensure a level playing field. Regulators and sporting bodies would be wise to learn the lessons of the financial industry and adopt a range of policies and surveillance tools while the market in the United States for sports betting is still nascent.Many investors, regulators, and capital market players were caught flat-footed when markets were computerized decades ago. New digital products and trading methods created fresh forms of electronic manipulation and unintended consequences that were difficult to track within a sea of data. Authorities took months, for example, to trace and explain the causes of the Flash Crash of May 2010.Many systems for monitoring the integrity of sports betting around the world look at odds or prices across bookmakers. This type of approach was abandoned in financial markets over 15 years ago because it does not provide the granularity needed to properly police trading.The systems that monitor financial markets today are much more powerful and can handle large volumes of data. (Nasdaq\u2019s SMARTS stock market surveillance software, for instance, can handle over 60 billion events per day and can detect manipulative activity in real-time.) Monitoring bets alongside live feeds of events will be crucial to understanding possible manipulation, particularly as a result of wagering during a game.Individual bookmakers monitor their own customers very closely, but policing a marketplace requires more than simply trusting its participants. Even monitoring the entire market only at the price level could still allow nefarious activity spread across multiple bookmakers to go unnoticed.To truly oversee sports betting markets, regulators should require licensed operators to share all transactional betting data so that it can be examined for patterns known to indicate irregular activity. Cooperation across states is also important so that as large a slice of the market as possible can be monitored.Surveillance technology can be a major factor in how well a new market operates and enforces a safe, level playing field. These systems should be able to handle high volumes of data and have some level of machine learning capability. As the quantity of data, the range of products, and the sophistication of traders grow within sports betting, these new technologies will become necessary.As a market operator and technology company, we fully endorse this necessity.There is a vast gray (or black) market in wagering that exists beyond our shores. But with this new opportunity, the United States has a unique chance to set an example by overseeing this marketplace with integrity.Scott Shechtman is head of new markets, market technology at Nasdaq, and Tony Sio is head of marketplace and regulator surveillance, market technology at Nasdaq.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Small Investors Are Prey, Again, for the Wolves of Wall Street", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress tried to protect ordinary Americans\u2019 portfolios with the Dodd-Frank Act, but today they are more vulnerable than ever.Ms. Antilla is the author of \u201cTales From the Boom-Boom Room: Women vs. Wall Street.\u201dDodd-Frank was passed to rein in too-big-to-fail banks and establish new protections for consumers and investors. That included marching orders for the Securities and Exchange Commission to look into reforms meant to level the playing field between everyday investors and the sales agents who try to separate them from their money.The agency\u2019s official actions and failures to act are not the only problem.Last month, Hester Peirce, an S.E.C. commissioner appointed by President Trump, threw out a bombshell, signaling that she would support requests from companies looking to block shareholders from bringing class-action lawsuits. Ms. Peirce told Politico that public companies \u201cabsolutely\u201d should have the option of demanding arbitration instead of allowing class-wide court actions to proceed.Today, when shareholders believe they\u2019ve been cheated, they can join together before a court as a class, as investors in Enron and Worldcom did. The strength of such cases is in their numbers \u2014 investors can share costs that most solo plaintiffs couldn\u2019t afford \u2014 and in the deterrent effect of big judgments.Mr. Clayton, however, recently promoted an idea that similarly is favorable to business. He told an audience in Nashville last month that the S.E.C. is studying various issues concerning private securities, including whether they should be made available to a larger universe of investors. The agency now limits private offerings to wealthy investors. Privately held companies provide far less information about their operations than public companies do, making them a risky bet for individuals. Big institutional investors, by comparison, have the tools to evaluate those companies.And then there are the letdowns after Dodd-Frank. The law directed the agency to evaluate the standards that applied to stockbrokers and investment advisers. Stockbrokers, who are registered with Finra, a self-regulatory organization financed by its Wall Street members, are required only to recommend investments that are \u201csuitable\u201d for their customers, which leaves wiggle room for them to pick products that give them the biggest commissions. Registered investment advisers, who are overseen by the S.E.C. and state regulators, are held to a higher fiduciary standard of putting their clients\u2019 interests first.In 2011, the staff of the S.E.C. recommended that stockbrokers should be subject to the same high standards as investment advisers. Instead, seven years later, the S.E.C. proposed a rule, requiring brokers to act in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of clients, that would slightly raise broker standards but falls short of the fiduciary requirements that the staff recommended.That\u2019s not to say the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard doesn\u2019t have some fans. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street trade group, said it \u201csupports and commends\u201d the new standard.At an event for Main Street investors organized by the S.E.C. in Denver in July, a woman named Jaimie Davis said she had lost more than $2 million at the hands of a broker who put almost all of her assets into speculative private placements that were later exposed as a fraud. Forced to use arbitration, she said one of her arbitrators \u201cslept through most of the arbitration.\u201d Ultimately, she lost the case.Mr. Clayton, who said her story was \u201cthe worst\u201d of all the ones he heard in two months of public meetings, promised to look into it. Twelve days later, the agency wrote to Ms. Davis to say there was nothing it could do to help.The investor-unfriendly moves come at a bad time. Nine years into an economic recovery, stock prices are near record highs. But small investors should not get too comfortable. When things get ugly, they may find, yet again, that there is no one looking out for them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street May No Longer Be Able to Shrug Off Trump\u2019s Trade Wars", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis may be the point at which investors have to start taking President Trump\u2019s trade wars much more seriously.Fears about trade have at times weighed on stocks since mid-February when the Trump administration announced tariffs on steel and aluminum. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up nearly 9 percent this year, and much of those gains have come in the past two months, a move that took the stock market to a record high last week.Investors may have viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s threats since February as negotiating tactics, and believed that he would be content with limited gains. That appeared to be the case over the past week, in which the White House worked toward a trade deal with Mexico and Canada that does not appear to radically remake the North American Free Trade Agreement.But there has been unease among many investors. Fund managers have ranked trade as their primary concern over the past few months, and as Mr. Trump\u2019s statements have turned into action, some have positioned their investments for slower economic growth.Though last week\u2019s Nafta negotiations sparked a rally in stocks, investors might not want to draw too much from the talks. Mexico and Canada are predisposed to compromise, given their huge dependence on the United States market. And the European Union, which typically takes a hard line in trade negotiations, has not agreed to anything yet.While China relies on the United States market, its leaders can offset the impact of $250 billion in tariffs, by measures like stimulating their economy and bolstering exports by letting China\u2019s currency slide.China could also step up its retaliation against the United States, which may hurt American companies.That could put the stock market\u2019s gains this year at risk. This summer\u2019s rally has made stocks more expensive, which in turn makes them more vulnerable to negative news.How far could stocks fall if the trade conflict intensifies?Underlying stock market numbers give some guidance. The S. & P. 500 is now trading at 17 times earnings that analysts expect over the next 12 months, according to figures from FactSet. The lowest valuation on the index during the trade tensions this year was just over 16 times expected earnings. The benchmark would have to fall more than 5.5 percent to trade at that lower multiple.A moderate market reaction to a stepped-up conflict with China may be justified given the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations. But any sign that the conflict could hit corporate earnings would deepen worries about future profits. If the great earnings boom that has recently driven stocks to new highs falters, the S. & P. 500 would be at risk of a steep decline.Investors now have to decide whether a much nastier fight with China fits into that bullish narrative.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Third Point May Need a New Recipe for Its Campbell Soup Turnaround", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsDan Loeb needs Campbell Soup to taste more like the Heinz variety.The activist investor is trying to replace the board at the indebted food group, which has a market value of around $12 billion. Success in turning the company around could bring an investment win, but it\u2019s a grind more suited to Kraft Heinz backers 3G Capital than Mr. Loeb\u2019s hedge fund, Third Point.As Mr. Loeb built a stake in Campbell over the summer, the company was conducting a strategic review under the interim chief executive Keith McLoughlin. To the investor\u2019s dismay, Campbell wound up its process in August without deciding to put itself up for auction.Campbell\u2019s options were limited anyway. Private equity investors might in other circumstances have considered partnering with the founding family\u2019s descendants, who own some 40 percent of the stock. But a deal to buy the pretzel company Snyder\u2019s-Lance left Campbell with nearly $10 billion of debt \u2014 more than five times a forecast of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the current financial year, according to analysis by Thomson Reuters.Kraft is one of few potential industry buyers. But Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway and Kraft\u2019s largest shareholder, recently said it would be hard to justify a large premium.That may mean Mr. Loeb \u2014 assuming he can win over enough insiders to seize control of the board \u2014 has to find his own recipe. An obvious place to start would be with Campbell\u2019s costs. The company\u2019s estimated margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the year to July 2019 is 18 percent. Unilever and General Mills clock in at around 21 percent.That means there are some low-hanging tomatoes. If Campbell took two years to get its margin in line with those competitors while growing revenue at a steady 2 percent annually, its equity value could increase by more than a third, according to Breakingviews calculations.Mr. Loeb has shepherded in new chief executives at other companies, including Sotheby\u2019s and Baxter International. But squeezing out costs is more of a specialty for the likes of 3G, the group behind brewing giant Anheuser Busch-InBev that is also Mr. Buffett\u2019s investment partner in Kraft. Mr. Loeb could, though, aim to take the most accessible chunk out of Campbell\u2019s expenses quickly \u2014 and hope that Kraft, with its nearly 30 percent margin before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, will do the rest.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How \u2018Hyphenated Americans\u2019 Won World War I", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a quarter of the men sent to fight in Europe in 1918 were foreign-born.Mr. Wawro is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cSons of Freedom: The Forgotten American Soldiers Who Defeated Germany in World War I.\u201d A hundred years ago this week, on a bend of the Meuse River in northern France, Gen. John Pershing launched the final major Allied offensive against Germany, an assault that would bring an end to World War I two months later. Without American intervention, the war would have probably ended in a German victory, or sputtered to a stalemate, leaving the Germans in possession of much of France, Belgium and Russia. The victory, though, came at significant cost: In the Meuse-Argonne offensive, as the operation came to be known, the Americans alone suffered some 122,000 casualties, including 29,000 dead. During the offensive, the Germans tried to use the army\u2019s multiethnic background as propaganda. The doughboys, as the American troops were known, were \u201chalf-Americans,\u201d the Germans sneered. Many Americans were as contemptuous of the \u201cmelting pot\u201d as the Germans. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, for example, tried in 1896 to extend the class of \u201cexcluded immigrants\u201d from \u201cpaupers, convicts and diseased persons\u201d to include all \u201cItalians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks and Asiatics\u201d who arrived on our shores and failed a literacy test. Ideally, Lodge wanted citizenship confined to the \u201coriginal race stocks of the 13 colonies.\u201d The others, he averred, were chiefly \u201cslum dwellers, criminals and juvenile delinquents.\u201dAnd so nearly a quarter of draftees in 1918 were foreigners, often recent arrivals. The Army\u2019s 32nd Division, made up of National Guardsmen from Michigan and Wisconsin, was nicknamed the \u201cGem\u00fctlichkeit Division\u201d \u2014 the German word means \u201ccoziness\u201d \u2014 because it included so many German immigrants. Its rosters, one officer remarked, \u201csounded like Hindenburg\u2019s staff.\u201dHow did this \u201chalf-American\u201d army do in World War I?They were splendid. Even though the doughboys spoke 49 different languages, making training and command difficult, the immigrants fought as bravely and desperately as native-born Americans. Germans deployed against the United States 77th Division in the Argonne Forest, hearing the mix of voices from the other trench, assumed that they were fighting Italian troops who had been sent north to reinforce the French. They weren\u2019t Italians; they were Americans, from Little Italy in Manhattan.\u201cNa\u00efve confidence\u201d is as fine a description of what it means to be American as any \u2014 a superiority complex born of transformative, class-blind opportunity: the opportunity sought by the men and women who flooded into America at the turn of the last century, just like those who arrive today and continue to see the military as an avenue for gaining citizenship and respect.Americans wandering in our nation\u2019s World War I cemeteries in France today will be struck by how many of those \u201cforeign slackers\u201d and \u201chalf-Americans\u201d reside there. The unassimilated names on the gravestones \u2014 Ottavio Fiscalini, Aleksandr Skazhkows, Olaf Knutson \u2014 confirm that, through what Senator Lodge called the \u201cunguarded gates of American citizenship,\u201d passed thousands of men ready to die for America.Advertisement"}

In some cases, his supporters have piled on with threats to boycott the companies\u2019 products or services. The stocks of those firms have come under pressure as investors worry that business will suffer.But a look back at months of critical presidential tweets, and their effect on stock prices, suggests that investors are shrugging off Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides. The stocks of targeted companies typically recover, and there is little, if any, discernible harm done to their business.Nike is the latest firm Mr. Trump has singled out. The sportswear company confirmed this week that it had entered into a new marketing deal with Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback. Mr. Kaepernick made headlines in 2016 for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, and has not played in the N.F.L. since the end of that season.Nike may yet suffer. The same people boycotting the N.F.L. because of player protests during the national anthem may shun its products. Companies selling a narrow range of items to consumers are most at risk to a buyers\u2019 strike. But Nike may also benefit. Mr. Trump\u2019s castigations, and Nike\u2019s support of Mr. Kaepernick, may generate higher sales.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms can at times seem to affect the shares of the companies he targets.Even so, the company\u2019s shares have recently rallied and now trade at more or less the same price they did just before the announcement of its production shift.This suggests that investors may have adopted a simple rule: Keep an eye on what the government does, not what the president says.And even if the Trump administration were to threaten more actions against companies, it may not succeed in doing much harm to the firms, or it may simply fail to follow through.Investors may hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets amount to little more than noise, and that the rule of law and other constraints will prevent him from taking actions that could harm corporate profits.Any tweets from the president on this battle could move markets.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Companies Are Pushing for Less Disclosure. Is That Good for Investors?", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchLouis Brandeis, before his nomination to the Supreme Court, observed that \u201csunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.\u201dThe federal securities laws were built around this concept, that more information to investors is the best protection.Ten years after Lehman Brothers\u2019 bankruptcy, corporations are pushing to restrict how much, and how frequently, they must provide information. With a strong economy, low unemployment and the stock market near record highs, executives are striking back at rules they believe hamper their ability to make profits \u2014 even as they make more than ever. The common complaint is that disclosure requirements force companies to focus on the short term at the expense of making investments that may pay off years later.The tweet raises a number of questions. Is less disclosure better for corporate America? If so, are six months the right interval? Could information be released annually, or perhaps just left to the best judgment of corporate managers about what should be disclosed? That is how most private companies, like Uber and Airbnb, are allowed to operate, because they have chosen not to tap the public markets for capital.Jay Clayton, the S.E.C.\u2019s chairman, has asserted that protecting the \u201cMain Street investor\u201d is a key mission for the agency. But the recent thrust of the S.E.C. appears to be moving away from disclosure and toward allowing companies to put out less information to the investing public.In a recent meeting about entrepreneurship, Mr. Clayton said he wanted to make it easier for retail investors to buy shares in private companies, noting that these can be \u201cpretty risky\u201d but that \u201cpeople want that.\u201d Private companies have minimal disclosure obligations, which was one reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, floated the idea of taking his intensely scrutinized company private.Lawsuits against management and directors for failing to fulfill their fiduciary duties, or against a company for making faulty or incomplete disclosures, are the best way for shareholders to police companies. These lawsuits are the bane of corporate management.Does that mean the idea is dead, or is the S.E.C. just waiting for the right company to request dispensation to limit shareholder access to the courts for challenging management? Once the S.E.C. permits arbitration of claims, companies can be expected to jump on board quickly.What is the best protection for shareholders? The S.E.C. does not review whether an investment is a good one, only whether enough information is available to judge the potential risks and rewards. Less disclosure would make that assessment more difficult, and leave investors guessing whether an opportunity is a good one \u2014 or a sinkhole for their money.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Argentina Takes Emergency Steps to Shore Up Peso", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina\u2019s president announced emergency measures on Monday to stem concerns from investors about the country\u2019s solvency as it seeks to tap an international credit line.It was the latest move to ease a growing crisis over a plunging currency, just days after the central bank intervened with a drastic increase in interest rates.In a televised address Monday morning, President Mauricio Macri said he would seek to reduce the government\u2019s budget deficit by imposing a new tax on exports. He also said he would reorganize his cabinet, eliminating around half of the ministries.\u201cWhat we have to face is a basic problem, which is we cannot spend more than we have,\u201d Mr. Macri said. \u201cThis is not just another crisis. It has to be the last.\u201dDespite the announcement, the Argentine peso continued its fall, losing 3 percent against the dollar in thin trading that analysts attributed to the Labor Day holiday in the United States. Stocks in Buenos Aires also fell.\u201cApparently there are still some doubts,\u201d said Sabrina Corujo, head of Portfolio Personal, a local brokerage. \u201cBut it may be a bit early to say outright that the reaction was negative.\u201dMr. Macri acted as officials prepared to head to Washington for negotiations Tuesday with the International Monetary Fund. Argentina is seeking a faster disbursement from a $50 billion standby credit agreement sealed this year.The tax on exports will be crucial in allowing a country to eliminate the fiscal deficit next year with the goal of achieving a surplus in 2020, Economy Minister Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne said.The tax, which will be in effect through 2020, will charge 4 pesos per dollar of exports in primary goods and services and 3 pesos per dollar for all other exports.\u201cThis will reduce the uncertainty surrounding the government\u2019s financing capability,\u201d said Marcos Buscaglia, a founding partner at Alberdi Partners, a local consulting firm. \u201cThe problem is that the additional austerity comes from the side of revenues and not spending.\u201dFausto Spotorno, chief economist at Orlando J. Ferreres & Associates, another consulting firm, said the export taxes \u201conly solve the short-term financial problems\u201d and do not amount to \u201ca replacement for the structural reforms that have not been carried out.\u201dIn addition, export taxes, which had long been criticized by Mr. Macri\u2019s allies, \u201care a bad tax because it alters the productivity of the economy\u201d and involves \u201csacrificing the long term for the short term,\u201d Mr. Spotorno said.Mr. Macri decreased export taxes on agriculture as one of his first measures when he entered office in December 2015 vowing to carry out market-friendly measures that he said would help the country reinsert itself into markets. It was a reversal of more than a decade of heavy state intervention in the economy by former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her husband and predecessor, N\u00e9stor Kirchner.Analysts said the government\u2019s credibility was still in question, particularly after a weekend filled with rumors about possible changes in the president\u2019s cabinet.\u201cThere is still a big question about whether the government will be able to implement a plan of social austerity and whether it will be able to obtain political consensus during an economy that is in a recession,\u201d said Federico Furiase, an economist with Eco Go, a consulting firm. \u201cAs time goes on, the government has fewer and fewer instruments to recover that credibility.\u201dAmong analysts there is still a feeling that the government \u201cis running to catch up\u201d after consistently trying to minimize any sort of economic problems, said Rodrigo \u00c1lvarez, the head of Analytica, another local consulting firm.It is a remarkable change in fortune for a government that was once a darling of the international markets and had won a big vote of confidence from voters in last year\u2019s midterm elections.\u201cAfter two years and a few months, the situation changed, and in large part because of circumstances that were outside our control,\u201d Mr. Macri said, largely blaming the global economy and a severe drought for the country\u2019s troubles.With the prospect of a potentially long recession, there is widespread concern among investors about the political future of Mr. Macri, who acknowledged Monday that the economic turmoil would lead to an increase in poverty.The political consequences of the move are difficult to predict.\u201cArgentina has never carried out an austerity plan of this magnitude before,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trade War Escalates. Stock Markets Shrug. Here\u2019s Why.", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInvestors tuned out the latest escalation in the trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies, with markets around the world climbing slightly as President Trump announced new tariffs on China and Beijing responded in kind.Stock markets in Japan, Germany and South Korea \u2014 where many companies\u2019 fortunes hinge on international trade \u2014 were all up. Even in China, where major equities markets had been down about 20 percent this year, the benchmark index in Shanghai closed almost 2 percent higher.In the United States, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose more than 0.5 percent, as American investors continued to see few signs that companies would be hurt by Chinese attempts to retaliate against Mr. Trump\u2019s confrontational stance on trade. In the latest tit-for-tat, the president said Monday that the United States was imposing tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports, and China responded by saying it was adding tariffs on $60 billion in American goods.Why are markets so sanguine about a trade war that could affect hundreds of billions of dollars in international commerce?One reason is that corporate profits in the United States have been booming \u2014 they were up more than 20 percent in the first two quarters of the year, compared to last year \u2014 thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s tax cuts and a strong domestic economy. That makes an intensifying trade war much less scary.\u201cI think the bottom line is that the earnings have continued to accelerate,\u201d said Marc Pouey, a strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cIf the trade tension were to dissipate, it would help sentiment, but this market is being held up by fundamentals, which are very good.\u201dStock markets in the United States are beating their foreign counterparts. The Nasdaq index is up more than 15 percent this year. The S. & P. 500 is up 8.6 percent, even though the companies in the index generate about 38 percent of their sales outside the United States, according to the market data company FactSet.By contrast, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 is up only about 2.9 percent for the year, and France\u2019s CAC-40 \u2014 one of the best-performing large European stock markets \u2014 had eked out a gain of less than 1 percent.Some sectors of corporate America have lagged. Industrial companies in the S. & P. 500 \u2014 Boeing, Honeywell and 3M among them \u2014 are up only 4.7 percent for the year.Such companies are especially vulnerable to trade disputes. They consume large amounts of products like steel and aluminum, whose prices have jumped because of the administration\u2019s import tariffs. Some of these companies also do lots of business in China, where they may be subject to that country\u2019s tariffs, a general economic slowdown because of the trade war or both.\u201cChina, for sure, is impacting some of these stocks,\u201d said Anik Sen, global head of equities at asset manager PineBridge Investments. \u201cThese are the ones that have actually borne the brunt of this uncertainty.\u201dTariffs could knock 0.7 of a percentage point off China\u2019s annual economic growth, said Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China\u2019s securities regulator. But, he added, the Chinese government has the tools to cushion any impact. Mr. Fang was speaking on Tuesday at a World Economic Forum conference.Some analysts worry that Beijing may retaliate against the United States by weakening the value of China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, relative to the dollar. That would make Chinese products cheaper and more attractive to foreign buyers, potentially blunting the higher costs that American tariffs would impose.The renminbi has weakened by more than 5 percent against the dollar this year, an unusual slide for a currency that does not trade freely and is carefully managed by Beijing. The daily exchange rate is set by the Chinese central bank and trades in a narrow band against the dollar.On Tuesday, the renminbi had lost a little more ground against the dollar.One big question hovering over the markets is whether the trade war has reached a plateau or will escalate further.Mr. Trump has long railed against what he says are China\u2019s unfair trading practices, and even as he announced the latest round of tariffs on Monday, he said he was willing to quickly add levies on an additional $267 billion worth of Chinese imports if Beijing retaliated.Advertisement"}

Rales and Emily Wei Rales worked with the artist to design the room to his specifications. That meant lowered ceilings, special plumbing, placement of the exit signs, consultation with a theatrical lighting specialist and about 70 meetings with the architects.Similarly, Charles Ray spent hours arranging the four sculptures in his gallery down to the inch. And On Kawara \u2014 before he died in 2014 \u2014 was explicit about how he wanted his triptych of Date Paintings, \u201cMoon Landing,\u201d to be exhibited. As a result, it\u2019s the only gallery with a wooden floor.These are the lengths to which the Raleses went in shaping Glenstone as a bespoke temple for artists they have collected in depth over the last 12 years in this affluent exurb of Washington. Works by the likes of Brice Marden, Pipilotti Rist and Roni Horn will now be displayed in a new 204,000-square-foot museum building called the Pavilions, designed by Thomas Phifer. It opens Oct. 4, but the first block of reservations have already been snapped up. The next block becomes available Oct. 1.\u201cThey\u2019re giving birth to a whole new institution,\u201d said the dealer Matthew Marks, who has artists in Glenstone\u2019s collection.In 2006, the Raleses opened a 30,000-square-foot limestone exhibition space on 100 acres, designed by Charles Gwathmey. For years, it was a hidden gem on the grounds of a former hunt club; in its first seven years of operation, only 10,000 people visited.The $200 million expansion adds 11 rooms constructed of stacked concrete blocks that are connected by a glass-walled passage and surround an 18,000-square-foot water court. You can see the family\u2019s home in the distance.In a lengthy recent interview at the new museum, the couple said they had decided to expand so that they could share more of their collection with more people and to entice groups from neighboring schools, where arts education is at risk.The dealer David Zwirner said the Raleses \u201creally want to contextualize what they buy \u2014 where does the work of art fit into the production of an artist?\u201d\u201cWhat this museum means to the United States is more akin to what Getty did, what Hirshhorn did \u2014 it\u2019s at that level,\u201d he continued, referring to J. Paul Getty and Joseph H. Hirshhorn.In an increasingly market-driven art world, artists say they appreciate the Raleses approach. \u201cThese people sought my work out, and they kept coming back,\u201d said Ms. Horn, whose two large solid cast-glass cylinders are on view in the passage along the water court.\u201cI\u2019ve never been a hot artist,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a big number at auction in my life. Others may not have the courage to make the kind of commitment they\u2019ve made.\u201dShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t care if they are getting a tax break.\u201dThe Glenstone addition also has a strong outdoor component, with 130 acres of meadows, woodlands and streams, designed by Adam Greenspan and Peter Walker of PWP Landscape Architecture. Among the sculptures integrated into the landscape are those by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Ellsworth Kelly and Richard Serra. The couple employ a full-time horticulturist to tend to the 24,000 flowers in Jeff Koons\u2019s monumental \u201cSplit-Rocker.\u201dThe expansion includes an environmental center, offering educational programs, that will open in the spring. \u201cWe\u2019re tree-huggers,\u201d Mr. Rales said.In addition to those of Mr. Gober, Mr. Ray and On Kawara, the museum\u2019s nine single-artist installations belong to Martin Puryear, Michael Heizer, Ms. Rist, Lygia Pape, Mr. Marden and Cy Twombly.Installations were painstakingly conceived in collaboration with the artist or the artist\u2019s estate. \u201cWe feel it\u2019s our responsibility to ask them, \u2018How would you like this shown?\u2019\u201d Ms. Rales said.The couple visited Mr. Heizer in the desert and built a rectangular pit at Glenstone for his sculpture of 15 steel beams. They even placed a line of matching raincoats in a closet for those who want to visit the piece in inclement weather.The inaugural exhibition in the Pavilions demonstrates the range of the collection, in a gallery featuring 65 artworks by 52 artists, dating from 1943 to 1989. They include examples of movements including Abstract Expressionism, Gutai, Brazilian modernism, Arte Povera, Minimalism and post-Minimalism.\u201cWe have our wish list, and we\u2019ve been slowly going through it,\u201d Mr. Rales said of their artists, \u201cthose we feel have made real innovations, shifted the way we look at art, changed the definition of art.\u201dThere are household names like Alexander Calder, Willem de Kooning, Agnes Martin and Mark Rothko. But there is also work by Akira Kanayama (Japan), Sergio Camargo (Brazilian) and Alighiero e Boetti (Italy). And there is an abundance of work by women. (The story of Minimalism is told through artists like Jo Baer, Anne Truitt and Agnes Martin, not just Carl Andre and Dan Flavin.)Similarly, the Raleses have hung a just-acquired flag by the artist-activist Faith Ringgold, which includes the N-word, next to one by Jasper Johns. \u201cHistory is always ripe for reinterpretation,\u201d Mr. Rales said.Glenstone has a staff of 130, including 24 young professionals working as guides. The Raleses said they toured about 50 other museums before expanding their own.Mr. Rales has been collecting since 1990. In 2005, he joined forces with Emily Wei, a former director at the Gladstone Gallery in Manhattan. They married in 2008 and have two children, 5 and 8. Their collection now numbers about 1,300 pieces, including sound art, film, video and works on paper.Glenstone aims to admit about 400 people a day, to ensure that visitors can have a contemplative experience. Instagram photos are discouraged indoors, where the space has a naturally lit, Zen-like serenity, with benches for resting designed by Mr. Puryear and meandering paths.Indeed, the collectors said they wanted plenty of breathing room \u2014 no \u201cMona Lisa\u201d crowds or selfie sticks, very little wall text and no stanchions forcing people to keep their distance from the art. The message to visitors is clear. \u201cLook \u2014 really use your eyes,\u201d Ms. Rales said. \u201cAllow that to be your primary experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greek Court Rules for Russia in Fight Over Cybercrime Suspect", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A Greek Supreme Court ruling Tuesday in a computer crime case may return to Russia, rather than extradite to the United States, a potential witness in the investigation into Russian hacking during the 2016 American presidential election.The warrant made no mention of election hacking. But Mr. Vinnik is accused of operating the exchange, BTC-e, at a time when, American prosecutors say, hackers used such funds to finance the electronic break-in at the Democratic National Committee and other targets. The practice was described in an indictment obtained by the special counsel investigating Russian election meddling, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Vinnik has been languishing in a Greek jail cell since July 2017, when the authorities arrested him as he was vacationing in a small beachside village in northern Greece. It was one of a series of American moves against Russians described as cybercriminals as they traveled.In Mr. Vinnik\u2019s case and in two others in Spain and the Czech Republic, the Russian authorities countered with competing extradition requests asserting that the Russians had also committed crimes at home, and that they had not come to light before they left the country.Far-fetched as it may seem, the legal maneuver has worked. And it put European governments in a tug of war between Moscow and Washington over Russians suspected of being computer criminals. Spain and the Czech Republic eventually extradited the suspects to the United States.The American authorities had been pressing Greece to hand over Mr. Vinnik, and Greece initially appeared willing to comply. In October, a three-member panel of judges in the northern city of Thessaloniki backed the American extradition request.But since then, the case has taken on a series of unusual twists.After Mr. Vinnik\u2019s lawyers filed an appeal to the Greek Supreme Court, France also demanded his extradition, claiming he had bilked around 100 French citizens by launching cyberattacks through his Bitcoin platform. In July, the judges in Thessaloniki reversed course and agreed to extradite him to France.That ruling dealt a fresh blow to the tenuous relations between Moscow and Athens, which has long courted Russia as an ally.Earlier that month, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had drawn Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s wrath by expelling two Russian diplomats and refusing entry to two others. He acted after Athens said it had uncovered evidence of a Kremlin-backed campaign to manipulate regional politics.Mr. Tsipras accused Russia of fomenting raucous protest rallies in Greece and Macedonia over a referendum in Macedonia to change the country\u2019s name, which would put it on a path to join NATO. Russia, which vigorously opposes an enlargement of the Western alliance, retaliated by expelling Greek diplomats, and accused Washington of \u201cputting pressure\u201d on Greece.When the Thessaloniki court then refused to hand Mr. Vinnik to Moscow, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry warned it would consider reprisals.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government insisted it wanted to maintain friendly relations. And less than a month later, on July 30, the Thessaloniki court changed course again and accepted Russia\u2019s request that Mr. Vinnik be extradited to Russia.On Tuesday, the Greek Supreme Court issued a preliminary ruling backing the decision. The court is scheduled to issue a final ruling next week. Greece\u2019s justice minister will make the final decision on where Mr. Vinnik will be extradited.In an interview last year, Mr. Vinnik\u2019s Russian lawyer, Timofey S. Musatov, said his client\u2019s case in the United States was unrelated to electoral hacking. Russian prosecutors filed an extradition request on a fraud charge. Mr. Musatov could not be reached for comment Tuesday.In July, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers and revealed details of their operation, including the use of computer servers paid for \u201cusing cryptocurrency.\u201d At the time, Mr. Vinnik\u2019s BTC-e platform was the largest virtual currency exchange in Russia.In the cases in Spain and the Czech Republic, relatives and Russian lawyers said the American authorities were seeking access to the suspects for information about election hacking, though the Department of Justice made no such assertions in indictments.The Department of Justice sought Mr. Nikulin over accusations that in 2012 he hacked three American technology companies: LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring. The allegations against Mr. Levashov related to the spam promotion of penny stocks and pharmaceuticals.Liz Alderman reported from Paris.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sushi and Kaiseki in an Exceptional One-Man Show", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cPeople always say summer is not a good time for sushi,\u201d Derek Wilcox said. \u201cI have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\u201dIn the broad view, having the place to myself was unjust. In the year since Mr. Wilcox took over the restaurant \u2014 at first his work there was termed a residency or pop-up, but in June the owner, Idan Elkon, announced that he\u2019d put a ring on it and made the arrangement permanent \u2014 he has firmly placed it in the top tier of the city\u2019s Japanese restaurants. On the basis of sushi alone, Shoji has few plausible rivals, and for sushi embedded within a longer, kaiseki-derived menu, it has no parallel. There should be no empty seats, no matter how many New Yorkers are off lolling at the beach.Taking a selfish view, though, I wasn\u2019t particularly unhappy to be the only customer. Mr. Wilcox, who grew up in Virginia, cooked at a kaiseki restaurant in Kyoto called Kikunoi for seven years and then spent three more at a traditionalist sushi parlor in the Ginza district of Tokyo. You might think of this as the equivalent of earning a master\u2019s degree followed by a Ph.D. in Japanese cuisine, and one side benefit of a meal across the counter from Mr. Wilcox is the chance to hear what he learned studying abroad.Show some curiosity and you could get a short education in the mineral-rich clay used by potters in the town of Shigaraki, or the various aliases and false names under which a particularly delicious, pink-fleshed fish known as akamutsu in Japan travels under when it is away from home. On this August night, I was about to get a two-hour schooling on the pleasures of summer sushi.Mr. Wilcox\u2019s opening move was a squiggle of what looked like short, thick noodles and turned out to be lengths of chilled eggplant; Mr. Wilcox had given them a cool bath in the light sauce in which icy coils of somen noodles are dipped in summer. Laid over the top were two tongues of bafun sea urchin, a species with the color of a nearly ripe persimmon. With one dish, he had shooed away the heat outside, shown off the uncanny harmony of urchin and eggplant, and introduced a minor theme of the night, the summer urchin harvest in Japan.This overture out of the way, Mr. Wilcox lifted what appeared to be a machete. This was a hamo knife, a heavy swath of sharp steel that can reduce the daggertooth pike conger\u2019s dozens of tiny bones to edible smithereens; before the first one was forged in the 19th century, he explained, the eel had to be fully cooked and separated from its skeleton. This hamo would be quickly scorched on one side and served with a lick of wasabi and pur\u00e9ed salt-cured plums thinned with dashi.Sashimi came next in the form of shioko, or kanpachi caught when it is young and its flavor is leaner and softer than it will get later in the year. This was followed by a local fish that in the spring Mr. Wilcox had told me he didn\u2019t like, striped bass. He had been working with it, though, salting it overnight and then grilling it until the skin crackled. Now I don\u2019t want striped bass cooked any other way. After this was Mr. Wilcox\u2019s nod to the kaiseki tradition known as takiawase, a plate of simmered vegetables and, in this case, seafood: a small potato, some Japanese eggplant, a crisp pink ginger shoot and the most flavorful piece of octopus I have ever put in my mouth.After my first meal at Shoji I learned to hope that chawan mushi, a bowl of steaming-hot tofu custard, was on the menu. In spring Mr. Wilcox made it with spot prawns, but tonight, in homage to clambake season, he was serving lobster chawan mushi.To this point, the menu had faithfully followed kaiseki\u2019s ritualized sequence of courses and its stopwatch-precise attention to seasonality. It was about to veer in a different direction, but it was enough to suggest that Mr. Wilcox could open a kaiseki restaurant that would set a new standard in the city. I\u2019m not sure the city would support it, but it would be spectacular while it lasted.While in Japan, Mr. Wilcox learned to make fresh ikura from sacs of salmon roe, a slow process that requires massaging the eggs apart by hand in many changes of water. Normally the roe is then heavily cured with sugar and salt, but the roe he was serving last month was very lightly seasoned before being spooned into a shot glass and served as is \u2014 sticky, fatty, sweet and fresh.After the last piece of fish, the kaiseki format kicks in again with a soup, which may be as simple as a classic bowl of miso or may break with tradition, like the extraordinary corn soup I ate in August. There will be something cold and refreshing, maybe a granita made from ginger or matcha, and finally a more substantial dessert. Sometimes this is a sort of tart with seasonal fruit \u2014 candied kumquats, maybe, or white peaches and blueberries \u2014 arranged in a mochi wafer called monaka.For all this the charge is $252, service included. A shorter menu is available at $190, or a longer one at $295, again with service included. That service is somewhat minimal; lately it has meant a single employee assiduously refilling water glasses and taking orders from a drinks list whose cheapest item is a $12 bottle of beer.Could my server have been more adept at deciphering the wines, sakes, shochus and Haitian rums Mr. Elkon and Mr. Wilcox have put together? Perhaps, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily want the scene cluttered by a sommelier in full pocket-square-and-cuff-links regalia. More employees hovering at the counter might take away from the bond Mr. Wilcox builds with the people he feeds.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Tariff and Trade Disputes Are More Than a Money Problem", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThat may sound hyperbolic. But two Yale law professors, Oona A. Hathaway and Scott J. Shapiro, make a persuasive case that the world could become a far more dangerous place if the Trump administration seriously disrupts the global consensus that has been in place for decades.\u201cImperfect as it may be, the world operates under the understanding that war is illegal and trade sanctions are a legal method of punishing aggressive behavior,\u201d Professor Shapiro said. \u201cBut sanctions only work with a healthy regime of international trade, and under the rule of international law. That is all coming into question now.\u201dThe Chinese authorities quickly retaliated with new levies on $60 billion in American products. And the United States also has trade disputes brewing with several allies. The costs for consumers, businesses and the world economy are being closely tallied.But the two scholars say the administration\u2019s aggressive approach could have a much higher cost: It could unravel a complex series of rules and agreements that have served to moderate the behavior of great powers like the United States, China, the Soviet Union and, now, Russia.In a provocative book, \u201cThe Internationalists: How a Radical Plan to Outlaw War Remade the World\u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2017), they provide a history of international law. They say the relative prosperity and peace of the post-World War II world owes a great deal to a now-obscure international treaty \u2014 the Kellogg-Briand Pact.At stake are even bigger issues, the professors say.Consider, Professor Hathaway said, what kind of a world we could be re-entering, if the Trump administration\u2019s escalation of its conflicts with other nations were to shred the current international consensus.\u201cSome pivotal principles are at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cRecall that punishing aggressive behavior through trade sanctions was illegal before the treaty in 1928, and acquiring territory through war was legal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in 1928, and with the rules that gradually developed, that was reversed.\u201dShe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that if you disrupt the world trading system \u2014 and the consensus outlawing war that is in place today \u2014 you are disrupting the financial means of punishing violations of war. In the end, you may be left with nothing but reliance on force.\u201dWithout robust trade, she said, geopolitical disputes over such issues as dominion over the South China Sea could flare more easily into military confrontations between great powers. Mutually beneficial commerce \u2014 and the need to abide by the international rules that make it possible \u2014 have successfully moderated the behavior of sovereign states.That has been the explicit aim of a succession of United States presidents, starting with Richard M. Nixon, who sought to give China \u2014 formerly an isolated Communist giant \u2014 a stake in the world economy and in the American-dominated global economic and political system put in place in the aftermath of World War II.This has never been entirely smooth. Disagreements over the terms of trade and the structure of the Chinese economy have rankled Americans since the early 1980s, when China entered the modern world economy. But given their political and economic differences, China and the United States have had a remarkably calm relationship until now.Strong, respectful negotiating to improve the relative standing of the United States is entirely appropriate, Professor Shapiro said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would defend the current system as being perfect. Far from it. But there\u2019s a difference between trying to reform the system from within, and blowing it up, which is what seems to be happening.\u201dFor example, he said, the day-to-day rules and arbitration procedures of the World Trade Organization don\u2019t usually attract much attention, but they are crucial if trade is to proceed smoothly \u2014 and peacefully \u2014 around the world.In a remarkable turnabout, he threatened to use economic sanctions \u2014 which became a prime tool for enforcing international law as a result of the Kellogg-Briand Pact \u2014 as weapons to deter the court\u2019s judges from enforcing international law, Professor Hathaway said.Furthermore, Mr. Bolton has in the past condemned the W.T.O. as well, generally advocating a unilateral approach by the United States and an end to the decision-making process enshrined in the organization.Under the circumstances, boring, negotiated resolutions to the current trade disputes would be a happy ending, Professor Hathaway said. What the world may face instead, is the dismal prospect of conflict without the rules or means for resolving it peacefully. The United States would remain a powerful player in that world, but it would be playing a much more dangerous game.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

But Mr. Erdogan, who is widely seen as trying to influence the independent central bank, has signaled an unwillingness to allow even modest rate increases or curb government spending that has fueled a popular growth boom \u2014 as well as runaway prices.Hours before the central bank made its announcement, Mr. Erdogan said he valued the bank\u2019s independence, before immediately taking another swipe at it. Speaking to the Confederation of Turkish Tradesmen in Ankara, he slammed interest rates as a \u201ctool of exploitation,\u201d adding: \u201cI say, let\u2019s drop these high interest rates. Interest is the cause, inflation is the result.\u201dMr. Erdogan also signed a decree Thursday effectively imposing a ban on conducting business in Turkey using euros or dollars.In a statement announcing its move, the Turkish central bank said there were \u201cupside risks\u201d to inflation, despite \u201cweaker domestic demand conditions.\u201d It added that, as a result, it had \u201cdecided to implement a strong monetary tightening to support price stability.\u201dFor nearly two decades, Turkey had uninterrupted growth that helped reduce poverty, increase the ranks of the middle class and, until recently, turned the nation into a darling of international investors.But the growth was built chiefly on a construction boom fed by cheap credit and an avalanche of government spending that Mr. Erdogan poured into the economy to stimulate even more activity. That success story has become increasingly unsustainable.On the ground, the plunge in the lira has had an impact on daily life in a litany of ways, affecting even the availability of pharmaceutical supplies. Major drug wholesalers in Turkey are running low on stocks, and soon many antibiotics, as well as drugs for oncology, as well as cardiovascular and neurological ailments, will fall out of date, according to Vedat Bulut, the president of the Ankara Chamber of Pharmacists.\u201cHundreds of thousands of people will be affected,\u201d Mr. Bulut said. \u201cEspecially for cancer patients, a delay of even a few days in treatment may cause metastasis.\u201dThe lira has since recovered many of its losses. At its weakest, in mid-August, 7.2 lira were required to buy one dollar, but at one point on Thursday the Turkish currency had strengthened to 6 against the dollar.While Turkey remains a relatively minor economy in the global context \u2014 its annual output is about the same as that of a country like the Netherlands \u2014 several European banks have investments or subsidiaries there. That exposes the region to risks emanating from Turkey, even as the European Union grapples with its own challenges, including a trade dispute with the United States and concerns over slowing economic growth.Matt Phillips and Amie Tsang contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Chicken Droppings and Airplanes. There\u2019s a Connection.", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeople don\u2019t think of Perdue Farms, the country\u2019s fourth-largest poultry producer, as a fertilizer company, but chicken droppings are perhaps the most valuable of manures for enhancing soil. High in nitrogen and phosphorus, they are prized by farmers, whose soil is often short of those nutrients.The qualities that have turned \u201clitter,\u201d the polite name for the mix of guano, wood chips and other matter that\u2019s periodically swept out of chicken houses, into a big business also make it a potent pollutant, contributing to algal bloom and other pollution in streams, rivers, ponds and lakes.So Perdue has started turning litter, sludge and waste from its hatcheries and production lines into a rich compost that\u2019s sold by lawn and garden companies.\u201cThe reduction in our carbon footprint as a result has been substantial,\u201d said Steve Levitsky, vice president of sustainability at Perdue. \u201cProduction of compost has reduced our carbon footprint by about 7,000 tons a year.\u201dPerdue is just one of hundreds of large corporations taking steps to mitigate their impact on the environment. Propelled by regulation, investors and consumers, businesses are overhauling their operations in ways that reduce their contribution to climate change.\u201cAddressing climate change can help you find savings, stimulates innovation and puts you in the vanguard, which is good for business no matter what business you\u2019re in,\u201d said Paula DiPerna, global adviser to CDP, an international nonprofit group (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) that works with institutional investors to push companies and governments to disclose and manage their environmental impact.CDP asks companies to file an \u201cenvironmental disclosure,\u201d and last year about 6,300 companies complied, up from roughly 80 when the organization was started in 2003, giving the organization perhaps the largest collection of data on how business is working to reduce its impact on climate change. \u201cWhen we started, 20 enlightened, mostly European investor signatories signed onto our disclosure request,\u201d Ms. DiPerna said. \u201cToday, we have more than 700 signatories.\u201dMr. Goldstein was a founder of Imprint Capital, an asset management firm devoted to what is known as \u201cimpact investing,\u201d or investing in companies that promise to deliver social and environmental results in addition to financial returns. Imprint was bought by Goldman Sachs in 2015, when it had about $550 million under management.A year later, it was managing $6 billion, and today more than $15 billion is devoted to investing in such double- and triple-bottom line companies. \u201cSovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, pension funds, large family offices \u2014 the volume of demand is pretty remarkable, even for Goldman,\u201d he said.Goldman Sachs has built assessment of corporate efforts to improve social and environmental impact into its own investment decisions, using it to, say, determine how long to hold a particular bond or whether a real estate investment makes sense.\u201cIt\u2019s not that the steps companies are taking to improve sustainability are magic,\u201d Mr. Goldstein said. \u201cYou don\u2019t sprinkle pixie dust and suddenly see a company outperform. But it does help you better manage risk and reward over time.\u201dAirbus has enlisted nature for ideas, creating innovations from its study of birds and fish. The funny-looking bend at the end of many airplane wing tips? \u201cAlbatross and other sorts of birds have high aspect ratios (a measure of aerodynamic efficiency) with wing shapes that curve up at the tips,\u201d said Simon Galpin, head of aerodynamics at Airbus.That modification reduces fuel use by about 3.5 percent, Mr. Galpin said. The study of birds is also responsible for an improvement in the wing flap on the Airbus A350 that changes the wing shape, enhancing aerodynamics and redistributing the weight of the plane, making it more environmentally friendly.The company is also studying how water flows over the skin of fish to reduce the drag created during acceleration. \u201cIf you look at dolphins or sharks, their skin is not perfectly smooth, there\u2019s a little roughness to it,\u201d said Norman Wood, aerodynamics expert at Airbus. \u201cThat controls water flow just above the skin\u2019s surface, reducing drag.\u201dIn the case of an airplane, such a modification would reduce carbon emissions. But applying the principle commercially has its issues. \u201cA brand-new aircraft is beautiful, shiny and sleek,\u201d Mr. Wood said. \u201cRiblets would have a tendency to collect dirt and make the aircraft look tarnished quite quickly, which would perhaps mean more cleaning and more cost.\u201d Nonetheless, another airline is trying riblets out to help Airbus collect real-time data on how the innovation functions.Perdue confronted similar challenges when it began considering ways to reduce the impact of chicken manure. When it started tackling the issue in the early 2000s, it put litter through a heat process to make pellets, using some of the same equipment for making feed.That process, which involved natural gas to heat the litter and electricity to run the mill, cost the company more than it could charge for the pellets. \u201cI spent innumerable hours up there to make it efficient enough to get the cost down,\u201d said Wayne Hudson, vice president at Perdue\u2019s agribusiness arm.The company hit upon composting a couple of years ago at the same site where it had been making pellets. Composting had the additional benefit of giving the company a use for its sludge, which it typically pumped into the ground.The company also has begun capturing methane generated in anaerobic lagoons where solids from its processing plants end up. Perdue burns the methane to make electricity for its plants.By 2020, the company aims to reduce its carbon footprint by 30 percent and its water use by 25 percent, and divert 90 percent of its waste from landfills. Jim Perdue, its chairman, hopes those efforts will reduce costs and even generate new profit streams, though he\u2019s not counting on the latter \u2014 the fertilizer-cum-composting operation has cost $80 million over 18 years.Rather, the company, which is privately held and faces no pressure from public shareholders, has taken steps to reduce its environmental impact to get ahead of possible regulation or simply because they made sense for its business. \u201cIt\u2019s not really about making a profit,\u201d Mr. Perdue said. \u201cSure, we\u2019d like that, but it\u2019s really about positioning our company for the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Smorgasbord Recession? (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next slump may have multiple causes.Opinion ColumnistThe thing is, there\u2019s nothing out there as obvious as the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, or even the tech bubble of the late 1990s. So here\u2019s my thought: maybe the next recession won\u2019t be caused by one big shock but instead by the combined impact of several smaller shocks. There are arguably several mid-sized bubbles out there, from private equity debt to emerging markets. Stocks are priced as if there\u2019s no risk despite omens of trade war, consumer confidence similarly seems to discount dangers. There\u2019s probably other stuff I\u2019m missing.The point, anyway, is that we might be looking at a smorgasbord recession, one that involves a mix of smallish things rather than a single dominant item. And there\u2019s a model for that kind of recession: the slump of the early 1990s.Most modern recessions have had clear narratives, at least after the fact. The 79-82 double dip was about the Fed tightening to bring inflation down; 2001 was about the tech bubble; 2007-2009 about the housing bust and the financial crisis it triggered. But I\u2019ve been reading various accounts of 1990-91, and they\u2019re kind of amorphous.One piece was a boom and bust in commercial real estate, partly connected with the savings-and-loan crisis and aftermath, which led to a sharp drop in nonresidential construction:Another piece was a drop in consumer confidence, brought on by oil price hikes and Gulf War jitters:Yet another piece was the post-Cold War drawdown in defense spending:So, no one overarching narrative, but the combination was enough to cause a recession. It was a fairly brief, shallow recession compared with the big slumps of 79-82 and 2007-9:But recovery was sluggish and for a long time jobless, with unemployment continuing to rise long after the official end of the recession:So here\u2019s my hypothesis: the next slump won\u2019t be a big bang like 2008, it will be a smorgasbord recession like 1990-1, the cumulation of a bunch of medium-sized issues.You might ask why multiple issues should strike at the same time. The answer, in two words, is Hyman Minsky: after a long period of stable growth, lenders and investors get complacent, and the private sector overreaches.And we\u2019re likely to have a big problem with the zero lower bound. The Fed cut rates by around 5 percentage points in the face of the 1990 recession, and still got a jobless recovery:This time around the Fed doesn\u2019t have 5 percentage points to cut \u2014 it only has 2. And no, that\u2019s not a reason to raise rates faster, to make room for later cuts; it\u2019s a reason to not raise rates until inflation is significantly higher, and hope that we\u2019ve gotten to 3 or 4 percent before the smorgasbord attacks.So those are my current thoughts on the next recession. When will it happen? (Looks at watch.) Actually, I have no idea. But it would be really strange if it doesn\u2019t happen within a few years at most.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lean Times for Reinsurers Could Trigger a Wave of M.&A.", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsReinsurers are facing a perfect storm of higher losses and lower margins. The answer is likely to be a wave of deal making.Insurers are still recovering from the worst year on record for catastrophe losses. In 2017, hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as other natural perils, caused $135 billion of damage globally, according to the reinsurance company Munich Re.Hurricane Florence, which has caused flooding in North and South Carolina, is expected to cost a further $20 billion this year. It comes after wildfires across the globe, and alongside Typhoon Mangkhut in Asia. Global warming may mean higher losses are here to stay. Losses have been nearly double the 10-year average in two of the last seven years, according to the professional services firm Aon.In the past, a surge of claims led to higher prices: losses forced weaker players to cut risk; stronger or lucky ones jacked up premium rates. But premiums rose by somewhere between 0 percent and 5 percent in 2018. The credit rating agency Fitch expects a similar level of increase in 2019.The problem is that new investors, like hedge funds, are increasingly underwriting catastrophe risk as an alternative to stocks and bonds. They are unlikely to go away, barring a more severe catastrophe. Analysts at the Royal Bank of Canada believe that losses would need to exceed $100 billion this year to push up rates.That leaves reinsurers facing a period of lean years. On average they can now expect a 30 percent operating margin from underwriting catastrophe risk, which is nearly half the level of five years ago, according to the Royal Bank of Canada.Mergers may help weather the storm. Larger reinsurers can spread risk across a broader range of businesses, as well as investing more in hot new areas like cyber security. Barclays analysts predict that any reinsurer with a market capitalization of less than $10 billion will need to bulk up. The insurance company Argo Group, for example, recently tried to buy Aspen Insurance but was beaten by the private equity company Apollo Global Management.With disasters on the increase, reinsurers will need to seek safety in numbers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Reliving Wall Street\u2019s Near-Death Experience", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTen years ago today, the C.E.O.s of Wall Street\u2019s banks were huddled at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a mad scramble to save the financial industry and the economy. They were playing out arguably the most consequential period in modern economic history.We\u2019ve spent the last decade debating the crisis. Could Lehman Brothers have been saved? Were bank bailouts the best way to protect Wall Street? Could the government have helped ordinary individuals more directly? Did the response widen inequality? Did the crisis create today\u2019s populist politics? And, perhaps most important, are we any safer today?My colleagues and I have put together a brief recap of key moments of the crisis, from that meeting at the Fed to the government\u2019s rescue of Wall Street. At the end, I\u2019ll be back with a little analysis and some highlights from an interview I conducted yesterday in Washington with Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner, who all played instrumental roles during the turmoil.For many of us, it is painful to relive those moments. But they are instructive if we hope to avoid another crisis.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinThat day, Dick Fuld, Lehman\u2019s C.E.O., seemed hopeful. He told Ken Lewis, his counterpart at Bank of America:\u201cYou and I both know we\u2019re doing this deal.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send us a message!\u201dA little after 4 p.m., the heads of Wall Street\u2019s top banks were told to attend the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by 6 p.m. There, Mr. Paulson told the executives:\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be government money. You\u2019re going to have to figure this out.\u201d\u201cI am not here to sell Merrill Lynch,\u201d Mr. Thain said. Mr. Lewis responded, \u201cWell, that is what I want.\u201dAfter a long day at the New York Fed, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase retired to his bank\u2019s executive dining room, where he told staff that disaster loomed:\u201cSo you might as well enjoy the champagne and caviar!\u201d\u201cHow many of you would kick in $1 billion \u2014 I don\u2019t care what form it takes \u2014 to stop Lehman from going down?\u201dOne by one, they raised their hands. Lehman executives rejoiced. But by 11 a.m., British regulators had quashed the idea of a Barclays-led deal without government assistance. Mr. Paulson told colleagues that his British counterpart didn\u2019t want to \u201cimport our cancer,\u201d and urged Mr. Thain to hurry up and save Merrill:\u201cIf you don\u2019t find a buyer by this weekend, heaven help you and heaven help our country.\u201dLate that afternoon, Bank of America cut a $50 billion deal to buy Merrill. By 10 p.m., it was approved. At close to midnight, Lehman\u2019s board voted to file for bankruptcy. Mr. Fuld told the room:\u201cWell, I guess this is goodbye.\u201dRead more:\u201cIf they default, you\u2019ll see default probabilities explode on all financial firms.\u201d\u201cI slammed the phone more than a few times on discussing A.I.G. I understand why the American people are angry.\u201d\u201cOne by one, all of my safe havens aren\u2019t so safe anymore, and that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201dThe chaos typified by Lehman\u2019s collapse spread far beyond America\u2019s shores. Here were some of the biggest impacts around the world:What saved America\u2019s financial system in 2008? A government bailout of big banks \u2014 using $700 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP \u2014 was key. But the authorities had to deploy several bazookas.\u201cThis is a huge cow patty with a piece of marshmallow stuck in the middle of it, and I am not going to eat that cow patty.\u201dLawmakers disliked the bill because it gave the executive branch sweeping authority. In his autobiography, Mr. Geithner was unapologetic:\u201cWe don\u2019t expect Congress to micromanage battle plans during wars, and I felt the same way about financial wars.\u201dThe bill finally passed on Oct. 3, with tax breaks and other provisions added. But markets continued to crater. The government had to put TARP funds to use with maximum impact, and quickly.Should the government have required more from the banks? That\u2019s still debated. Tony Fratto, a press officer in the White House at the time, said in an interview this week:\u201cIt was like coming up with the design for a plane as you fly it, and then flying that plane in stormy conditions.\u201d\u201cI care about Wall Street for one reason and one reason only \u2014 because what happens on Wall Street matters to Main Street.\u201dThe worst financial crisis in 80 years had its roots in low interest rates, lax oversight and complacency on Wall Street. Debt issuance and risk-taking had surged. Wall Street gobbled up loans from risky borrowers and repackaged them into complex financial products, inflating one of history\u2019s largest credit bubbles.The Fed rode to Bear\u2019s rescue anyway, fearing that the collapse of a major investment bank would cause panic in the markets and wreak havoc with the wider economy. Fed officials knew that they were doing a bad thing, but believed that the alternative would be even worse.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a bazooka, and people know you\u2019ve got it, you may not have to take it out.\u201d\u201cThis turmoil would directly and negatively impact household wealth: from family budgets, to home values, to savings for college and retirement. A failure would affect the ability of Americans to get home loans, auto loans and other consumer credit and business finance. And a failure would be harmful to economic growth and job creation.\u201dFannie and Freddie remain under government control.Read more:The tactics the men chose can be second-guessed, but the result of their efforts speaks for itself. The expansion has lasted nine years, the second longest on record. Although job gains were disappointingly slow for years, the unemployment rate is now 3.9 percent, among the lowest in decades.And then:The response to the crisis was in many ways the high-water mark for a mold of centrist, technocratic policymaking that seeks to tweak and nudge existing institutions toward better outcomes. It also undermined any widespread popular support for that mode of governing for the foreseeable future.When I spoke to Mr. Paulson, Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Geithner yesterday at a symposium in Washington, they said the one thing they wished they had done better was communicating their strategy to the public.\u201cIt was very hard to explain that we had go to the source to stop the bleeding. Otherwise it was going to kill the economy,\u201d Mr. Paulson told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard case to make, and we were unable to make it.\u201dMr. Geithner recounted conversations with his wife. \u201cThe hardest thing was sitting at the table with my wife in the morning with her reading about what I was doing, and just seeing on her face the mix of despair and doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe she felt that we were ethical people trying to do the right thing, but she looked at what we did and said \u2018Really?\u2019 \u201dThe big question that remains is: Are we any safer today?

But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.Another factor: Under Nike\u2019s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can\u2019t sell league-branded merchandise after 2020.

{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Whales Love Bunker. So Do Fishing Boats. Conflict Ensues.", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a sightseeing boat out of the Rockaways the other day, the guide directed the passengers\u2019 attention to the little gray flecks churning on the surface of the ocean.\u201cSee all those snaps in the water?\u201d Paul Sieswerda said over the loudspeaker. \u201cThat\u2019s the bunker. We\u2019re going over a patch 50 or 60 feet thick with them.\u201dThere was something else in the water, too: A humpback whale, which arced its massive body and opened its leviathan mouth. Dozens of silver-gold bunker fish leapt out of the water. Hundreds more disappeared down the whale\u2019s gullet. The passengers on the whale-watch boat the American Princess let out a collective Oooh!It has been a bountiful summer for bunker in the waters off New York, and for local whale spotters. Bunker, a favorite food of many larger predators, including whales, are enjoying another year in a decade-long recovery.On Aug. 30, a boat from Omega Protein lowered a net nearly six city blocks long into the water, about 25 miles southeast of the Rockaways, and pulled up about 800,000 pounds of bunker, also known as menhaden. On Sept. 6, Omega returned to the vicinity and hauled out nearly 2 million pounds more.The catches, in federal waters outside the three-mile state line, are perfectly legal. Omega, which grinds and refines the oily, bony fish into pet food and fish-oil capsules and employs 125 fishermen, is authorized to harvest about 500 million menhaden (or about 340 million pounds) this year \u2014 over 70 percent of the total menhaden catch, according to quotas set by regulators.That does not mean they are welcome.Tom Paladino, a former charter fishing boat captain who started running whale watches from the American Princess in 2010 as local whale sightings began to grow, did not mince words. \u201cWe have a major issue with a fishing fleet coming in and taking all the food from the whales,\u201d he told his passengers.Omega says it is doing nothing of the sort and is removing only a tiny fraction of the local menhaden that its spotter pilots have estimated to be in the tens of millions. \u201cThe best science shows that this is a completely sustainable fishery and the whale diet is not being impacted at all,\u201d said an Omega spokesman, Ben Landry.At the local level, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation is not concerned, either. \u201cThere\u2019s not been any alarm bells about them coming up here,\u201d James Gilmore, the director of D.E.C.\u2019s marine resources division, said of the Omega Protein boats.But some scientists point out that there is very little local data on menhaden populations, in part because the fish migrate widely; there is simply no way of knowing if industrial fishing in the New York Bight, as these waters are known, could send the whales further to sea in search of food.And the conservation department itself says that the connection between menhaden stocks and whale abundance is not understood. \u201cD.E.C. has observed an increased humpback whale population in New York waters feeding on menhaden,\u201d the department said in a statement, \u201cbut D.E.C. cannot speculate as to the overall causes of the whale population increase.\u201dFor a fish that humans have generally considered inedible, menhaden, which grows to about a foot long, has generated much human passion. It is eaten in great numbers by fish that humans do love to catch and eat \u2014 striped bass and bluefish, among others. And since olden days, a battle has raged between menhaden fishermen and fans of menhaden\u2019s marine predators.The reelmen\u2019s charge was answered by a menhaden fisherman named Capt. J.W. Hawkins. \u201cCaptain Hawkins admitted that great opposition to the menhaden fishermen existed along the coast,\u201d The Times wrote, \u201cbut he added that the notion of the matter was extremely erroneous and due to ignorance.\u201dMany conservationists expect that the new approach, which will take several years to research and implement, will lead to lower catch limits for menhaden, though Mr. Sieswerda of Gotham Whale worried that by the time that happened, New York\u2019s menhaden stocks could be \u201cdecimated.\u201dNonsense, said Mr. Landry, the Omega Protein spokesman.\u201cThere appears to be a Chicken Little going on in New York right now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Shaken by a Departure and What Elon Musk Was Smoking", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor a moment, it looked as if Elon Musk and Tesla had put a summer of turbulence behind them. The moment was very brief.The developments, which brought new scrutiny of Mr. Musk\u2019s behavior and managerial fitness, rattled investors who have lately endured many challenges to their faith. Tesla shares ended the day off 6 percent and are at their lowest level since April. But while the decline was sharp, it was not sudden.\u201cThe level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations,\u201d Mr. Morton said in a statement included in the filing. \u201cAs a result, this caused me to reconsider my future.\u201dHe went on to say, \u201cI want to be clear that I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla\u2019s leadership or its financial reporting.\u201dAfter the company dropped its pursuit of a stock buyout, it seemed ready to focus on its strategic goals: production of the crucial Model 3 sedan and a push to deliver profits. But analysts said the sudden exit of Mr. Morton \u2014 the latest in a growing exodus of top Tesla executives \u2014 prompted new questions about the company.\u201cLosing a chief accounting officer so quickly at a time when the company\u2019s finances are under pressure does not give good optics,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, an automotive analyst at Gartner. \u201cIt gives the implication that the executive was uncomfortable with the situation or with putting his name on something.\u201dThere is no question that Tesla\u2019s culture is different from that of conventional automakers or even other Silicon Valley companies \u2014 like the data storage company Seagate, Mr. Morton\u2019s last employer. That is largely by Mr. Musk\u2019s design, and certainly reflects his outsize presence. His web appearance late Thursday was the latest evidence.He was the guest of the comedian Joe Rogan, an advocate for legalizing marijuana, and the repartee included an exchange over what Mr. Musk was smoking.\u201cIs that a joint, or is it a cigar?\u201d Mr. Musk asked after his host took out a large joint and lit it up.\u201cIt\u2019s marijuana inside of tobacco,\u201d Mr. Rogan replied, and he asked if Mr. Musk had ever had it.\u201cYeah, I think I tried one once,\u201d he replied, laughing.The comedian then asked if smoking on air would cause issues with stockholders, to which Mr. Musk responded, \u201cIt\u2019s legal, right?\u201d He then proceeded to take a puff. Marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use in California, where the interview was recorded.After Mr. Musk announced on Aug. 7 that he intended to take Tesla private at $420 a share, there was speculation that the figure was chosen because \u201c420\u201d is a code for marijuana in the drug subculture.\u201cIt seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was not on weed, to be clear. Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u2019s a reason for the word \u2018stoned.\u2019 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u201dEven though the plan to go private has been set aside, its repercussions continue. The San Francisco office of the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet about having \u201cfunding secured\u201d \u2014 a proposition that proved dubious \u2014 as well as broader issues surrounding company disclosures about production goals with the midsize Model 3, which Tesla is counting on to drive up revenue and stabilize its finances. Shareholder lawsuits are also cropping up.After declaring aggressive output goals for the new model, Tesla has struggled for the last 12 months to smooth out glitches and bottlenecks in its assembly process. Mr. Musk has vowed that Tesla will report profits in both the third and fourth quarters, a forecast based on production of 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week.Analysts think the company has been averaging close to 4,000 cars a week or fewer since then.And investors have remained on edge as the stock declines \u2014 it closed Friday at $263.24 \u2014 and Mr. Musk continues to draw attention away from strategic priorities, often through impulsive outbursts on Twitter.\u201cIt\u2019s time for Tesla and Elon Musk to grow up,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader. \u201cThe company has problems, and it seems the board and investors need to start speaking up about how the company is being run. Maybe behaving like that is cool to some people, but doing it while running the company with other people\u2019s money is really not cool.\u201dA company spokesman, Dave Arnold, had no comment.Mr. Musk has made Tesla\u2019s brand inseparable from his own image. He is not only chief executive of the 15-year-old company but also its chairman and largest shareholder. Now that Tesla is remaining a public company, it will be up to its board to determine if and how his role might change.If he is feeling any insecurity, it was not reflected in his webcast with Mr. Rogan. He appeared at ease, sipping whiskey, and spoke, at one point, about artificial intelligence and how it could not be controlled.\u201cYou kind of have to be optimistic about the future,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in being pessimistic. I\u2019d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right.\u201dCeylan Yeginsu and Matthew Goldstein contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Measuring the Economy All Wrong", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe official statistics say that the financial crisis is behind us. It's not.Opinion ColumnistTen years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the official economic statistics \u2014 the ones that fill news stories, television shows and presidential tweets \u2014 say that the American economy is fully recovered.Look around, and you can see the lingering effects of the financial crisis just about everywhere \u2014 everywhere, that is, except in the most commonly cited economic statistics. So who are you going to believe: those statistics, or your own eyes?[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]Over the course of history, financial crises \u2014 and the long downturns that follow \u2014 have reordered American society in all sorts of ways. One of those ways happens to involve the statistics that the government collects. Crises have often highlighted the need for new measures of human well-being.Almost a century later, it is time for a new set of statistics. It\u2019s time for measures that do a better job of capturing the realities of modern American life.As a technical matter, the current batch of official numbers are perfectly accurate. They also describe some real and important aspects of the American economy. The trouble is that a handful of statistics dominate the public conversation about the economy despite the fact that they provide a misleading portrait of people\u2019s lives. Even worse, the statistics have become more misleading over time.The stock market, for example, has completely recovered from the financial crisis, and then some. Stocks are now worth almost 60 percent more than when the crisis began in 2007, according to a inflation-adjusted measure from Moody\u2019s Analytics. But wealthy households own the bulk of stocks. Most Americans are much more dependent on their houses. That\u2019s why the net worth of the median household is still about 20 percent lower than it was in early 2007. When television commentators drone on about the Dow, they\u2019re not talking about a good measure of most people\u2019s wealth.All the while, the federal government and much of the news media continue to act as if the same economic measures that made sense decades ago still make sense today. Habit comes before accuracy.And there is no reason that data reform needs to be limited to G.D.P. The Labor Department could change the monthly jobs report to give more attention to other unemployment numbers. It could also provide more data on wages, rather than only broad averages. The Federal Reserve, for its part, could publish quarterly estimates of household wealth by economic class.\u201cAs someone who advises policymakers, I can tell you there is often this shock: \u2018The economy is growing. Why aren\u2019t people feeling it,\u2019\u201d Boushey says. \u201cThe answer is: Because they literally aren\u2019t feeling it.\u201d She argues \u2014 rightly, I think \u2014 that the government should not focus on creating wholly new statistics. It should instead change and expand the ones that are already followed closely. Doing so could force the media and policymakers to talk about economic well-being at the same time that they are talking about economic indicators.It\u2019s worth remembering that the current indicators are not a naturally occurring phenomenon. They are political creations, with the flaws, limitations and choices that politics usually involves.Several years later, he received a promotion. He was named the first head of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a job he would hold for 20 years. His original methods from Massachusetts influenced the way that the federal government began calculating unemployment data, and still do to this day. The fact that the official rate ignores millions of discouraged workers is \u2014 although Wright wouldn\u2019t have used this phrase \u2014 a feature not a bug.The whole point of statistics is to describe reality. When a statistic no longer does so, it\u2019s time to find a new one \u2014 not to come up with a convoluted rationale that tries to twist reality to fit the statistic.After all these years, though, we haven\u2019t solved the problem. Maybe it takes a financial crisis to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Most Important Least-Noticed Economic Event of the Decade", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA localized recession in manufacturing-heavy areas can explain a lot of things. Sometimes the most important economic events announce themselves with huge front-page headlines, stock market collapses and frantic intervention by government officials.Other times, a hard-to-explain confluence of forces has enormous economic implications, yet comes and goes without most people even being aware of it.In 2015 and 2016, the United States experienced the second type of event.There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar.The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment. Overall economic growth slowed but remained in positive territory. The national unemployment rate kept falling. Anyone who didn\u2019t work in energy, agriculture or manufacturing could be forgiven for not noticing it at all.Yet understanding this slump \u2014 think of it as a mini-recession \u2014 is important in many ways. It helps explain some of the economic discontent evident in manufacturing-heavy areas during the 2016 elections. It offers warnings for where the next downturn might come from, and shows how important it is for policymakers to remain watchful and flexible about unpredictable shifts in the global economy.Most important, the mini-recession of 2015-16 offers a cautionary tale for any policymaker who might want to think of the United States as an economic island.The episode is stark evidence of the risk the Trump administration faces in threatening economic damage to negotiate leverage with other nations on trade and security. What happens overseas can return to American shores faster and more powerfully than once seemed possible.The mini-recession defies neatness. It\u2019s a story of spillovers and feedback loops and unintended consequences. But here\u2019s a summary:In 2015, Chinese leaders were concerned that their economy was experiencing a credit bubble, and they began imposing policies to restrain growth. These worked too well and caused a steep slowdown. That in turn caused troubles in other emerging nations for whom China was a major customer.Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, finally growing confident that the United States economy was returning to health, made plans to end its era of ultra-easy monetary policy.As the Fed moved toward tighter money, its counterparts at the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan were going in the opposite direction. The prospect of higher interest rates in the United States and lower rates in the eurozone and Japan fueled a steep rise in the value of the dollar on global currency markets.That in turn made China\u2019s problems worse. China had long pegged the value of its currency to the dollar, so a stronger dollar was also making Chinese companies less competitive globally. When China attempted to reduce this burden by loosening the peg in August 2015, it faced capital outflows, making the economic situation worse.Moreover, across major emerging markets, many companies and banks had borrowed money in dollars, so a stronger dollar made their debt burdens more onerous.Put it all together, and when the Fed moved toward raising interest rates \u2014 as it eventually did in December 2015 \u2014 it was essentially making financial conditions tighter and therefore slowing growth across big swaths of the world.The slowdown across emerging markets, in turn, meant less demand for oil and many other commodities. That helped cause their prices to fall. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell to under $30 in February 2016 from around $106 in June 2014. The drops in the prices of metals like copper and aluminum, and agricultural products like corn and soybeans, were also steep.That only heightened the economic pain for the many emerging economies that are major commodity producers, such as Brazil, Mexico and Indonesia.Given falling prices and high debt loads among energy producers in the United States, the markets for stocks and riskier corporate bonds came under stress, especially in early 2016. That generated losses for investors and fears about the overall stability of the financial system.Each of these forces has connections to the others. It wasn\u2019t one problem, but an intersection of a bunch of them. That made it devilishly hard to diagnose, let alone to fix, even for the people whose job was to do just that.When Federal Reserve officials meet eight times a year to set interest rate policy, their job, assigned by Congress, is to figure out what is best for the United States economy. Their job isn\u2019t to set a policy that will be best for China or Brazil or Indonesia.Entering 2015, things were looking pretty good for the United States.Inflation was below the 2 percent level the Fed aims for, but the traditional economic models on which the central bankers had long relied predicted that it would start to rise thanks to a rapidly falling unemployment rate.Even when prices for oil and other commodities started falling in the middle of the year, the Fed\u2019s models viewed it as a positive for the overall economy. Sure, some oil drillers and farmers might experience lower incomes, but consumers everywhere would enjoy cheaper gasoline and grocery bills.Although officials spent a lot of time monitoring the global economy, the fact remained that the United States wasn\u2019t as dependent on exports as many smaller countries. The 2008 financial crisis had shown how the American and European banking systems were deeply intertwined, but the same couldn\u2019t be said of the ties with Chinese banks.In other words, through the summer of 2015 it sure looked to many Fed officials as if the sound move was to start raising interest rates.At the Treasury Department, which is responsible for the United States\u2019 currency policies, it seemed well into 2015 that the strengthening dollar was mostly benign.\u201cThere was a sense that the U.S. was doing well and the rest of the world was not doing very well,\u201d said Nathan Sheets, a Treasury under secretary at the time and now chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cIt was driven by strong U.S. fundamentals.\u201dBut in late summer 2015, financial markets started to react more violently to the feedback loop of global currencies and commodities. It started to seem as if some of the old rules of thumb \u2014 about how a rising dollar or falling oil prices might affect the economy \u2014 might not apply.Perhaps the economics models used by forecasters had become outdated, failing to fully account for the ways surging energy production had become more intertwined with the manufacturing sector and the financial markets.\u201cThese things were all interconnected in different ways, and they all cycled back on the same industries and parts of the economy,\u201d said Jay Shambaugh, a member of the Obama White House Council of Economic Advisers at the time. Still, distilling that complex story into crisp memos for senior officials was no easy task.\u201cYou have to make memos short and to the point in the White House, and it was hard to say what exactly we thought was happening,\u201d he said.Behind closed doors at the Fed, officials started debating whether this outburst of volatility in markets really posed a risk to the overall economy. Should they stick to their plans to raise interest rates steadily, or slow down?Over two days in October, the debate played out publicly.Stan Fischer, the vice chairman of the Fed, was reluctant to adjust the planned rate increases, not wishing to let swings in financial markets dictate policy.\u201cWe do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path for policy,\u201d he said in a speech in Lima, Peru, on Oct. 11, 2015.Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who had worked on international issues at the Treasury, was quite a bit more worried.Ms. Brainard was right.The vicious circle of a stronger dollar, weaker emerging market growth and lower commodity prices caused spending on certain types of capital goods to plummet starting in mid-2015.Spending on agricultural machinery in 2016 fell 38 percent from 2014 levels; for petroleum and natural gas structures \u2014 think oil drilling rigs \u2014 the number was down a whopping 60 percent.The oil and gas exploration boom tied to fracking technology came to a halt with energy prices at rock-bottom levels, and with it sales of equipment tied to that boom. With the fall in domestic capital investment in those industries and with weakness overseas, companies in related industries took it on the chin. Caterpillar, the maker of heavy equipment, had 30 percent lower revenue in 2016 than 2014.In large segments of the economy, by contrast, it was business as usual. Business spending on investments like computers and office buildings kept rising, as did consumer spending.Still, the industrial sector downturn was powerful enough to turn a strong expansion into a weak one. Overall growth fell to 1.3 percent in the four quarters ended in mid-2016, from 3.4 percent in the preceding year.The national economy kept adding jobs. But Harris County, Tex., which encompasses energy-centric Houston and its near suburbs, shed 0.8 percent of its jobs in that span. In Peoria, Ill., hometown of Caterpillar, employment fell 3.2 percent.In effect, this was a localized recession \u2014 severe in certain places, but concentrated enough that it did not throw the overall United States economy into contraction.But it could have been worse.When Janet Yellen assumed leadership of the Federal Reserve in early 2014, she inherited an economy that had been expanding steadily for years, with a great deal of help from the Fed\u2019s interest rate policies.Deciding how and when to pull that support \u2014 when to raise interest rates, which had been near zero for more than six years \u2014 was set to be the defining choice of her tenure.In 2015, with signs that the United States economy was returning to health, she and her colleagues believed it was time to begin raising interest rates. She is a leading labor market scholar who spent a career studying, among other things, how a tight labor market can eventually feed through to inflation.Ms. Yellen elected not to raise rates in September, waiting for more evidence that the economy was truly on track and that the emerging market troubles wouldn\u2019t do too much damage to the domestic economy. But by December she judged that the situation had stabilized enough to raise rates.At the same time, the Fed revealed forecasts indicating that its senior officials expected to raise interest rates four more times in 2016. Within weeks, global markets were sending a message: Not so fast.In mid-February 2016, the financial leaders of the world\u2019s most powerful nations were set to convene in a Shanghai for the periodic G20 summit. With global markets in turmoil, the great question was: Can the officials rein in these forces?Three weeks after the summit, the Fed had another policy meeting. Rather than raise interest rates further as had been envisioned in December, Fed officials declined to raise rates \u2014 and steeply reduced their expectations of how much further they would raise rates over the remainder of 2016.Together, these steps were enough to end the vicious cycle. The dollar stopped appreciating and started dropping. Oil prices bottomed out and began a recovery. In the United States, capital spending was growing again by the summer of 2016.Ms. Yellen said it\u2019s not so. She said in an interview that there was an extensive exchange of views and information with the Chinese delegation in Shanghai, but that there were no promises or explicit agreements.\u201cI realize it looked to much of the world like some kind of secret handshake deal,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a deal. This was the global economy and capital markets affecting the U.S. outlook, and the Fed being sensitive to that, taking that into account and its influencing policy appropriately.\u201dThe Fed, she said, did what it thought was best for the United States economy without knowing exactly what the Chinese would do.Mr. Sheets, the former Treasury official, also dismissed the idea of some secret agreement.\u201cIt\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were a lot of meetings. A lot of bilaterals and quadrilaterals. You meet with your counterparts and talk about the global economy and think about the challenges and what might be done. But there was nothing agreed behind closed doors that was not part of the formal statement.\u201dEven if there was no formal secret agreement, the result \u2014 leaders of the world\u2019s two biggest economies squarely focused on the risks that the situation presented \u2014 turned out to be enough.The impact of the global commodity-currency spiral of 2015-16 is evident from a glance at the economic statistics. It is less so in the economic debates of 2018.First, while the Trump administration has claimed full credit for a surge in business investment, the bounce-back from the mini-recession is a major factor.Second, the mini-recession might well have affected some political attitudes during the 2016 election. While the economy was in pretty good shape for people in large cities on the coasts, 2016 was rough for a lot of people in local economies heavily reliant on drilling, mining, farming or making the machines that support those industries.Third, economic policymakers need to display the flexibility to respond to incoming information, even when it doesn\u2019t fit their own forecasts or preconceptions.If Ms. Yellen had been more stubborn about sticking to the plan to keep raising rates through 2016 because of her training as a labor market economist, the result might well have been an actual recession. \u201cShe\u2019s always learning,\u201d said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, \u201cand not so egotistical that she\u2019s wedded to one view of the world.\u201dFinally, it shows the global economy is so interconnected that events in Shanghai or S\u00e3o Paulo can cause unpredictable effects in faraway places.In the last year, the Trump administration has been lobbing tariffs at China and other major economic partners to extract more advantageous terms for trade. But the mini-recession warns of the risk of ricochet.Like it or not, the complexity of our global connections means that policy can\u2019t just focus on the home front. In 2016, we learned that lesson the hard way, even if not everybody was paying attention.An earlier version of this article misstated the year when the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was around $106. It was 2014, not 2015.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Recovery Threw the Middle-Class Dream Under a Benz", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrisis and ConsequencesOnce a year or so, the economist Diane Swonk ventures into the basement of her 1891 Victorian house outside Chicago and opens a plastic box containing the items that mean the most to her: awards, wedding pictures, the clothes she was wearing at the World Trade Center on the day it was attacked. But what she seeks out again and again is a bound diary of the events of the financial crisis and their aftermath.\u201cIt\u2019s useful to go back and see what a chaotic time it was and how terrifying it was,\u201d she said. \u201cThat time is seared in my mind. I looked at it again recently, and all the pain came flooding back.\u201dThe most profound of these is that the uneven nature of the recovery compounded a long-term imbalance in the accumulation of wealth. As a consequence, what it means to be secure has changed. Wealth, real wealth, now comes from investment portfolios, not salaries. Fortunes are made through an initial public offering, a grant of stock options, a buyout or another form of what high-net-worth individuals call a liquidity event.Data from the Federal Reserve show that over the last decade and a half, the proportion of family income from wages has dropped from nearly 70 percent to just under 61 percent. It\u2019s an extraordinary shift, driven largely by the investment profits of the very wealthy. In short, the people who possess tradable assets, especially stocks, have enjoyed a recovery that Americans dependent on savings or income from their weekly paycheck have yet to see. Ten years after the financial crisis, getting ahead by going to work every day seems quaint, akin to using the phone book to find a number or renting a video at Blockbuster.The financial crisis didn\u2019t just kill the dream of getting rich from your day job. It also put an end to a fundamental belief of the middle class: that owning a home was always a good idea because prices moved in only one direction \u2014 up. The bubble, while it lasted, gave millions in the middle class a sense of validation of their financial acumen, and made them feel as if they had done the Right Thing.In theory, if you lost your job, or suffered some other kind of financial setback, you could always sell into a real estate market that was forever rising. Ever-higher home prices became a steam valve, and the \u201cgreater fool\u201d theory substituted for any conventional measure of value.The kindling for the fire that consumed Wall Street and nearly the entire economy was mortgages that should never have been taken out in the first place. Homeowners figured the more house the better, whether or not their income could support the monthly payment, while greedy banks and middlemen were all too happy to encourage them.When the bubble burst, the bedrock investment for many families was wiped out by a combination of falling home values and too much debt. A decade after this debacle, the typical middle-class family\u2019s net worth is still more than $40,000 below where it was in 2007, according to the Federal Reserve. The damage done to the middle-class psyche is impossible to price, of course, but no one doubts that it was vast.Banks were hurt, too, but aside from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the pain proved transitory. Bankers themselves were never punished for their sins. In one form or another \u2014 the Troubled Asset Relief Program, quantitative easing, the Fed\u2019s discount window \u2014 the financial sector was supported in spectacular fashion.Worsening the picture, the post-crisis era has been marked by an increased disparity in wealth between white, Hispanic and African-American members of the middle class. That\u2019s according to an analysis of Fed data by the Pew Research Center, which found that families in the latter two groups were more dependent on housing as their principal form of investment. Not only were both minority groups harder hit by foreclosures, but Hispanics were also twice as likely as other Americans to be living in Sun Belt states where the housing crash was most severe.In 2016, net worth among white middle-income families was 19 percent below 2007 levels, adjusted for inflation. But among blacks, it was down 40 percent, and Hispanics saw a drop of 46 percent. For many, old-fashioned hard work has simply not been a viable path out of this hole. After unemployment peaked in the fall of 2009, it took years for joblessness to return to pre-recession levels. Slack in the labor market left the employed and unemployed alike with little leverage to demand raises, even as corporate profits surged.Maybe it was inevitable that when half the population watches its wages stagnate while the other half gets rich in the market, the result is President Donald Trump and Brexit.\u201cIt peeled away the facade and revealed an anger that had been building for decades,\u201d said Ms. Swonk, who is chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. \u201cThe crisis was horrific, but its legacy pushed us over the edge in terms of the discontent.\u201dWhether or not he is right, the concentration of wealth that is a legacy of the financial crisis will make itself felt far into the future. Younger Americans, in particular, will be marked by the experience of 2008 much as the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression haunted the generations who lived through it in the last century. Not only were they unable to accumulate assets in the lean years of the early recovery, but they also missed out on the recent stock market rally that benefited their older and richer peers.For those fortunate enough to still possess wealth after the crisis, the future looks very different. With the security provided by assets, rather than just income, they and especially their children are on a glide path for a gilded financial future. \u201cOver and over, you see that family wealth is an important determinant of opportunity for the next generation, over and above income,\u201d said Fabian T. Pfeffer, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. \u201cWealth serves as a private safety net that allows you to behave differently and plan differently.\u201dA wealthy person who loses a job can afford to be more choosy and wait for an opportunity suited to his or her skills and experience. The risk of going to an expensive college and taking on debt is lower when there is parental wealth to fall back on.Timothy Smeeding, who teaches public affairs and economics at the University of Wisconsin, put it more bluntly. \u201cYou can see dynasties starting to form,\u201d he said.Ten years have passed since the trauma of 2008, the nerves are still raw, and the pain still has a way of flaring up. Every time she goes down into the basement and peruses her diary, Diane Swonk feels it anew.\u201cIt is the diary of an economist, as well as a mother and a human being,\u201d Ms. Swonk said. It includes her published writings for clients, as well as her feelings, thoughts and fears as the crisis unfolded. She also recorded her impression of key figures she met during those fateful months, including Lawrence H. Summers, a top White House economic official at the time, and Ben S. Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve.\u201cThe financial crisis became a delineator,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were those who could recoup their losses and those who could not. Some people have amnesia, but we are still living with the wounds.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Investments That May Have Hit Their Peak", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersThis week is the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a flash point in the financial crisis. The economy has rebounded since then and the stock market has risen to record highs, but a feeling of caution looms over many investors.One of them is Dan Rasmussen, a contrarian investor who has marshaled data and historical returns to argue that three of the most popular asset classes for high-net-worth investors are not as desirable as they seem.\u201cI want to give the advisers the intellectual ammunition to allow them to say, \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to put money into these strategies,\u2019\u201d he said.But some advisers challenge this point of view, saying it is almost akin to market timing. \u201cYou could look at any asset class at any point in time and position it in a way and understand why it\u2019s outperformed or underperformed,\u201d said Scott Stackman, managing director of private wealth at UBS Wealth Management.Here is Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s argument for caution in three areas:During the financial crisis, Mr. Rasmussen worked at Bain Capital, a leading name in private equity. One of his jobs was to collect data on deals by Bain and its competitors to determine why some had done well and others had not.The more profitable deals were the least expensive ones, he found. The cheapest 25 percent of deals accounted for 60 percent of the funds\u2019 profits. The top 50 percent accounted for just 7 percent of profits. The difference was the price paid for the company. This was not solely for the obvious reason that paying less is better, but because private equity funds typically borrow 60 percent of the purchase price, which affects a company\u2019s profitability.Mr. Rasmussen said he admired the success Bain had in the 1980s and \u201990s, but began to question whether the private equity model it had helped pioneer was still sustainable.When early private equity firms bought relatively small companies at a discount and loaded them up with debt, the amount of leverage on the company was still about four times the company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of profitability known as Ebitda.Private equity firms continued to apply this strategy, but they were paying more for the companies, and consequently the amount of debt was rising to more than six or seven times Ebitda. With leverage at 10 times Ebitda, Mr. Rasmussen found, a company\u2019s free cash was almost all going toward debt service, and it was nearly impossible to be profitable.Mr. Rasmussen said the sector would look worse if not for a few high-performing funds that pulled up overall returns.\u201cIt\u2019s probably the worst time ever to invest in private equity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s being packaged for wealth management firms and registered investment advisers.\u201dAccording to PitchBook Benchmarks, which gathers data on private equity investments, only 25 percent of funds have been outperforming the market, and have done so by a smaller amount.Mr. Stackman of UBS said he was still putting money into private equity and hedge funds for certain clients, and reducing their investments in public equities or fixed income.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d term it as a true shift,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our belief in how the high-net-worth clients could and should be invested.\u201dMr. Rasmussen said the funds that still provided high returns equal with the risk were generally smaller ones that acted more like the owners of the companies they bought and didn\u2019t just add debt to increase returns.At his own firm, Mr. Rasmussen said, he modeled the strategy on what private equity funds were doing in the 1980s and 1990s: buying smaller companies at cheap prices and putting a reasonable amount of debt on them. In Verdad\u2019s case, Mr. Rasmussen focused on buying publicly traded companies with a small market capitalization.Verdad\u2019s main leveraged company fund lagged its small-cap benchmark in the first two quarters of this year but kept pace with a broader global benchmark. Over the past three years, the strategy has beaten both the small-cap and global benchmarks by six percentage points.The argument against venture capital is less nuanced. Top private equity funds are still delivering high returns, but venture capital funds have largely functioned as what Mr. Rasmussen calls \u201ca rich man\u2019s lottery.\u201dHe cites data from Cambridge Associates showing that venture capital has underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Nasdaq over the last 15 years. And he argues that those venture capital firms that built big names often did so with a few spectacular investments that overshadowed more mediocre ones.The venture capital firm Benchmark, for example, invested $6.7 million in eBay in 1997. That investment grew to $5 billion in two years, outshining other investments.Any venture capitalist will argue that the big winners make up for all the bets that did not pay off. Mr. Rasmussen does not dispute that; he emphasizes how difficult it is to find those funds that are going to consistently make the big winning investments.Mr. Rasmussen draws a distinction between real estate owned by private equity firms and real estate investment trusts. And for him, the difference in returns comes down to fees. A REIT typically charges a management fee of less than 1 percent. A fund that owns real estate will charge a typical private equity fee, which can be as high as 2 percent to manage the money and 20 percent of the profits.\u201cBy and large, it\u2019s a pretty efficient asset class, since rental income is a fixed contract,\u201d he said. So fees play a big role in the difference in returns.But real estate owned in REITs, he said, could be a good buffer for anxious investors because they have a low correlation to traditional equities given their stream of rental income. They\u2019re also less risky, he wrote, than his focus, small-cap stocks.Excluding entire asset classes can be a tough sell, some financial advisers say. Investors should be asking instead whether an asset class is performing as it should.\u201cYou could put together a low-volatility portfolio of hedge funds, and they will get very consistent return,\u201d Mr. Stackman of UBS said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not getting the generous returns the S. & P. has been giving you since 2009.\u201dThat would be around 2 percent a year for hedge funds versus about 18 percent for the S. & P. 500. And many asset classes now have had a good run.There\u2019s another cautionary argument on private investments. Because they are inherently risky, they should be undertaken only by the most experienced investors.Michael W. Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club for people with $10 million to $1 billion, said the group\u2019s 630 members had increased their investments in private equity and real estate.The group\u2019s collective portfolio has about 50 percent allocated to private equity and real estate. Public equity and debt make up just 35 percent.Mr. Sonnenfeldt said that such high allocations to risky private assets were a product of how Tiger 21\u2019s members often made their fortunes, building businesses and taking risk.But he agreed with Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s argument on investing in smaller companies.\u201cWhat our members do is not a referendum on the entire market,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. \u201cIt\u2019s our members. Most people who are thinking about these investments wouldn\u2019t do well without the skills to be successful. That\u2019s an important distinction.\u201dAnd he said the group\u2019s members expressed interest in private asset classes because, they said, their experience allowed them to influence the management of the investment.\u201cOur members overwhelmingly express their interest in private equity through ownership of a company or investment in a company,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a third have put money into a fund, and then they\u2019re biased toward the smaller funds over the larger ones, for the reasons Rasmussen is talking about.\u201dIn other words, the message is a resounding caveat emptor.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Jeff Bezos Should Push for Nobody to Get as Rich as Jeff Bezos", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtJeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has been publicly agonizing over a vexing problem: what to do with all his money.The question of how Mr. Bezos should spend his money is a good one, but a better place to start might be: Why does he have so much money in the first place? What does his fortune tell us about the economic structure and impact of the tech industry, the engine behind his billions? And, most important, what responsibility comes with his wealth \u2014 and is it any business of ours what he does with it?The answer: Of course it\u2019s our business.In the book, Mr. Giridharadas argues that the efforts of the super-wealthy to change the world through philanthropy are often a distraction from the planet\u2019s actual problems. To truly fix the world, Mr. Bezos ought to push for policy changes that would create a more equal distribution of the winnings derived from a tech-driven economy, Mr. Giridharadas said.\u201cHe should address himself to America\u2019s deepest problems in ways that would demand sacrifice from the winners of our age \u2014 making a difference at the expense of their opportunity to make a killing,\u201d Mr. Giridharadas said.There\u2019s another way of putting this: Jeff Bezos should spend his vast fortune pushing for a society where no one can ever become as rich as Jeff Bezos is now.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Bezos\u2019 philanthropic plans.But Mr. Bezos isn\u2019t just rich. He is growing unprecedentedly rich \u2014 rich enough that his wealth, by itself, illustrates a new economic reality.Most of Mr. Bezos\u2019 wealth is tied up in Amazon\u2019s stock, so he could well lose billions if Amazon flails. But if he does, there will probably be someone else just as megarich to take his place, because extreme concentrations of wealth are baked into the dynamics of the modern tech economy.Tech-powered businesses are often driven by an economic concept known as network effects, in which the very popularity of a service sparks even greater popularity. Amazon, for instance, keeps attracting more third-party businesses to sell goods in its store \u2014 which in turn makes it a better store for customers, which attracts more suppliers, improving the customer experience, and so on in an endless virtuous cycle. Digital businesses are also characterized by tremendous economies of scale \u2014 Amazon can create a robotic assistant once and deploy it to everyone \u2014 that further entrench concentration.\u201cWe have technology that has allowed us to create vastly more wealth for society,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy. \u201cBut there\u2019s no economic law that says that these benefits will be distributed evenly \u2014 and it\u2019s worked out that some people have gotten most of the benefits and a lot of other people have been left behind.\u201dBut economics isn\u2019t destiny, he said.\u201cTechnology has led to some of this concentration, but since it makes the pie bigger, you could make everyone better off simultaneously \u2014 you could make the poor better off and the rich better off \u2014 and whether we do that is a matter of policy,\u201d he said.\u201cThey\u2019re not providing the sort of high-wage, middle-class jobs to a broad swath of individuals that we used to associate with corporate success,\u201d Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, said of Amazon and other high-flying tech firms. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not the sharing of the productivity benefits that we used to see in the past. And that may be even more galling than the concentration of wealth.\u201dThose ideas strike me as unlikely; Mr. Bezos is a far-thinking innovator, but he has expressed little interest in near-term political questions.On the other hand, Mr. Bezos\u2019 most attractive quality, as a businessman, is his capacity for patience and surprise.\u201cThis is guy who was willing to buck what everyone else thought for so long,\u201d Mr. Giridharadas said. \u201cIf he brings that same irreverence to the question of how to give, he has the potential to interrogate himself about why it is that we need so many billionaires to save us in the first place \u2014 and what we could do to build a society that would not require Jeff Bezos to help us so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice Department Is Examining Tesla After Musk Comment", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla said on Tuesday that the Justice Department had requested documents from the company after its chief executive, Elon Musk, abruptly announced that he had lined up funding to convert the publicly traded electric-car maker into a private company.The request for information suggests that the Justice Department has opened a preliminary investigation into Mr. Musk\u2019s market-moving Twitter post on Aug. 7 about the potential buyout.The Justice Department inquiry, along with an intensifying Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Tesla\u2019s practices and communications, substantially increases the risks facing the embattled company. Tesla already is under intense financial pressure, with its shares down 25 percent since early August, and the government investigations introduce the possibility of costly penalties or other sanctions.The Justice Department inquiry is being handled by the United States attorney\u2019s office in San Francisco, according to a person familiar with the matter. It is unclear whether the inquiry is criminal or civil or whether it is at such an early stage that the question has not been settled.While the specific scope of the Justice Department inquiry isn\u2019t known, prosecutors in investigations like this one might look at a company\u2019s accounting practices, the adequacy and accuracy of its public disclosures and whether executives had sought to mislead investors.Tesla said the Justice Department\u2019s request was not a subpoena but rather a \u201cvoluntary request for documents.\u201d The company added: \u201cWe respect the D.O.J.\u2019s desire to get information about this and believe that the matter should be quickly resolved as they review the information they have received.\u201dThe tweet blindsided Tesla\u2019s board and ignited a rally in Tesla\u2019s shares. It soon became clear that Mr. Musk had not nailed down the billions of dollars in outside funding that would be required for such a deal. Nor had he retained any banks to assist in the fund-raising process.As part of the investigation, the S.E.C. in the past month has sent subpoenas not only to Tesla but also to financial institutions that it hired to explore the going-private transaction, according to people briefed on the subpoenas. Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake, a large investment firm, both received subpoenas demanding materials about their interactions with Tesla, the people said.It is not clear whether the Justice Department inquiry is, like the S.E.C.\u2019s, focused on a wide range of issues at Tesla or in particular on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Musk\u2019s Twitter post.Mr. Musk and the company he helped found have been bouncing from crisis to self-inflicted crisis in recent months.As the pressure mounts, Mr. Musk has retained his own lawyers to represent him in the government investigations, separate from the law firms hired by the company and its board.Lawyers from Hughes Hubbard & Reed \u2014 including Roel C. Campos, a former S.E.C. commissioner \u2014 are representing Mr. Musk in connection with the S.E.C. investigation, according to three people familiar with the arrangement. Mr. Musk has also hired Steven Farina, a partner at Williams & Connolly who specializes in government investigations and accounting malpractice, to represent him, two of the people said.A request for documents from a United States attorney\u2019s office would often be a sign of a criminal investigation. But federal prosecutors sometimes proceed with civil, not criminal, cases. They generally do so when the conduct they are investigating does not clearly violate a criminal statute or when prosecutors\u2019 main goal is to stop someone from a specific type of behavior. Civil lawsuits also carry a lower burden of proof than criminal cases.The news of the Justice Department inquiry sent Tesla\u2019s shares down more than 3 percent on Tuesday.David Gelles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nio\u2019s Share Surge Takes It From Carmaker to Tech Star", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsElectric-car maker Nio shifted quickly into a new gear. On the second day of trading after its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, its shares zoomed up 76 percent. That transformed China\u2019s answer to Tesla from a carmaker into a tech star.Some deserved skepticism forced Nio to sell its stock at the low end of the indicated price range. For a fleeting moment, its valuation \u2014 nearly $7 billion at Wednesday\u2019s close \u2014 just about suited the sector in which it operates. Applying rival Geely\u2019s net profit margin of nearly 12 percent and its valuation of seven times its forecasted earnings implied a bottom line of just over $1 billion for Nio. That would conceivably be within reach if it could run its manufacturing partner\u2019s factory at full capacity and then sell every single one of the 120,000 vehicles produced.With a valuation of $13 billion, much higher expectations kick in. Nio would have to churn out more than twice as many vehicles as current capacity allows and find buyers for all of them. As of August, Nio had delivered just about 1,600 cars, generating $7 million in revenue at a big loss.Chinese tech hype may explain the enthusiasm. Nio touted connected cars serviced by a dedicated app and partnerships with Tencent and JD.com for music streaming and e-commerce. These kinds of services resonate with investors. Shares of market debutants from China on the N.Y.S.E. and Nasdaq, excluding Nio, have averaged 64 percent increase this year, according to Dealogic. For all new listings in the Big Apple, the rise is a more muted 28 percent.Tesla, too, trades at over 100 times estimated earnings for 2019. Nio may have belatedly captured some of that exuberance. It is nevertheless an unexpected, and implausible, U-turn.Advertisement"}

The living room area includes a sofa in the rosy hue known as millennial pink, the kitchen comes equipped with a floor-to-ceiling wine fridge, and the library nook is filled with books chosen for their appearance, not their contents. The white walls are spotless, and there is never any clutter.Nobody lives here.The 2,400-square-foot space \u2014\u00a0which rents for $15,000 a month \u2014\u00a0was designed as a backdrop for Instagram stars, who have booked it through October.\u201cPeople get up and go to ABC Home the second the doors open to shoot \u2014 they do anything,\u201d Ms. Segar said. \u201cSpaces like this are gold for them, because then they\u2019re able to have a place that\u2019s a home to shoot lifestyle home moments in.\u201dVillage Marketing, which has an all-woman staff of 17, invited a number of social media stars to make use of the apartment in recent weeks, and their posts have already racked up tens of thousands of likes.The photographs of the apartment taken for this article, when viewed alongside the Instagram posts that resulted from photo shoots in the same space, give an idea of how the social media sausage is made. The apartment points to a future where Instagram moves further away from a do-it-yourself aesthetic toward a look that is more staged and polished.As Ms. Segar led a tour of the apartment, she invoked terms like \u201cmoments,\u201d \u201cfeelings,\u201d \u201cscenes\u201d and \u201cvibes.\u201dIn fashion- and Instagram-speak, a moment is a certain look, rather than a unit of time. And so Ms. Segar described the apartment\u2019s library nook as \u201cone of our favorite little moments.\u201d She added that the books on the shelves \u2014\u00a0with \u201cCrisis Economics\u201d just below \u201cGone Girl\u201d \u2014 were chosen for their muted colors to make the area \u201cnot as feminine and peachy as the rest of the space.\u201dNear the entrance is a spot that Ms. Segar described as a \u201cfireplace scene,\u201d which is likely to be a hit among influencers during pumpkin spice season (also known as fall). The chairs by the brick hearth have low backs, partly to avoid \u201canything reflective\u201d from the mirror on the mantle. \u201cWhen you think of all the products they\u2019re trying to bring to life, they need as many moments and feelings as possible,\u201d she said.Ms. Segar noted that the \u201chuge windows\u201d and \u201creally iconic\u201d wallpaper helped make the bedroom Instagram-ready. The room has already yielded posts featuring a pillow fight and a bra ad. Village Marketing steams the pillows and sheets before every shoot.\u201cThere\u2019s tons of pillows in the bed for them to work with,\u201d Ms. Segar said, adding that different textures like velvet and (fake) fur photograph well. A serving tray with shiny accessories has already appeared in numerous breakfast-in-bed shots. Another popular prop is the framed poster that says \u201cThe Future is Female.\u201d And the custom rug has figured in Instagram posts promoting footwear.\u201cWe wanted them to have something that would be able to feel like a moment where they could shoot their shoes,\u201d Ms. Segar said.Marianna Hewitt, who has more than 800,000 Instagram followers, recently took photos in the penthouse and hosted an event there for a skin care line she co-founded.\u201cIf you shoot in a traditional photography studio, it almost looks too good for social,\u201d Ms. Hewitt said. At the same time, she added, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to shoot at our house every single day or the same streets we post on all the time.\u201dSocial media users like Ms. Hewitt like the apartment because it allows for images that have style, without the off-putting slickness of traditional advertising.The women who work with Village Marketing are drawn to the apartment\u2019s \u201cpink design moments and our iconic pink couch,\u201d Ms. Segar said. The specific shade, she noted, is \u201cmillennial pink,\u201d which was also used for the chairs around the dining table.\u201cMost of our influencers are millennials, most of them love this color palette,\u201d she added. \u201cThe gold accents, the blushes, the velvets, the furs.\u201dThere is also the \u201crah-rah-Instagram-slash-feminist-wall,\u201d an area filled with photographs of Instagram influencers and messages of female empowerment.The bathroom has become a destination for influencers who promote beauty products \u2014 and the distance between the entrance and the bathtub makes it easy to get a good shot. The spa-style tub was a party prop during Ms. Hewitt\u2019s event, when it was filled with flowers. (Very Instagram.)\u201cI\u2019m waiting for an influencer to do like a floating flower bathtub shot,\u201d Ms. Segar said. \u201cIt will happen. It just hasn\u2019t happened yet.\u201dThe kitchen is a stranger to dirty dishes and splattered grease, but the Village Marketing team sometimes stocks it with baked goods or cheeses as props. Instagram-worthy vendors include Levain and Balthazar. During my visit, a batch of By Chloe cupcakes, with colorful frosting, lent a homey touch. The gold-accented dishes must be photo-ready at all times.\u201cWe needed a really white, well-lit kitchen that had enough space that you could back out and put a camera to video and film,\u201d Ms. Segar said.Hanging on a nearby wall is a framed photo of Prada Marfa, the installation featuring the Italian fashion brand that has been the subject of countless Instagram posts.\u201cPeople literally travel to this space to shoot,\u201d Ms. Segar said. \u201cIt felt like this was the exact perfect place we should have on here.\u201dThe roof deck allows for the staging of everything from yoga classes to dinner parties. And with a clever arrangement of the potted plants, the area can serve as a stand-in for \u201can outdoor space in the middle of the country,\u201d Ms. Segar said.\u201cListen, does Instagram create false reality? Yes, 1,000 percent,\u201d said Ms. Bronfman, who has roughly 474,000 Instagram followers. \u201cBut having a place like this, for me, is not about pretending your life looks like something else. It\u2019s about having a space you need to get your work done.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese I.P.O.s Are Bringing Casino Trading to New York", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsChinese start-ups are bringing the volatility of their homeland markets to New York.The Tencent-backed news aggregator Qutoutiao more than doubled its share price on its first day of Nasdaq trading, before tumbling on the second. The luxury electric-car maker Nio, which has a market capitalization of almost $9 billion, seesawed almost as much. Small free floats and untested business models are partly to blame, but the erratic behavior will hurt future debuts.Qutoutiao, an unprofitable start-up that gives cash rewards to its readers, priced its shares at the bottom end of a marketed range last week. Investors, it seemed, were put off by a lack of important operating licenses, and other signs of a rushed sale. But the shares rose nearly 130 percent from their listing value on the first day \u2014 only to crash 40 percent in the next session. Nio, China\u2019s answer to Tesla, had a similar ride. It priced at the low end of an ambitious range and had a damp start, but its shares soared nearly 80 percent on the second day.In both cases, the oscillations \u2014 more frequently seen in mainland exchanges \u2014 triggered trading halts.One credible explanation for the roller coaster effect is the small quantity of shares actually sold by Chinese debutantes, either because of stubborn founders, weak investor demand or both. Just 16 percent of Nio was sold. Qutoutiao put roughly 5 percent of itself on the market. That amplifies market mood swings.Overall, the eight largest Chinese companies making U.S. debuts this year sold between 4 and 19 percent of their shares, according to the data provider Dealogic. That compares to between 14 and 86 percent for the top non-Chinese companies listing on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.Either way, trading with Chinese characteristics has damaging consequences. With even companies like the $27 billion shopping app Pinduoduo whipsawing this year, large institutional investors may be put off further listings, making it ever harder to build credible shareholder books. That would only accentuate the gambling problem further.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elon Musk Steps Down as Chairman in Deal With S.E.C. Over Tweet About Tesla", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk, under pressure from his lawyers and investors of Tesla, the company he co-founded, reached a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Saturday to resolve securities fraud charges. The settlement will force Mr. Musk to step aside as chairman for three years and pay a $20 million fine.The deal with the S.E.C. will allow him to remain as chief executive, something he could have jeopardized if he had gone to battle with the agency.It is not clear why Mr. Musk changed his mind so quickly.People familiar with the situation, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said lawyers for Mr. Musk and the company moved to reopen the talks with the S.E.C. on Friday. During that time, one of Tesla\u2019s lawyers became instrumental in securing a deal with the S.E.C., according to a person familiar with the negotiations.The whipsaw events of the past few days followed a series of self-inflicted wounds by Mr. Musk.His tweet about taking his company private, along with attacks on critics on social media, raised concerns with investors about whether Mr. Musk has become too focused on criticism from so-called short-sellers who had been making bets against him and Tesla. The company has recently been struggling to meet audacious production goals for its Model 3 sedan.Mr. Musk is widely regarded by analysts and investors as the creative engine behind Tesla, and he has helped the company become one of the most valuable American carmakers. But Tesla has lurched from crisis to crisis over the past year, and has since scrambled to contain the fallout from Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet.The company, whose shares have been hit hard since the S.E.C. filed the lawsuit, did not immediately comment on the settlement. On Friday, its stock dropped almost 14 percent.Tesla, which is also settling with the S.E.C., will pay a $20 million penalty. The company was not charged with any fraud.In addition, the company will add two independent directors and take steps to monitor Mr. Musk\u2019s communications with investors. It will also create a permanent committee of independent directors to monitor disclosures and potential conflicts of interest.Jay Clayton, the S.E.C. chairman, said the settlement with Mr. Musk and Tesla sent a message that \u201cwhen companies and corporate insiders make statements, they must act responsibly, including endeavoring to ensure the statements are not false or misleading.\u201dIn settling, Mr. Musk neither admitted nor denied misleading investors under the civil fraud charge, which means he cannot later say he did nothing wrong.The settlement with the S.E.C. faulted Tesla for failing to make sure that information important to investors was disclosed in a proper and timely manner.Mr. Musk had a good reason to reopen the settlement talks: The S.E.C., in suing him, had sought to bar him permanently from serving as a top executive or officer of Tesla or any other public company. Under the deal reached on Saturday, he will not only remain as chief executive, but will also stay on as a board member, just not as chairman.\u201cThe total package of remedies and relief announced today are specifically designed to address the misconduct at issue by strengthening Tesla\u2019s corporate governance and oversight in order to protect investors,\u201d said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division.Mr. Musk, according to people familiar with the negotiations, had been concerned about whether settling a civil fraud charge might affect the ability of Tesla and the other companies he runs, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, to raise money from investors in private placements and the debt markets.But a Tesla spokesman said the S.E.C. had granted waivers to all of those companies so his settlement would not be held against them.Waivers in such a situation are not uncommon, legal experts have said.A Tesla spokesman said that Mr. Musk, a billionaire, would be buying $20 million in Tesla stock. The amount of stock being bought by Mr. Musk matches the penalty the company has to pay under the settlement, which was filed in federal court in Manhattan.The S.E.C. reacted quickly after the Aug. 7 tweet, which caused an immediate surge in Tesla shares. Regulators served a subpoena on the company seeking information and moved to take testimony from Mr. Musk and others at the company, people familiar with the matter said.Negotiations toward an initial settlement began about a week ago, after the S.E.C. said it was planning to send an official notice to Mr. Musk and Tesla that it was considering filing an enforcement action, those briefed on the talks said. By their account, all the parties thought a deal had been reached by Wednesday evening, and the plan was for a settlement with Mr. Musk and Tesla to be announced on Thursday.Mr. Musk was said to have backed away from a settlement, in part, because he was concerned that he could not later tell investors that he had not done anything wrong. But the settlement on Saturday requires him to do that.In a so-called \u201cadmit nor deny\u201d settlement, a settling party cannot later disavow the terms of the settlement.After Mr. Musk was said to have rejected the deal on Thursday, his lawyers asked the S.E.C. to wait a couple of days so they could talk him into it, but the regulators said no, said another person familiar with the matter but not authorized to speak publicly.Once the S.E.C. sued Mr. Musk, his lawyers continued to talk to him about moving forward with a settlement and eventually he agreed, this person said.In the meantime, Mr. Musk had conversations with investors and friends like Mark Cuban, an entrepreneur who has had his own battles with the S.E.C., and they gave him a sense of how difficult it is to fight one of these suits, even if he eventually won, said people familiar with the negotiations.The parties worked much of Friday and Saturday to get a deal done.The settlement clears a big headache for Tesla, but other problems remain.The S.E.C. is continuing to look into the company\u2019s past claims about its production goals. And now with Mr. Musk agreeing to step down as chairman, Tesla\u2019s board must decide who should replace him.Emily Flitter, David Gelles and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Betting Against Tesla: Short-Sellers Make Their Case", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk says short-sellers are conspiring to bring his company down. Some seasoned investors say it\u2019s just a matter of fundamentals. For the past year, Elon Musk has waged a bitter war of words with short-sellers, the investors who are betting billions of dollars that Tesla will fail.George Noble doesn\u2019t fit that description. Manager of his own hedge fund, Noble Capital Advisors, he rarely comments on Tesla in public or on Twitter, and he comes with an impressive pedigree. He has been following and investing in car companies for nearly 40 years, having started his career an auto analyst and then a rising fund manager at Fidelity in the 1980s.\u201cI\u2019m not one of these individuals with superficial knowledge who\u2019s tweeting garbage on Twitter,\u201d said Mr. Noble, 61. \u201cI\u2019ve followed this industry a long, long time. I\u2019m not a bomb-throwing hack.\u201dThere\u2019s no doubt Tesla and Mr. Musk, the company\u2019s high-profile chief executive, have plenty of detractors, especially on Twitter, where some critics trumpet vitriol and unsubstantiated information about the company and its business. But many of those who believe that Tesla is destined for a major restructuring \u2014 or even collapse \u2014 are buttoned-up investors. They base their view not on antipathy for Tesla or Mr. Musk, but on cold financial calculations, including its heavy debt load and voracious cash burn.\u201cThis isn\u2019t only about Musk,\u201d said Mark B. Spiegel, a managing partner at Stanphyl Capital, which has a large position shorting Tesla. \u201cIt\u2019s about a terrible capital structure, because of the debt, and a stock price that is out of whack with the demand for the product and the competition that\u2019s coming in.\u201dMr. Spiegel said he had spoken out to \u201ceducate people\u201d about Tesla\u2019s finances. \u201cI\u2019m just putting facts out there that counter the claims Musk puts out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t make up reasons to short something.\u201d Tesla did not respond substantively to a request for comment for this article.Here are some of the reasons that skeptics like Mr. Nobel and Mr. Spiegel offer for their position.REASON 1The main reason that Tesla is the most shorted stock on Wall Street is its market valuation of $50 billion. Until recent declines in its stock, Tesla was worth more than General Motors. But in 2017, G.M. sold 9.6 million cars and trucks and made $12.8 billion in pretax profit. Tesla sold just over 100,000 cars in 2017, and lost $2.2 billion.Mr. Noble said the image of an unprofitable company with a lofty market value harked back to the dot-com era, when enthusiastic investors drove up the stock prices of even start-ups that had no revenue and no profits.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cars are cool \u2014 the acceleration, the torque.\u201d But a struggling, highly leveraged company with a valuation of $50 billion, he said, is \u201cone of the biggest bubbles in the market.\u201dREASON 2The argument against Tesla almost always cites its finances \u2014 whose shaky state, Mr. Spiegel contends, is often obscured by the hype over its cars and by Mr. Musk\u2019s own tweets and ambitious ideas, such as an electric semi truck and his hope to transport people through networks of underground tunnels.With cars priced at $70,000 and up, a company selling more than 100,000 a year would normally rake in hefty profits. But Tesla still spends more money than it takes in, consuming nearly $1 billion every three months. Mr. Musk has vowed that a sharp increase in sales of the Model 3 sedan in the current quarter will drive up revenues enough to make Tesla profitable and provide the funds it needs, but short-sellers are skeptical.Gabe Hoffman, 41, general partner at Accipiter Capital Management, a hedge fund that has shorted Tesla, points to the ratio of how much cash Tesla has and could access quickly and how much it owes in the short term. Because of its shortage of cash and all its liabilities, \u201cTesla looks worse than General Motors one quarter before it filed for bankruptcy,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said.\u201cTo me that doesn\u2019t sound like a good long-term business model,\u201d Mr. Wolters said.REASON 3The chief of any company needs to be disciplined and to \u201cexecute at a high level,\u201d Mr. Cohodes said. But the string of recent events has convinced him that Mr. Musk is \u201cnot mentally fit\u201d to deal with all of Tesla\u2019s challenges successfully. \u201cI view Elon as a tragic figure,\u201d he added.REASON 4 For Mr. Noble, the biggest doubt about Tesla is whether consumers are actually clamoring to buy its cars. The company has reported that more than 400,000 people have paid deposits of $1,000 each to reserve Model 3s.\u201cThat suggests that every car they make has a paying customer waiting for it,\u201d Mr. Noble said. \u201cThat is the heart of Tesla\u2019s story. That\u2019s why people buy the stock, because it looks like they have unlimited demand.\u201dBut some recent actions by Tesla suggest that may not be the case. The weekend after Labor Day, it held a \u201csales event\u201d at its plant in Fremont, Calif., allowing deposit holders to stroll among several hundred cars and pick one to buy. Hundreds more have been parked for weeks at lots in Burbank and Lathrop, Calif. On Friday, Tesla sent an email to customers and deposit holders inviting them to test drive a Model S or X overnight \u2014 the kind of marketing event that car companies organize to drum up sales.\u201cThat\u2019s inventory,\u201d Mr. Hoffman said. \u201cEverything they produce is supposed to be delivered or in transit on the way to the customer. If there\u2019s nothing wrong with demand, why are there all these cars in Burbank? Something doesn\u2019t add up.\u201dThe italics emphasizing the adverbial form of \u201cshort\u201d were left to interpretation. By Sunday evening, Tesla had not responded further.An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Gabe Hoffman at the hedge fund Accipiter Capital Management. He is general partner, not simply a partner.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Blasts Sessions for Charging G.O.P. Members Before Midterms", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Monday attacked Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, over the Justice Department\u2019s decision to bring criminal charges against two Republican congressmen ahead of the midterm elections, linking the department\u2019s actions with his party\u2019s political fate.In a pair of tweets sent midafternoon, Mr. Trump suggested that the Justice Department should not have brought charges against two \u201cvery popular\u201d Republican lawmakers running for re-election so close to November because it could jeopardize the party\u2019s control of the House.In another tweet, he suggested that Mr. Sessions, a former senator who was one of Mr. Trump\u2019s only vocal defenders early in his campaign, had fallen into favor with Democrats after the charges were delivered.Both lawmakers have pleaded not guilty to the charges.Until Monday, Mr. Trump had not so overtly tied the Justice Department\u2019s responsibility for pursuing charges against alleged criminals with Republicans\u2019 election prospects.Last week, it even appeared that Mr. Trump would stop publicly toying with the idea of removing Mr. Sessions until after the midterm elections.\u201cI just would love to have him do a great job,\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg News in the Oval Office last week. \u201cI do question what Jeff is doing.\u201dBy calling it the \u201cJeff Sessions Justice Department,\u201d Mr. Trump put even more distance between himself and the country\u2019s top law enforcement organization, which is investigating members of his inner circle and his business dealings.Those inquiries are being conducted by the United States attorney\u2019s office in the Southern District of New York and by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel appointed to investigate Russian election interference and any ties to the Trump campaign.Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets \u2014 sent from the White House on a searingly hot day that kept him from departing for his nearby Virginia golf course \u2014 criticized indictments that fall well within the Justice Department\u2019s window for bringing charges during an election cycle.His comments triggered a swift rebuke from former prosecutors and members of his own party.\u201cThe United States is not some banana republic with a two-tiered system of justice \u2014 one for the majority and one for the minority party,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThese two men have been charged with crimes because of evidence, not because of who the president was when the investigations began.\u201dThe investigations into Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle have resulted in a string of guilty pleas and convictions that include two members of the Trump campaign and Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, and David Pecker, the publisher of the National Enquirer and Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime friend, have also cooperated to some degree with federal investigators.Mr. Trump has used Twitter to cast the investigations into his conduct and that of his associates as witch hunts propagated by career government employees.Here are all the people connected to President Trump who have been charged with crimes or found to have violated federal ethics rules.\u201cThe president is trying to delegitimize the criminal justice system in this country because people close to him are at risk,\u201d said Joyce Vance, a former federal prosecutor.The Justice Department declined to comment. After Mr. Trump attacked the department, its methods and the outcome of its cases last month, in the wake of prosecutors\u2019 securing a guilty plea from Mr. Cohen and a guilty verdict for the president\u2019s former campaign manager, Mr. Sessions issued a rare rebuke.\u201cWhile I am attorney general, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in his statement. \u201cNo nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.\u201dFederal prosecutors say Mr. Collins used his seat on the board of an Australian-based drug company to privately tip off his son and other investors \u2014 before the information was made public \u2014 that the company\u2019s only product had failed a do-or-die scientific trial. Because his son and others dumped their stocks before the public announcement, they avoided losing hundreds of thousands of dollars.It was clear that elections were on the president\u2019s mind on Monday. After tweeting about Mr. Sessions, Mr. Trump attacked John Kerry, the former senator and Democratic presidential candidate, for suggesting that he might run again for president in 2020.\u201cI should only be so lucky - although the field that is currently assembling looks really good - FOR ME!\u201d Mr. Trump wrote.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Taming of Initial Coin Offerings", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchIf initial coin offerings have been the wild West of the investment world, then the sheriff has just arrived to bring order.Issuers of digital tokens clothed their offerings in the guise of being unregulated cryptocurrencies that do not fall under the federal securities laws. But a recent decision in Federal District Court in Brooklyn may be a first step in putting an end to that view.The Justice Department accused him of conspiracy and securities fraud, based on allegedly false statements he made to attract funding. Mr. Zaslavskiy filed a motion to dismiss the charges. He argued that virtual currencies from REcoin and Diamond were not securities, and that therefore the government did not have jurisdiction over them and could not prosecute him for fraud.Judge Dearie rejected the defense argument that purchases of REcoin and Diamond tokens were not an \u201cinvestment of money\u201d because they were just an exchange of one currency (dollars) for another (digital tokens). The judge also found that statements promoting the offerings had promised profits, with REcoin described as \u201can attractive investment opportunity\u201d that \u201cgrows in value.\u201dThe decision makes it clear that it will be up to a jury to decide whether the digital tokens were investment contracts. But by allowing the case to go forward, Judge Dearie provided the first opinion finding that they could come within the federal securities laws.The message from the TokenLot\u2019s case is that those who want to cater to investors in digital tokens will need to adhere to S.E.C. oversight of their exchanges. Although becoming a broker is costly, a firm that does so could use that status as a marketing tool by telling potential customers that they will be much safer trading through its platform than on unregulated exchanges where assets could be stolen with no recourse for the victims. Like car companies that tout their safety measures under rules they long fought, a properly registered broker can offer much greater client protection that customers may be willing to pay up for.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Volvo\u2019s I.P.O. Problems Go Beyond a Brewing Trade War", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsPresident Trump\u2019s threats of a trade war are becoming a useful corporate scapegoat. Volvo\u2019s stalled initial public offering was no doubt hindered by American tariffs, as the company claims, but its mooted valuation was also far too high.That\u2019s now on pause. Volvo boss Hakan Samuelsson said on Monday that \u201cconditions right now are not optimal,\u201d and called trade discussions between the United States, China and Europe \u201creally difficult to predict.\u201d He is correct. The introduction of American and Chinese tariffs has hit groups like BMW and Daimler, which ship American-made cars to China. Their shares are down 6 percent and 23 percent, respectively, so far this year. Mr. Trump has also threatened Europe with tariffs of up to 25 percent on vehicle imports.The bigger problem is Volvo\u2019s valuation. Geely\u2019s desired price was equivalent to 27 times the Swedish automaker\u2019s earnings, which totaled $1.1 billion last year. That is more than quadruple the multiples at which BMW and Daimler trade.Granted, Volvo invests heavily in self-driving technology and says all cars launched after 2019 will either be electric or hybrid. That puts it ahead of peers when it comes to moving on from the internal combustion engine.Investors are nonetheless skeptical that old-school auto groups can get a return on these electric-vehicle investments. Valuations were falling well before Mr. Trump moved into the White House. Toyota took years to turn a profit on its popular Prius hybrid model.Raising capital at a high valuation to fund an even more aggressive push into electric vehicles was always going to be difficult. Mr. Trump deserves only part of the blame.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Hits $1,000,000,000,000 in Value, Following Apple", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Amazon has become the second American company to cross that once-unimaginable line. Its shares rose as high as $2,050.50 on Tuesday morning, pushing it over $1 trillion in value, before immediately falling back and then ending the day at $2,039.51, below the $1 trillion threshold. Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is worth nearly as much as Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett put together.This time, the explanation is more complicated.Amazon captures 49 cents of every e-commerce dollar in the United States. It employs more than 550,000 people and generates $178 billion in annual revenue. It sells everything from computing space to peanut butter to appointments with plumbers.But the thing it has always sold the most \u2014 to investors, customers, the news media \u2014 is excitement.In the beginning, Amazon was an exciting new way to shop for books: online. Then it was an exciting new way to read (Kindle e-books), an exciting new way to publish (CreateSpace), an exciting new way to power the internet (Amazon Web Services), an exciting new way to get deliveries (Amazon Prime), an exciting new way to make your house a high-tech outpost (Alexa).Long before Amazon went to Hollywood and began making movies, it was the star of its own show, generating vast amounts of attention just for being Amazon. No other company had ever managed to turn its lack of profit into such effective drama, or the question of what its next move would be.Mr. Bezos made clear when Amazon went public in 1997 that he would not work for Wall Street, and the result was a company cast in an entirely different mold. It never feared losing money. In a real sense, there were no consequences for being wrong.Behind the drama is a relentless and sometimes scary ambition. Amazon is the Jay Gatsby of American companies, believing that tomorrow it will run faster, stretch its arms out farther, fulfill the desires of consumers in ways that no other business possibly could. You will live in Amazon\u2019s world, it says, and you will like it.One of the great benefits for Amazon of this approach is that it is impossible to tell where reality ends and hype \u2014 or perhaps even madness \u2014 begins.Take Amazon\u2019s drone program, which it first announced on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI know this looks like science fiction,\u201d Mr. Bezos said, as he showed a film of an unmanned vehicle delivering a package. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d He said there were \u201cyears of additional work\u201d to be done, but declared himself an optimist. Drone delivery, he predicted, would be a reality in \u201cfour, five years.\u201dThat was December 2013. Roughly a million features were written about Amazon and its drones, nearly all with the subtext: Isn\u2019t this the coolest thing ever?Over the years, the company kept raising the stakes, as if they were not already high enough. Amazon applied a few years ago for a patent for an \u201caerial fulfillment center\u201d that would float at 45,000 feet. Drones would fly out of it with your order and then glide down to your backyard.The fulfillment center, which looks in drawings like a blimp tugging a warehouse, has other uses besides delivering dinner. It would drift down to 2,000 feet to what the patent calls \u201cthe advertising altitude,\u201d where it would present information \u201cabout items and/or services.\u201d Perhaps it will be just like the movie \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and the floating ads will trumpet the joys of working in Amazon\u2019s off-world colonies. The patent was granted this summer.Haye Kesteloo, senior editor of the news site DroneDJ, noted that there were many hurdles to routine delivery by drone, even if the vehicles are not being launched from airships. The claimed drone attack on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela will not help soothe nervous citizens.Nevertheless, Mr. Kesteloo, like Mr. Bezos, proclaims himself an optimist. \u201cCompanies like Amazon will make routine drone deliveries to consumers by 2025,\u201d he said \u2014 only twice as far away as promised.\u201cThere is no doubt anymore,\u201d said Ron Nussbaum, who runs an investment management fund called Maverick Value in Los Angeles. \u201cThe stock always goes up, and no one doubts it will keep going up.\u201dMr. Nussbaum, who emphasized that over all his investments were profitable, might be the last Amazon skeptic. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d he said.And an expensive one. Last year, when Amazon crossed $1,000 a share, he started buying \u201cput\u201d options \u2014 bets that the stock would decline. One of his puts has dropped 85 percent; another, 92 percent.Mr. Nussbaum is planning to buy more. He thinks people are confusing their impressions of Amazon the company with Amazon as an investment.\u201cIf I fill up your gas tank for $1 but it costs me $2, you can say it\u2019s a great product, but it doesn\u2019t make any sense as a company,\u201d he said.Apple had profits of $48 billion last year. Amazon\u2019s were less than a tenth of that. If profits were all that mattered, Amazon should be worth about $100 billion, the size of United Technologies or Texas Instruments. That is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing to get people excited, either.Even before Amazon hit $1 trillion, the milestone was old news. There was a poll on Facebook run by a group of young Wall Street investors. The question: Would Amazon or Apple be the first to hit $2 trillion?The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of Amazon. Dreams will always triumph over devices.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The U.S. Stock Market Towers Over the Others. But at What Cost?", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesMuch of the world has recovered from the global financial crisis of a decade ago, but one market has prospered above virtually all others: the United States stock market.In addition to outpacing other major markets, the American market has outstripped the growth of the United States economy to such an extent that it is a global outlier. Whether the surge \u2014 which has helped fuel economic inequality in the United States \u2014 can continue, and what the domestic and global consequences might be, are unresolved questions.\u201cThere has been a disconnection between stock markets and economies around the world, with stock markets generally outperforming their economies,\u201d Professor Prasad, a former International Monetary Fund official, said in an interview. \u201cBut the United States stands out. There\u2019s a much greater degree of outperformance and disconnection from domestic economic growth. And you don\u2019t typically see a disconnect like this for such a long period.\u201dThe Brookings survey shows, for example, that while the two biggest emerging market economies \u2014 those of China and India \u2014 have grown far faster than America\u2019s in the past decade, those countries\u2019 stock markets have not fared as well as their American counterpart. India\u2019s stock gains were substantial in its local currency, the rupee, but were almost eliminated when translated into dollars. The Chinese stock market has actually lost value since the financial crisis.Since the end of 2007 through June of this year, the survey says, gross domestic product in the United States grew by 18 percent, after adjusting for inflation. \u201cThe U.S. leads the pack among major advanced economies,\u201d the report says, while noting that the American economy\u2019s growth trailed that of emerging market economies like those of China and India.In nominal terms, without the inflation adjustment, gross domestic product in the United States grew more: 38 percent. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index nearly doubled from December 2007 through August 2018, a better return than other major stock markets experienced.This trend \u2014 stock markets growing much faster than domestic economies \u2014 also appeared in advanced economies like those of Britain, France, Germany, and Japan, but it was much more extreme in the United States, the report says.The American stock market\u2019s outperformance can be explained by factors like the rising share of corporate profits in the domestic economy and by the sheer force of American financial power on a global scale, Professor Prasad said.Although the United States contributed mightily to the global financial crisis, it has been a source of financial stability for most of the last 10 years, attracting investments from around the world. The dollar has strengthened against most other currencies in that time, becoming, if anything, an even more central part of the world financial system, he added.What\u2019s more, the dollar\u2019s strength has magnified the outperformance of the American stock market when compared against markets in most other countries.India outpaced the United States in economic growth, and its stock market rose roughly 90 percent from December 2007 through last month, almost as much as the American stock market did, when both are tracked in their domestic currencies. But the Indian rupee lost ground against the dollar, and its weakness has wiped out most of the value of its stock market\u2019s gains: When converted into dollars, the Indian stock market rose only 6 percent.China is the rare country whose currency, the renminbi, actually has strengthened modestly against the dollar since the end of 2007. But that was not enough to offset the decline of the Shanghai stock market, which fell 48 percent in renminbi and 45 percent in dollar terms.The Chinese stock market, like the United States market, is an outlier, Professor Prasad said, but in a radically different dimension: The Chinese market has significantly trailed other markets as well as the Chinese economy.One reason is that the Chinese stock market, to an even greater degree than the United States stock market, represents only a small slice of the country\u2019s overall economy. Publicly listed Chinese corporations, Professor Prasad said, tend to suffer from endemic structural problems: high debt levels, poor accounting disclosure and weak governance. Until these problems are solved, China may be risky for global stock investors.The United States stock market, which has been a global magnet, is rife with its own anomalies. For one thing, Professor Prasad said, stock market growth has exceeded G.D.P. growth by so much and for so long that it bears close attention. \u201cOver long periods there is typically a close correlation between stock market growth and economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is already a long period.\u201dThat does not mean that the American stock market will necessarily fall soon. It is being supported by several macroeconomic factors, aside from cash inflows from foreigners. Corporate profits, supported in part by tax cuts and relaxed regulation and low interest rates, have been rising more rapidly than the G.D.P., while wage growth has been constrained.Because stock ownership is concentrated among richer people, the rising market wealth has exacerbated economic inequality in the United States. \u201cMost of the stock market wealth has been going to those who are already very rich rather than to the poor,\u201d Professor Prasad said. \u201cThe disconnect between the stock market and the real economy is manifest in the disconnect between corporate profits and real wages. It has potential sociopolitical implications.\u201dIn short, the American stock market could well keep rising for some time. But that might increase domestic political tensions, if increasing corporate and stock market riches are not accompanied by broad-based growth in wages.From a global perspective, the American stock market appears to be attracting capital that might otherwise bolster other markets and economies. The United States market is exceptional and it has enriched stock investors. But the decade of outperformance has incurred mounting costs.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

As the drawn-out battle for Sky enters its final weeks, what sounds like the premise for a bad movie may become reality for the Walt Disney Company and Comcast.Unless one of the American media giants backs down by Saturday, Britain\u2019s Takeover Panel will stage an auction for the pay-TV group. Bidding is already stretched: Comcast\u2019s offer of \u00a314.75 per share, worth \u00a326 billion ($34 billion) overall, would earn the buyer a return on investment of just 6 percent in 2020. Twenty-First Century Fox, parts of which are being absorbed by Disney, has bid \u00a314 per share for the 61 percent of Sky it doesn\u2019t already own.One outcome is that Disney and Fox put in a knockout offer. The Mouse House wants to launch a streaming-video subscription service to rival Netflix. Sky\u2019s 23 million European subscribers would be the ideal launchpad, and would allow Disney to reclaim the British rights to movies like \u201cMoana.\u201d Its DisneyLife subscription product is flailing in Britain, partly because it has the rights to just 16 of the 55 Disney and Pixar movies released in the last five years, according to Bernstein.Yet Brian Roberts, Comcast\u2019s chief executive, has deeper pockets. A bid of, say, \u00a316 per share would push the cable group\u2019s net debt to 3.1 times 2019 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with 3.7 for Disney, according to Breakingviews calculations. Mr. Roberts is eyeing international expansion through Sky and reckons he can slash costs at the combined group.If Comcast wins the auction, Bob Iger, Disney\u2019s C.E.O., would have to decide what to do with the 39 percent of Sky he\u2019s buying from Fox. Accepting the bid would bring in \u00a310 billion or more in cash. But the stake might also prove a useful bargaining chip. Mr. Iger could offer it to Comcast down the road in return for movie and television rights owned by Sky, or some other swap involving Hulu.Until then, the two media giants would be at an impasse. Disney would have economic exposure to Sky but no control over the British group. Comcast would control the board but couldn\u2019t pass special shareholder resolutions without its rival\u2019s support. Crucially, it would lose a share of the dividends paid by the British broadcaster. The joint venture would be an awkward end to an overpriced deal.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Next Downturn Will Surprise Us", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn their campaign to contain the risks that caused the Great Recession, central bankers may have planted the seeds for the next global economic crisis.Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer. After the fall of Lehman Brothers 10 years ago, there was a public debate about how the leading American banks had grown \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d But that debate overlooked the larger story, about how the global markets where stocks, bonds and other financial assets are traded had grown worrisomely large. Today the markets are even larger, having grown to 360 percent of global G.D.P., a record high. And financial authorities \u2014 trained to focus more on how markets respond to economic risk than on the risks that markets pose to the economy \u2014 have been inadvertently fueling this new threat. Central bankers and other regulators have largely succeeded in containing the practice that caused disaster in 2008: risky mortgage lending by big banks. But with so much easy money sloshing around in global markets, new threats were bound to emerge \u2014 in places the regulators aren\u2019t watching as closely.Within the $290 trillion global financial markets, there are hundreds of new risks, pools of potentially troubled debt. Among the most troubling: corporate borrowers and so-called non-bank lenders all over the world.As bank lending dried up, more and more companies began raising money by selling bonds, and many of those bonds are now held by these non-bank lenders \u2014 mainly money managers such as bond funds, pension funds or insurance companies.Among corporations listed on the S.&P. 500 index, debt has tripled since 2010 to one and a half times annual earnings \u2014 near the historic peaks reached during the recessions of the early 1990s and 2000s. And in some parts of the bond markets, debt loads are much higher.One of the big corporate risks is developing largely beyond regulatory oversight. Some United States companies that were publicly traded in 2008 have since gone private, often precisely in order to avoid intensified scrutiny from regulators. Many of those companies were purchased by private equity firms, in deals that leave the companies saddled with huge debts. Right now the typical American company owned by a private equity firm has debt six times higher than its annual earnings \u2014 or twice the level that a public ratings agency would consider high-risk or \u201cjunk.\u201dAt a time when central banks are holding interest rates at record lows, the return from holding plain vanilla corporate bonds is negligible, so investors are more willing to buy junk, for the higher yields. And this hunt for higher returns has been playing out worldwide as asset managers chase higher returns anywhere they can be found, whether in United States private equity or in the bond markets of Europe and emerging economies like Argentina and Turkey.The biggest risks outside the United States are in China, which has printed by far the most money and issued by far the most debt of any country since 2008, and where regulators have had less success reining in borrowers and lenders. Easy money has fueled bubbles in everything from stocks and bonds to property in China, and it\u2019s hard to see how or when these bubbles might set off a major crisis in an opaque market where most of the borrowers and lenders are backed by the state. But if and when Beijing reaches the point where it can\u2019t print any more money, the bottom could fall out of the economy.More broadly, the trigger to watch is the United States Federal Reserve, since many other central banks in the world tend to follow the Fed\u2019s lead in setting interest rates. Over the last 50 years, every time the Fed has reined in easy money by raising interest rates, a downturn in the markets or the economy has followed eventually. It may take a while, but trouble almost inevitably does come.Many doomsayers worried that the Fed tightening that began in 2004 would help prompt a recession \u2014 and it eventually did, in 2008. Though rates are still historically low in the United States, the Federal Reserve began to raise them more than two years ago and is expected to continue tightening them into next year.If a downturn follows, it is more likely to be a normal recession than another 100-year storm, like 2008. Most economists put the probability of such a recession hitting before the end of 2020 at less than 20 percent. But economists are more often wrong than right. Professional forecasters have missed every recession since such records were first kept in 1968, and one of the many reasons for this is \u201crecency bias\u201d: using economic forecasting models that tend to give too much weight to recent events. They see, for example, that big banks are in much better shape than in 2008, and households are less encumbered by mortgage debt, and so play down the likelihood of another recession. But they are, in effect, preparing to fight the last war.To have any chance of anticipating and preventing the next downturn, regulators must look for the threats that have emerged since 2008. They need to recognize that the markets now play an outsized role in the economy, and their attempts to micromanage this vast sea of money have only pushed the risks away from big American banks and toward new lenders outside the banking system, particularly in the United States and China.Markets have grown so large in part because every time they stumbled, central bankers rescued them with easy money. When markets rose sharply \u2014 as they have in recent years \u2014 the authorities stood by, saying they are not in the business of popping bubbles. Now, the markets are so large it is hard to see how policymakers can lower the risks they pose without precipitating a sharp decline that is bound to damage the economy. It\u2019s a familiar problem: Like the big banks in 2008, the global markets have grown \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Edgy Investors Are Retreating From Risky Economies ", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn stark contrast to the U.S., where a bull market continues, investors are pulling out of developing economies as the economic and financial risks mount. Cratering currencies, rising inflation, jumpy investors: A financial panic is again gripping some of the world\u2019s developing economies. When we\u2019ve seen this before \u2014\u00a0in the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, the Thai baht collapse of 1997 and the Russian default of 1998 \u2014 investors had to contend with spillover of trouble from one country to others, dragging down economic growth or causing market stress. ArgentinaOne of South America\u2019s largest economies, Argentina spent much of the last two decades locked out of global markets, in the aftermath of its 2001 financial meltdown.But the 2015 election of President Mauricio Macri was a turning point. He focused on returning the country to the good graces of international investors, by removing restrictions on the flow of capital in and out of the country, and reaching settlements with creditors still owed money since the 2001 collapse.Argentina was able to regain access to the bond market in April 2016, when it raised $16.5 billion from international investors. Once it did, Argentina repeatedly turned to global investors, tempting them with high bond yields and pledges to gradually bring the country\u2019s spending problems under control. TurkeyThe Turkish economy enjoyed a ripping run over the much of the last decade. Growth has averaged roughly 6.8 percent since 2010, beating the world economy\u2019s 3.9 percent and other emerging markets, according to I.M.F. data.But much of that economic pep depended on a debt-fueled bubble. Turkish companies have binged on bonds, much of them denominated in the dollar and the euro. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government has been spending, too, subsidizing big-ticket infrastructure projects. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly railed against high interest rates as the economy shows signs of slowing. And his growing control over economic policy \u2014 he installed his son-in-law as finance minister \u2014 has investors nervous about his strongman approach. President Trump\u2019s August decision to double the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports seemed a catalyst for investors to beat a rapid retreat out of the country. Now, with the lira down about 40 percent against the dollar since Mr. Erdogan\u2019s re-election, companies that are earning lira but have to repay debts in dollars are struggling. Bankruptcies of Turkish corporations are expected to rise, and many economists now think Turkey will soon to fall into a recession.South AfricaBut in recent years, it has benefited from an influx of money from foreign investors. Much of that went to the government, which has tried to offset the nation\u2019s stark inequality \u2014 it is one of the world\u2019s most unequal countries \u2014 with large-scale social spending.As a result, the country\u2019s external debts grew to roughly 50 percent of gross domestic product last year, from 37 percent in 2013. Much of that borrowing has been done via markets, making those investments much easier to dump when the going gets rough.RussiaRussia\u2019s problems with global markets are fairly idiosyncratic. Since January 2017, the Trump administration has mostly continued the Obama administration\u2019s policy of imposing sanctions on individuals with ties to the country, citing issues such as aggression in Ukraine, interference in American elections, support for Syria\u2019s Assad regime, the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter with a chemical weapon in England, and trade with North Korea.As global investors factored in the country\u2019s increased isolation from the world economy, the ruble fell 18 percent this year. (Simply put, less integration and trade with Russia mean less demand for rubles, which you need to buy Russian goods.)A weak currency makes imports more expensive. Russian inflation, while low, has picked up, and interest rates are rising, both of which could be a drag on growth. The Russian government plans to increase government spending in an effort to keep the economy grinding ahead. In theory, Russia\u2019s relatively low debt level \u2014 government debt is less than 20 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 allows it plenty of breathing room to spend more on roads, health care and social welfare, as long as it can dig up the money somewhere.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Where does all this stop? No one is sure. It could be that the countries being battered may simply suffer from unique vulnerabilities to market pressure. It\u2019s also possible that other countries will become the next focus for jittery investors eager to avoid losses. But predicting precisely where things will spread isn\u2019t simple. Sure, there are some clues for what to look for. Investors are already looking askance at countries that owe a lot of money in foreign currency, for example. Screening for that kind of vulnerability would have identified Turkey as a potential problem spot. The amount of such hard-currency debt to be paid off, however, is only part of the story. The level of interest rates, the reliance on foreign borrowers, refinancing needs, the size of government deficits and the stockpiles of foreign currency that can be used to push back market pressures all play a role. Perhaps most important, and most difficult to measure, is a country\u2019s credibility with financial markets. If investors believe a country will continue to pay its bondholders in a currency that retains its value, they will likely put up with even the ugliest-looking levels of debt. If that trust starts to fray, look out below. Advertisement"}

Tesla, which has seen its cash stockpile shrink in recent quarters as its debt has grown, is entering a crucial period in which there can be no qualms about its financial statements.Much rides on Tesla hitting certain financial goals. Mr. Musk said last month that he expected the company to be profitable, under generally accepted accounting principles, in the last two quarters of this year. In less precise terms, Tesla also said it expected to show positive cash flows. Its executives have at times also made predictions about its automotive gross margin, which measures how much revenue is left after subtracting the costs closely associated with producing cars. Because such financial benchmarks are derived from inputs that investors often cannot see, Tesla must have their trust.Mr. Morton could not be reached for comment.It\u2019s possible his resignation signifies little. Mr. Morton was not Tesla\u2019s top accountant; that is Deepak Ahuja, the chief financial officer, who has been at the company for the better part of a decade. And in Tesla\u2019s filing on Friday, Mr. Morton said he had \u201cno disagreements\u201d with the company\u2019s financial reporting. \u201cSince I joined Tesla on August 6th, the level of public attention placed on the company, as well as the pace within the company, have exceeded my expectations,\u201d Mr. Morton said.Big questions remain, though, and his statement is unlikely to assuage investors.Mr. Morton was previously the chief financial officer at Seagate, a company that makes disk drives for computers. When announcing his appointment, Tesla said he would \u201cbring more than two decades of significant financial and accounting expertise to Tesla.\u201d Did he discover that his new working environment was difficult or in disarray? Was there something he was uncomfortable signing off on?There\u2019s a recent reason Tesla\u2019s high-ranking accountants might feel uncomfortable. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating not only Mr. Musk\u2019s tweets musing about taking Tesla private but also the company\u2019s disclosures about certain production goals. Such investigations can broaden.Before Mr. Musk tweeted about going private last month, Tesla\u2019s promises about becoming profitable seemed to reassure investors. Shares jumped nearly 16 percent the following day. But the turbulence since then has only increased the pressure on Tesla. Not only does the company need to deliver on its promises, investors must be able to trust those results.With the latest executive departure, that just became all the more difficult.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Robots Can Manage Your Money. But Even They Need Humans.", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe robots may need some help from humans after all.The rise of so-called roboadvisers has been among the most significant changes to how consumers obtain financial planning advice in the past several years. With low minimum investment requirements and reasonable fees, the automated services have popularized a new way of getting professional help. Customers answer simple questions online, creating investment portfolios that are set on autopilot \u2014 all without much interaction with a person.But a growing number of these online services are adding warm-blooded financial planners to the mix, often at less than half the cost of what a traditional adviser charges.The company\u2019s new product is built on the idea that we seek advice only when we really need it. For some people, it\u2019s when they realize they are financial adults. For others, it may be with the birth of a child who will one day require a college education.Until that moment arrives \u2014 whenever that is \u2014 \u201cpeople are fundamentally lazy and don\u2019t want to work on their finances,\u201d said Jon Stein, Betterment\u2019s chief executive, during an interview at the company\u2019s offices in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. He added: \u201cThis is about making packages of advice available to anyone.\u201dFor those who want guidance from a professional, the online options are multiplying. The big question that looms for roboadvisers, some analysts say, is whether they can make enough money by charging customers so little. In the past few years, several independent online advisers \u2014 including WorthFM, Hedgeable and, after Northwestern Mutual acquired it, LearnVest \u2014 have closed. Others, including Invessence, have switched to selling their technology to other money management firms.Betterment, which has nearly 400,000 customers after eight years in business, says its economics are sound. The company\u2019s new advice packages, which it introduced this week, are geared toward five distinct circumstances: \u201cgetting started\u201d for $149; financial checkup or college planning ($199 apiece); marriage planning ($299); and retirement planning ($399). Even the company\u2019s priciest package is less than a quarter of the cost of a full financial plan from a traditional adviser.The plans differ slightly, but each includes at least one 45-minute phone call with a financial professional who is required to act in the customer\u2019s best interest.The newlywed package includes two 45-minute calls with a certified financial planner and a comprehensive financial plan delivered via email with an \u201caction plan\u201d for the couple to execute themselves. The retirement package includes a one-hour call and a month of email and chat access to a team of Betterment advisers.The new product will potentially help Betterment sell more of its own investment accounts, but company executives said that wouldn\u2019t get in the way of providing sound advice.\u201cAs fiduciaries, we always put our customers\u2019 interest ahead of our own, even if it means not investing with Betterment,\u201d Mr. Holeman said. If, for example, paying off high-interest debt or maxing out a 401(k) before investing with Betterment makes the most sense, that is what Mr. Holeman and his colleagues recommend.Last year, Betterment introduced a premium package for people who want advice on a continuing basis. It requires a minimum investment of $100,000, costs 0.40 percent of the assets being managed plus the cost of investing (0.10 percent of assets on average) and includes unlimited advice from a team of a dozen planners. By comparison, traditional advisers often charge 1 percent or more for such a service.Its cheaper, digital-only service is still the preferred option for the typical Betterment customer, a man in his mid- to late 30s with roughly $120,000 in income and a $40,000 average balance. That costs 0.25 percent of the money managed (there\u2019s also the cost of investments, which averages 0.10 percent) and includes access to the company\u2019s online investing service and tools to help customers gauge whether they are on track to meet specific goals and what may be required to improve their chances of doing so.How does Betterment compare with some of its online competitors that also offer input from advisers with a pulse? Each has a distinct personality and seems to attract a certain type of customer with specific needs. One hurdle, however, is that some of these services require higher minimum investments.The Vanguard service has limitations. When I asked whether it could also make specific investment recommendations for my employer\u2019s Vanguard 401(k), the answer was \u2026 no. The company cited regulatory restrictions. That said, the assets in 401(k) accounts are factored into the overall Vanguard plan, as are what\u2019s in outside accounts. It can also help establish plans geared toward other goals, like saving for college.At a cost of 0.30 percent of assets (investing generally costs another 0.08 percent), it\u2019s a solid service but not quite as comprehensive as the human independent adviser I visited after my son was born. It generally won\u2019t recommend how much term insurance you might need or how expensive a home you can afford. I have, however, found all of the Vanguard planners to be professional and helpful within the confines of what the firm offers.The tools are comprehensive: Planning for college? You can pull up the actual costs of a specific university, estimate what percentage you expect to pay and plan around that goal with a 529 account, even if it\u2019s not held at Schwab. Selling your home in retirement? It can estimate how much you expect to clear, and how that might factor into your planning.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here\u2019s One Emerging Threat That Could Derail the Bull Run", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNothing so far has succeeded in ending the bull run in stocks that began nearly a decade ago.The rally survived the sluggish economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European debt crises, fiscal battles in Washington, the oil bust, concerns about China\u2019s growth and, most recently, President Trump\u2019s trade war.Now the stock market faces a more prosaic but nonetheless powerful threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds.For years, yields on Treasuries were so low that investors had an incentive to buy stocks in the hope of higher returns. Yields are still quite low by historical standards, but they have been rising in recent weeks, and they could go even higher if the Federal Reserve keeps raising its target interest rate. (An increase was announced on Wednesday.)The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen to 3.1 percent, from 2.4 percent at the end of last year, and analysts expect the yield to climb to 3.42 percent by the end of 2019, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. That yield is still far from beating the stock market\u2019s recent annual performances. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose 19 percent last year and is up 9 percent this year. But buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process.Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off. One way to make that comparison is to look at the difference between the yield on the 10-year Treasury and the \u201cyield\u201d on the stock market, measured by dividing the historical yearly earnings of the S. & P. 500 companies by the value of the index. When the earnings yield is substantially higher than the 10-year Treasury yield, investors are more likely to favor stocks. The difference has narrowed. It\u2019s now 1.83 percentage points, well below the 2.88-point average of the past three years.If companies\u2019 profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds. But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year. And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more. In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more. Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.There is a major reason this bearish outcome may not occur. Profits could be stronger than analysts are forecasting.But if companies disappoint investors with lackluster profits, the federal government has an investment it is eager to sell them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Steeper Versus Deeper (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDid finance cause the Great Recession, redux.Opinion ColumnistMy starting point in thinking about the Great Recession and aftermath is that we clearly had a very large housing bubble. Here\u2019s the ratio of housing prices to owner\u2019s equivalent rent, the sort of housing equivalent of the P/E ratio for stocks:Housing prices went extremely high relative to rental rates (and consumer prices more generally), then suffered a long and protracted fall. This decline started well before the period of severe financial distress, which was a fairly short episode from September 2008 to around June 2009. And prices were still way down years later, which suggests that while the credit crisis surely accelerated the pace of decline, prices were going to come down and stay down regardless of what happened to the financial system.Given a housing price slump of this magnitude, you had to expect large macroeconomic impacts: a big decline in residential investment spending, a fall in consumer spending because of the wealth effect, and a decline in nonresidential investment because of the slump in demand brought on by the first two effects.In other words, something very much like the Great Recession seems like an inevitable consequence of the bursting of the housing bubble. And the magnitude of the shocks \u2014 around 4 percent of GDP for housing investment, perhaps around 2 percent for the wealth effects of the decline in home equity \u2014 looks well within the range needed to explain the whole thing.What Bernanke offers is, as I read it, mainly evidence that the pace of decline accelerated a lot during 2008-2009. Indeed it did \u2014 and no reasonable person would deny that the combination of financial disruption and sheer fear that gripped the world after September 2008 brought the slump forward and made the decline steeper than it would otherwise have been.But did it make the decline deeper as well as steeper? The unemployment rate averaged 9.6 percent in 2010 and 8.9 percent in 2011. How much did the financial crisis contribute to these extremely high levels of economic slack, long after the disruption had ended? I still don\u2019t see how to make it the main story.Now, does this mean that rescuing the financial system was pointless? Here Dean Baker and I disagree, I think. Dean says yes, because finance didn\u2019t cause the slump. I think that the slump we had didn\u2019t have much to do with finance \u2014 but the slump we would have had if the financial system had been allowed to implode might have been much worse. On precautionary grounds, bailouts were in my view the right thing to do, although the terms were too sweet for the bankers.On the other hand, the fact that we suffered such a deep, prolonged slump despite rescuing banks shows the limits of a finance-centered view.Advertisement"}
