{"Headline": "Giving Malaria a Deadline", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a new genetic tool, scientists move a step closer to eradicating mosquitoes and the deadly diseases they carry.Malaria is among the world\u2019s worst scourges. In 2016 the disease, which is caused by a parasite and transmitted by mosquitoes, infected 194 million people in Africa and caused 445,000 deaths.But biologists now have developed a way of manipulating mosquito genetics that forces whole populations of the insect to self-destruct. The technique has proved so successful in laboratory tests that its authors envisage malaria could be eliminated from large regions of Africa within two decades.The technique involves equipping mosquitoes with a gene drive, a genetic mechanism that forces a gene of choice into all of an organism\u2019s offspring. (Normally, sexual reproduction would pass the gene to only half the progeny.) Genes carried by a gene drive therefore can spread very rapidly through a population, which makes the technique both powerful and potentially dangerous. No gene drive has yet been released in the wild.Dr. Crisanti and his colleagues instead found a way to target a stretch of DNA that does not vary from one mosquito to another, presumably because each DNA unit plays so vital a role that any mutations would kill the organism. This invariant DNA sequence occurs in a gene called doublesex, which determines sexual development in the mosquito species Anopheles gambiae, one of the major carriers of the malaria parasite in Africa. Dr. Crisanti\u2019s team disrupted the doublesex gene in a way that affects only females. These females develop ambiguous sexual features: they cannot bite because they have male-type mouthparts, and they are infertile. But the males are unaffected and continue spreading the disruptive gene until no more eggs are laid.In the lab, when males with the doublesex gene drive were placed in cages of wild mosquitoes, the populations were driven to extinction in as few as seven to 11 generations. No mutations could be found in the targeted sequence of DNA.\u201cWe are not saying this is 100 percent resistance-proof,\u201d Dr. Crisanti said. \u201cBut it looks very promising.\u201dKevin Esvelt, who studies the evolution of gene drives at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, indicated that the biological aspects of mosquito control may now be close to solution. \u201cWith this achievement, the major barriers to saving lives are arguably no longer mostly technical, but social and diplomatic,\u201d he said.The theory of how gene drives could be used to control pest populations was laid out in 2003, in an article by Austin Burt, a biologist at Imperial College, London, and a co-author on the new paper. He hopes that a small-scale field trial can be started in Africa in five years.Implementing such a program would entail releasing just a few hundred drive-carrying mosquitoes in each village. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have to hit every village, maybe as few as one percent,\u201d Dr. Burt said. Complete eradication isn\u2019t necessary; the malaria parasite can\u2019t maintain its populations once the number of mosquitoes falls below a certain number.\u201cIf there are no unexpected technical or regulatory delays,\u201d Dr. Burt said, \u201cit\u2019s possible to envisage that gene-drive mosquitoes, in combination with other approaches, could have eliminated malaria in significant parts of Africa in 15 years.\u201d Achieving such a goal likely will require a continentwide agreement, since a gene drive, once released, probably couldn\u2019t be confined to a single country, and biologists want to avoid any unintended consequences. All insects analyzed so far rely on the doublesex gene to direct their sexual development. It could be disastrous if an altered doublesex gene drive somehow jumped from mosquitoes to another insect species, such as bees.\u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d Dr. Crisanti said. He noted that every insect species has its own version of both the doublesex gene and the gene\u2019s highly conserved region, so a gene drive aimed at one species wouldn\u2019t work in any other. For that same reason, the technique potentially could be aimed at a wide range of noxious insects, each targeted individually. \u201cThese sequences might be an Achilles heel present in many insect pests,\u201d Dr. Crisanti\u2019s team writes in their paper.Dr. Esvelt acknowledged that the new gene drive could possibly spread to other insects but said that, if it did, the most likely host would be other Anopheles mosquito species. \u201cThe known harm of malaria greatly outweighs every possible ecological side-effect that has been posited to date, even if all of them occurred at once,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Left\u2019s Guide to Reclaiming the Constitution ", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProgressives should not just resist the erosion of important legal gains, but say what they believe the courts should do, and what they believe the Constitution means. Mr. Purdy is a professor of law at Duke.With Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, progressives see a dystopian future: a judicial gavel pounding down for decades on voting rights, workers\u2019 rights, women\u2019s rights and more. But rather than despairing or scheming for 1930s-style court packing, what progressives need most is a constitutional vision of their own, a vivid picture of what judges should do with the power of the courts. At a time when the left is on the offensive in ideas and policies, political struggles are providing a compass for progressive jurisprudence. Progressives should not just resist the erosion of important legal gains, but say \u2014 starting today \u2014 what they believe the courts should do, and what they believe the Constitution means. The centerpiece should be a constitutionalism of strong democracy. Fighting against the vote-suppression efforts of a Republican Party that dominates national politics despite being in the minority in presidential and Senate votes, Democrats are recognizing the extent of disenfranchisement \u2014 of former felons, incarcerated people, Puerto Rican citizens and those whose jobs and family responsibilities keep them from the polls on any given Tuesday. These reforms would tend to benefit progressive candidates, but they are also matters of democratic principle. The best role for the Supreme Court is to help maintain fair rules for the political process, and nothing is more basic than the right of citizens to form their own government.Second, progressive candidates and activists are pressing for a new conception of economic citizenship: universal health and family leave, free higher education, access to union membership and other workplace protections against the power of owners and bosses. That would inform a constitutionalism of economic citizenship. For decades, the Supreme Court has ignored economic power, protecting unlimited campaign spending as a form of speech, undercutting public-sector unions as burdens on the conscience of anti-union employees and upholding \u201cvoluntary\u201d arbitration agreements that sign away workers\u2019 protections against abuse and exploitation. The unifying impulse in these opinions is the libertarian conceit that the free market is really free, not shaped by unequal power and vulnerability. But people aren\u2019t meaningfully free unless they have some security and some option to say no \u2014 that is, some power. Judges should protect unions as essential institutions of worker power. They should treat policies like the Medicaid expansion as essential efforts to achieve economic security, treating them as obviously constitutional in the same way that core civic institutions like jury duty are obviously constitutional. They should hold that federal law does not authorize arbitration agreements where workers sign away basic protections, because those protections are part of the fabric of economic citizenship. Instead of assuming that the law exists to uphold private \u2014 and often unequal \u2014 agreements, they should assume that its job is to help correct inequality. Economic citizenship also has important meaning for abortion rights. All liberal justices support the freedom to choose, but it is worth much less to poor women far from services, as many are in the South and West. Decades ago a divided court ruled that Medicaid and other federal programs can refuse to fund abortion while paying for live births and other reproductive care. This is a breach of the usual principle that government may not penalize people for exercising a constitutional right. (Imagine student loans only for those who agree not to vote.) It is time to reopen this question. Third is a constitutionalism of just criminal justice. Activists are raising a new generation of questions about policing and the prison system: who gets stopped, the system of money bail that keeps arrestees locked up simply because they cannot raise the cash to get out, the ways prosecutors\u2019 offices set priorities, and the widespread and highly unequal incarceration that results. An earlier generation of court rulings established the right to a lawyer for criminal defendants and protections against arbitrary and abusive treatment by the police. Today we need justices who will address a new generation of issues. They should rule that it violates due process of law to languish in jail, away from work and family, because you cannot make bail. They should hold that constitutional equality is offended when white and nonwhite people \u2014 or poor and wealthy people \u2014 have pervasively different experiences of criminal justice. Progressives are winning important victories on these fronts by electing reformist prosecutors, but constitutional rulings can press change throughout the system, not just in sympathetic cities and states. The core work of the law is organizing and disciplining government\u2019s coercive power, and whether that power reinforces racial and economic inequalities or helps to neutralize them is one of the most basic questions for a legal system.Fourth is a constitutionalism that respects the rights of noncitizens. Spurred by President Trump\u2019s nativism, a new wave of mobilization and solidarity with migrants has highlighted the extreme legal, economic and sexual vulnerability of millions of undocumented residents and workers.The courts have long tolerated different treatment of foreigners than of United States citizens and authorized residents. But the family-separation crisis at the border has highlighted the American archipelago of lawlessness that asylum-seekers and unauthorized border-crossers face: little meaningful process, and opaque and seemingly arbitrary decisions with life-or-death consequences. The right to due process of law applies to everyone in the power of the United States government, not just citizens. A progressive jurisprudence would strike down policies like family separation and require a decent, intelligible and transparent process to decide on the rights of noncitizens. It would be more expensive than the present system, but legitimacy is not free.It may seem like pointless fantasizing to plot progressive rulings when the right is tightening its grip on the courts. But these things change quickly: No one expected Mr. Trump to be appointing justices. And the demographic, generational and ideological changes that are reviving the left may well shape decades of politics. Even if the Democrats retake the elected branches, they will face surprises from Mr. Trump\u2019s judges \u2014 like the 2012 decision that undercut the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, in which four conservative justices would have invalidated the Affordable Care Act altogether. And even when the courts don\u2019t stand in the way, progressive reformers will need help from judges. A constitutional vision is also part of how a party defines itself to its constituencies. Republicans have long identified themselves as the party of the Constitution \u2014 that is, their preferred version of it. After years of professionalized and defensive lawyering, the left needs an answer in the same terms.Every political movement has its constitutional visions, from Great Society liberalism to Reaganite economic libertarianism and cultural conservatism. The work now is to define a jurisprudence of economic citizenship, strong democracy and inclusive justice that will help a resurgent left reclaim the Constitution.

{"Headline": "Typhoon Mangkhut Slams Hong Kong and Southern China", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Typhoon Mangkhut battered Hong Kong and Macau on Sunday with 100 miles-per-hour wind gusts, drenching rains and 11-foot surges of seawater that inundated the first urban area of Asia to face the wrath of the year\u2019s mightiest storm.Mangkhut left a swath of damaged buildings and scores of injuries in Hong Kong and Macau before churning across the southern coast of China. Barely a day earlier, it ravaged the northern Philippines and left dozens buried in landslides, including people sheltering in a church and a dormitory for miners.The unofficial count from the Philippine police put the number of dead as at least 59. The death toll was expected to rise as rescue workers continued digging into areas buried by mud, especially in mountainous parts of Benguet Province in the northern island of Luzon. The president\u2019s office said 43 bodies had been recovered from the mine landslide and the search was continuing.Francis Tolentino, a senior adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, estimated that 5.7 million people had been affected by the storm and raised concerns about how aid could be sent to the hardest-hit areas.While the other side of the world was preoccupied with the destructive power of Hurricane Florence as it drenched the Carolinas, Mangkhut hurtled into southern China\u2019s city of Taishan, in the sprawling, densely populated province of Guangdong, making landfall around 5 p.m.The storm headed toward China after making landfall in the northern part of the Philippines.China\u2019s state television reported that at least four people had been killed in the province. As night fell, the full extent of the damage was not yet clear.Meteorologists have called Mangkhut the world\u2019s most powerful storm of 2018, with a span as wide as 550 miles and wind gusts that hit 200 miles per hour last week. At its peak, the typhoon was equivalent to a Category 5 hurricane.For Hong Kong, a metropolis that has shrugged off tropical storms in the past, Mangkhut was different. Though its peak gusts had slowed to 100 miles per hour, Hong Kongers were taking no chances.The typhoon accelerated as it crossed the South China Sea, landing a nearly direct hit on Hong Kong at midday Sunday and sweeping through the city\u2019s canyons of tall buildings.For the first time ever, Macau, the gambling capital nearby, closed its casinos because of a storm, although they reopened on Monday. By the time the winds and rain eased, central parts of Macau had suffered major flooding and 20,000 people were left without electricity.Hong Kong Airport, a central transit point for much of Asia, was virtually shut down on Sunday. Almost 1,000 flights were canceled or delayed, but by Monday the airport had reopened. The outdoor sections of the city\u2019s vaunted subway system were taken out of service.Airports and high-speed railways in Guangdong, too, were shut down, throttling traffic in one of world\u2019s most urbanized and densely populated regions, with 100 million people. By midday, most bridges in the province, which stretches southwest toward Hainan Island, were closed. Schools in the province, along with those in Hong Kong and Macau, have been ordered closed on Monday, when the storm\u2019s effects were expected to linger.China\u2019s state television did not immediately provide details about the four deaths, but they followed reports on social media of people crushed by falling debris in Shenzhen and Dongguan, two cities along the Pearl River near Hong Kong.There were no reports of deaths in Hong Kong, but the government said early Monday that nearly 400 people had sought medical treatment. More than 1,500 people sought refuge in 46 temporary shelters.As the storm reached the mainland on Sunday evening, cities along China\u2019s southern coast seemed eerily vacant, with residents mostly heeding warnings to stay indoors. As in Hong Kong, they had stockpiled water and basic foods on Saturday and Sunday, emptying stores.Guangzhou, the region\u2019s capital and largest city, ordered all restaurants closed to keep people off the streets. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, citing government reports, said that nearly 2.5 million people in the province had been affected in some way, with some seeking protection in more than 18,000 designated shelters.Tens of thousands of fishing boats \u2014 fishing is a main part of the region\u2019s economy, along with chemical and steel works \u2014 were ordered to port in advance of the storm. The authorities detained several fishermen who had defied warnings and put to sea anyway.As the storm swirled through the night, it seemed likely that casualties and damage would grow, with the full impact of the typhoon becoming clearer Monday morning.Mangkhut\u2019s assault on Hong Kong tested a metropolis that has developed intricate safeguards against typhoons. The city\u2019s mountainous terrain typically hinders flooding, and retaining walls on steep slopes prevent landslides.But on Sunday, some were in danger of failing. The Hong Kong Observatory warned people to stay away from steep hills and retaining walls and issued evacuation notices to residents living in areas prone to landslides. Temporary shelters were opened.On Sunday, most residents hunkered down in their apartments, while those in more flood-prone areas took refuge in shelters.As the storm unleashed its full force, the postings became more ominous.Videos showed glass windows and doors smashing, pedestrians blown off the ground and residents frantically bailing rainwater off their balconies to prevent flooding.In the neighborhood of Tai Kok Tsui, video captured the collapse of a crane or elevator shaft affixed to a building construction site. No injuries were reported.A NASA satellite captured the intense rainfall of 2018\u2019s strongest storm so far.Lily Chiu, a 60-year-old caregiver in Hong Kong, had stayed overnight at the nursing home where she worked to avoid commuting to an early shift when the storm hit. Other than the tape on the windows of residents\u2019 rooms, it had been a normal day, with hot meals running on schedule.But this storm felt different.\u201cThese last few hours felt more severe than other typhoons I had experienced,\u201d Ms. Chiu said, after speakers announced that train services to the station near her home had been suspended. She prepared to walk home.In the eastern Hong Kong neighborhood of Heng Fa Chuen, residents of a flooded housing complex linked arms and held hands as they waded knee-deep through pools of rainwater in streets, parking lots and stores.\u201cHow am I going to go home?\u201d one elderly man asked despondently into a phone.\u201cHeng Fa Chuen has become a water reservoir,\u201d May Siu, a longtime resident, said. \u201cI\u2019ve lived here 30 years, and these storms only started looking like this with Hato last year,\u201d Hato was the biggest typhoon last year.Shaking their heads at the snapped lampposts and flooded entryways, residents said that the storm on Sunday had done far more damage than last year\u2019s. Then teenagers rolled up their shorts and prepared to wade home through floating debris.Gerry Mullany and Tiffany May reported from Hong Kong, and Steven Lee Myers from Zhanjiang in Guangdong Province, China.

{"Headline": "To Thwart Iran, Save Idlib", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy is the administration so reluctant to block Tehran\u2019s most dangerous regional gambit?Opinion ColumnistThe Trump administration has made clear that its top priority in the Middle East is to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear and regional ambitions. So why is it so reluctant to lift a finger against Tehran\u2019s most audacious gambit in Syria?That gambit is the reconquest, by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies, of Idlib Province, the last major rebel holdout in western Syria and home to about three million people. A humanitarian catastrophe is expected to follow, entailing mass casualties and another tidal wave of refugees.By now, the strategic consequences should also be obvious. Iran will have succeeded in consolidating a Shiite crescent stretching from Bandar Abbas on the Persian Gulf to the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon. Russia will have succeeded in reasserting itself as a Mideast military victor and diplomatic power broker. Hezbollah, already the dominant political player in Lebanon, will further extend its influence in Syria.The losers in this equation: Turkey, already groaning under the pressure of millions of Syrian refugees and a crumbling economy; Israel, whose repeated strikes against Iranian targets in Syria have dented but not denied Tehran\u2019s ambitions; Europe, which could face yet another refugee crisis even as the effects of the last are felt in the resurgence of the far right; and the Syrian people, terrorized witnesses to the marriage of wickedness and indifference.And then there\u2019s the United States, where two administrations have now allowed the Syrian crisis to become depressing testimony to the worthlessness of our word, the fickleness of our friendship and hollowness of our values. Donald Trump, loudly billing himself as Barack Obama\u2019s opposite in every respect, has effectively adopted his predecessor\u2019s worst foreign policy mistake.The larger goal is to establish that the U.S. has the ability and will to achieve core foreign policy objectives at a relatively reasonable price. Those objectives are to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe; exact an increasingly heavy toll on Assad and his allies for prosecuting their offensive; create leverage for future diplomacy; and demonstrate to regional allies that we can be an effective, engaged and reliable partner, provided they\u2019re willing to do their share.But American policymakers desperately need to learn how to find the middle road between overreaction and inaction; between a missionary zeal to solve other people\u2019s agonies and the illusion that we can remain aloof from them. The Obama administration thought it could largely wash its hands of Syria. It ended up acting as a bystander to genocide, to borrow Samantha Power\u2019s famous phrase.The Trump administration might still think it can fire off a few cruise missiles and the odd tweet in the face of Assad\u2019s depredations. If so, it will wind up as a midwife to the mullahs\u2019 ambitions, however many sanctions the president might otherwise slap on Tehran.The countdown for the siege of Idlib has begun. America\u2019s enemies know the stakes. Do we?Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.In a more virtuous world, Judge Brett Kavanaugh would be deeply embarrassed by the manner in which he has arrived at the doorstep of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.He was nominated by a president who undermines daily the nation\u2019s democratic order and mocks the constitutional values that Judge Kavanaugh purports to hold dear. Now he\u2019s being rammed through his confirmation process with an unprecedented degree of secrecy and partisan maneuvering by Republican senators who, despite their overflowing praise for his legal acumen and sterling credentials, appear terrified for the American people to find out much of anything about him beyond his penchant for coaching girls\u2019 basketball. Perhaps most concerning, Judge Kavanaugh seems to have trouble remembering certain important facts about his years of service to Republican administrations. More than once this week, he testified in a way that appeared to directly contradict evidence in the record. Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s backers in the Senate brushed this off by pointing out that his 2003 statement was factually correct. They\u2019re right, which means that his testimony this week was both disingenuous and meaningless.As we\u2019ve learned with each new trickle of previously withheld documents, Judge Kavanaugh didn\u2019t start misleading senators just this week. It\u2019s only thanks to Senate Democrats and others that we\u2019ve been able to see important pieces of the judge\u2019s lengthy paper trail. There is far more that was never even requested. Far from being embarrassed by all this, Judge Kavanaugh is acting like someone who knows there is virtually nothing he can do to imperil his nomination.Republicans defend their steamrollering by saying that most Democrats have already made up their minds to oppose Judge Kavanaugh. That\u2019s rich: In the months before the 2016 election, multiple high-ranking Republican senators openly vowed to block any and all Supreme Court picks by Hillary Clinton, period. It\u2019s also irrelevant. The people deserve to know everything possible about nominees to a lifetime seat on the highest court in the land, and they depend on their senators to seek out that information and share it.

In 2015, he compared people like me to nuclear bombs.My wife and I, who have raised two children and worked for three decades as teachers and social workers, are surely imperfect souls. But I would humbly suggest that our marriage, and our family, has brought more good into the world than harm and that on the whole our little family does not deserve to be compared to the device that killed nearly 200,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.There hasn\u2019t been a Catholic in my branch of the family since my father left the church in 1940. But I\u2019ve carried my faith with me, in fits and starts, over the years, and several years ago I became a member of the Riverside Church in New York. It\u2019s not Pope Francis\u2019 church, to be sure. But like his, at the center of everything is a hard-won belief in the transformative powers of love and forgiveness.And so it was with equal measures reverence and contempt that we made our way over to the Vatican and joined the line that would lead us inside its walls.That was when the street vendor approached me, selling a shawl for 10 euros. \u201cYou will not be allowed inside,\u201d he said, \u201cwith the bare arms.\u201dI cursed my stupidity. Of course. I\u2019d been to the Vatican before, and I remembered all too well the requirement that women cover their shoulders in the Sistine Chapel. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d forgotten something so obvious.So I bought the shawl (having first haggled him down to six euros) and eventually the doors opened, and we went inside. For three hours we wound through the long corridors of the Vatican Museum and gazed in wonder at its treasures: the gallery of maps; the \u201cApollo Belvedere\u201d; Raphael\u2019s painting of the School of Athens; the \u201cLaoco\u00f6n and His Sons\u201d sculpture of the three Trojans losing a battle with a sea serpent.Still, as we walked along, I felt myself growing crabbier and crabbier. I understood full well the virtue of humility before God. But surely my bare shoulders were minor offenses in the grand scale of things. Surely there have been greater offenses against him.Like: the hundreds of priests who had raped, groped and abused thousands of children in my home state of Pennsylvania; like the condemnation of over 30,000 women to Magdalene laundries in Ireland for the crime of being pregnant, some of them at the hands of their priests; like the centuries of the pursuit of sheer power and wealth at the expense of questing souls who surely, surely deserved a better church than this.That was when the doors opened and we were ushered into the Sistine Chapel at last, a vast space crammed with people, including some very determined guards whose only job was, every two minutes or so, to tell everyone to stop talking and instead to gaze upon the ceiling with the reverence of silence.I stood there in the crush of humanity, gazing upward. There were Adam and Eve, in Paradise, reaching for an apple. I held the hand of the woman I love.For just a moment, everyone was looking up, in silence. We knew that this was one of the greatest achievements of the human spirit, a reflection of the majesty of God\u2019s love.But it was so far overhead, so distant. It was hard to see. Tears shimmered in my eyes, and I wondered, for a moment, if any of this grace could possibly be real.An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the sexual assault allegations against Catholic priests in Pennsylvania. They were made against priests across the state, not in a single parish.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s China Fight Puts U.S. Tech in the Cross Hairs", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says his trade war with China will protect America\u2019s dominance and derail Beijing\u2019s plan for technological and economic supremacy.Mr. Trump\u2019s next round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods goes into effect on Monday, hitting thousands of consumer products from handbags to refrigerators to bicycles. The tariffs will also hit the tech and telecom companies that provide much of the gear that powers the internet, mobile networks, data storage and other technology. United States customs will begin collecting a tax on circuit boards, semiconductors, cell tower radios, modems and other products made and assembled in China and exported into America.Those tariffs, Intel warned in a letter last month, are \u201ca game changer for the American consumer.\u201d The tariffs begin at a rate of 10 percent and increase to 25 percent next January.Like American automakers and other manufacturers, the tech sector has increasingly outsourced production to China, where manufacturing and assembly of products is cheaper than in the United States. In recent decades, Intel, Dell, and Apple began shifting manufacturing overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and align operations closer to customers in emerging markets.Intel, for instance, designs and manufactures most semiconductors in the United States but relies on Chinese facilities for assembly of their chips, which will now be taxed. Moving those manufacturing and assembly operations outside of China is unrealistic, the company has warned, saying \u201cit is too expensive to relocate established and integrated supply chains.\u201dGoogle, Dell, IBM and others say the tariffs will increase costs for companies and consumers, hindering America\u2019s ability to dominate the next generation of technology, like 5G wireless networks. Rising prices, the industries say, will slow business growth, increase costs for consumers and put other nations, like China, in a more competitive position to dominate tech.\u201cThe tariffs affect the heart of the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank financed by tech companies including Microsoft, Google and Intel. \u201cIf we are going to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, we should impose them on items that hurt the Chinese, not us.\u201dMr. Trump does not share that view, seeing the tariffs as a weapon to force China to change trade practices that the administration \u2014 and many companies, including tech firms \u2014 say are unfair.\u201cChina is engaged in numerous unfair policies and practices relating to United States technology and intellectual property \u2014 such as forcing United States companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement last week.Tech companies agree that China has long pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business in China or engaged in outright theft of intellectual property. But they argue that using tariffs as a retaliatory measure will hurt American companies while doing little to change China\u2019s ways.Tech and telecommunications products are among the fastest growing imports from China. In 2014, electronics accounted for 40 percent of all Chinese imports, according to the United States International Trade Commission. While the total value of telecommunications parts affected by the latest round of tariffs is unclear, the Telecommunications Industry Association estimates \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in extra costs for companies.The impact on the industry is amplified by the timing, as the United States and China race one another to dominate the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks, known as 5G. The faster networks will fuel the use of artificial intelligence in driverless cars and robotics and other technologies used by military. Companies have warned that the administration\u2019s tariffs will undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s stated plan to lead in those areas.\u201cThese latest duties threaten to raise the cost of 5G infrastructure in the U.S. by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Nokia officials told the F.C.C., according to public filings.\u201cOf course, this is related to some of the product that we import into the U.S. that is manufactured in China, and we are very much focused on mitigating that manufacturing,\u201d Micron\u2019s chief executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in an interview on CNBC.Other companies are weighing legal options. A leading trade group, the Consumer Technology Association, which represents 2,000 tech companies, said the administration is overstepping its authority on trade policy and is considering legal action against the administration.\u201cWe are exploring all options,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the association\u2019s president, said when asked if his group would sue the administration. \u201cThe tariffs will stifle our global leadership in 5G, create and internet tax on business and cause uncertainty for companies.\u201dThe inclusion of tech products only increased tension between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Silicon Valley has sparred with Mr. Trump on immigration. Mr. Trump accused tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google of political bias against conservatives and Amazon of avoiding tax payments. The companies have refuted the president\u2019s claims.Some companies have been partially spared. After intense lobbying by Apple and Fitbit, the Trump administration removed several consumer electronics products from the latest round of tariffs. Left off the list are technologies that affect Apple\u2019s Watch and other fitness trackers, AirPod earbuds and wireless speakers. The administration spared a total of 300 products from an earlier proposal drafted in July.On Friday, a senior administration official who has been engaged in trade negotiations defended the decision to offer relief to Apple\u2019s products. In a briefing with reporters at the White House, the official rejected the notion that winners and losers were being determined based on lobbying power.\u201cThis has been talked about a lot as an Apple issue, Apple has been very vocal about it, but the tariff lines that have been exempted, they applied to a whole range of companies in addition to Apple,\u201d the official said, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the trade battle with China would be resolved.When asked about the exemptions of Apple\u2019s products, Mr. Cook said that while the iPhone is assembled in China, many parts are made and developed in the United States. The tariffs would cost a company like Apple when it imports devices assembled in China.\u201cI think they looked at this and said that it\u2019s not really great for the United States to put a tariff on those type of products,\u201d Mr. Cook said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Nokia\u2019s headquarters.

B) Took a job teaching at the University of Arizona, where he donated all his salary to the scholarship fund.C) Became a lobbyist for the American Automotive Policy Council, Anheuser-Busch, H&R Block, JW Aluminum, Wal-Mart Stores and others too numerous to mention.It is possible that you are already finding a flaw in Warren\u2019s thinking, in that the number of senators and representatives who could support themselves by being brilliant inventors is \u2026 unlarge. Also, being an actual stock trader requires expertise unless there is somebody giving you inside information.But about the revolving door between Congress and the lobbying industry. You do not want people representing you in Washington with one eye out for a possible future career lobbying for the businesses they\u2019re supposed to regulate. Take the case of former Representative Billy Tauzin, who was the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee in the early 2000s. He worked very hard to expand Medicare to include prescription drugs. (Say thank you to Billy.) He also worked very, very, very hard to make sure the government couldn\u2019t use its massive new negotiating power to bring drug prices down \u2014 the way most sane countries do. (Say what, Billy?) Then, after announcing his retirement in 2004, Tauzin became head of the drug manufacturers\u2019 lobbying arm, PhRMA, at an annual salary of $2 million.\u201cThe impact of money in Washington is felt everywhere. It goes far beyond campaign contributions. The revolving door is at its center,\u201d said Warren.But about closing the revolving door between Congress and lobbying. It would be a stupendous move that would completely change the way many members of Congress think about their careers:\u201cO.K., I\u2019ve put in my time in Washington. Now I\u2019m gonna go home and campaign for the State Senate.\u201d\u201cWell, the new district lines just aren\u2019t going to work for me.

No \u2014 honestly. Just my family. We\u2019re going to get in the R.V. and visit relatives in Toledo. Then there\u2019s a real big basement do-over waiting for me.\u201d Sounds sort of cool, huh? But you know there\u2019s got to be a catch.\u201cThere are going to be ways to sneak around the rules,\u201d said Tim LaPira, a professor of political science at James Madison University and the author of a book on the revolving door. \u201cSecondly, it\u2019s unconstitutional. Lobbying is clearly a First Amendment protected activity.\u201dI say don\u2019t give up the ship, people. This fall when candidates come around asking for your vote, say, \u201cPromise us that when you\u2019re done serving, you\u2019ll come home.\u201d Make them put it on their website. And tell them you want to know how to make the same rules for everyone else. Demand the whole package. If people in Washington think you\u2019re irrational, what the heck.

{"Headline": "\u2018Latent\u2019 Tuberculosis? It\u2019s Not That Common, Experts Find", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthActive infections kill 4,000 people a day worldwide, more than AIDS does. But the notion that a quarter of the global population harbors silent tuberculosis is \u201ca fundamental misunderstanding.\u201dAlthough experts frequently assert that nearly 1.7 billion people carry dormant tuberculosis worldwide, that figure may be a \u201cgross exaggeration\u201d of the real threat, a recent study concludes.(TB has not become more lethal, nor AIDS less so. The difference is that 20 million people, mostly in Africa, are now on H.I.V.-suppressing drugs.)Although the incidence of TB is falling slowly around the world, some regions fare much worse than others. For example, South Africa, Mozambique and the Philippines have especially high infection rates.Drug-resistant TB remains a crisis, the W.H.O. reported, and just three countries \u2014 India, China and Russia \u2014 account for almost half the cases.And the \u201cglobal treatment success rate\u201d is dropping. The figure was 82 percent in 2016, down from 86 percent three years earlier. Experts at nonprofits like the TB Alliance and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease agreed with the major conclusions of the new study and the need to focus on active rather than latent disease. Dr. Ramakrishnan\u2019s study analyzed reports of local TB outbreaks going back to the 1930s, before antibiotics were invented, in places like the Faroe Islands that were so sparsely populated that it was possible to pinpoint exactly who infected whom and when.The misconception that 1.7 billion people are walking time bombs, potentially capable of developing and communicating full-blown TB, comes from the fact that skin and blood tests for the bacterium confirm only that the body once mounted an immune reaction to exposure.The tests do not tell if the bacteria are still alive in the body, said Dr. Paul H. Edelstein, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of the new study. In 1929, 250 German infants were given a TB vaccine that was accidentally contaminated with live bacteria. About a third died, and another third fell seriously ill \u2014 but a third survived unscathed, possibly because they had innate resistance.At next week\u2019s U.N. meeting, member states are expected to pledge to increase efforts to treat the infected and to do more research. The organization has estimated that an additional $3.5 billion a year is needed for tuberculosis treatment, along with over $1.3 billion more for research.The South Africans and the charity wanted the meeting\u2019s declaration to acknowledge that, under international treaties going back to 1994, poor countries may override patents and import generic drugs when they cannot afford prices that pharmaceutical companies charge.

{"Headline": "Modeling in the #TimesUp Era", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are new measures to safeguard young women from predatory behavior, but a wholesale change in the industry remains elusive. For the first time it encouraged fashion houses to, among other things, create private changing areas, the better to guard against models being effectively naked in front of the many makeup artists, hairstylists, photographers, journalists and other random people who work behind the scenes of a show, where the making-of aspect has become as public as the event itself.Most designers tried to comply. Nevertheless, at one show, as at many other shows over the following month in the other fashion cities, the private changing area was more of an ideal than a reality. \u201cThere was a male photographer there taking pictures while girls were getting undressed!\u201d said Edie Campbell, a model. In February, a model from Minneapolis who met with a photographer to work on her portfolio reported him to the police after she said he forcibly touched her near her breasts and genitals. Four other models\u2019 accounts were also described, on Facebook, involving coerced nude photo shoots and suggestive personal commentary with the same man.Interviews with dozens of models, agents and others in the fashion supply chain show that at the very visible top of the fashion pyramid, where brands are global and reputational risk is high, attitudes have shifted (at least when it comes to female models). But the change has not necessarily trickled down into the industry at large.Yet the Model Alliance, a research and policy organization focused on modeling rights, received over 100 calls between October 2017 and July 2018 reporting sexual harassment and assault, according to the group \u2014 an increase of 40 times over the year before.\u201cIt\u2019s been the lawless Wild West, and now we are rebuilding,\u201d said Karen Elson, a longtime model and Model Alliance board member who spoke to The New York Times last year about her experience of harassment early in her career. \u201cIs it changing for the right reasons? Or out of fear? I\u2019m not sure. But even I \u2014 and I\u2019m in a privileged position \u2014 am still scared to name names.\u201d\u201cI had one photographer recently saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to touch your hair now \u2014 I don\u2019t mean anything by it,\u2019\u201d said Jessica Stewart a 23-year-old model from Illinois. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m going to touch your shoulder now \u2014 it\u2019s not sexual.\u2019\u201d She noted that it was a far cry from an experience of a year ago, when a photographer had convinced her to be totally nude for a series of images in bed and used the opportunity to massage her against her will. Jess Cole, a 24-year-old model from England, characterizes the changes as: \u201cWe\u2019re not just clothes hangers anymore. You are a person.\u201d And there have also been logistical changes, including, at LVMH and Kering, contractually preapproved nudity, limiting hours, and making sure no model is left alone with a photographer. Cond\u00e9 Nast and Cond\u00e9 Nast International have committed to not using models under the age of 18. As a rule, guardians accompany models who are between 16 and 18 on set, and agencies such as IMG Models and DNA are dedicated to enforcing this. But the lack of consistent global standards, and debate about the best way forward, has created a sense of ambiguity that has left models in real doubt about the depth of the commitment. While Kering and LVMH approached other companies in Europe and the United States to join their model charter, for example, none signed on. (Lagard\u00e8re, the publishing house, recently agreed.) At the same time, other big brands, including Phillips-Van Heusen, the group that owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Oscar de la Renta, are working on their own versions of the charter. And Ralph Lauren has extended its employee protections to cover contract employees, which includes models. But not one of these companies has publicized the changes, and the differences between them (and why there are differences), are unclear. As a result, there remains no consistent bar for professional conduct, or agreement as to who adjudicates it. At Cond\u00e9 Nast, for example, a violation of the code was recently reported not via the hotline but directly to Helena Suric, the co-director of the talent group and the bookings director at Vogue.\u201cI thought it was a great sign because it showed someone felt confident enough about the code to contact us directly,\u201d Ms. Suric said. She said the violation was investigated, and a decision made that Cond\u00e9 Nast would not work with the bad actor again. The company declined to specify the person, the violation or elaborate on the decision.But the brand continued to use Mr. Templer for ad campaigns, most recently the fall 2018 women\u2019s wear, though it declined to elaborate on the decision-making process beyond the earlier statement. Coach no longer works with Mr. Templer on its shows, but Alexander Wang used Mr. Templer to style its June precollection runway; neither brand responded to requests for comment. That diversity of approach and lack of clarity are two of the reasons that all of the models spoken to for this article said they would be unlikely to complain to a brand about a code-of-conduct violation but would be more likely to go to their agent or to a fellow model. When asked if she had told the executives at Sies Marjan, the brand involved, about the male photographer in its private changing room, Ms. Campbell said she had not because she was concerned about getting a reputation as a \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d(A spokeswoman for the company said: \u201cthe safety and protection of everyone who works with Sies Marjan is of the utmost importance to us,\u201d and that the brand would be increasing security at its coming New York Fashion Week show.) Ms. Quinlivan said she could not know for sure why she was dropped (and the agency, Women Management, did not respond to requests for further comment on the subject), but she noted: \u201cWhen I talked about being trans, they were very supportive. They were much more hesitant when I talked about assault.\u201d When she first raised the issue, \u201cthey shrugged off my concerns and told me that this type of behavior was typical of this individual,\u201d she said. Later, when Ms. Quinlivan continued to be upset, \u201cMy bookers responded to my claims with compassion, but they offered no solutions other than suggest that I not work for the many brands my assailant also worked for.\u201dSergio Leccese, the chief financial officer of Women, said Ms. Quinlivan first mentioned the assault to her agent two months after it had taken place, and that, \u201cmanagement expressed sympathy immediately and recommended two options: to report to the police immediately, and/or to stop working with the party in question on projects going forward.\u201d Whether the models who assumed a connection between Ms. Quinlivan\u2019s complaints and being dropped by her agency are correct, the fact they made it is indicative of the continuing anxiety around what is and is not acceptable in fashion. And that climate allows for additional transgressions.Morgan Allen, a 20-year-old from Minneapolis, was contacted last November by a photographer named Haythem Lafhaj via Instagram, a relatively common way for new models, especially those outside fashion centers like New York, to network with image makers. Ms. Allen met with him a few times to work on photographs for her portfolio without incident, but at a shoot in February, she said, she found herself alone with him. In the middle of the shoot, she said, \u201che started to grab me and pushed me back on a table and continued to touch me around my vaginal area.\u201dShaken, Ms. Allen left. Later she connected with Casey Pearson, a makeup artist who had previously posted on Facebook about Mr. Lafhaj; Ms. Pearson said she had also been sent descriptions of negative experiences other models had had with the photographer, which she also posted. (There were additional models who left comments under the post attesting that they had never had a problem with Mr. Lafhaj). Ms. Pearson convinced Ms. Allen to report her own assault to the police, and when Ms. Allen said she was scared, Ms. Pearson went with her to file a complaint. Mr. Lafhaj said in a statement via email, \u201cwith respect to the allegations of Ms. Allen, I was never aware of any police report or allegations of inappropriate sexual touching or activity. The police never contacted me. I have never been charged with any crime, and most importantly, the allegations are untrue.\u201d He also said he was not in Minneapolis at the time of the alleged incident.Sarah Gant, a 19-year-old model from Nashville who came up to New York to attend a casting for the Alexander Wang show in June, had been in the city only a week or so when Kevin Fitzpatrick, the executive director of Silent, her New York agency, invited her to a get-together where she could meet other models and photographers. That later turned into a trip to a nightclub with him and another model who had arrived in the city from Europe the day before (and whose visa was tied to the agency).At the nightclub, Mr. Fitzpatrick \u201cimmediately started pushing shots on us,\u201d Ms. Gant said. He began to touch them in ways that both women felt crossed a line. Ms. Gant said he was \u201cgrabbing my ass\u201d and calling her \u201cbaby.\u201dMs. Gant reported him to her original agent, who told her not to return to Silent and arranged for her to move to a different agency. The other model, who also confirmed Ms. Gant\u2019s story but asked that her name not be used for fear of reprisals, likewise left the agency and then had to leave the country because she lost her visa, which was sponsored by Silent, in the process.In a statement, Mr. Fitzpatrick said, \u201cto be clear, there was zero physical contact between me and Sarah Gant. I did not touch Sarah at all, nor did I make any attempt to do so. I did not call her \u2018baby,\u2019 speak to her in an inappropriate manner.\u201dHe added that he blamed the incident on Ms. Gant being \u201cunhappy\u201d at Silent, and \u201cas a result needed an excuse to break her contract and manufactured these baseless lies.\u201d Mr. Fitzpatrick described it as \u201csad that a model would stoop to character assasination and weaponize the MeToo movement just to get ahead in this industry.\u201dThere is a general acknowledgment that more work needs to be done. \u201cNot everything is perfect, but it\u2019s going in the right direction,\u201d said Antoine Arnault, the head of group image and communications at LVMH and the driving force behind the model charter there. Mr. Arnault noted that the lack of calls to the hotline made the group wonder if models were reluctant to come forward, and so they have now added a psychologist backstage at every show to provide alternative recourse.Meisha Brooks, a model who experienced multiple financial problems with an agency, including unreliable payments that were not clearly linked to any job and lack of accounting transparency for what she did receive, believes that the financial relationship between models and agencies needs to be addressed in the various codes. Fear about their paychecks means models will do almost anything to secure their career, she said, which fosters an environment where sexual abuse can flourish. Not everyone is so convinced, however. Elite World Group and DNA, both prominent agencies, have pledged cooperation, though DNA has made an exception for those under 18 who have already walked for one season. But while IMG, another influential agency, is considering it, the company is not yet committed. It believes that those years are important to the development of a model\u2019s career if handled properly, according to Ivan Bart, the president of IMG Models and IMG fashion, which is the administrator of the official show spaces of New York Fashion Week, where the company has ensured private dressing areas. Mr. Arnault of LVMH agreed and said he felt strongly that the charter contained meaningful protections for models between 16 and 18 and that to deprive them of those years in what are generally very short careers was to put them at a disadvantage. Besides, he said, it did not prevent models from working with companies that had not signed the charter, and who may treat them less responsibly. This lack of alignment is why Ms. Elson believes such measures leave too much to individual discretion. \u201cThis is a first step,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next step needs to be taking it from piecemeal to an industrywide mission.\u201dIt involves a short educational curriculum for models and puts the onus for protecting models on their agencies. It would use the British Standards Institute (which is recognized in 120 countries) to administer and audit a certification system, currently being constructed, for agencies.It is inspired by worker-driven nongovernmental industry agreements like the Fair Food program and the Bangladesh Accord, both of which were created to address crises and regulate policy in industries populated largely by contract or seasonal workers who are unable to unionize. (This is also true for modeling, since federal law prohibits unions for independent contractors.) Respect was introduced in May with the support of more than 100 models.Both are slowly gaining traction, though neither can claim official industry support. \u201cNo one wants to be the first one to jump,\u201d said Sara Ziff, the founder of the Model Alliance and a model herself. But then, fashion has never been good about centralization. \u201cI\u2019ve had people say it\u2019s going to rob the industry of creativity,\u201d Ms. Elson said.Legal differences among countries are often cited as a potential impediment to creating a global standard. Ms. Ziff doesn\u2019t accept that. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to wait for governments to get involved,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can create a better world through contract law.\u201d Until then, the industry may remain in this risky, fuzzy zone \u2014 one perfectly, if unintentionally, captured by a new eight-episode documentary series from E! that will have its premiere just in time for fashion week. (Review copies of the first four episodes were made available to journalists.)Entitled \u201cModel Squad,\u201d it features nine models at varying levels of success in New York. They try out for the Victoria\u2019s Secret show and the Sports Illustrated swimwear special issue; they attend go-sees, walk during fashion week and party in the Hamptons. It\u2019s replete with Ubers and Champagne, high heels and bikinis, discussions of racism and body issues and endless judgments. It\u2019s reality TV, after all.But there is a moment in Episode 4 that stands out. A model named Ashley Moore, in New York for the first time, goes on a test shoot with Yu Tsai, a photographer who is identified in an earlier episode as holding the keys to the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. First he jokes about Googling her and says, \u201cAm I going to see pictures of you with hot guys, naked?\u201c Later, after a few shots of her in a jacket, he tells her it\u2019s time to do lingerie.\u201cAre you comfortable being naked?\u201d Yu Tsai says.\u201cI think so,\u201d Ms. Moore says.\u201c\u2018Think so\u2019?\u201d the photographer asks, looking skeptical. Ms. Moore seems uneasy, as if she just realized she picked the wrong answer on a test. She quickly amends her response.\u201cYes,\u201d she says.(Asked about the scene, E! did not provide a statement.)At no time on the shoot are they alone. But after everything that has gone on, the fact that this scene is in the show is telling.Advertisement"}

Economic growth and employment have clearly been on a tear since Trump took office. I\u2019m glad about that.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]What if Trump\u2019s tax cuts, deregulation, scrapping of Obamacare without any alternative and military spending surge were actually ill-thought-through, short-term-focused initiatives that all ignored expert opinion \u2014 because they mostly emerged from off-the-cuff remarks at Trump pep rallies \u2014 and collectively amount to a sugar high that not only will be unsustainable but will leave our economy far more vulnerable in the long term?When Trump simultaneously cuts corporate taxes and withdraws America from the Paris climate accord, tries to revive the coal industry by lowering pollution standards and weakens fuel economy standards for U.S.-made cars and trucks, he is vastly adding to the financial debts and carbon debts that will burden our children.And he is doing this at a time when virtually every climate scientist has warned that global-warming-driven extreme weather events \u2014 droughts, floods and wildfires \u2014 are sharply on the rise and we are staring through the last window of time to mitigate climate change so that we can manage the impacts that are already unavoidable and avoid the impacts that will be terrifyingly unmanageable.There were responsible ways to cut taxes on things we want more of \u2014 like corporate investment \u2014 while boosting them on things we want less of \u2014 like carbon, reckless financial speculation and diabetes \u2014 that could have stimulated jobs and growth but also left us more financially and environmentally resilient. But both Trump and the anonymous-G.O.P. crowd rejected them, just as they rejected smart improvements to Obamacare, preferring a total scrapping.So when Republicans say they\u2019re disgusted by Trump\u2019s ignorance and indecency but love his \u201cderegulations\u201d and \u201ctax reforms\u201d \u2014 those very sanitized words \u2014 this is what they love: taking huge fiscal and environmental risks \u2014 effectively throwing away our bumpers and spare tires that we may soon need to drive through the next financial or climate storm \u2014 for a short-term economic and political high.Here again, the anonymous-Republicans equate a bigger defense budget and more weapons with strategy and strength. Thus, by definition, if Trump increased defense spending, he did something right. Did I miss the series of congressional hearings with independent military experts that addressed the question: What are the new (and old) threats we\u2019re facing today, and how will these new and vastly expensive weapons systems enable us to better address them?Some of the smartest military analysts I know think that investing in so many big, new weapons systems is the equivalent of taking sledgehammers to droplets of quicksilver, considering that so many enemies we face today are super-empowered individuals or nations that have opted to hurt us with cheap cyberweapons and cheap but massive swarming tactics.John Arquilla, a senior strategist at the Naval Postgraduate School, likes to say that in today\u2019s networked world \u2014 where ISIS was buying drones from online shopping sites and turning them into aerial grenade launchers \u2014 \u201cmany and small can beat few and large.\u201dThe Chinese, he notes, \u201care building sea power without a traditional navy,\u201d focusing on building hundreds of cheap, small missile and torpedo boats to take on our multibillion-dollar aircraft carriers and flotillas. Moreover, Arquilla notes, \u201cwhen you have such a massive defense budget, you don\u2019t have to ask yourself hard questions\u201d such as: What the hell are we still doing in Afghanistan after 17 years of \u201cfailing to reroute the currents of history and culture there and make the place into a democracy by armed force?\u201dIn sum, I believe in a robust military and U.S. global engagement. But this does not automatically translate into support for a radically higher defense budget.So the next time anonymous-G.O.P. lawmakers tell you that while Trump is a moral wreck \u2014 and they are saving the nation from his wretchedness \u2014 they love his tax cuts, deregulation and military budget, ask them to describe the strategic vision behind that defense budget. Ask them if they really are unbothered by massively increasing the deficit at a time when our economy was already growing \u2014 just when we should be saving cash to soften our next recession. Ask them if they really think it is smart to roll back our auto mileage standards, when the last time we did that the more fuel-efficient Japanese and Korean auto industries nearly killed Detroit.Lastly, ask them if they have kids \u2014 and how they think all these Trumpian policies that they like, even if they don\u2019t like Trump, will serve the next generation.Advertisement"}

But he is frank about the toll his breakneck pace has taken.WAYZATA, Minn. \u2014 On a warm August evening at an outdoor charity rock concert not far from Minneapolis, restlessness overtook Andrew Zimmern.He drives his Audi too fast. He pulls his ball cap low and snakes through crowded restaurants to avoid fans seeking selfies. He hustles through airports like a sled dog with a cellphone.Mr. Zimmern is on the road so often \u2014 on his way to make television about food or give a speech about food or tell business executives what to do about food \u2014 that his head hits his own pillow only about a third of the year. Even when he is home in Minneapolis, the city where he landed 26 years ago strung out, broke and with no options left but one more stint in rehab, he is so tightly scheduled he can\u2019t find time to call up an old friend for dinner.But so far, the opposite is happening. He has never been more successful or more popular.\u201cHe is willing to knock the big rock over to show the squirrelly, wormy bits underneath it,\u201d Ms. Rothman said. Some changes have been subtle. He has quit using the phrases \u201cethnic food\u201d and \u201chole in the wall,\u201d which he came to see as derogatory and steeped in white privilege. Others are more substantial, like taking on a muscular new business strategy. Some are just sad, like trying to unpack why he and his wife, Rishia Zimmern, are getting divorced. The split is difficult but amicable, they say. The couple have a son, Noah, who is 13. Mr. Zimmern is bracingly frank about where his marriage went wrong. They met 18 years ago at a cookware store in Minneapolis and married two years later. He was leaving the restaurant business and starting a career in food media, a shift he thought the would allow him more time to be a family man. It had the opposite effect, especially as his career took off.\u201cI wasn\u2019t there for my wife, and I wasn\u2019t there for my son,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cMy wife gave me a thousand chances to make it right.\u201d He underestimated his own ambition, he wrote, and \u201cthe strange dependence I would come to have surrounding all the attention and the merry-go-round of being a public person.\u201d\u201cWe shared a very, very deep feeling of wanting to get off this crazy roller coaster, but at the same time knowing that this was our work,\u201d Mr. Zimmern said in an interview on the day Mr. Bourdain died.The death has intensified Mr. Zimmern\u2019s quest to learn balance, something he says is elusive for chefs, athletes, actors and other celebrities. \u201cIn all honesty, it\u2019s at the core of what the impostor syndrome is all about,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople telling you all the time how great you are, how much you\u2019ve accomplished, screaming, \u2018We love you! You\u2019re the best!\u2019 from the car speeding by. But at the end of the day, on the inside, you don\u2019t always feel good about yourself.\u201d His solution is to double down on health and sobriety. \u201cI want to be the best dad and the best ex I can be.\u201d He is even pondering politics, which is not a stretch in a state that elected Al Franken, a comedic actor, to the Senate and Jesse Ventura, a retired professional wrestler, as governor.\u201cI\u2019m not opening Lucky Cricket in Flushing,\u201d Mr. Zimmern said, \u201cbut why shouldn\u2019t someone in Des Moines have a good time and a tiki drink and a proper bowl of house-made won tons in chili oil? What could be more fun?\u201dHis philosophy, he says, is \u201cland and expand.\u201d It\u2019s a strategy he honed when he was breaking into television. \u201cBizarre Foods,\u201d it turned out, was a perfect Trojan horse. Slowly, he has turned the ship. The show is still an easy-to-consume hour of travel with unusual food, but now Mr. Zimmern walks more directly into cultural issues like race in America, which he did in a recent episode about the Underground Railroad.\u201cHe has what I call \u2018the grandma effect,\u2019\u201d Mr. Twitty said. \u201cWhen you are there with her, you feel like you are the only, only, only one. And then you realize she is that way with every grandchild and every child and every person she sees. And that\u2019s him.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s like this walking human encyclopedia of food cultures and people,\u201d she said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything he doesn\u2019t know about anything. I could talk to him about retail clothing and he would know something.\u201dBut she, like others close to him, worries about how much time he spends on the road, and how much emotional capital he gives away. \u201cIt feeds him in a very important ways, but because I love Andrew I am concerned about him,\u201d she said. On a July morning, Mr. Zimmern stepped to a lectern in a cinder-block hall, shoved his hands into his jeans pockets and launched into his story. \u201cI have spent my life always trying to game whatever situation I was in,\u201d he began.For the next hour, he laid it all out. Born in Manhattan, an only child, to parents who were divorced by the time he was 5. His father was a world-traveling former Navy man with a big appetite who got into the advertising game and lived much of his life as a closeted gay man. His mother struggled with the effects of brain damage from a botched surgery to remove an appendix scar. She slipped into a coma while Mr. Zimmern was away at camp. When he came home, his father\u2019s advice was never to talk about it. \u201cI thought, \u2018Fantastic,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Zimmern said.He started drinking in earnest then, and became a drug dealer in high school and college, where he drank so much he was hospitalized for alcohol poisoning. He was arrested a lot.He became the indispensable guy who could put out 120 servings of poached eggs for Sunday brunch, or execute perfect risotto no matter how high or hung over.He fell in love with heroin, and his addictions grew so bad that even restaurants didn\u2019t want him anymore. He kicked the drugs, but not the drinking. He ended up living in an abandoned building in SoHo, stealing purses from the backs of chairs at outdoor cafes.\u201cI was the vagrant pushing the shopping cart that people crossed the street to avoid,\u201d he told the inmates.At the end, Mr. Zimmern rented a cheap Manhattan hotel room and started draining plastic bottles of vodka. The idea was to drink himself to death. When that didn\u2019t work, he surrendered. He called a childhood friend for help, and within a few days entered a treatment center in Minnesota.At San Quentin, he told the inmates that he had found a higher power and a purpose: \u201cI want to teach tolerance and love and understanding in a world that doesn\u2019t have enough of it.\u201dAfterward, he hung out at the back of the room, forking through a slab of sugary orange-flavored sheet cake and drinking a cup of blue punch an inmate had scooped from a plastic cooler.\u201cI\u2019m more comfortable here than in the room I\u2019m going to walk into to make television tonight,\u201d he told them.\u201cYou\u2019re good, man,\u201d one inmate answered. \u201cWe got you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Why did the slump go on so long?There are multiple answers, but the most important factor was politics \u2014 cynical, bad-faith obstructionism on the part of the Republican Party.Beyond that, efforts to fight unemployment had to deal with a bizarre Beltway consensus that despite high unemployment and record low interest rates, debt, not jobs, was the real problem.But the most important reason the great slump went on so long was scorched-earth Republican opposition to anything and everything that might have helped offset the fallout from the housing bust.So if you want to understand why the great slump that began in 2008 went on so long, blighting so many American lives, the answer is politics. Specifically, policy failed because cynical, bad-faith Republicans were willing to sacrifice millions of jobs rather than let anything good happen to the economy while a Democrat sat in the White House.Advertisement"}

He lived through the zenith of postwar American power; believed, despite setbacks, in America\u2019s unique capacity to forge a more open and democratic world; and held America\u2019s word as pledge in the cause of liberty.The president of the United States is persona non grata at services that speak of bipartisanship, of American ideals, of self-sacrifice rather than self-interest, of an American global commitment that goes beyond \u201cPay up now!\u201d Trump stands outside the American tradition.In years past, I would watch McCain at the Munich Security Conference. The experience was never less than bracing. Beside him, others seemed mealy-mouthed. He had known the extremes of human experience, lived in full. His voice contained that fullness. He was a man of conviction. He preferred to be wrong than to bend.America\u2019s many failures were as nothing beside American achievement. Stubbornness defined him in an age of finger-to-the-wind opportunism. As a spineless Republican Party folded into the Trump Party, McCain came to stand almost alone as a politician of principle. His party moved. He did not.\u201cI know from personal experience that the abuse of prisoners will produce more bad than good intelligence. I know that victims of torture will offer intentionally misleading information if they think their captors will believe it. I know they will say whatever they think their torturers want them to say if they believe it will stop their suffering. Most of all, I know the use of torture compromises that which most distinguishes us from our enemies, our belief that all people, even captured enemies, possess basic human rights, which are protected by international conventions the U.S. not only joined, but for the most part authored.\u201dAn important voice for \u201cbasic human rights\u201d is gone. Trump does not know what human rights are. That McCain voice could be erratic or impetuous, but it was never petty.I disagreed with McCain about many things: his incorrigible itch to bomb Iran, his bizarre back-and-forth on Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. He ran a comically disastrous campaign as the Republican candidate for the presidency in 2008. His choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate elevated the jingoistic idiocy that has become a Republican hallmark. It was a terrible mistake. The Straight Talk Express, as his bus was named in both his presidential campaigns, has degenerated a decade later into Trump\u2019s \u201ctell-it-like-it-is\u201d Fox News spectacular.I wish I could believe the outpouring of sympathy for McCain marks the moment when principle and bipartisanship will rise above lies and fracture in American politics. But I don\u2019t, at least not in the near term. The nationalist, nativist, xenophobic tide has not yet run its course. In many respects, McCain was a dinosaur.That\u2019s because his words from 2017 are out of fashion: \u201cTo refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain \u2018the last best hope of earth\u2019 for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.\u201dThey will resonate nonetheless, beyond \u201cAmerica First\u201d and all that ash-heap-bound Trump drivel.Advertisement"}

She crept into her kitchen and spotted the culprit \u2014 long white neck, red-rimmed eyes, yellow-webbed feet \u2014 stabbing its beak into a garbage bag.Growing up in Sicily, Ms. Tripi always had a romantic vision of sea gulls, but now she was face to face with a predator that has aggressively colonized a city a good 20 miles from the sea. She threw a slipper. It ignored her. She lifted a second slipper. It cawed violently, took flight and charged.\u201cArrivederci, you win,\u201d she thought as she ran out of the kitchen, closing the door behind her.As her cat cowered, wetting the couch, she banged on the door to scare off a bird she described as \u201cenormous, above my knee, as big as an American wild turkey.\u201d But it stayed \u201clike it was its place\u201d she said, until it was done eating and flew back out the window.But the sea gulls aren\u2019t complaining about the overgrown spaces and free food, and their raucous sundown ritual of circling over the Forum and Palatine Hill does not augur well for Rome.\u201cWe\u2019ve told them Rome is their home,\u201d said Francesca Manzia, the director of the Italian League for Bird Protection in Rome. \u201cAnd they are acting like it.\u201dThe sea gull population in Rome has grown in recent years to the tens of thousands, according to some experts. Their physical dimension has grown, too, as they gorge on the smorgasbord of trash, snack on handouts from complicit tourists and snatch sandwiches from unsuspecting pedestrians.A species with a taste for pigeons, bats, starlings and sometimes other sea gulls, the Larus michahellis protects its territory like a local heavy.If some mayors promise a chicken in every pot, Rome\u2019s have delivered a sea gull atop every garbage bin. The birds, which can live for decades, have settled comfortably in the city\u2019s rooftops, church towers and ancient ruins. Their shrill squawks, sounding like a flock of colicky babies, pierce the evening sky.\u201cOnce in contact with a new species \u2014 us \u2014 they have learned to respond,\u201d said Ms. Manzia, who explained that sea gulls interpret human handouts as a sign of submission. \u201cThey think, \u2018O.K., this is my territory now.\u2019 \u201d\u201cThe city says, \u2018Impossible,\u2019 \u201d she said.And so, at a recent performance of \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in the Baths of Caracalla, an ancient ruin and longtime sea gull haunt, I listened as an operatic duet became a trio with a screeching sea gull.On a rooftop outside the Vatican, where sea gulls have ripped to shreds peace doves released out the pope\u2019s window, I watched as a pair ominously swooped above the purple zucchetto, or skullcap, of the Vatican foreign minister. A couple in the Trastevere district, with a terrace to die for, risk, well, dying on it, as squatting gulls defend it beak and talon.This avian onslaught has spurred a resistance. Barbara Nat, an architect, saw the birds shredding the garbage bags under her balcony by the Circus Maximus and grabbed three oranges from the kitchen. She fired them at the birds and connected. \u201cIt felt good,\u201d she said.Ms. Nat, like many Romans, is convinced the Roman gulls have mutated into monstrous proportions. But experts insist they seem bigger only because humans are not accustomed to seeing them up close. Not everyone is buying it.\u201cThat\u2019s not a sea gull,\u201d shouted Joe Potenza, as he sidestepped two large birds fighting over pizza scraps on the Bridge of Angels. Mr. Potenza said the sea gulls in his native Melbourne, Australia, were half the size of their Roman cousins, which are big enough, he worried, to \u201cbite your hand off.\u201dResidents responded angrily. \u201cThanks for giving a lousy image of a city that is always more mired in ugliness,\u201d read one comment. The administration took down the post, apologized and substituted it with its procedures \u201cto reduce the sea gulls in the city.\u201dBut the sea gull, while taking a post-breeding season breather in the late summer and fall, doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere, and like the she-wolf before it, has its own mythic origins.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story and it involves me directly,\u201d wrote Fulco Pratesi, a well-known wildlife advocate, on his blog in 2009.Legend has it that in 1971, a friend of Mr. Pratesi rescued an injured female gull from a Tuscan island and brought it in a shoe box to his office at the Rome zoo. Mr. Pratesi built a home for it in the seal pool and then one spring the injured bird \u201cattracted a wild male gull flying over these parts.\u201d The birds coupled and created a nest out of garbage. The rest is history.Ms. Manzia was incredulous. \u201cIt\u2019s like we don\u2019t come from Adam and Eve,\u201d she said.The arrival, she said, was actually the result of foraging gulls that followed the Tiber River to Rome, and then spread word of the city\u2019s bounty to other birds.At first, the Malagrotta landfill outside the city, Europe\u2019s largest dump until the authorities ruled it unfit to treat waste, drew the gulls in droves. Since its closing in 2013, Rome\u2019s uncollected garbage has picked up the slack. The Vatican has added rare delicacies to the menu.In January 2014, during a Sunday prayer for peace in Ukraine, two children flanking Pope Francis at his window in the Apostolic Palace released two white doves. The pope wished everyone his customary \u201cgood lunch,\u201d and a sea gull, aided by a hooded crow, obliged.\u201cOh God, that was a nightmare,\u201d Ms. Manzia said. \u201cThey called me from all over the world asking, \u2018Is this a bad omen?\u2019 \u201dMs. Manzia said she had repeatedly told Vatican officials that the domesticated white doves are easy prey for the gulls and that traveler pigeons should be used instead, which at least have a chance of fleeing, but the Vatican has stuck with the doves.\u201cIt\u2019s the Vatican\u2019s own fault,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they have a different state with different laws.\u201dBut it\u2019s hard to forgive them their smell.\u201cBeing an animal that eats garbage,\u201d Ms. Manzia said as she walked out of a pungent cage filled with dozens of sea gulls, \u201cthey stink like garbage.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He also questioned the movement against sexual assault and harassment.This is all classic Bloomberg: sincere, but also arrogant and sometimes outrageously out of touch. His remarks disparage the experience of racial minorities and women in America. For someone who may seek the Democratic nomination for president, the stance is particularly inexplicable.Michael Bloomberg can be better than this.If he is serious about running for president, which those close to him believe he is, he needs to show voters that he can learn from his mistakes.He should not only apologize for his administration\u2019s use of stop-and-frisk, he should begin listening seriously to black and Latino voters in a way he never did as mayor, visiting communities of color.

For example, Republicans promised that the Trump tax cut would lead to soaring wages, which hasn\u2019t happened. So are Democrats really credible on health care?Almost five years after Obamacare went into full effect, the answer is a very clear yes. It hasn\u2019t worked perfectly, and its successes haven\u2019t come in quite the form its proponents expected. But it has delivered huge progress, especially in states run by politicians who are trying to make it work.It\u2019s worth remembering what Republicans said would happen before the A.C.A. went online: that it would fail to reduce the number of uninsured, that it would blow a giant hole in the budget, that it would lead to a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of rising premiums and declining enrollment.What\u2019s particularly impressive about Obamacare\u2019s stabilization is that it\u2019s happening despite desperate attempts by Trump and his allies to sabotage his predecessor\u2019s achievement. Republicans have repealed the mandate that was supposed to induce people to sign up for coverage while still healthy, and the Trump administration has done all it can to increase risks and drive insurers out. Yet Democrats built their system so well that it\u2019s still standing despite everything thrown at it.And on the other hand, if Republicans hold Congress this November, they will simply kill Obamacare outright, taking coverage away from millions. If you have a pre-existing medical condition, or a job that doesn\u2019t come with good insurance, be very, very afraid.But the Affordable Care Act really did achieve a lot. And this achievement bears strongly on the current political debate. Basically, Democrats have earned a lot of credibility on health care: They delivered what they promised, and they have showed that they can build systems that work.So are Democrats justified in running as the defenders of American health care? Yes.Advertisement"}

Or is there?Supported byMs. Wiseman is a journalist.The place of suburbs in our collective psyche has been on my mind recently, as last year, with great internal drama, I moved out of the city, got a cat for my daughter \u2014 pets, of course, traditionally being tools for children to practice grief upon \u2014 and settled all the way down. In Britain the idea of suburbia has none of the David Lynchian perversion or drama of the United States. But it\u2019s still thought of as an in-between place, a punch line, where small neat gardens reflect the dimensions of their owners\u2019 minds. Suffocating, but safe. Until a predator shatters the illusion.The first deaths happened in a place called Croydon. A South London suburb that, for David Bowie, \u201crepresented everything I didn\u2019t want in my life, everything I wanted to get away from.\u201d It was a \u201ccomplete concrete hell,\u201d he said cheerfully in 1999. \u201cI suppose it looks beautiful now.\u201d (It doesn\u2019t.)In Michelle McNamara\u2019s true crime best-seller \u201cI\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark,\u201d about her search for a murderer who stalked the California suburbs, it was the lamp-lit detail, more than even the crimes themselves, that stayed with me \u2014 the way the killer prowled his victims\u2019 cul-de-sacs over decades, peering through their windows at night. The most chilling thing was the suggestion that a side effect of suburban architecture is that the houses become stages for roadside audiences after dark, who watch their inhabitants dance from kitchen to sofa, to bathroom to bed. For all the apparent safety of these homes in the sticks, it seems they have the danger built in.We bought our kitten shortly after the burglary, presenting it to our child with a jangly collar and promise of distant grief. \u201cHere you go, love!\u201d I said to my daughter. \u201cDeath! Vaccinated, purring death with green eyes, death that thinks shoelaces are mice.\u201d The suburbs had given us the space to teach our daughter about grief \u2014 there\u2019s only so much loss you can fit in a one-bedroom flat. And the kitten was easy to love. She crept under our duvet at night and slept on my feet. We talked to her in song, and applauded her skill in climbing curtains. It was a couple of months later that I saw the post on a neighborhood website, alongside plant pots for sale, warning that the cat killer had arrived.Eva Wiseman (@EvaWiseman) is a columnist and editor at The Observer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just a Few Pieces of Plastic Can Kill Sea Turtles", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesA new study shows that especially for young turtles, ingesting just a little more than a dozen pieces of plastic in the ocean can be lethal. All over the world, sea turtles are swallowing bits of plastic floating in the ocean, mistaking them for tasty jellyfish, or just unable to avoid the debris that surrounds them.Now, a new study out of Australia is trying to catalog the damage.Worldwide, more than half of all sea turtles from all seven species have eaten plastic debris, estimated Britta Denise Hardesty, the paper\u2019s senior author and a principal research scientist with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Tasmania. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where you are, you will find plastic,\u201d she said.The study examined data from two sets of Australian sea turtles: necropsies of 246 animals and 706 records from a national strandings database. Both showed animals that died for reasons unrelated to eating plastic had less plastic in their guts than those that died of unknown causes or direct ingestion.But the deaths are hard to pin down. \u201cJust because a turtle has a plastic in it, you can\u2019t say that it died from it, except in very extenuating circumstances,\u201d Dr. Hardesty said. Even a single piece of plastic can occasionally cause death. In one case a turtle was found with its digestive tract blocked by a soft piece of plastic; in another, its intestine was perforated by a sharp piece of plastic.In others, a variety of plastic material was found inside their digestive tracts \u2014 as many as 329 pieces in one sea turtle. Because of their anatomy, sea turtles cannot vomit up something once they\u2019ve swallowed it, Dr. Hardesty said, meaning it either passes through their gut or gets stuck.The study\u2019s innovation was to try to determine this inflection point, where the load of plastic becomes lethal, said T. Todd Jones, a supervisory research biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Hawaii.\u201cThere\u2019s always been this question of when is plastic too much?\u201d Dr. Jones said. An animal that swallows a lot of plastic might appear healthy, Dr. Jones said, but might be weakened by plastic in its gut limiting food absorption.Mark Hamann, a turtle expert and associate professor at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, said he hoped that studies like this one would provide a sense of the scope of the problem. In some areas with high levels of plastic pollution, like the Mediterranean and the southern Atlantic Ocean, turtles are unable to avoid the debris, while in other areas it is less of a problem.\u201cWe know individual turtles are dying, but we don\u2019t know yet whether enough turtles are dying to cause population decline, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading to now,\u201d Dr. Hamann said.Jennifer Lynch, a research biologist with the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Hawaii, took issue with the way the study measured vulnerability to plastic.In her own research, she has seen animals that aren\u2019t harmed after swallowing 300 pieces of plastic, so she doesn\u2019t believe that 14 pieces pose such a high risk of death. \u201cThey ate a lot of plastic but it did them no harm,\u201d Dr. Lynch said of the animals she\u2019s examined. \u201cThey swallow it and they poop it out.\u201dThe difference between the two studies, Dr. Lynch said, was the health of the animals. \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong bias in their study toward very sick, dead animals,\u201d she said. \u201cWe looked only at live, healthy animals that died because they drowned on a fishhook.\u201dDr. Lynch said the new study should have focused on the weight of the plastic rather than the number of pieces. A single piece could range from a speck of microplastic to an entire snack bag, she noted.\u201cIt\u2019s just that this magic number of 14 pieces I think is too low,\u201d Dr. Lynch said. \u201cI think we have a lot more to do before we know what concentration of plastic causes physiological and anatomical impacts.\u201dDr. Lynch does agree that sea turtles are eating too much plastic. \u201cWe have to get this pollutant under control if we don\u2019t want to kill half of our sea turtles.\u201dThe vast majority of plastic off Hawaii, she said, comes from the international fishing industry, which is prohibited from dumping its old fishing lines and crates overboard, but often does it anyway \u2014 and faces no consequences. \u201cTeeth is what\u2019s needed,\u201d Dr. Lynch said.Dr. Hardesty said she thinks it\u2019s possible to reduce the turtles\u2019 exposure to plastic with a variety of approaches, from incentives to bans for high-impact, frequently littered items.\u201cThe stuff that ends up in the ocean was in somebody\u2019s hand at some point in time,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Ms. Jaffe is the author of \u201cNecessary Trouble: Americans in Revolt.\u201dIt\u2019s too early to tell whether the Missouri vote is a turning point for labor. But perhaps it\u2019s time to look back at the 2011 Wisconsin labor protests as such a point. Though waves of attacks in state after state on public- and private-sector union organizing followed Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s successful anti-union Act 10, Wisconsin unions have begun to show their power again. This spring\u2019s Red for Ed protests recalled the occupied Wisconsin Capitol in the winter of 2011, and if the Wisconsin public sector has been the bellwether for labor under Janus, there is cause for optimism, if not also a cleareyed assessment of just how hard the work will be.Amy Mizialko, president of the Milwaukee Teachers\u2019 Education Association, said that the union has had to win fights \u2014 despite being legally barred from bargaining over anything other than cost-of-living raises \u2014\u00a0by organizing alongside parents and winning the community over to its side on everything from smaller class sizes to more recess for students. \u201cEven though Act 10 in many ways felt like and was an ending,\u201d Ms. Mizialko said, \u201cit\u2019s a chapter in the book, and there are lots more chapters that come after it. That\u2019s what members have been saying and feeling for seven and a half years \u2014 we\u2019re writing the fight-or-die survival chapter, but we\u2019re not just interested in surviving. We want it all back.\u201d Those workers are changing the way union leaders have thought about political power. \u201cIt is a real challenge to labor leaders to recognize that our strength is in working people \u2014 in withholding our labor \u2014 and not in the statehouse,\u201d Ms. Madeloni said.In New York, retail workers at Verizon Wireless took part in a 2016 companywide strike but have had to fight to keep their union \u2014 in late August, they defeated a decertification vote. To Colin Hull, a worker in the four-year campaign for the union in a mostly nonunion sector, more than money, it was about taking some of the power back from the company. With a newly hostile labor board and courts packed with President Trump\u2019s appointees, union members and workers fights will continue to be long and grueling, but they have realized that it is this or giving in to the erosion of their lives.They are often winning fights against Republicans in power, and their struggles are garnering at least lip service from Democrats considering a presidential run in 2020. But they know that the shift in class power they seek will still, largely, be won in the workplace.   Sarah Jaffe is the author of \u201cNecessary Trouble: Americans in Revolt.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But he believes that Silicon Valley \u2014 already facing something of a crisis of user confidence over issues including privacy and foreign influence \u2014 is setting itself up for a fall.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very significant problem for the Valley,\u201d Mr. Karp, who rarely speaks publicly, said in an interview in his Manhattan office.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you stand up and talk to a Marine or a special operator and explain to them how you have a piece of software that will allow them to come home \u2014 or more likely allow them to come home \u2014 and you\u2019re not going to allow them to use it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a nearly impossible argument to make outside the Valley without people being legitimately pretty upset.\u201dAll of this has set off a quiet \u2014 but growing \u2014 debate across corporate America in the age of Trump: What does it mean to be a patriotic company when you vehemently disagree with your nation\u2019s leader?In truth, the ethical arguments are a diversion. This is political.And there is a real danger in letting politics undermine the storied relationship between the government and Silicon Valley \u2014 Hewlett-Packard built sonar, radar and aviation equipment for the government during World War II, for example \u2014 that has led to much of the innovation we enjoy today.Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School and a member of the Defense Innovation Board, an independent federal advisory committee set up under President Barack Obama, said he believed that the partisanship that was contributing to the debate would ultimately stifle innovation.\u201cI worry that it will stall progress,\u201d he said. \u201cInnovation has been fueled for decades by private-public partnerships. It smacks of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Even if you\u2019re not a fan of the president, you can still serve your country.\u201dMr. Karp, whose parents met at a civil rights demonstration, said he believed that American companies, including those in Silicon Valley, had a moral obligation to support the country and its military, no matter who was living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201cWe\u2019re proud that we\u2019re working with the U.S. government,\u201d he said.Of course, Mr. Karp certainly has an interest in maintaining relationships between the government and the technology sector. Palantir, which uses technology to analyze vast troves of data, was founded with the help of $2 million from the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s venture capital arm, and much of its business model was to use data to help the government in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. But that makes his willingness to be so forthright about his view of the president refreshing when his peers who may have similar views stay quiet.\u201cI obviously am very biased,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a problem if I go to a cocktail party in Silicon Valley because they want to know, \u2018Is it true that your product is used to target terrorists?\u2019 Yes. And some people don\u2019t agree with that. That\u2019s fine, by the way. I don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with that.\u201dHis outspokenness is even more surprising given that a co-founder of Palantir is Peter Thiel, a serial entrepreneur who has publicly supported Mr. Trump.\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the same people,\u201d Mr. Karp said without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to vote for the same people.\u201dStill, even if it is political allegiances that have prompted tech workers to push back, the ethical issues around artificial intelligence are not insignificant. Everyone from Elon Musk to Stephen Hawking has raised questions about technological warfare in the future. But we are still most likely decades away from those extreme kinds of worries being realized.Reid Hoffman, who founded LinkedIn and sold it to Microsoft, where he now sits on the board, said there were real worries about how the government would use powerful technologies like artificial intelligence.\u201cI think that the majority of Silicon Valley people have a strong worry/reflex against weapons,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who is a member of the Defense Innovation Board with Mr. Grant. The Trump administration, he said, has \u201camplified\u201d concerns over \u201cpossible bad government action.\u201dBut Mr. Karp said claims that a president could steer us toward an authoritarian world powered by artificial intelligence were too extreme.\u201cAmerica is a complicated modern democracy with numerous checks and balances so that no one person has the ability to do insane things,\u201d Mr. Karp said. With government work, he added, \u201cyou\u2019re buying into the inherent fabric and structure of the country.\u201dLost in the conversation in Silicon Valley is its own history. The internet itself was originally funded by an arm of the Defense Department that is now called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. As recently as the Obama administration, Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest technology giants embraced roles advising the government.But there is a difference between today\u2019s tech giants like Google and Facebook and those who turned the Santa Clara Valley into Silicon Valley. A bond with the government \u201cwas clearly not part of the founding of the consumer internet in any relevant way,\u201d Mr. Karp said.It is a connection that should be better understood by the employees now pushing for it to be severed. Those bright minds are able to have this debate in part because of the work done by their predecessors.And given the very real questions that have emerged about the benefits \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that the biggest tech companies truly offer society, those workers might want to rethink their position.As Mr. Karp pointed out when we talked about the big technology companies, \u201cIf actually the narrative was \u2018We are helping also with our defense,\u2019 then people would understand the value of these other things\u201d they do.There could come a time when Silicon Valley wishes it was waving that flag.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "James Frey Has Written His First Adult Novel in a Decade", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cKaterina,\u201d James Frey\u2019s first adult novel in 10 years, claims Henry Miller\u2019s \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d as its literary North Star. The first-person narrator, Jay, is a former \u201cBad Boy of American Letters\u201d who has abandoned his self-proclaimed Sisyphean struggle to run a company that \u201cpublishes commercial fiction and creates intellectual property for large media companies.\u201d A jaded Angeleno, Jay is paid \u201cstupid amounts of money\u201d and surrounded by standard-issue signifiers of success \u2014 three cars, two kids, a wife, a pool, a housekeeper \u2014 a fate he bemoans with his agent while poolside at (where else?) the Beverly Hills Hotel.Jay\u2019s ennui is punctuated by the receipt of a series of Facebook messages from a former lover, the titular Katerina, who at first uses an alias to contact him. Shifting between present-day Los Angeles and Paris in 1992, Jay recalls with euphoria his time abroad when the goal was to \u201cbe happy and spend our days in pursuit of pleasure and pain and every form of lust and desire that exists.\u201d The impetus for his sojourn to Paris? A copy of \u201cTropic of Cancer\u201d left for him by his college roommate.Jay is well aware he\u2019s not the first writer or expatriate to have traversed St.-Germain in an alcoholic stupor or a lovesick trance, incorporating homages to literary forefathers like Hemingway, Wilde, Hugo, Fitzgerald, Baudelaire, Beckett and, of course, Miller. But in Jay\u2019s search for \u201ccrazy crazy mad love,\u201d Frey conveys nothing so emotionally evocative that it builds on the work of these predecessors. Rather, the Katerina of Jay\u2019s memory is a shell of a muse: a paper doll with \u201cthick pouty lips like cherry pie\u201d whose history is summed up in a mere paragraph or two. He calls her \u201cModel Girl.\u201d She calls him \u201cWriter Boy.\u201d Their bond, while intended to be emotional, reads as purely carnal: a physical connection that could easily possess its own depths if Frey approached sex with more knowing nuance.Jay and Katerina \u201cKiss. Stare. Smile. Whisper. Laugh. Slow and deep. Fast and hard.\u201d Her vagina is the \u201cmost magnificent most delirious most peaceful\u201d vagina in the \u201centire history of existence,\u201d yet we are never told what it looks, smells or tastes like. Even when wet, Katerina is ever the dry fantasy, tossing off orgasm after orgasm from penetration alone. Each of Jay\u2019s women \u2014 and there are several in the book \u2014 is also suspiciously easily-turned-on. A quickie against a car with a college ex results in simultaneous orgasms that leave her \u201cshaking.\u201d One wonders if our protagonist knows what cunnilingus is at all?The book\u2019s end feels similarly hasty, employing Katerina as more of a prop than a well-developed character. This objectification might serve the book better if Frey used it to question the nature of fantasy love as a reflection of ourselves, and not so much the object of our desires. For a recovering alcoholic and addict, Jay is bafflingly unable to turn that same lens on his emotional life or question the relationships between romantic passion, obsession and compulsion. The reader is left only with a clumsy plot device that is meant to elicit emotion but lacks self-awareness.Jay\u2019s libertine dreams similarly leave the reader cold. He frequently professes a desire to \u201cburn the world down,\u201d but one wonders which world he is talking about exactly. Is it the world of literary formalities, codes and mores? Is it the rules of love, which as he asserts to Katerina are \u201cmade to be \u2026 smashed\u201d? Or is this the resurrection of his rebellious and artistic spirit, which he sold willingly \u201cin the most American of activities, capitalism and commerce\u201d?The fire of this canned sort of mutiny is pitted far too neatly against a hackneyed depiction of social conformity: \u201cGo to school, follow the rules, get a job, work save vote obey.\u201d What\u2019s more, the thematic dichotomy between freedom and responsibility is wrought with far too heavy a hand \u2014 especially when coupled with realizations like \u201cYou have to dream new dreams or you \u2026 die,\u201d or Katerina\u2019s assertion, \u201cIf you burn the world down, it\u2019s very likely you burn yourself in the process.\u201d One wonders what is really being rebelled against.The revelation that Frey\u2019s 2003 book, \u201cA Million Little Pieces,\u201d was not a straight-up work of nonfiction as he had originally presented it led to a conversation around how much of a writer\u2019s imagined life can be viewed as autobiographical. Ultimately, that text was reframed and is today sold as a novel. With \u201cKaterina,\u201d the question of autobiography doesn\u2019t matter so much. Regardless of how true this tale is to Frey\u2019s own personal story, the fictional version cries out for a richer, more succulent imagining.Melissa Broder is the author of \u201cThe Pisces.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Shame of the MeToo Men", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI feel bad for them. Do they feel bad for women?Opinion ColumnistHere\u2019s a confession: I feel bad for a lot of the men caught out by the #MeToo movement.Not all of them \u2014 not Harvey Weinstein or former CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves \u2014 but the slightly less powerful, less overtly predatory schmoes whose gross behavior was tacitly accepted by those around them until, suddenly, it wasn\u2019t. I can only imagine how disorienting it must be to have the rules change on you so fast, to have your reputation obliterated in an instant, to be suddenly unable to do the work that gives you your identity. Shame, in my experience, feels even worse than injustice.So I am not unsympathetic to those who want to begin the fraught conversation about how these men \u2014 and, now, a couple of women \u2014 might redeem themselves and re-enter public life.Before we do that, though, we should clarify a few things. It\u2019s one thing to say that people who have harmed others, and feel remorse, deserve an opportunity to make amends, and shouldn\u2019t be pariahs forever. Most people shouldn\u2019t be defined by the worst thing they\u2019ve ever done.There\u2019s a difference, however, between arguing that someone merits a second chance, and insisting that he didn\u2019t do anything all that wrong in the first place, that his accusers are exaggerating, or that his humiliation makes him the real victim.Maybe this distinction seems obvious, but recently I\u2019ve seen it elided again and again. Last Friday, I flew to Los Angeles to appear on \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher.\u201d Maher\u2019s closing monologue was a call for Al Franken, who resigned from the Senate in January amid allegations of groping, to return to politics. It\u2019s fair to argue that the things Franken was accused of \u2014 pretending to molest a sleeping woman while posing for a photograph, grabbing other women\u2019s butts \u2014 aren\u2019t irredeemable sins, and that he shouldn\u2019t be permanently banished from politics.Instead, Maher disparaged the credibility of the women who spoke out against Franken, and mocked their complaints. \u201cYou know, when you\u2019re a politician, being touchy-feely is kind of part of the job,\u201d he said. (At one point I interrupted him, which you\u2019re not supposed to do in that segment; it was awkward.)[Discover the most compelling features and reporting from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]Public vilification was clearly traumatic for Hockenberry. He writes of going from \u201csomeone recognized on the streets of New York City as a journalist, author, and advocate for people with disabilities\u201d \u2014 he is a paraplegic \u2014 to a man terrified of public reproach. At some points in the essay, he takes responsibility for bad behavior toward female colleagues, some of whom he propositioned. At others he explains it away, ascribing it to out-of-fashion Byronic romanticism. But the most frustrating parts of \u201cExile\u201d are where he casts himself as the victim of the women who spoke out against him.\u201cOnly one of my accusers reached out or responded to my heartfelt queries,\u201d he writes. (Why would they?) Elsewhere he describes his children\u2019s experience of his disgrace as a \u201cpain I wish on no one, not even my accusers.\u201d He invokes his children repeatedly, furious at the toll the scandal is taking on them. Maybe he behaved offensively toward women, he allows, but asks, \u201cIs a life sentence of unemployment without possibility of furlough, the suffering of my children, and financial ruin an appropriate consequence?\u201dReading Hockenberry\u2019s essay, it hit me: I feel sorry for a lot of these men, but I don\u2019t think they feel sorry for women, or think about women\u2019s experience much at all. And maybe that\u2019s why the discussion about #MeToo and forgiveness never seems to go anywhere, because men aren\u2019t proposing paths for restitution. They\u2019re asking why women won\u2019t give them absolution.I\u2019m not interested in seeing these #MeToo castoffs engage in Maoist struggle sessions to purge their patriarchal impulses. But maybe they\u2019d find it easier to resurrect their careers if it seemed like they\u2019d reflected on why women are so furious in the first place, and perhaps even offered ideas to make things better. What ideas? I don\u2019t know, but they\u2019re the ones who are supposed to be irreplaceably creative, and they\u2019ve got time on their hands.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Injudicious Man, Unfit for the Supreme Court", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis was a job interview, not a criminal trial. Kavanaugh, in his fury and pathos, failed the test.Opinion ColumnistWhat America saw before the Senate Judiciary Committee was an injudicious man, an angry brat veering from fury to sniveling sobs, a judge so bereft of composure and proportion that it was difficult not to squirm. Brett Kavanaugh actually got teary over keeping a calendar because that\u2019s what his dad did. His performance was right out of Norman Rockwell with a touch of \u201cMad Men.\u201dThis is what you get from the unexamined life, a product of white male privilege so unadulterated that, until a couple of weeks ago, Kavanaugh never had to ask himself what might have lurked, and may still linger, behind the football, the basketball, the lifting weights, the workouts with a great high-school quarterback, the pro-golf tournaments with Dad, the rah-rah Renate-ribbing yearbook, the Yale fraternity, and the professed sexual abstinence until \u201cmany years\u201d after high school.Kavanaugh swears under oath that he never \u201csexually assaulted anyone.\u201d To entertain even the possibility of it would be to dismantle the entire edifice of his holier-than-thou life. He\u2019s the all-American jock, the model only child. For God\u2019s sake, he contingently, and a little presumptuously, hired four female law clerks to work with him at the Supreme Court, the first (prospective) justice to have \u201ca group of all-women law clerks.\u201dThe words that resonate for me are the very words Kavanaugh used about his mother, Martha, the Maryland prosecutor and trial judge, whose trademark line was: \u201cUse your common sense. What rings true? What rings false?\u201dFor my common sense, Mr. Kavanaugh \u201cdoth protest too much, methinks.\u201d Christine Blasey Ford rang true. I\u2019ll take her \u201c100 percent\u201d over his. She felt no need to yell. Nor did she hide behind a shield of repetition. She did not succumb to pathos (\u201cI may never be able to coach again\u201d). She spoke with a deliberation, balance and humanity missing in the judge.But Kavanaugh\u2019s bleating about due process and presumption of innocence \u2014 his rage at a supposed \u201cnational disgrace\u201d \u2014 misses the point. He failed the job interview. Who would want this spoiled man pieced together on a foundation of repressed anger and circumscribed privilege \u2014 this man who quite plausibly was the teenage drunk near-suffocating Christine Blasey Ford as he ground his body against hers, this man who may now have perjured himself \u2014 occupying a place for life on the highest court in the land?I began this column by describing what America saw on Thursday. But it\u2019s not what all of America saw. Millions of Americans, including President Trump and Senator Lindsey Graham, saw something else: a despicable Democratic Party conspiracy against an innocent and upstanding middle-aged judge, the latest victim, along with his family, of gender politics, the #MeToo revolution, and an ascendant culture dictating that whatever women say must be true and whatever men say must be false.The hearings were a Rorschach test for America\u2019s tribes. They saw what they wanted to see. For Kavanaugh\u2019s supporters, his rage was as good a primal scream for threatened white male privilege as may be imagined. No wonder Trump loved it.A tribal confrontation is not conducive to the establishment of truth. That\u2019s why the F.B.I. investigation is important. Despite Trump\u2019s best efforts to trivialize the everyday lie, facts matter.Addressing the Democrats on the committee, Graham fumed: \u201cYou want this seat? I hope you never get it.\u201d But of course, as Democrats will never forget, Republicans stole a seat. Remember Merrick Garland? There is something so hypocritical in Republican outrage that it would be comical if the issue were not so grave.It\u2019s hard to argue that America\u2019s tribal democracy is not dysfunctional these days, but still the United States is a democracy. Flake\u2019s 11th-hour decision to demand a week\u2019s delay before a full Senate vote to allow the F.B.I. investigation \u2014 a decision driven by conscience over Republican Party allegiance \u2014 is a small act of honor in a tawdry time. It can take a while for democracies to zigzag toward the truth.Kavanaugh has revealed himself to be a man without measure, capable of frenzy, full of conspiratorial venom against Democrats. Justice would not be served by his presence on the Supreme Court.Advertisement"}

Moving north through thinly inhabited areas, no homes were burned as of late Thursday and there were no reported injuries or deaths, according to Chris Losi, a public information officer for the Shasta Trinity National Forest.But the fire closed down Interstate 5, the crucial artery connecting California to the Pacific Northwest. And it was moving very fast: The fire ignited Wednesday and by Thursday evening 22,000 acres had burned.\u201cThe fire is behaving aggressively,\u201d Mr. Losi said. \u201cIn some places 300-foot flames have been observed.\u201dThe Delta Fire is one of 17 major wildfires currently burning in California, according to Cal Fire. On Thursday, officials offered two measures of how much these fires are costing the state and its residents.Ken Pimlott, the director of Cal Fire, told legislators that his agency had nearly run out of money.Mr. Pimlott reported that Cal Fire had already spent $432 million of its budget this year and had only about $10 million left.

En route, the cabdriver, a former U.P.S. deliveryman, guessed the destination and shared a story about how odd it was to bring packages to Infowars, where staff didn\u2019t acknowledge the name of the business on the phone and he had to go through a serpentine process to make a drop.He jabbed his finger at me. \u201cYou have a responsibility. You wrote the blueprint article everybody else picked up where they said, \u2018Alex Jones is the scum of the earth . . . People need to go after Alex Jones, people need to bankrupt Alex Jones, people need to kill Alex Jones,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201c\u2018because he sends people to these parents\u2019 houses and he won\u2019t stop doing it.\u2019\u201dAfter a public outcry, Mr. Jones\u2019s lawyer altered his demand, saying in a hearing in the Pozner case that week that he\u2019d now accept \u201ca dollar\u201d in court costs. Mr. Jones claimed, wrongly, that I hadn\u2019t reported that gesture, \u201csomething that my lawyers have never seen before.\u201d (In court filings before a separate defamation hearing last month, Mr. Jones sought more than $200,000 in court costs from Neil Heslin, another Sandy Hook parent.)Mr. Jones asked whether I\u2019d seen his \u201cFather\u2019s Day message\u201d to the Sandy Hook families, broadcast in 2017. He complained that his on-camera acknowledgment of long-accepted facts got little attention because he\u2019s the target of a mainstream media plot. \u201cI said I thought that the children died and I was sorry for their loss. And I said that I wanted to reach out to them and try to heal things,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that\u2019d be pretty newsworthy, but no newspapers reported it. Pretty amazing discipline to, all in unison, do that.\u201dMr. Jones was wearing a starched, white, too-snug monogrammed shirt and one of his Rolex watches (more on that later). \u201cHumanity will be obsolete by 2050. This is the consensus at Google and Facebook and Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to merge with machines and become gods, but first we\u2019ve got to reduce the world population 90 percent.\u201d I wondered aloud what the Jones family dinner table conversation must be like.Mr. Jones seemed rattled. He stammered and rushed around a cluttered conference room on whose whiteboard was a list of stunts \u2014 \u201cmoving in to Starbucks,\u201d \u201csetting up a safe space\u201d \u2014 that the Infowars team could perform to trigger liberals.Throughout the interview, he\u2019d shake his fist, pause, sigh dramatically, and do imitations, including of my \u201csaucer eyes\u201d as I listened to his repetitive, bigoted and mind-bending claims. I asked Mr. Jones about an excerpt from his show that his lawyer had played during a court hearing in the Pozner family\u2019s defamation case that week: \u201cYou said people can\u2019t go to the Eiffel Tower at night because of the Muslims attacking them.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s cut back tourism massively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Muslims are as a group attacking people because under the Quran there is the house of Islam, and outside of it there\u2019s the house of war.\u201d Mr. Jones advances plotlines using would-be spy lingo like \u201cintel,\u201d going \u201coperational,\u201d and \u201cC.I.A. mis-info.\u201d He calls employees on his show \u201creporters.\u201d The survival of his business now depends on whether he can successfully claim First Amendment protection for theories that real reporting would swiftly debunk. I asked Mr. Jones whether he, as a father, accepted responsibility for what the Sandy Hook families have endured. He got angry.\u201cThe media \u2014 mainstream media \u2014 has 10,000 times the responsibility I do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the main people talking about it.\u201dA couple weeks after the interview, Emily and I read court testimony dated Dec. 18, 2014, a few days after the second anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting. Mr. Jones was in divorce proceedings, and lawyers for his ex-wife were asking him to account for spending more than $317,000 over the previous several months. He\u2019d bought four Rolexes at once, bought jewelry for his girlfriend, spent thousands on restaurant dinners and parties in his rented Austin penthouse. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to restart my life.\u201d During our reporting, Mr. Jones maligned Emily and me by name on his broadcasts, making misogynist comments and false claims about our work, including that we were stalking him and threatening his associates. He left weird voice mail messages, texts and photos on my cellphone. In a discussion of his accusations against me among Mr. Jones\u2019s fans on a non-Infowars Facebook page, a commenter named \u201cScott\u201d suggested that I be mutilated, raped and set on fire. Journalists are accustomed to anonymous threats online. But the families of murdered children are not. Advertisement"}

Supported byOpinion ColumnistIt\u2019s been a long time since I last thought about the Technical Virgins Association.The T.V.A. \u2014 which is not to be confused with the people who generate electricity in the Tennessee Valley \u2014 was a joke my friends and I made up early in our college careers. It referred to the then-popular idea that girls could go as far as they wanted with a boy as long as everything stayed, um, intact.All of this brings us to Brett Kavanaugh, who appears to have been a T.V.A. member.\u201cNever had sexual intercourse with anyone in high school?\u201d asked a Fox interviewer. \u201cCorrect,\u201d said a somber Supreme Court nominee, who added that he had maintained that record for \u201cmany years after.\u201dExcept maybe not.\u201cPerhaps Brett Kavanaugh was a virgin for many years after high school. But he claimed otherwise in a conversation with me during our freshman year in Lawrance Hall at Yale, in the living room of my suite,\u201d tweeted a history professor at the University of Wisconsin.So, people, it sounds as if a young Brett Kavanaugh was bragging \u2014 to virtual strangers \u2014 about having done the deed. That was, of course, before he was nominated to the Supreme Court and became a charter member of the T.V.A.When it comes to the relationship between men and women, we\u2019ve been on a heck of a journey. The sweep of change in my lifetime just knocks me out. First, after a long struggle, the nation accepted the idea that women had the same right to education and job opportunities as men. Then we confronted the fact that if women were going to work in every part of society, shoulder to shoulder with men, we had to do something fast about predatory bosses and male colleagues with grabby hands.Now, it\u2019s sex outside the workplace. Follow the Kavanaugh story and you\u2019re traveling back to the days when men were supposed to try to go all the way and women were supposed to hold the line. If you failed, he got to boast and you were awarded a scarlet letter.By the time Kavanaugh was a teenager we had, at least in theory, gotten past that point. Clearly, everybody didn\u2019t get the message at Georgetown Prep. And maybe not even today in Washington, D.C.\u201cThey were drunk. Nothing evidently happened in it at all, even by her own accusation.\u201dNothing happened at all, since Kavanaugh lost his grip and Blasey escaped. No penetration, no complaints.Cramer is, by the way, running for the Senate against Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat generally regarded as vulnerable in November\u2019s election. The Republicans really want to win there, but not enough to nominate a woman themselves.The party is so embarrassingly short on women in Congress that the Judiciary Committee had to import a \u201cfemale attorney\u201d to question Blasey in order to paper over the fact that every single Republican member is a man. (There are only six Republican women in the entire Senate, and you can\u2019t expect them to be everywhere.)That makes a huge difference. Only women can really call up memories like the ones the Kavanaugh hearing is resurrecting \u2014 of a double standard so unbreachable Trump\u2019s imaginary wall pales in comparison.But he\u2019s still a reminder of the bad old days. The Senate could show the country that even though we\u2019ve got a president who exemplifies all that\u2019s depressing and creepy about male attitudes toward women, we\u2019re still moving on.Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on trial for his life. The question at hand is simply whether the country should give him an extraordinary honor and lifetime power to make decisions that will affect everybody in the land.It\u2019s perfectly fair to just say no.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Teeth Became Tusks, and Tusks Became Liabilities", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBasicsHumans, mice, narwhals \u2014 most mammals rely on ancient genes to produce teeth and tusks. But the tuskless elephants of Africa show that nature can quickly alter the code. GORONGOSA NATIONAL PARK, Mozambique \u2014 We are flying in a Bat Hawk aircraft \u2014 which may be named for a raptor that preys on bats but looks more like a giant, lime-green dragonfly \u2014 and my hair, thanks to the open cockpit, has gone full Phyllis Diller.Scudding above flood plains the color of worn pool table felt and mud flats split like jigsaw puzzles, we dip toward the treetops and see herds of waterbuck scatter with an impatient flash of their bull\u2019s-eye rumps. We are searching for the elusive tuskless elephants of Gorongosa, elephants that naturally lack the magnificent ivory staffs all too tragically coveted by wealthy collectors worldwide. Today, about a quarter of the park\u2019s 700 or so elephants are tuskless, all of them female, and I am determined to catch a glimpse of at least one. Yet a week of ground searches has proved fruitless, and now we are circling in a plane and still nothing and, holy mother of Horton, how can such massive creatures go missing? \u201cThere!\u201d Alfredo Matavele, the pilot, cries triumphantly, pointing toward a cluster of trees. \u201cAnd there!\u201d pointing toward a watering hole. And there and there. \u201cDo you see them?\u201d he demands. Oh yes, I see them. Dozens, scores, cliques and claques of elephants, ears flapping like flags, trunks slowly swinging, and many of their faces decidedly free of ivory eruptions. I have found them at last, my sisters in dental deprivation. Other people may admire elephants for their brains or their complex social lives; I feel a bond with this mutant crew. After all, I\u2019ve learned that we share a basic developmental anomaly, which may well be traceable to the same underlying glitches in our DNA. Elephant tusks happen to be overgrown versions of the upper lateral incisors \u2014 the teeth right next to the front teeth, before you get to the canines. Simply put, tuskless elephants lack lateral incisors. I, too, lack lateral incisors; moreover, the trait runs in families. Tuskless elephants often have tuskless kin. Both my daughter and my younger brother are missing their lateral incisors. No wonder we\u2019ve always had trouble ripping the bark off trees.Scientists do not yet know the precise cause of tusklessness, but they\u2019ve made great progress in deciphering the genetic program behind mammalian tooth development generally. It turns out to be an old and widely shared code. \u201cTooth development has been very conserved during evolution,\u201d said Irma Thesleff, a developmental biologist at the University of Helsinki in Finland. She has found that mutations associated with tooth abnormalities in mice also show up in genetic studies of people with missing or malformed teeth. \u201cElephants are no more different from humans than mice are,\u201d Dr. Thesleff said, \u201cso it\u2019s quite possible that the same gene or genes are involved\u201d in elephant tusklessness and human toothlessness. For example, it could be a typographical error in the genetic code for a signaling molecule called wnt10a. \u201cThis is one of the most commonly mutated genes in humans with missing teeth,\u201d Dr. Thesleff said.And oh, we gap-mouths are everywhere. An estimated 8 percent of the population is missing one or more of the 32 teeth found in the standard adult set, and that figure rises to about 30 percent if you include a natural absence of the four extra wisdom teeth that many people get yanked out anyway. Even more common in humans than a lack of lateral incisors, said Ariadne Letra, an associate professor at the University of Texas School of Dentistry at Houston, is the absence of the lower second premolars, the teeth with two cusps located in the bottom jaw just before the four-cusped molars. (I discovered in the course of reporting this story that my husband was born without his second premolars, so I guess I\u2019m grateful my daughter has any teeth at all.)Through animal studies, scientists have learned that teeth can grow in macabre isolation from other body systems, as though they yearned for a career as novelty dentures at a Halloween party. Isaac Salazar-Ciudad, a theoretical biologist who studies tooth development at the University of Helsinki, explained that if you remove part of the primordial mouth of a mouse embryo and culture it in a dish, it will develop an array of normal-looking mouse teeth. Although the basic genetic program is widely shared, tooth building is also flexible, susceptible to evolutionary influences. Teeth develop through the interaction of two types of embryonic tissue, epithelial and mesenchymal, which early in gestation \u2014 by about Day 28 in humans \u2014 start folding up into each other origami-style to form a series of large and small buds. Those buds can then be sharpened into canines or incisors for slicing into flesh, or flattened and sculpted into molars with any number of cusps for processing high-fiber plants. The core of a tooth, the pulp, holds the blood vessels and nerve fibers, while the bulk consists of a bone-like material called dentin. The outer coating of calcium phosphate enamel is the hardest substance in the body, which is why animal teeth account for a disproportionate share of the fossil record. And when lengthened into structures that breach the boundary of the mouth and grow throughout life, teeth become tusks \u2014 for digging, fighting, hauling, piercing, threat display.The diversity of shapes that teeth can assume, combined with their mineralized hardness, said Dr. Salazar-Ciudad, \u201ccould be why they have been repurposed as tusks and used for so many tasks.\u201dIn most cases, tusks are recast canines, curving to the side and upward in wild boars and warthogs, or drooping down in walruses like Yosemite Sam\u2019s mustache. In narwhals, the unicorns of the Arctic, the tusk is built of a single overgrown canine that penetrates through the narwhal\u2019s left upper lip in a permanent open wound, which ends up hosting tiny shrimplike creatures with an appetite for shed whale skin. The narwhal tusk \u201cis the only straight tusk in nature, and the only spiral tusk, too,\u201d said Martin Thomas Nweeia, a narwhal expert who lectures at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine.Tusks, as a rule, are multipurpose devices. Boars and warthogs apply theirs offensively and defensively, to battle one another during mating season and to gore predators many times their size. Walruses use their tusks like grappling hooks, to haul themselves out of the water and onto the ice, and as weapons against polar bears and in sexual contests \u2014 but not, as commonly believed, to forage for food or pry open oysters. Elephants are the true masters of the Swiss Army tusk. They use their mighty incisors to dig for salts and minerals, to break off branches and get at the foliage, to pry into trees and peel off the bark \u2014 \u201cThey really love to to eat bark,\u201d said Joyce Poole, scientific director of Elephant Voices, a research and advocacy group working at Gorongosa \u2014 to scoop an errant calf out of a mudhole or lift a sleeping one to its feet. They coordinate tusks, trunks and feet to de-thorn acacia trees and soften tough grasses, and they stash leafy branches across their ivory shelves for later consumption. Just as people are left- or right-handed, so elephants have a favored tusk. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to break a branch over a tusk, they use the same tusk repeatedly,\u201d Dr. Poole said. A groove forms in the preferred tusk over time. But it can take two tusks to tangle. From my perch in the Bat Hawk, I watched a pair of large bull elephants spar by locking together their massive tusks, which can weigh well over 100 pounds each \u2014 seven times the weight of an average female tusk. Yet the biophysical properties that make tusks such splendid tools to own have all too often proved their owners\u2019 undoing. People have long coveted ivory for its beauty, ductility and presumed magical properties. The first appearance of narwhal tusks in medieval Europe is thought to have given rise to the myth of the unicorn, and to a mad surge in demand for the nine-foot spiraling spears. Elizabeth I is said to have paid 10,000 pounds for a narwhal tusk, then the price of an average castle. The drive to harvest walrus ivory may well have contributed to the settlement of Greenland in the 10th century, and led to the near extinction of walrus populations around Norway, Iceland and other parts of the North Atlantic.Elephant ivory, however, is considered the finest in the world, and elephants have long been slaughtered to supply it. Despite international efforts to ban the ivory trade, demand still drives a business worth at least a billion dollars a year. The persistence of elephant poaching has prompted researchers to wonder whether elephants really needed their tusks, and whether they might not be better off if the tuskless trait were to spread more widely through the African population. Shane Campbell-Staton, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues have begun systematically comparing tusked and tuskless elephants in Gorongosa, seeking not only to identify the genes involved in tusklessness but also to solve perplexing patterns of inheritance. Dr. Campbell-Staton is also looking at downstream effects of tusklessness. \u201cWe know tusks play an important role in obtaining food,\u201d he said, \u201cso if individuals don\u2019t have that tool, are they using the environment differently, and could those changes have consequences for other animals dependent on elephants as ecosystem engineers?\u201dMaybe, but from the look of it, the tuskless elephants of Gorongosa are thriving. \u201cThey\u2019re in fantastic condition, this is a very good habitat for them, and there\u2019s no indication they\u2019re suffering nutritionally,\u201d Dr. Poole said. Lateral incisors: who needs them? Better by far to keep the poachers at bay.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Life After Roe ", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe need to be clear about what is at stake with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.Ms. Paltrow is the executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women. In the post-Roe v. Wade world described by opponents of legal abortion \u2014 one they imagine Brett Kavanaugh will bring into being if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court \u2014 abortions will be outlawed, but women won\u2019t be arrested and they won\u2019t be treated like criminals. According to this mythology, women were never arrested for having abortions before Roe, and therefore we can count on the same being true after the constitutional protection for abortion is overturned. This is the story they tell, but it is not true.As the Senate begins confirmation hearings this week on Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, it is especially important to refute the skewed vision presented by those who want to see Roe overturned. Let\u2019s begin by looking at a pre-Roe arrest \u2014 and then at the way the legal system has dealt with women even with Roe as the law of the land.In 1971, Shirley Wheeler was pregnant and living in Florida. She was advised by her doctor to have an abortion for medical reasons. Abortion was illegal in most states, including Florida. So Ms. Wheeler did what an estimated one million women did each year at that time: She found a way to end her pregnancy.She paid someone $150 to perform an abortion on her and developed complications. When she began hemorrhaging, she went to the hospital. Someone at the hospital reported her to the police.When she refused to name the person who had performed the abortion, police officers arrested her. Ms. Wheeler was convicted of manslaughter \u2014 a crime with a possible 20-year sentence. The court, however, sentenced her to two years of probation and forbade her to stay out overnight, go to a bar or associate with people \u201cof harmful character or bad reputation.\u201d The court also gave her this ultimatum: Marry the man she was living with in Florida or leave the state in no more than a week and return to North Carolina to live with a different man, her brother.Ms. Wheeler, whose conviction was later overturned, was not alone in being arrested for having an abortion before Roe, but it is true that such arrests were not common. It\u2019s unlikely, however, that would be the case today because our current legal system \u2014 radically expanded through the war on drugs \u2014 is profoundly different from the one we lived with when Roe was decided.In the 1970s, the United States imprisoned approximately 300,000 people, almost all of them men. Today, American prisons and jails hold more than 2.2 million people, and 4.5 million more people are under some form of criminal justice supervision, such as probation and parole.This is not the result of population growth. Between 1970 and 2000, the American population rose by less than 40 percent, yet the number of inmates rose by more than 500 percent. Today, more than 200,000 women are behind bars, in both jails and prisons, and more than one million women are on probation or parole. Looking just at prisons, there has been more than a 1,700 percent increase in incarceration of women since 1973. The majority of them are black and brown.But we don\u2019t have to just imagine future arrests. Such arrests are happening already.The fight about the next Supreme Court appointment is not just about whether abortion remains legal or illegal but also about how many of the six million women who become pregnant each year could be subject to arrest if Roe is overturned.Lynn M. Paltrow is the founder and executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women.Advertisement"}

I watched her \u2014 vulnerable, obliging, guileless (precisely the opposite of what her skeptics suspected) \u2014 and found her wholly believable. If she\u2019s lying, she will face social and professional ruin. Do you believe Kavanaugh? I watched him \u2014 meticulous, wounded, furious (wouldn\u2019t you be, too, if you were innocent of such an accusation?) \u2014 and found him wholly believable. If he\u2019s lying, he will face ruin as well.I found her likable; him, not so much. But likability is not what this is about.Bottom line, I came away from the hearings feeling no more confident than I had the day before of who was being truthful. It was high drama but it was also a wash. What happened Thursday should not prevent Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Senators are within their rights to vote against the nomination out of philosophical differences. But to vote on the basis of a belief in things unseen and unproved is a road to national ruin.What\u2019s the alternative? Democrats demanded an F.B.I. investigation at Thursday\u2019s hearing and now, thanks to Jeff Flake, they\u2019ve been joined by Senate Republicans. I\u2019m all for it, though I doubt it will uncover anything definitive. It could have been completed, with much greater thoroughness, weeks ago if Dianne Feinstein hadn\u2019t concealed Blasey\u2019s allegation from the Judiciary Committee for much of the summer \u2014 a remarkably cynical ploy suggesting motives other than honest truth-seeking.A stronger argument against Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is that we should not elevate to the Supreme Court a nominee over whom there will always be this dark pall of suspicion.I\u2019m sympathetic to this argument, too. If Kavanaugh were to step aside in exchange for a deal in which Donald Trump nominates conservative federal judge Amy Coney Barrett and Democrats agree to vote on her nomination before the midterms, the country might find a chance for compromise, closure, and even a moment of grace.But that\u2019s not likely to happen. And if suspicion based on allegation \u2014 even or especially \u201cbelievable\u201d allegations \u2014 becomes a sufficient basis for disqualification, it will create overpowering political incentives to discover, produce or manufacture allegations in the hopes that something sticks. Americans have a longstanding credulity problem \u2014 9/11 trutherism; Obama birtherism; J.F.K. assassination theories; the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 so the ground is already fertile.We should beware of what will grow in the Senate once this seed is sown. We should beware of what will happen in the country as cultural norms shift toward reflexively believing the accuser.The enduring challenge of liberal societies is to react to such challenges, not overreact. The guardrails against overreaction are based in the presumption of innocence and the legal, institutional and personal norms that bolster that presumption. To deny Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation based on Blasey\u2019s allegation alone \u2014 never mind those of Deborah Ramirez or Julie Swetnick \u2014 is to remove one of the guardrails for all future nominees of whatever party.Is that a good idea? More particularly, is it an idea for liberals to embrace, given that we live in an era in which a right-wing demagogue can mobilize millions of Americans to believe just about anything? When politics becomes solely a matter of \u201cI believe\u201d versus \u201cI believe,\u201d it descends into a raw contest for power. Historically, it\u2019s been fascists, not liberals, who tend to win such contests.It is surely appropriate that Americans should respond to Blasey\u2019s obvious decency, compelling story, and confident memory with an open mind. But if Kavanaugh ends up winning confirmation, it will have much to do with the perception that Democrats never intended a fair process to begin with, toward either the nominee or his accuser; that they treated allegation as fact; and that they raised their sense of belief above normal standards of fair play. This may be the hill they want to die on. The rest of America should be careful not to follow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hundreds of Seals Are Dying on the New England Coast", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesDeaths of gray and harbor seals, in much greater numbers than usual, have been attributed to viruses related to distemper and the flu. Marine mammal stranding agencies always expect to find some sick and deceased animals this time of year, as a percentage of newborn pups fail to thrive after weaning. But the carcasses washing up on New England beaches reveal an epidemic that\u2019s touching all ages, said Katie Pugliares-Bonner, a senior biologist and necropsy coordinator for the New England Aquarium in Boston.\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that was largely concerning \u2014 not only the volume, but the variety of age classes,\u201d she said.Phocine distemper causes lung infections and seizures as it attacks the seal\u2019s brain tissue. Some animals have washed up on beaches still alive, but lethargic and coughing, she said. Infections are more likely to spread at this time of year, when the seals are living in close quarters, she said. Both infections have been detected in seals on the East Coast before, Dr. Goldstein said, although not at the same time. It is theoretically possible though unlikely for viruses to jump species, Dr. Goldstein noted, and dogs have been known to give distemper to seals, though the opposite has not been seen.[To report a stranded or dead seal, call 866-755-NOAA.]\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you see people intervene with animals that are not doing well,\u201d said Ms. Doughty, whose team has responded to more than 400 stranded animals over the last month, including 30 on Sept. 2 alone. \u201cIt\u2019s the ones that show up on populated beaches that you feel bad for. The stress of having people around is not really helpful.\u201dAlthough her Massachusetts stranding team has seen fewer dying and dead animals this week than last, Ms. Pugliares-Bonner said September is usually their busiest month, as more pups are weaned and the seasons change. Both harbor and gray seals have been faring well in recent years and neither species is endangered, Dr. Goldstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad when you\u2019re seeing large numbers affected and dying, but in the long-term, the population should recover,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ebola Attacked Congo Again. But Now Congo Seems to Be Winning", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGlobal healthNew cases are dropping sharply, vaccination is going well and schools are about to open. But it is too soon to declare victory, experts said.Only a handful of new cases appear each week, and the region's two treatment centers, full until recently, now have fewer than 30 patients in their 78 beds.However, it is far too early to relax, health experts warned. \u201cWhile the number of confirmed cases has slowed down lately, we must remain vigilant,\u201d Dr. Ilunga said. \u201cAn Ebola outbreak works in waves, and the first wave hit us hard.\u201dThat wave, he explained, comprised people infected before health workers arrived, and these patients may have infected a second wave of family members, neighbors and medical workers who are still in their incubation periods.If the outbreak does fade out, credit will again go to rapid action by the Congolese government and global health agencies, as well as to a new, highly protective Merck vaccine.One reason experts are reluctant to declare the outbreak contained is that some remote towns have not been visited because of armed groups roaming the area.Thus far, fighting has not hampered the response, said Florence Marchal, spokeswoman for the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the region.But with each new outbreak, medical groups are bringing new technologies and tactics to bear on the disease. For example, in Mangina and Beni, the towns at the epicenter, the Ministry of Public Health immediately sent about 150 hospital staff personnel into home quarantine and replaced them with others who had been trained in donning and safely removing protective gear.To encourage patients to come in, the ministry also made all care at public hospitals free \u2014 for any illness.Then, as soon as possible, health officials vaccinated all medical personnel. Those steps reduced a major risk factor \u2014 medical workers who catch the virus from one patient and unwittingly pass it to others before they themselves collapse. (In the early days of any outbreak, most people coming to hospitals do not have Ebola but malaria, bacterial infections or other crises, like difficult pregnancies.)Soon afterward, Alima, the Alliance for International Medical Action, deployed its new Biosecure Emergency Care Units, which it calls \u201ccubes,\u201d in its treatment center in Beni. The rooms, made of clear, flexible plastic with sleeves, gloves and bodysuits built into the walls, allow nurses to safely perform about 80 percent of the care an Ebola patient needs without having to put on hot, cumbersome gowns, hoods, rubber aprons, boots and goggles.Wearing full gear, caregivers can look terrifying, especially to children.\u201cNow they can see us as human beings,\u201d said Claude Mahoudeau, Alima\u2019s emergency response coordinator.The chambers are air-conditioned for comfort. Also, patients\u2019 relatives can safely sit outside and talk to them.The cubes \u201csound like a very interesting idea\u201d said Leah Feldman, medical coordinator for the Doctors Without Borders treatment center in Mangina, who said she plans to visit Alima\u2019s center soon.Her center keeps patients and relatives separated by two rows of waist-high fencing; those who are bedridden can talk on phones. Families will only bring in their sick if they can see they are well cared for, she said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be that they just go inside and come out later in a body bag.\u201dPreviously, only about half of Ebola patients were saved if they got supportive treatment, including fluid replacement and fever control, in time.Being consistently able to cure most patients would be a terrific advance, experts said, reducing the terrifying aura around the virus to one more like that surrounding cholera. Few Ebola victims have received the experimental treatments, and the results have not been compiled. But \u201cEbola is tricky,\u201d warned Ms. Feldman, a trauma nurse working on her fourth outbreak. \u201cPatients can look like they\u2019re doing better and then crash.\u201dDespite the lull, the International Medical Corps, a nonprofit group of volunteer doctors and nurses, is still working to complete a 50-bed unit in Makeke.Building in such a remote area is not easy. Besides isolation wards, toilets and showers for 50 patients, a center must have a laboratory with generators and freezers, gowning and decontamination areas, screening areas for new patients, bathrooms, kitchens and on-site housing for up to 200 staff. Even before that, the ground had to be cleared and hundreds of yards of dirt road had to be graded. Because it is the rainy season, heavy equipment was bogged down.\u201cWe\u2019re hiring local people to do it with shovels,\u201d Mr. Luu said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Take the Hypocrite\u2019s Oath", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn health care, a determination to deceive voters as much as possible.Opinion ColumnistOn graduation, most medical students swear some version of the ancient Hippocratic oath \u2014 a promise to act morally in their role as physicians. Human nature being what it is, some will break their promise. But we still expect those who provide health care to behave more ethically than the average member of society.So Hawley has responded with ads claiming that he, too, wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions, as supposedly shown by his support for a bill that purports to provide such protection.And the fraudulence of this bill aside, even serious, nonfraudulent regulation of insurance companies isn\u2019t enough in itself to provide affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions. If that\u2019s all you do, those who sign up for coverage will be a lot sicker than those who don\u2019t, which means a bad risk pool, which means high premiums. That was New York\u2019s experience: Before the A.C.A., it had strong regulations on insurers, but high premiums meant that only people with health problems bought insurance on the individual market (as opposed to getting it from their employers), and this in turn kept premiums high.But in this universe, Republicans have decided that they must conceal their intention of taking health care away from those who need it most. So they\u2019re doing what Hawley is doing: resorting to a combination of sabotage and smoke screen. On one side, they\u2019re hacking away at the edges of the Affordable Care Act in the hope that it will implode. On the other, they\u2019re pretending to want the very things \u2014 like guaranteed coverage of pre-existing conditions \u2014 they\u2019re trying to destroy.So let\u2019s be clear about this: If you or anyone you care about suffers from a pre-existing medical condition, Republicans are trying to take away your insurance.

He told Harris he didn\u2019t know everyone who works there, and asked her, in several different ways, who she was thinking of. \u201cI think you\u2019re thinking of someone and you don\u2019t want to tell us,\u201d said Harris, a former prosecutor. \u201cWho did you have a conversation with?\u201d Throughout the exchange, which continued for several minutes, Kavanaugh was evasive. Entering the hearing room on Thursday, Harris told reporters, \u201cI have good reason to believe there was a conversation. Information that I\u2019ve received is reliable and I asked him a clear question and he couldn\u2019t give a clear answer.\u201d[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] He will owe his elevation to Trump, who is in effect an unindicted co-conspirator in a campaign finance crime that helped him achieve his minority victory. There\u2019s every reason to believe that Kavanaugh will shield the president from accountability or restraints on his power. Yet even Republicans who think Trump is a menace are desperate to confirm his judicial pick.What we have here, in miniature, is the corrupt bargain Washington Republicans have made with a president many of them privately despise. They know Trump is unfit, but he gives them tax cuts and right-wing judges. Those tax cuts and right-wing judges, in turn, strengthen the president\u2019s hand, buying him gratitude from rich donors and potential legal cover. Republicans who participate in this cycle seem convinced that the situation is, and will remain, under their control.\u201cWe want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous,\u201d the official wrote, adding, \u201cThere are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more.\u201dOne answer is that they care about the norms of American democracy \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 but not quite as much as they care about the agenda of the Republican Party.If Kavanaugh weren\u2019t confirmed, it would be a profound blow to Trump, and not just because he would look weak and disappoint his evangelical base. Without Kavanaugh, Trump wouldn\u2019t be assured of a conservative majority on the Supreme Court if and when it rules on him and his administration. With Kavanaugh, the tie-breaking vote on the Supreme Court will be a right-wing apparatchik chosen in part for his deference to executive power.A vote for Kavanaugh is thus a vote to give Trump a measure of impunity. Republican senators who know the president is out of control have a choice \u2014 they can maintain a check on his ill-considered autocratic inclinations, or solidify right-wing power on the Supreme Court for a generation. It\u2019s obvious which way they\u2019ll go. Maybe they\u2019ll tell themselves having adults in the room at the White House makes it O.K. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In This North Carolina Coastal Town, \u2018Downtown Is Literally Underwater\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW BERN, N.C. \u2014 There is plenty of past in this city, 308 years of it: colonial governors, Union troops, communities of freed slaves and yes, hurricanes, plenty of them. But none of it, at least nothing that anyone alive could remember, seemed to prepare New Bern for Hurricane Florence.\u201cIt\u2019s been flooding ever since our history started,\u201d said Steve Bengel, who was driving around the inundated city on Friday morning with his wife, Sabrina, a town alderwoman, and looking at one street that had been submerged in five feet of water. \u201cBut not like this,\u201d she responded.New Bern and its 30,000 residents were overwhelmed by Hurricane Florence. Over 360 people had been rescued since Thursday night, from first floors, second floors, attics and rooftops. By Friday evening, the list had started to grow again, with 140 people in need of help.\u201cWith the deterioration of the weather, people are calling back and saying, \u2018The water is creeping back into my home. Can you please come get me?\u2019\u201d said Colleen Roberts, a spokeswoman for the city.Follow our live briefing for the latest developments on Tropical Storm Florence.Places that had never flooded were taking on water, and places that had typically flooded a little were turned into lakes. The two rivers that come together at New Bern, the Neuse and Trent, were both repulsed by a storm surge-swollen Pamlico Sound. Their waters emptied into the streets of the city instead. Comfortable neighborhoods of retirees were filling up along with the city\u2019s poorer districts; most of one public housing complex now sat several feet deep in the engorged Trent River.The onslaught was nowhere near finished. The tide was coming in again, and the rainfall, projected to reach an astonishing 40 inches, was just getting started. The rescues were not finished, either.\u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t come up to the second floor, we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Cynthia Diraimondo, who had left her steadily flooding one-story home on Thursday afternoon to join two families in a two-story dwelling up the street. The water level rose inside the house overnight, reaching about seven feet. It receded a bit by morning, she said, but she knew it would come back again.\u201cWe are praying and hoping for the best,\u201d she said.The badly flooded areas were all around town, not isolated to just one spot, said Jameesha Harris, an alderwoman, who heard from constituents whose relatives had fled to their roofs. \u201cDowntown is literally underwater,\u201d she said.Since a mandatory evacuation was ordered for New Bern earlier in the week, city officials had tried to get word out. They knocked on doors, left fliers and drove the streets broadcasting on fire truck bullhorns. They offered rides. \u201cIf you were even afraid that you might flood,\u201d said Jeffrey T. Odham, an alderman who made the rounds, \u201cthen you probably could flood this time.\u201dThe state had set up a shelter at a National Guard armory two hours inland, and hundreds had gone. Four local shelters had been set up, as well, for last-minute deciders, and they filled up.But still, some people remained. They stayed because they were up there in age, on dialysis, because they did not hear of the mandatory evacuation, because they had faith that God would keep them safe, because they loved their homes and did not want to leave, because it had never flooded badly where they lived.But as Thursday afternoon turned to evening, it had become ever more clear that Hurricane Florence was not going to be like any storm in memory. Surgewaters marched down streets and crept up front porches, knocking on windows and sending people to second floors, then attics, if they had them.\u201cIt was close to dark, I\u2019d say probably 5, 6 o\u2019clock, and these floodwaters were really starting to rise and were rising quickly,\u201d Mr. Odham said.Animated maps and satellite images show the effects of the storm.Friday\u2019s daylight revealed a city largely submerged, and a population stunned and scattered.Gerald Richmond, 35, sat in the darkness of a city parks and recreation bus with a family friend, an older woman in a housecoat. They were alone in the bus, having just decided to evacuate as the water inched up the front porch.\u201cWe didn\u2019t think it was going to be this bad,\u201d he said as the rain pounded on the bus.Essence Keys, 25, left her apartment in Trent Court on Thursday afternoon, walking out the back door as water came in the front. She has been at a nursing home, where she works, ever since. Things have been hectic with the arrival of residents from another home. Her two little boys are in another part of town with her grandmother, who has no cellphone and no power \u2014 and thus no way to get in touch. As for the state of her own apartment, who can say.\u201cI don\u2019t have nothing but the clothes that I had on yesterday,\u201d Ms. Keys said.Overnight, the door to Meghan Margarum\u2019s house flew off, and the ground level started to fill with water. She called a friend, who called 911 and \u2014 told that conditions were too dangerous for rescue operations \u2014 dove into Facebook. Connections were made, friend to friend, and eventually to a group from Texas that arrived at Ms. Margarum\u2019s front door in a skiff on Friday morning.People had to improvise like that.\u201cThe flooding is going to be something that in my lifetime I haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d Mr. Bengel, 62, said. \u201cI have never seen this amount of flooding.\u201dHe and his wife had driven the town, seen his business that has been around for over a century surrounded by water, seen the flooding in Trent Court, looked down streets that descended into water, and had now returned to the downtown historic district of New Bern, \u201ca mix of Charleston and Williamsburg,\u201d as Ms. Bengel put it.\u201cOh gosh, Steve,\u201d she said, looking at the downtown. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad here.\u201dThey looked at the high-tide water mark on a friend\u2019s home \u2014 four feet. The wind was whipping. They drove toward the mall, beyond the historic district, to see how it was holding up. A woman named Linda called on the phone.\u201cWe survived last night. I figure we can survive anything,\u201d Linda said.Ms. Bengel was not so sure. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have at least another 24 hours of rain.\u201d\u201cWell, the Lord looked out for us last night,\u201d the woman on the phone said.Linda, it turned out, was Mr. Bengel\u2019s sister. \u201cShe\u2019s the Eeyore of the family,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, \u2018The sky is always falling.\u2019 Today she may be right.\u201dRichard Fausset reported from New Bern, N.C., and Campbell Robertson from Myrtle Beach, S.C.

Venezuela\u2019s neighbors have been generous in aiding immigrants, but their resources are becoming strained. The government in Caracas hasn't yielded to pressure from its beleaguered neighbors and the United States to ease the crisis. It has also rejected humanitarian aid from international organizations. It acts with such intentional cruelty that it is criminal. The international community should establish a more direct link between migration and corruption. Governments rigidly regulate movement of foreigners into their countries; they should do the same for money. Nations require more documentation from refugees than from dollars derived from corruption. They are stricter when it comes to victims than to their tormentors. The United Nations warned recently that Venezuela\u2019s refugee crisis risks spinning out of control. We urgently need to promote solidarity and tolerance, and crack down on xenophobia.

They offer an opportunity to meet collectors they might not have otherwise encountered, or have access to, and to increase their artists\u2019 visibility within the broader art world. But taking part in fairs is costly, and for many smaller and medium-size galleries, also highly risky. After they pay for the booth space (easily between $50,000 and $100,000), a hotel and transportation and insuring the art, smaller galleries frequently return home with a loss.

{"Headline": "Where Are All the American Orchestra Conductors?", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMusic directors from abroad have had an avenue for advancement unavailable to most homegrown aspirants. One result: a tradition of foreign-born maestros leading U.S. orchestras.Mr. Gelles was for 15 years the executive director of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra.Before winning acclaim as a virtuoso composer and a charismatic popularizer of classical music, Leonard Bernstein attained fame as a conductor. In 1943, still green at 25 and assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic, he took the podium as a last-minute stand-in for an ailing Bruno Walter. With no rehearsal and everything on the line, he saved the day and gained celebrity overnight.Mr. Bernstein was not only an anomaly but also an upstart, an American interloper on European turf. Yet 75 years after his success, we might wonder why his breakthrough has led, perhaps, to a dead end. In a country as vast as ours and as artistically rich in homegrown talent, why have so few American music directors followed in his footsteps?As we embark on a new season of concerts, a look at our leading orchestras reveals a situation similar to 1943. When Mr. Bernstein shot to fame, each of the so-called Big Five orchestras, in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and Cleveland, was led by a foreign music director (born, respectively, in Poland, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Belgium and Austria), as is each today (with conductors from the Netherlands, Latvia, Canada, Italy and Austria).Orchestras in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Los Angeles and even in Washington are led by conductors from Austria, France, Venezuela and Italy. To find American music directors at larger orchestras, you must look to, among other locations, San Francisco, Atlanta and, until recently, St. Louis.There\u2019s no questioning the credentials of music directors from abroad; they are generally impeccable. But these men \u2014 yes, regrettably they are all men \u2014 had an avenue for advancement that is unavailable to most aspiring Americans: As apprentices, most honed their craft into art at one of the opera houses that since the 18th century have spread throughout Europe. Starting as a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur \u2014 a pianist who plays at rehearsals and coaches singers in their roles, who serves as assistant conductor prepping an orchestra for performance and who perhaps matures to full-fledged conductor, learning and leading a stylistically wide swath of repertory \u2014 the young European can be immersed in music-making to an extent only envied by most Americans. A fledgling conductor in the United States might be groomed at one of our exceptional conservatories, independent or university based, but must find a different path to prominence and must overcome an attitude that undervalues musical excellence among native-born conductors.Have you heard of \u201cThe Cultural Cringe,\u201d a seminal 1950 essay by the Australian writer A.A. Phillips? The term, which he coined, refers to an inferiority complex that causes people to overvalue artists in other countries and undervalue those in their own. Mr. Phillips was writing of Australian artists \u2014 writers, painters, actors, musicians \u2014 and their difficulties being judged on their own merits and not measured adversely in comparison with British counterparts. Nowadays, cultural cringe has made it into academe, where examples of the phenomenon are examined by social anthropologists.Michael Tilson Thomas, Los Angeles born and bred, is currently the longest-tenured music director of a major American orchestra. He will end a quarter-century with the San Francisco Symphony in 2020, having unquestionably shown that an American can lead an orchestra to the pinnacle of international success.One explanation of the current situation comes from Hugh Wolff, the former music director of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and currently chief conductor of the Belgian National Orchestra, as well as director of orchestras and teacher of conducting at the New England Conservatory of Music. Though born abroad to Foreign Service parents, he received a blue-ribbon schooling in the United States. Mr. Wolff noted that American orchestras\u2019 hiring of foreign maestros \u201chas kind of been the case for many, many years. But some of us work more in Europe than in the States, which sometimes surprises people. So there\u2019s a free flow of goods and services. Of course I wish there were more young American conductors, but I\u2019m seeing young conductors from all over the world at our festivals and music schools.\u201dMr. Wolff continued: \u201cThe whole art form of concerts, and of orchestras in classical music, is not part of the educational curriculum any more, not part of what young people are expected to learn, and therein lies the nub of the problem.\u201dA different perspective comes from James Blachly, a generation younger than Mr. Wolff and music director of two ensembles \u2014 the Johnstown Symphony Orchestra, in southwestern Pennsylvania, and the New York-based Experiential Orchestra, which he founded. He came to conducting in his late 20s, and rather than pursue a conservatory education, he found mentors and apprenticeships at home and abroad.\u201cThere\u2019s still this idea that you can become an assistant conductor with a major orchestra and get a big break and your career can take off, but the traditional path no longer applies,\u201d Mr. Blachly said. \u201cThe Big Five is one thing, and sure, if the Berlin Philharmonic called, I\u2019d be on the next plane, but there are a lot of other orchestras out there. And for many young conductors, the new route is to start your own ensemble.\u201dThe larger question remains: Where are our American conductors and how do they reach the top tier? Well, you can win a prestigious competition, though most are Europe-based and worldwide in focus, with American contestants heavily outnumbered.More realistically, there are two stages on which young conductors are welcomed: They are our largest and most prestigious orchestras, those included in Group A by the League of American Orchestras, an organization that advocates on behalf of its membership. These major ensembles often engage Americans as assistant or associate conductors, where their role is that of the ever-ready understudy, but where they also might conduct pops concerts and a youth orchestra. Orchestras in Groups B through E, with smaller budgets, shorter seasons and less clout, also engage young Americans, often as music directors, though their exposure, inevitably, is limited.The league is making an effort to bring gifted young conductors before orchestra managements and artist representatives. This past April, in collaboration with the Nashville Symphony, the league hosted the Bruno Walter National Conductor Preview. (That\u2019s the same Bruno Walter, of course, whose illness enabled Leonard Bernstein\u2019s fortuitous debut.) The promise implicit in Mr. Bernstein\u2019s success will be fulfilled only when the agents who manage a maestro\u2019s career collaborate with symphony managements in a conscious effort to place gifted Americans on the most prestigious podiums. Working closely with an orchestra\u2019s leadership and providing guidance that might prove useful, the artist\u2019s manager is essentially a salesman, analogous to a star quarterback\u2019s agent, and plays a crucial role pairing conductors with orchestras. In so doing, an ensemble\u2019s artistic fortunes and public profile are defined.Today two agencies dominate the field: Columbia Artists Management and International Management Group Artists. Together they represent 113 conductors, of whom 24 are Americans, though nine of those make their careers in Hollywood, on Broadway or as pops concert personalities. Absent these nine, that\u2019s a skinny 13 percent of Americans, some recognizable, a majority less so. One possible explanation is that foreign conductors have had more experience and more time to become better known. Another factor might be that the foreign conductor comes to an orchestra with a certain cachet and commands a significantly higher fee than the younger American, which means a fatter fee for the agent. None of this necessarily reflects on the comparative quality of performance.The orchestral enterprise is in transition. In a generally sanguine report from the League of American Orchestras \u2014 \u201cOrchestra Facts: 2006-2014,\u201d the most up-to-date study publicly available \u2014 it is reported that audiences declined 10.5 percent between 2010 and 2014, and in 2013 alone, subscription revenues fell by 13 percent.Should there be doubt that an American maestro is up to the challenge, one need only look to the too few examples of homegrown success, to the likes of Kenneth Schermerhorn and Thomas Schippers, Robert Spano and Michael Tilson Thomas.And, indeed, to Leonard Bernstein.George Gelles has written on music and dance, served at the National Endowment for the Arts and at the Ford Foundation, and for 15 years was executive director of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra.An earlier version of this article misstated the nationalities of six conductors singled out in April for promotion by the League of American Orchestras. Four of the six are American citizens, not two. The article also incorrectly described the nationality of the Philadelphia Orchestra's leader. Its music director, Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin, is Canadian, not European.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kremlin Wants Information. To Get It, Agents Show Up With Flowers.", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 Russia\u2019s vast security apparatus often displays its power through brutal actions: burly police officers in riot gear pummeling protesters or mysterious thugs assaulting and occasionally assassinating opposition politicians and journalists.A gentler, more insidious face of the system, however, belongs to the courteous, smiling, well-dressed man who, carrying a bouquet of flowers, showed up early last month out of the blue at the ninth-floor Moscow apartment of Nataliya Gryaznevich.The man, who introduced himself only as \u201cAndrei,\u201d told Ms. Gryaznevich, a 29-year-old employee of a pro-democracy group called Open Russia, that he would like to invite her out for coffee and a friendly chat. \u201cIt seems that you really like coffee,\u201d he said, hinting that he knew lots of other things about her, too.\u201cHe acted like an old friend I didn\u2019t recognize,\u201d Ms. Gryaznevich recalled.Though initially mystified, she recognized what was going on when they met, and he peppered her with questions about her trips abroad and her foreign contacts. \u201cAndrei,\u201d she realized, was trying to recruit her as an informer.\u201c\u2018Let\u2019s be friends,\u2019\u201d she remembers him urging. \u201c\u2018Think about yourself. You want to make a career, and you can go far with us on your side.\u2019\u201dHer account of the recruitment pitch, which she said was made without menace, opens a small window into one of the most secretive and sinister aspects of Russia\u2019s security system.Known in Russian as stukachi \u2014 literally, \u201cknockers\u201d \u2014 a Soviet term of uncertain etymology, informers basically serve as spies for the Russian state at home and abroad. They are nowhere near as omnipresent today in Russia as they were in East Germany or the Soviet Union, where millions snitched on their friends and colleagues.But after being banned in the early 1990s, the practice of luring Russians into informing on their fellow citizens again seems to have become widespread.The authorities have been thirsting for inside information about their domestic opposition since large antigovernment demonstrations exploded from nowhere in the winter of 2011, severely unnerving the Kremlin. A new surge of protests that started in May 2017, while smaller than the previous round, also caught the authorities by surprise \u2014 and increased the value of inside information.How many people are serving as informants is impossible to know: The only people who talk about recruitment pitches are those who balked.Viktor Voronkov, the director of the Center for Independent Social Research in St. Petersburg, told the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta early this year that four members of his staff had told him of recruitment approaches by the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the successor of the K.G.B.Contacted last week, he said he had not heard of any further attempts but assumed that many more of his employees had been approached. \u201cBelieve me, it is rare that people report such things,\u201d he said, adding that many of those who are approached are asked to sign nondisclosure agreements.A clear sign that the security services are again in the market for informers came in 2016 when Life, a Russian news service that is often used by the F.S.B. as a conduit for leaks, revealed that retired informers would receive state pensions in return for their service. In the past, that incentive had been offered only to full-time employees of the intelligence agency.The principal incentive for serving as an informer, however, is rarely money but the promise that legal or other problems will suddenly go away.Evgeny Shtorn, a 35-year-old sociologist born in Kazakhstan, recalled how, while working at Mr. Voronkov\u2019s research center in St. Petersburg, he was called to a meeting at the Federal Migration Service to discuss his application for Russian citizenship, which had just been rejected. When he went to the migration service office in December as requested, he was taken upstairs to an unmarked office with security cameras outside.Mr. Shtorn was met there by a polite man who showed a card identifying him as an officer in the F.S.B. and who explained that he knew all about the failed citizenship application and pretended that he thought this decision very regrettable. \u201cHe then very quickly shifted to questions about the research center, about foreign foundations and human rights organizations,\u201d Mr. Shtorn recalled.Mr. Shtorn, who is gay and was researching attacks against gay and transgender people in Russia, said it quickly became obvious that he had been targeted as a potential informer because he was \u201csuper vulnerable\u201d because of his stateless status and his involvement with gay rights groups. Assured that his rejected application could be reviewed in the future, he was questioned for nearly two hours about foreign foundations, their financial support for rights groups and research centers in Russia, and his own contacts with foreign diplomats and activists.The same agent called Mr. Shtorn the next day and asked for another meeting. He declined. The officer called again, and he again declined.\u201cTheir strategy is to find a vulnerability and use this to make you collaborate with them. The weaker you are, the higher the probability that they will approach you sooner or later,\u201d he said by telephone from Ireland, where he fled in January after refusing to collaborate.Convinced that discontent in Russia is largely the work of hostile foreign forces, Russia\u2019s law enforcement apparatus has increasingly focused on infiltrating organizations with real or imagined links to foreign organizations and governments, said Mark Galeotti, an expert on Russia\u2019s security system at the Institute of International Relations in Prague.The hunt for informants, he said, \u201chas become much more focused\u201d than it was in the Soviet Union, when the K.G.B. padded its roster with people who passed on useless office gossip and domestic tittle-tattle. The emphasis today, he said, is on finding informers who might have real inside information about terrorist groups like the Islamic State as well as peaceful foreign groups that promote democracy, which the Kremlin views as a dangerous threat.A long list of foreign nonprofit groups has been declared \u201cundesirable\u201d and a threat to Russia\u2019s national security, including a London-based outpost of Ms. Gryaznevich\u2019s organization, Open Russia.The Kremlin is particularly concerned about groups like Open Russia, Mr. Galeotti said, because of its links to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an exiled Russian billionaire who, after nearly a decade in Russian prison camps, now lives in London and finances a wide range of projects intended to promote democracy and civil liberties inside Russia.Open Russia, whose Moscow office has been raided twice by the authorities, says it receives some funding from Mr. Khodorkovsky but not from his London groups that have been declared \u201cundesirable.\u201d Representatives for Open Russia in Russia have insisted it is not so much an organization as an alliance of small and wholly Russian civil society groups.Unnerved but also intrigued by the motives and identity of the stranger who appeared at her door with flowers, Ms. Gryaznevich took his phone number. After calling her boss at Open Russia to ask for advice, she agreed to meet him.\u201cI had no idea who he was or what he wanted, but he was very polite and well-spoken,\u201d recalled Ms. Gryaznevich, who had recently returned from the eastern city of Vladivostok after spending a night in police detention for helping to organize a conference there sponsored by Open Russia.Over coffee, \u201cAndrei\u201d quickly made clear that he knew all about her troubles with the police in Vladivostok \u2014 and a disconcerting amount about her life in general, including her trips abroad on behalf of Open Russia.The man offered to help her solve her legal issues, explaining that her lawyer \u201ccannot protect you, but we can\u201d \u2014 so long as she reciprocated with help of her own.His proposition, she said, was this: If she agreed to meet once a week to provide information, especially about her foreign contacts \u2014 who they were, what they were doing and why \u2014 she would no longer need to worry about being pursued by the police and threatened with jail time. \u201cWe can solve all these problems,\u201d she recalled being told.She said \u201cAndrei\u201d showed little interest in Open Russia\u2019s activities inside Russia, about which he already seemed to know a great deal, but focused instead on its interaction with foreigners.The only time he dropped his studiously courteous manner, she added, was after she declined to serve as an informant and refused his request that she keep their meeting secret. And even then, she said, he did not veer into the crude threats often associated with Russia\u2019s secret police. \u201cIt was obviously not the first time he had done this kind of thing,\u201d she said.Mr. Galeotti said that being polite was \u201cstandard tradecraft\u201d in security services around the world. \u201cEveryone knows that coercion is the least effective way of getting people on your side,\u201d he said.Ms. Gryaznevich\u2019s mystery charmer never said exactly who he was. \u201cHe didn\u2019t answer a single one of my questions concretely,\u201d she said, but he left her with no doubt that he was working for the F.S.B., the principal pillar of a Russian security system dedicated to keeping President Vladimir V. Putin in power.A few days after the meeting, she posted about it on Facebook, explaining that she wanted her experience known by as many people as possible so that \u201cmaybe snitches in our ranks will be fewer.\u201dOffering advice to other recruitment targets, she warned: \u201cDon\u2019t try to outsmart them. They\u2019re not idiots.\u201dAnd don\u2019t be fooled by the recruiter\u2019s charm, she added: \u201cThis is not the cops who grab you on the street and push your face onto the ground. This is someone with intelligent greetings, compliments and gallantry. But the essence is the same.\u201dSophia Kishkovsky contributed reporting from Moscow.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Slippery Slope of Regulating Social Media ", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySpeech on Twitter and Facebook should not be treated like a collective good that should be subject to political control.Mr. Suderman is the managing editor at Reason.com. The promise of the internet, and social media in particular, was that it would not only allow anyone the opportunity to speak, but would also make it possible for anyone to precisely tailor what he reads, sees and hears online. News and information would no longer be mediated by newspaper editors, television producers and other gatekeepers. Instead, social media would allow direct access to individual voices in a feed custom-built by the user. It was a new frontier for both unregulated free expression and individual control.In practice, the actual experience of social media, for many users, is not one of control but of virtual bombardment, in which a flood of ideas and opinions that are irritating, dull and often outright offensive often seem impossible to avoid. Yes, you can block, mute, unfollow, log off and even delete your account. But the prevalence of social media \u2014 the way in which it has become the mortar of everyday life, filling in the cracks of our time \u2014 has a way of enforcing a sense that there is no way to truly escape from its reach. The world of social media increasingly feels as if it is simply the world.That world is one in which speech is often perceived not as an individual right, but as a public act, in which words and ideas are not your own, but a contribution to the collective. Social media has, in effect, socialized speech.The feeling of inescapability is amplified by both our politics and our traditional media. Walk into any modern newsroom and you\u2019ll see screen after screen open to Twitter and Facebook. Log onto Twitter on any given weeknight and you can see exactly what journalists are doing with their spare time. Twitter has become an always-on, all-encompassing chat room for political reporters and commentators and the people who follow the news most obsessively.The sense that social media and the rest of reality have converged is further intensified by President Trump, who spends a lot of time tweeting, which then, of course, causes a feedback loop with the media, which reports on and discusses his tweets, which sometimes lead to additional mini-controversies of their own, and so on and so forth, meaning that a significant fraction of mainstream political journalism consists of reporting and commentary about what people are saying online. Turn on cable news at any given hour of the day, and the odds are reasonably high that you\u2019ll encounter a summary of or argument about what\u2019s happening on social media. It\u2019s Twitter all the way down.Even for those who aren\u2019t news junkies, the connective power of social media, combined with its habit-forming drips of information and positive reinforcement \u2014 all those likes and favorites \u2014 can be difficult to avoid entirely, unless you want to become a digital hermit. Yet as anyone who has spent time on social media knows, even feeds built to serve up nothing but pictures of puppies and babies can easily devolve into ugly political arguments.The embrace of regulation is no doubt strategic \u2014 an effort to ensure that Facebook can weather any new rules better than potential competitors. Yet even these social media behemoths now appear to view themselves as something like public utilities. The Trump administration, in turn, seems to share that view: Last week, the Justice Department proposed talks with state attorneys general about the practices of large tech platforms.Given the unanticipated reach and influence of these companies, this view is perhaps understandable. But it is mistaken and even dangerous, because at its core it is a view that speech \u2014 the primary use for these platforms \u2014 is not an individual right, but a collective good that should be subject to political control.Combating this perception will entail a return to the original, unmet promise of social media \u2014 of a tailored experience that serves up what you want, rather than what you don\u2019t. Blocking, muting, unfollowing and even unplugging should be celebrated. Social media should work for you, not against you. More generally, it will require reinforcing, whenever possible, the notion that it\u2019s not only speech that is an individual right and responsibility \u2014 so is listening.I recognize just how difficult this can be. I\u2019ve spent the better part of my adult professional life online, half-distracted by newsfeeds and endless scrolling updates. In the last year, I\u2019ve dropped off Facebook, taken time away from Twitter, and repeatedly removed (and restored) various social apps from my phone. Even still, I regularly spend entire evenings online, occasionally when I have no reason to do so, and I often fight the urge to cycle through a suite of social media apps on my phone when I\u2019m in between \u2014 or in the middle of \u2014 tasks. I sometimes worry that Twitter has become a substitute for thought.Yes, social media can be abused. Harassment is never acceptable, and if foreign governments are attempting to influence our politics, we should be aware. Social media corporations, as private entities, have the right to ban anyone, for any or no reason.But all of us, as citizens and individuals and residents of the online world, have a responsibility to manage our own social media consumption, to resist letting it take over their our thoughts, our lives, our culture, and our politics. Social media is only the real world if we let it be.Peter Suderman (@petersuderman) is the managing editor at Reason.com.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jon Burge, 70, Ex-Commander in Chicago Police Torture Cases, Dies", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJon Burge, the former Chicago police commander whose reported torture of criminal suspects cost the city more than $100 million in legal fees and reparations and prompted the governor to pardon four death row inmates and halt capital punishment in Illinois, died this week in Hillsborough County, Fla. He was 70.His death was confirmed on Wednesday by the Zipperer\u2019s Funeral Home in Ruskin, near his retirement home in Apollo Beach, south of Tampa. At the family\u2019s request, the funeral home did not say precisely when or where he died or give a cause of death. He had been treated for cancer.A decorated Vietnam veteran who had collected 13 police commendations, Mr. Burge and detectives under his command were accused of extracting confessions from more than 100 people while questioning them in the 1970s and \u201980s by shocking them with cattle prods, smothering them with plastic typewriter covers and pointing guns in their mouths while pretending to play Russian roulette. Most of the suspects were black; he was white.Fired from the force in 1993, he was never prosecuted for torture because the statute of limitations had lapsed. He was also acquitted in a 1989 civil rights suit filed by an inmate, Madison Hobley, who said he had been coerced into falsely confessing to the killing of his wife, infant child and five others in an arson investigation.But Mr. Burge was convicted on federal charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2010 for denying, in response to the civil suit, that he had inflicted cruel and unusual punishment on prisoners in his custody.Sentenced in January 2011 to four and a half years\u2019 imprisonment, he was released in October 2014.His victims served much longer terms.The City of Chicago agreed to pay a total of nearly $5.5 million in 2016 to 57 torture victims who, as a result of the testimony wrested from them by Mr. Burge and his \u201cMidnight Crew\u201d of South Side detectives, had served more than two decades behind bars.The $5.5 million added to an estimated $100 million in other settlements, court-ordered judgments and legal fees stemming from the police torture cases.The reparations settlement also required the city\u2019s public school system to teach eighth and 10th graders about the torture case. Mayor Rahm Emanuel publicly apologized for what he called the \u201cdark chapter\u201d that Mr. Burge\u2019s behavior and the city\u2019s indifference to it, or complicity in it, had etched.Three days before the end of his term in 2003, Gov. George Ryan pardoned four death row inmates, including Mr. Hobley, who long maintained that they had falsely confessed after being tortured by Mr. Burge. The governor commuted the death sentences of 167 other inmates and declared a moratorium on capital punishment in Illinois. The state abolished the death penalty in 2011.Just how much progress Chicago has made in restoring public confidence in its police department was being tested again as word came of Mr. Burge\u2019s death.The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who was attending the officer\u2019s trial, said Mr. Burge\u2019s legacy is \u201ctied in with forced confessions and wrongful convictions.\u201d\u201cAs a person, may his soul rest in peace,\u201d Mr. Jackson said of Mr. Burge. \u201cAs a policeman, he did a lot of harm to a lot of people and left on this city a mark. It stains us for a long time.\u201dIn a statement posted on Facebook, the police union demurred. \u201cThe Fraternal Order of Police does not believe the full story about the Burge case has ever been told, particularly the case that led to his sole conviction,\u201d the statement said.Jon Graham Burge was born on Dec. 20, 1947, in South Deering, an industrial neighborhood on Chicago\u2019s South Side. His father, Floyd, worked for the telephone company. His mother, Ethel, was a fashion writer for The Chicago Daily News.Jon Burge joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps in high school and, after attending the University of Missouri for one semester, joined the Army Reserves in 1966. He volunteered to serve in Vietnam. In interviews, he said he had been trained as a military police officer in interrogation techniques and earned commendations, including a Bronze Star, for rescuing wounded comrades under fire.He joined the police department in 1970, when he was 22, 6-foot-2 and about 210 pounds.Allegations lodged later suggested that he began aggressively interrogating suspects in brutal crimes early on. (A boat he owned was named \u201cVigilante.\u201d)\u201cFind me another city that has paid reparations for systemic police abuse,\u201d Mr. Conroy said in an email on Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it. Find me another state with a Torture Commission. Greater transparency has resulted from the abuse here.\u201dFollow-up reports in The Chicago Tribune and investigations by Francine J. Sanders and Michael Goldston of the police department\u2019s Office of Professional Standards (now the Independent Police Review Authority) led to Mr. Burge\u2019s suspension in 1991 and his firing two years later.In the civil suit testimony that led to his perjury conviction, Mr. Burge was asked whether he had ever used \u201cphysical objects to inflict pain, suffering or fear, such as firearms, telephone books, typewriter covers, radiators, or machines that deliver an electric shock.\u201dMr. Burge replied, \u201cI have never used any techniques set forth above as a means of improper coercion of suspects while in detention or during interrogation.\u201dFacing the judge, Mr. Burge said, \u201cWhile I try to keep a proud face, in reality I am a broken man.\u201d\u201cI find it hard to believe that the city\u2019s political leadership could even contemplate giving \u2018reparations\u2019 to human vermin,\u201d he said.Since he was fired in 1993, Mr. Burge had continued to collect his $4,000-a-month police pension.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Affirmative Action Spectacle ", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrett Kavanaugh knows firsthand that affirmative action works and he uses it to hire female law clerks. But he opposes it as policy. Opinion ColumnistAffirmative action is a thorny issue, an imperfect tool to push society toward more perfect equality. It creates a current preference to counterbalance a historical preference. In this equation, there will always be winners and losers. Many people who have been long excluded because of race, gender, religion or sexual orientation \u2014 approve of this system. People who have long benefited from others being excluded \u2014 often white and often male, Christian and heterosexual \u2014 may even despise this affirmative action as a form of \u201creverse discrimination.\u201dThat is why I found an exchange on Wednesday between the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the Republican senator Orrin Hatch so fascinating. Hatch pointed out:A majority of your clerks in fact have been women. I understand that you were the first judge in the history of the D.C. Circuit to have an all-female class of clerks. Why do you believe it important to encourage young women lawyers and to ensure that both men and women are well represented in the legal profession?Kavanaugh\u2019s response was long, but I feel it important to reprint an extended passage of it here:She wrote a story about that. And that seemed to me very odd and unacceptable. And I started thinking about what I could do. First of all, why is that happening and what can I do about it? What\u2019s the problem, what can I do? So, the problem seemed to me these networks that \u2026 judges rely on for clerk hirings, professor networks \u2026 were excluding women or at least women weren\u2019t fully represented in those. That\u2019s true with minorities as well, by the way. So, I made sure, when I was talking to professors at law schools, that I made sure that I wanted to see a broad pool of qualified, well-qualified applicants, including women. And that year, for example, fall of 2006, which was my first year on the bench \u2014 we hire a year ahead, so I\u2019m hiring for 2007 \u2014 and I hired three women for that clerk class, 2007, three out of the four \u2026And, that was the start of my efforts to make sure that women were not being excluded.This is the very definition of affirmative action! He is making a concerted effort to include in the applicant pool people who had traditionally been excluded and had apparently taken that fact into consideration when hiring. Kavanaugh went on to say of his personal program of affirmative action: \u201cI\u2019m very proud of that because I do believe that all people should be treated equally.\u201dThis was all of course before he got married, had two daughters and started coaching girls\u2019 basketball.This is the kind of illogical social positioning I despise. Kavanaugh knows firsthand that affirmative action works, but he opposes it as policy. He is now deeply interested in female advancement and equality because he has two daughters. The inconsistency is maddening. And yet Kavanaugh has tried to bring these two warring positions into harmony. As The Journal reported: \u201cI continue to see no contradiction,\u201d he wrote in March 2003 to a journalist questioning how the White House could boast about minority judicial nominees while fighting affirmative action. \u201cDiversity is a permissible goal but a state must use race-neutral criteria when available,\u201d he added.Kavanaugh finished this exchange with Hatch on Wednesday by saying, \u201cI appreciate the question, Senator.\u201d Hatch replied: \u201cAnd I appreciate the answer. And I think everybody in this country should appreciate the answer. And, I think it distinguishes you.\u201dPrograms that give minorities and women preference in jobs and education are facing increasing opposition. President Reagan has rapped what he described as racial \u2018quotas\u2019 in some of these \u2018affirmative action\u2019 plans. Scholars are debating the value of setting aside opportunities for members of ethnic groups. And this week Sen. Orrin G. Hatch opened hearings on a constitutional amendment to ban government action to favor any race. The publication dubbed Hatch \u201cCapitol Hill\u2019s chief foe of affirmative action.\u201dAnd yet here he was gushing over Kavanaugh\u2019s affirmative action clerk program because he no doubt thought that it would somehow blunt the dire warnings about a Kavanaugh confirmation coming from civil rights and women\u2019s rights groups.Affirmative action isn\u2019t perfect. But the senator is a die-hard opponent of the tactic, while using praise of it as a tool to shield from criticism that is an even greater threat. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Bay Leaf Chicken to Prepare You for Fall", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteA glut of end-of-season fresh bay leaves inspires an easy weeknight chicken recipe.Herbs flourish under adverse conditions. I was told this once by an organic farmer, and have seen the proof. No matter how many 95-degree days I forget to water them, no many how many frigid winters I neglect to bring them inside, the herbs on my deck seem to survive, growing green in spite of my brown thumb.This year, it\u2019s the fresh, fragrant bay leaves that have done especially well \u2014 which presents me with an unusual predicament: What do I do with a glut of them? Most recipes calling for bay leaves require one or two. I have dozens at my disposal. One answer is to use lots of them in a marinade for boneless, skinless chicken thighs. The dense, dark meat can take the deeply herbal flavor, gaining complexity from the piney fragrance of the leaves. Bay leaves also have a mild citrus scent, so to bring that out, I grated some orange zest into the marinade. Mustard seeds add pungency and heat, while cumin and coriander provide a gently spicy note.Since the marinade\u2019s ingredients are intense, and boneless chicken thighs are relatively thin, a long stint in the marinade isn\u2019t necessary. An hour will do, though, if you want to plan ahead, you can marinate the chicken up to a day in advance and keep it in the fridge. Or do what I did: Marinate the thighs, then decide at the last minute to go out for sushi. Stick them in the freezer, where they\u2019ll keep for a month. Then, one day, when you think there\u2019s nothing in the house for dinner, discover the icy bag underneath the lemon sorbet. Defrost and proceed.These I sipped while sitting on the deck, admiring the herbs \u2014 and closing the happy summer circle of gardening, eating and cocktail-ing.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Arthur Ashe Knew About Protest", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tennis great was committed to respectful dialogue, refusing to lower himself to the level of invective.Mr. Arsenault is a biographer of Arthur Ashe.Mr. Ashe has been gone for 25 years, struck down at the age of 49 by AIDS, inflicted by an H.I.V.-tainted blood transfusion. But the example he set as a champion on and off the court has never been more relevant. As Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James and others strive to use their athletic stardom as a platform for social justice activism, they might want to look back at what this soft-spoken African-American tennis star accomplished during the age of Jim Crow and apartheid.The first thing they will discover is that, like most politically motivated athletes, Mr. Ashe turned to activism only after his formative years as an emerging sports celebrity. He began his career as the Jackie Robinson of men\u2019s tennis \u2014 a vulnerable and insecure racial pioneer instructed by his coaches to hold his tongue during a period when the success of desegregation was still in doubt. At the same time, Mr. Ashe\u2019s natural shyness and deferential attitude toward his elders and other authority figures all but precluded involvement in the civil rights struggle and other political activities during his high school and college years.The calculus of risk and responsibility soon changed, however, as Mr. Ashe reinvented himself as a 25-year-old activist-in-training during the tumultuous year of 1968. With his stunning victory in September at the U.S. Open, where he overcame the best pros in the world as a fifth-seeded amateur, he gained a new confidence that affected all aspects of his life.Mr. Ashe\u2019s political transformation had begun six months earlier when he gave his first public speech, a discourse on the potential importance of black athletes as community leaders, delivered at a Washington forum hosted by the Rev. Jefferson Rogers, a prominent black civil rights leader Mr. Ashe had known since childhood. Mr. Rogers had been urging Mr. Ashe to speak out on civil rights issues for some time, and when he finally did so, it released a spirit of civic engagement that enveloped his life. \u201cThis is the new Arthur Ashe,\u201d the reporter Neil Amdur observed in this paper, \u201carticulate, mature, no longer content to sit back and let his tennis racket do the talking.\u201dIn part, Mr. Ashe\u2019s new attitude reflected a determination to make amends for his earlier inaction. \u201cThere were times, in fact,\u201d he recalled years later, \u201cwhen I felt a burning sense of shame that I was not with other blacks \u2014 and whites \u2014 standing up to the fire hoses and the police dogs, the truncheons, bullets and bombs.\u201d He added: \u201cAs my fame increased, so did my anguish.\u201dDuring the violent spring of 1968, the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom Mr. Ashe had come to admire above all other black leaders, and Senator Robert F. Kennedy, whom he had supported as a presidential candidate, shook Mr. Ashe\u2019s faith in America. But he refused to surrender to disillusionment. Instead he dedicated himself to active citizenship on a level rarely seen in the world of sports.His activism began with an effort to expand economic and educational opportunities for young urban blacks, but his primary focus soon turned to the liberation of black South Africans suffering under apartheid. Later he supported a wide variety of causes, playing an active role in campaigns for black political power, high educational standards for college athletes, criminal justice reform, equality of the sexes and AIDS awareness. He also became involved in numerous philanthropic enterprises.By the end of his life, Mr. Ashe\u2019s success on the court was no longer the primary source of his celebrity. He had become, along with Muhammad Ali, a prime example of an athlete who transcended the world of sports. In 2016, President Barack Obama identified Mr. Ali and Mr. Ashe as the sports figures he admired above all others. While noting the sharp contrast in their personalities, he argued that both men were \u201ctransformational\u201d activists who pushed the nation down the same path to freedom and democracy.Mr. Ashe practiced his own distinctive brand of activism, one based on unemotional appeals to common sense and enlightened philosophical principles as simple as the Golden Rule. He had no facility for, and little interest in, using agitation and drama to draw attention to causes, no matter how worthy they might be. A champion of civility, he always kept his cool and never raised his voice in anger or frustration. Viewing emotional appeals as self-defeating and even dangerous, he relied on reasoned persuasion derived from careful preparation and research.Mr. Ashe preferred to make a case in written form, or as a speaker on the college lecture circuit or as a witness before the United Nations. His periodic opinion pieces in The Washington Post and other newspapers tackled a number of thorny issues related to sports and the broader society, including upholding high academic standards for college athletic eligibility and the expulsion of South Africa from international athletic competition. In the 1980s, he devoted several years to researching and writing \u201cA Hard Road to Glory,\u201d a groundbreaking three-volume history of African-American athletes.In retirement Mr. Ashe became a popular tennis broadcaster known for his clever quips, yet as an activist he never resorted to sound bites that excited audiences with reductionist slogans. Often working behind the scenes, he engaged in high-profile public debate only when he felt there was no other way to advance his point of view. Suspicious of quick fixes, he advocated incremental and gradual change as the best guarantor of true progress.Yet he did not let this commitment to long-term solutions interfere with his determination to give voice to the voiceless. Known as a risk taker on the court, he was no less bold off the court, where he never shied away from speaking truth to power.He was arrested twice, in 1985 while participating in an anti-apartheid demonstration in front of the South African Embassy and in 1992 while picketing the White House in protest of the George H.W. Bush administration\u2019s discriminatory policies toward Haitian refugees. The first arrest embarrassed the American tennis establishment, which soon removed him from his position as captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team, and the second occurred during the final months of his life as he struggled with the ravages of AIDS. In both cases he accepted the consequences of his principled activism with dignity.Mr. Ashe was a class act in every way, a man who practiced what he preached without being diverted by the temptations of power, fame or fortune. When we place his approach to dissent and public debate in a contemporary frame, it becomes obvious that his legacy is the antithesis of the scorched-earth politics of Trumpism. If Mr. Ashe were alive today, he would no doubt be appalled by the bullying tactics and insulting rhetoric of a president determined to punish athletes who have the courage and audacity to speak out against police brutality toward African-Americans. And yet we can be equally sure that Mr. Ashe would honor his commitment to respectful dialogue, refusing to lower himself to the president\u2019s level of unrestrained invective.Not all of the activist athletes involved in public protests during the past two years have followed Mr. Ashe\u2019s model of restraint and civility. But many have made a good-faith effort to do so, resisting the temptation to respond in kind to Mr. Trump\u2019s intemperate attacks on their personal integrity and patriotism. In particular, several of the most visible activists \u2014 including Mr. Kaepernick, Stephen Curry and Mr. James \u2014 have kept their composure and dignity even as they have borne the brunt of Mr. Trump\u2019s racially charged Twitter storms and stump speeches. By and large, they have wisely taken the same high road that Mr. Ashe took two generations ago, eschewing the politics of character assassination while keeping their eyes on the prize.Mr. Ashe would surely be gratified that to date, this high road has led to more protest, not less, confirming his belief that real change comes from rational advocacy and hard work, not emotional self-indulgence. As we celebrate his remarkable life and legacy a quarter-century after his death, we can be confident that Mr. Ashe would rush to join today\u2019s activists in spirit and solidarity, solemnly but firmly taking a knee for social justice.Raymond Arsenault is the author of \u201cArthur Ashe: A Life.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Do People Stay When a Hurricane Comes?", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe messy truth lies in between two common, incorrect tropes.Dr. Stephens is a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.That outlook is typical of many in coastal communities who habitually remain behind and in harm\u2019s way when hurricanes make landfall in the United States. The rest of us are routinely left with a deceptively straightforward question: Why do they choose to stay?It\u2019s not a simple question, nor is it a neutral one, and how one answers it typically reflects a particular sense of what counts as appropriate behavior during a crisis and what makes for a responsible, or even \u201cgood,\u201d person.These characterizations, rooted in pervasive American attitudes of independence, presume everyone in harm\u2019s way has a clear ability to leave when, in reality, many lack reliable transportation or the money for gas and a hotel room.Countless people don\u2019t have close friends or family to stay with outside the hurricane-threatened area, and others cannot take for granted having a job when they return in the days or weeks after the storm.While it\u2019s virtually impossible to untangle what precise percentage of residents stay because of material reasons as opposed to cultural ones, in our study the average annual income of people who stayed was only $19,500, and only 54 percent of \u201cstayers\u201d had a car, compared to 100 percent of those who left.Unfortunately, acknowledging the monetary constraints of many residents who stay behind can too often turn into a patronizing narrative that robs people of agency. There are of course some who do have the option to leave, but nevertheless choose to stay for reasons they find as sensible as the motivations others point to for leaving.During survey interviews, survivors who stayed focused on interdependence, emphasizing themes of sticking together, religious faith and communal and family ties. In fact, over two-thirds of those who stayed explicitly discussed the importance of connections to others.\u201cWe had a good community\u201d one Katrina survivor in the New Orleans area said. \u201cAll the people here help one another.\u201dAnother said, \u201cI was worried and not only for myself, but for a lot of the people.\u201d As critics of storm holdouts may suspect, nearly half of those who stayed also discussed the importance of being tough or strong in the face of hardship, but this was never the sole factor.The silver lining of residents weathering a dangerous storm with one another is visible in the ways communities come together in a chaotic aftermath to share boats, food, and emergency supplies. Such acts of neighborly bravery have been caught on camera, or retold on social media, during ad hoc rescue operations for multiple hurricanes.These benefits may especially resonate with working-class Americans, who are more likely to think of themselves as part of a broader social network, with responsibilities to vulnerable neighbors; in contrast, members of the middle- and upper-class, who tend to evacuate, are more likely to think of themselves as independent families, free to come and go as they please.Considering the government\u2019s slow and inept response to recent natural disasters, it is not surprising that people \u2014 especially those in working-class and minority communities \u2014 frequently do not trust the government\u2019s disaster preparation. When the sentiment that the government doesn\u2019t care about \u201cpeople like us\u201d is widespread, the likelihood of those people complying with mandatory evacuation orders drops.Like Hurricane Katrina before it, the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, in 2017, was a tragic reminder that our government desperately needs to improve its ability to respond effectively to the immediate and long-term needs of citizens who endure natural disasters.Federal and state disaster preparation offices should better take into account the material realities of people\u2019s lives \u2014 for example, by providing free transportation and a safe place to stay outside of the affected areas, or vouchers to cover the expenses of evacuating. And the messaging for these programs should mesh with the interdependent cultures of many working-class coastal communities.Battening down the hatches and seeing what\u2019s left after the storm blows over is clearly not the wisest plan, but until we directly tackle both the financial and cultural factors that lead residents to stay behind, the nation will be ill-prepared for hurricanes at a time when they are destined to become more frequent.Nicole Stephens, a cultural and social psychologist, is an associate professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Retirement Home\u2019s Lessons in How to Keep in Touch ", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA curator finds much to admire in the creative exuberance of the objects in these halls. Dr. Adamson is a curator and art historian. I expect it\u2019s partly for this reason that the management at Brooksby installed a shelf in the hallway next to each apartment door. The shelves are small, about two feet long and one foot deep, and are all the same. But the residents use them in endlessly varied ways. My parents choose to display a blue glass vase (a gift from me) and, somewhat incongruously, a little bronze Komodo dragon. Some shelves feature sentimental cards or teddy bears or flowers, real and artificial, or mementos of loved ones. Others bespeak the eclectic ethnic mix of the community and are filled with Irish and Italian and Polish and Russian tchotchkes and flags. On others still are crafts, paintings, sculptures \u2014 some souvenirs from past travels, some made by the residents themselves.There is deep feeling here if you are open to seeing it. Many attachments may have fallen by the wayside. Friends may have died, homes sold, children grown up and moved away. But the macaroni-encrusted chicken is still there, and with it, a measure of self-identity.As a professional curator, I feel there is something to learn from these micro-exhibitions. After all, they are a lot more emotive than many museum and gallery shows manage to be. Once I began thinking about them, I started noticing similar displays, in other places, marking other times of life. Objects laid by a child\u2019s crib, on a dorm room desk, along an office cubicle ledge, at the foot of a gravestone. Wherever we are, at whatever age, we have an impulse to tell people who we really are through a few resonant objects.Having dedicated my career to the history and creativity of craft, I have become increasingly worried about the incursion of the digital into our lives. There is much gratification and practical use to be had through the sliding, tapping and clicking that we all do incessantly, bathed in the encouraging glow of our screens. But aren\u2019t we losing something in the process? This goes far beyond the ability to make things, or even to understand how they are made. It has to do with a pervasive disconnect from our physical surroundings, in all their richness. It has to do with the way we are losing touch, quite literally, with the accumulated \u201cmaterial intelligence\u201d of the past.All useful objects, from satellites to screwdrivers, are a repository of this material intelligence that has been handed down from previous generations. When we underestimate that inheritance (perhaps because we overstate the worth of newer technologies) we risk cutting ourselves off not only from the human past but also from those people around us who still have a hand in making our world what it is.Will Brooksby Village eventually replace its shelves with digital tablets that automatically scroll through thousands of family pictures but communicate far less than a few carefully chosen things? I doubt it. As humans, the urge to keep objects close is deeply rooted in us. Today, it\u2019s easy to lose track of this desire, either getting distracted by our devices or surrounding ourselves with so many things that each one ceases to hold much value. At Brooksby, though, I\u2019ve found reason for optimism. We will never lose touch completely with the curators inside us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Dominates as a Merchant and Platform. Europe Sees Reason to Worry.", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many independent merchants who sell their goods on Amazon, there has long been deep concern that if the e-commerce giant saw a particular product selling well, the company would duplicate it, but at a lower price.The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief said on Wednesday that there may be reason for worry.Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s competition commissioner, announced the start of an investigation into whether Amazon is unfairly using data collected about third-party sellers to make its own decisions about products to sell \u2014 information that would give it a potentially anticompetitive edge.Ms. Vestager, the world\u2019s most aggressive regulator of American technology giants, said that Amazon\u2019s dual position as host of the largest online platform for third-party sellers and as a retailer of goods deserved a closer look from European investigators. Her office has sent a number of questionnaires to market participants to learn more about Amazon\u2019s practices.\u201cThe question here is about the data,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at a news conference on Wednesday. She said that she wanted to know whether Amazon used data collected from merchants to make its own calculation about \u201cwhat is the new big thing, what it is that people want, what kind of offers do they like to receive, what makes them buy things?\u201dShe called the investigation \u201cpreliminary,\u201d and noted that a formal inquiry had not been started. European antitrust investigations can take years to complete.\u201cIt is very early days in this antitrust investigation into Amazon\u2019s business practices,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Amazon had no immediate comment.Most of the products sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers who use the platform to find customers. The practice has been mutually beneficial: Merchants get access to Amazon customers they would not otherwise be able to reach, while Amazon is able to offer a wider range of products and to collect a fee from any goods that are sold. Just over half of the company\u2019s unit sales globally come from third-party sellers.Amazon, she added, can use sales data about other merchants to improve its offerings.This is not the first time Amazon has been in Ms. Vestager\u2019s sights. Last year, her office ordered Luxembourg to collect 250 million euros, or about $290 million at current exchange rates, in back taxes from the online retail giant.An earlier version of this article, using information from an Amazon spokesman, referred incorrectly to the proportion of Amazon\u2019s sales that come from third-party sellers. It is just over half of unit sales globally, not revenue.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hand-Feeding Hummingbirds: You Can Do It, but Should You?", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesVideos abound on the internet of people using customized hats and other tools to hand-feed the tiny fliers. Here\u2019s what you need to know if you\u2019d like to try it.\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a meditative exercise we could all use to slow down a bit,\u201d said Ms. Williamson. \u201cSitting still you start to notice things in your garden you may not have noticed before. It makes for a nice excuse to get out and just commune with nature.\u201d To discourage the birds from thinking of any human as a possible food source, she said, try blending in with the environment as much as possible. That\u2019s important because not every human has good intentions, she notes.Getting hummingbirds too accustomed to people can make them vulnerable to those who may swat at them out of fear or attract them for reasons other than just observation. Hummingbirds have excellent memories. These intelligent birds have huge brains relative to their bodies, and they show awareness of their surroundings. But nobody, to Ms. Williamson\u2019s knowledge, has formally tested whether hummingbirds recognize humans as food sources. Anecdotal accounts suggest, however, that hummingbirds may look for humans when they find their feeders empty. \u201cThey\u2019ll fly to the feeder, look at me, and fly back to the feeder, almost like a pet waiting at an empty food dish,\u201d she said.Pick a spot and stay very still.Take a chair to the same place on the patio, porch or lawn and remain motionless so the birds can investigate the new food source without fear. \u201cThey\u2019re quite suspicious little creatures, and they\u2019re also not too quick to accept new stimuli.\u201d Because hummingbirds are quite color-sensitive, you may try wearing lots of colors. \u201cA really gaudy Hawaiian print shirt is an excellent hummingbird attractor,\u201d said Ms. Williamson. She also called Mr. Pratt\u2019s flowered hat, \u201ca great idea.\u201d Your piece of flair doesn\u2019t have to look like a flower: \u201cA red bandanna, headband, gaudy beaded earrings \u2014 you can wax your mustache red,\u201d she said. Or you may also try adorning yourself with flowers from your garden \u2014 especially the kinds hummingbirds pollinate.No, but it may distract them from flowers.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem to be as much of a problem here in the temperate zone \u2014 as long as we practice good feeding habits,\u201d she said. Regularly clean feeders \u2014 the ones you wear or the ones hanging in your garden \u2014 every few days or more often in hot weather with hydrogen peroxide to keep the nectar from fermenting and to fend off microbes that may make hummingbirds sick.Also, use low-sugar nectar that won\u2019t distract them too much from natural nectar sources they need to pollinate. The rule of thumb for all the species of hummingbirds in North America is four parts water to one part cane sugar.Birds have already started to fly from the north. But in the south, this time of year until early October is near perfect for creating a safe place for young, na\u00efve birds, which may be more exploratory, to sample your offerings. \u201cThey will remember your yard on their next journey, and you\u2019ll end up with a loyal and growing clientele if you do everything right,\u201d she said Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What We Need to Fight the Next Financial Crisis", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress has taken away some of the tools that were crucial to us during the 2008 panic. It\u2019s time to bring them back.Mr. Bernanke is a former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Geithner and Mr. Paulson are former Treasury secretaries. The seeds of the panic were sown over decades, as the American financial system outgrew the protections against panics that were put in place after the Great Depression. Depression-era safeguards, like deposit insurance, were aimed at ensuring that the banking system remained stable, but by 2007 more than half of all credit flowed outside banks. Financial innovations, like subprime mortgages and automated credit scoring, helped millions to buy homes, but they also facilitated unwise risk-taking by lenders and investors. Although we and other financial regulators did not foresee the crisis, we moved aggressively to stop it. Acting in its traditional role as lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve provided massive quantities of short-term loans to financial institutions facing runs, while cutting interest rates nearly to zero. The Treasury Department stopped a run on money market funds by providing a backstop for investors. The Treasury also managed the takeover of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and worked with the Fed to try to prevent the collapse of large, systemically important financial firms. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guaranteed bank debt and protected depositors.But the powers of the regulators alone proved inadequate. Congressional action made it possible for two presidents, one Republican and one Democratic, working with regulators, to prevent the collapse of the financial system and avoid another Great Depression. Most importantly, Congress provided capital to the banking system, allowing for the normalization of credit flows. Congress also provided support for housing and mortgage markets and authorized a powerful fiscal stimulus. The economy began to grow again in mid-2009, and the funds deployed by Congress were recovered with substantial profit to the taxpayer. Policymakers certainly didn\u2019t get everything right. But compared to most other countries, America\u2019s post-2008 recovery started sooner, was completed faster and was built on healthier foundations. Are we ready for the next crisis? In some respects, yes. Reforms of financial regulation have helped make the system more resilient, making a crisis less likely to occur. Banks and other key financial institutions are financially stronger, and the gaps in regulatory oversight have largely been closed. Regulators are more attuned to systemwide risks. Our main concern is that these defenses will erode over time and risk-taking will emerge in corners of the financial system that are less constrained by regulation. Even if a financial crisis is now less likely, one will occur eventually. To contain the damage, the Treasury and financial regulators need adequate firefighting tools. After the crisis, Congress gave regulators some promising new authorities to help them manage the failure of an individual financial institution, tools we did not have in the fall of 2008 when we faced the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers. The so-called orderly liquidation authority, for example, which was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, could help regulators unwind a failing firm in a manner that could be less damaging to the system as a whole. But in its post-crisis reforms, Congress also took away some of the most powerful tools used by the FDIC, the Fed and the Treasury. Among these changes, the FDIC can no longer issue blanket guarantees of bank debt as it did in the crisis, the Fed\u2019s emergency lending powers have been constrained, and the Treasury would not be able to repeat its guarantee of the money market funds. These powers were critical in stopping the 2008 panic.From a political perspective, Congress\u2019s decision to limit these crisis-fighting tools was predictable. Many of the actions necessary to stem the crisis, including the provision of loans and capital to financial institutions, were controversial and unpopular. To us, as to the public, the responses often seemed unjust, helping some of the very people and firms who had caused the damage. Those reactions are completely understandable, particularly since the economic pain from the panic was devastating for many.The paradox of any financial crisis is that the policies necessary to stop it are always politically unpopular. But if that unpopularity delays or prevents a strong response, the costs to the economy become greater. We need to make sure that future generations of financial firefighters have the emergency powers they need to prevent the next fire from becoming a conflagration. We must also resist calls to eliminate safeguards as the memory of the crisis fades. For those working to keep our financial system resilient, the enemy is forgetting.Advertisement"}

On issues from immigration to economics, the 2016 vote to leave the European Union has prompted insecurity about who we are as a nation and what we have become. Food has not been spared.Even the most hardened Leave supporter would probably admit that British food has improved since 1973, when we joined the European Economic Community, the Union\u2019s predecessor. Once we joined the club of Europe, we became bewitched by European eating habits, and then aped (and often improved) them. Easy trade with the Continent has filled our supermarket shelves with an increasingly rich display of produce. Fifty years ago, olive oil was a medicinal product most often found in Britain in a pharmacy. Nowadays, it is the country\u2019s best-selling cooking oil.The anti-European Union side says this is hyperbole, part of an elite campaign to scare voters off Brexit. To an extent, that is right: Most people don\u2019t believe that without the European Union, Britons will go hungry.One consolation is that our appetites are today more global than European. Our food revolution was not just continental. It may not be fashionable to be wistful about the British Empire but it\u2019s certainly popular to enjoy delicacies from former colonies, as well as from countries Britain never even came close to invading. If you had to define our national dish, it would be as accurate to say chicken tikka masala or pad thai as fish and chips, which, by the way, is believed to have been introduced to Britain in the 19th century by Jewish refugees.Nobody is quite sure what Brexit will mean for our diets. Our taste for world dishes may help, as we start to forge new trade links and wean ourselves off cheap European goods. But a food culture, much like food itself, can perish. Much as it pains us to admit it, we owe a lot of our confidence to our European cousins. So will we go back to where we once were \u2014 the laughingstock of the culinary world \u2014 or can we prove the critics wrong?Advertisement"}

With his gridiron build, manifestly hairy chest and crinkly dark eyes suggesting an abiding sense of humor, Reynolds \u2014 hard though it may be to believe now \u2014 topped the list of box-office stars for five years, from 1978-1982, a feat equaled only by Bing Crosby before him.From the beginning, the vehicles \u2014 \u201cShark!\u201d, \u201cWhite Lightning,\u201d \u201cSmokey and the Bandit\u201d (which eventually went on to a second and third iteration), \u201cThe End\u201d \u2014 seemed to matter less than the actor\u2019s insouciant presence in them, but there were also the strong dramatic performances he delivered in \u201cDeliverance,\u201d \u201cSemi-Tough\u201d and, much later on, in a brief but potent appearance in \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d as well as his autobiographical role in the 2017 film \u201cThe Last Movie Star.\u201dPart of his appeal lay in the fact that it was never entirely clear whether Reynolds was playing to his strengths or riffing on them; indeed, Pauline Kael once described him as having an \u201cinsider\u2019s jokey contempt for the whole entertainment business.\u201d In 1972, right after he displayed his thespian chops in \u201cDeliverance,\u201d he chose to capitalize on his beefcake charm by posing for a nude centerfold in Cosmopolitan, assuming a coyly odalisque position on a bearskin rug. I was in my late teens at the time and not a Cosmopolitan reader, but I still remember going out to buy that issue and staring at Reynolds \u2014 an actor I had not otherwise particularly warmed to \u2014 in all his glory (well, not quite all) with a frisson of delight, reveling in the fact that the erotic optics were now mine to claim and study closely.For one thing, one inevitably bumps up against the homoerotic tradition, which has always venerated the male physical ideal; for another, women have generally been conditioned to love men in the way that the poet W.B. Yeats thought only God loved women: for themselves alone and not their yellow hair. Undoubtedly, this has a lot to do with the unspoken rules of the culture we live in, which allows men to grow old and gray without losing their allure \u2014 thereby underscoring the fact that women are valued primarily as decorative where men are not.Reynolds\u2019s centerfold, much as he might have come to regret it, indicated that a shift was in the air. In 1973 came \u201cThe Way We Were,\u201d in which the Sleeping Beauty was no longer a damsel in distress but a blond-haired and blue-eyed creature named Robert Redford \u2014 dressed in white, no less. He was gazed at tremulously and kissed into wakefulness by the ugly duckling, Barbra Streisand (more than one myth of beauty was at play here, it seems). Whereas the 1967 film \u201cThe Graduate\u201d had given us the ultimate vision of amorous pursuit, \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d skewed that vision one gradation further: The discreet object of desire was not a Beautiful Woman, but a Beautiful Man. And what the inversion showed us was that the ache, the longing, remained the same.It\u2019s odd to think that fashions in male ideals change as reliably as fashions in what constitutes female beauty, but there\u2019s no doubt that they do. Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman spoke to a different, more imperfect and less suave ethos than Redford or Reynolds, who might be seen as Redford\u2019s dark counterpart. Although it seems to go against the dictates of our biological underpinnings to think that something as ostensibly organic as sexual desire can seem dated \u2014 as well as the cultural ideals that go along with it \u2014 one can\u2019t refute the reality that Reynolds and his macho charisma appears from our current vantage point as retrograde as Cary Grant or Charles Boyer\u2019s debonair personas. After Reynolds came the more bland, pretty-boy variants, such as Brad Pitt, Rob Lowe and Tom Cruise, but these days the heterosexual premium has been leavened by an infusion of perceptibly vulnerable and slightly androgynous types like Ryan Gosling, Matt Damon and Casey Affleck.Typology, of course, goes only so far. There was more to Reynolds than his hypermasculinity, as was apparent in his uproarious self-send-ups on Johnny Carson\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d and his romantic involvement with the much older and more sophisticated Dinah Shore. And then there was his relationship with Sally Field, who was not a conventional beauty and seemed to have the sort of depth that didn\u2019t appear to be part of Reynolds\u2019s second wife Loni Anderson\u2019s makeup. Field\u2019s memoir, \u201cIn Pieces,\u201d is being published shortly and will surely shed some more light on what made Reynolds tick. Meanwhile, there\u2019s the memory of his bon vivant, old-boy-but-not-quite cinematic presence \u2014 and of that defining fillip of a mustache.Daphne Merkin is a novelist and critic.

{"Headline": "Elephant Tusk DNA Helps Track Ivory Poachers", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesResearchers are examining the genetic data in seized elephant ivory to trace it back to the animals\u2019 homelands and connect it to global trafficking crimes. Poachers are killing 40,000 elephants a year and with a global elephant population of just 400,000, it doesn\u2019t take a mathematician to figure out that there is an urgent need to stop the killing.But it\u2019s hard to catch poachers in the act. They operate over a wide area, move just a few elephant tusks at a time and once their ivory contraband reaches a major port, it can be easily hidden among other goods, said Samuel Wasser, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington.Dr. Wasser had already developed a genetic map of African elephants by analyzing scat from across the continent. Now, he can link that map with genetic analysis of confiscated tusks to determine where the animal was living when it was killed. This can help law enforcement target areas most susceptible to poaching, he said in a telephone news conference on Tuesday.\u201cIt helps us focus our investigative efforts and our conservation efforts on the ground to attack the problem at the source and also to take down the transnational criminal organizations that are responsible,\u201d Mr. Brown said. Dr. Wasser\u2019s approach, he added, \u201cis a very successful tool that\u2019s being exploited to the fullest in these investigations.\u201dTrafficking cartels often separate tusks into multiple shipments. Dr. Wasser said researchers can sometimes link shipments by showing that tusks in two different shipments belong to the same elephant or the same family. That way, he said, they can link criminals to more than one shipment, leading to harsher sentences when they are caught.In 2016, a ring of international poachers was convicted in Tanzania, but the defendants\u2019 cases were thrown out on grounds of trial irregularities and weak evidence. Dr. Wasser said genetic data has since connected the ring to additional shipments, which he expects will lead to a conviction that will stick. He urged the governments of countries where the poaching occurs to turn over contraband as soon as it is seized so it can be genetically analyzed. Dr. Wasser said it\u2019s important for consumers to stop buying ivory and other animal products \u2014 which are sold as trinkets or pitched, without medical evidence, as aphrodisiacs or treatments for various diseases. There are also people, he said, who appear to be buying whole tusks as \u201cinvestments,\u201d hoping they will become even more valuable some day, perhaps if the elephants are hunted to extinction.Fundamentally, Dr. Wasser said, addressing the demand side takes more time than conservationists have to protect elephants. \u201cWe need something really urgent that gets in there and really stops the trade in its tracks,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes his genomic approach will be part that solution.Advertisement"}

Thompson, along with Kathryn Martin, the chief operating officer.The Times and ProPublica found that Dr. Baselga had received millions of dollars in consulting fees and in ownership interests in health care companies, but had often failed to disclose those ties in appearances at scientific conferences and in journal articles. His reporting failures included articles in prestigious publications like The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet as well as in Cancer Discovery, a journal for which he serves as one of two editors in chief.Several institutions, including The New England Journal of Medicine and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, have said they are looking into his disclosures. The American Association for Cancer Research said it had also begun a review of Dr. Baselga\u2019s reporting practices. Dr. Baselga appears to have violated disclosure rules while he was president of that organization in 2015 and 2016. The A.A.C.R. also publishes Cancer Discovery.In the email, Dr. Thompson and Ms. Martin described the guidelines for reporting industry relationships as \u201cnebulous,\u201d adding that \u201cwe need to work with journal publishers and professional societies to standardize the reporting process.\u201d They said they had been discussing the issue with ASCO, the cancer group, which has pushed for more standardized disclosure.A decade ago, a series of scandals relating to hidden payments by drug companies to prominent physicians prompted medical journals and professional societies to beef up their reporting requirements. But as Dr. Baselga\u2019s case and others demonstrate, much is still left to the honor system. Medical journals have said they don\u2019t routinely fact-check authors\u2019 disclosures.In comments to The Times and ProPublica, The New England Journal of Medicine acknowledged that the problem of failed disclosures is \u201cwidespread\u201d and said it was putting in place a better system to track authors\u2019 disclosures. Two of the articles that Dr. Baselga said he planned to correct were published in that journal.Dr. Baselga has served since March on the board of Bristol-Myers Squibb, a major manufacturer of cancer drugs, and since 2017 on the board of Varian Medical Systems, which sells radiation equipment to cancer centers, including to Memorial Sloan Kettering.Dr. Baselga received nearly $3.5 million in payments from drug, medical equipment and diagnostic companies from August 2013 through 2017, according to Open Payments, a federal database that tracks payments to physicians from health care companies. The bulk of that amount, about $3 million, involved a payment from Genentech, a subsidiary of the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche, for Dr. Baselga\u2019s ownership interest in a company it acquired, Seragon Pharmaceuticals, in 2014.But that total amount does not include many companies with which Dr. Baselga has ties that do not report physician payments to the federal database because they are biotech start-ups without any products approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Baselga declined to provide a tally of the money he has received from such companies.Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center employs about 17,000 people and conducts hundreds of clinical trials.In the email to staff, Dr. Thompson and Ms. Martin closed by affirming the value of working with the health care industry.\u201cCollaboration with industry leaders, from early stage start-ups to large corporations, is necessary to focus on bringing better treatments to patients,\u201d they said.Christine Hickey, a spokeswoman for Memorial Sloan Kettering, said the cancer center had no further comment.Charles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization.Advertisement"}

Sydney Ember, a politics reporter for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.You now cover politics after writing about media for years. What tech do you use to follow politics, and what tech do you take with you on the campaign trail?Covering politics is totally different from covering the media. I no longer get to talk to other journalists all the time. But on the upside, I\u2019ve gotten to leave my media bubble. And I get to travel a lot more.When I\u2019m out on the trail reporting, I'm actually pretty low-tech. I use a backpack so I can keep my hands free. I carry around a lot of reporting notebooks and pens. I have a small Olympus recorder that I got years ago. It has a USB that connects to my computer, but it\u2019s so old that my computer can no longer play the recordings I transfer over. It seems to have something to do with the format of the recordings, but it\u2019s still something of a mystery to me even after copious Googling. I also record a lot of videos on my phone so I can remember what the atmosphere was like at a campaign event, for example, or how candidates looked interacting with voters.Drives on the trail can get long. I recently drove from Kansas City to Wichita, Kan., and back, then went on to St. Louis, a journey of roughly 700 miles over three days. Most cars these days seem to have a USB port, so I make sure to plug in my phone as soon as I start driving.I rely on the Google Maps app for directions and would never be able to find my way to the right place without it. That\u2019s all to say I spend a majority of my time on the road thinking about how to make sure my phone stays charged. I have a pink Mophie external battery in case the situation gets dire.How has tech changed the way politicians are campaigning for the midterms? The goal of this direct-to-voter messaging seems twofold: They can more easily shape their narratives and appear more human while also bypassing difficult questions from the media.What\u2019s the deal with those pesky robo texts?If you haven\u2019t received any of these robo texts yet, count yourself lucky.Does switching beats change how you use technology to report?When I covered the media, I spent every waking hour on Twitter. (That\u2019s at least how my husband felt.) If media news broke, I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t miss it. Now, I try not to spend all day looking at Twitter \u2014 it seems less necessary \u2014 and check in only every few hours. This sometimes feels more like an aspiration. But I\u2019m trying.I actually feel it\u2019s easier to get people to talk on the politics beat than it was when I covered the media. Believe it or not, it\u2019s hard trying to get other journalists to say things on the record! On both beats, though, I find that picking up the phone and calling people is often the best way to get them talking.You\u2019ve covered the rise and fall of many print media empires in the digital age. For the ones that are succeeding, what do you think they are doing well? Companies that are doing well have figured out a good pay wall to make up for losses in digital advertising and print subscriptions. The cost has to be low enough that readers can justify it, but high enough that it helps support the journalism the companies want to offer.In the end, though, the companies that are succeeding are consistently producing great, unique stories that can\u2019t be found anywhere else. Readers will pay for good journalism.Outside your work, what tech product do you use a ton? In a weird way, it gives me some freedom from my phone. Before I had it, I\u2019d pick up my phone for every email, text or alert, then get sucked into the vortex of social media. I could lose hours this way. Now, because I can look at my watch to see what\u2019s going on, I can leave my phone alone, sometimes even in another room, knowing I still won\u2019t miss anything important.I also really like that I can read and send text messages from it. When I\u2019m stuck on long drives on the trail, I can glance at my wrist to see a text, then respond simply by saying something out loud.

{"Headline": "Top Cancer Researcher Fails to Disclose Corporate Financial Ties in Major Research Journals", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization.One of the world\u2019s top breast cancer doctors failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from drug and health care companies in recent years, omitting his financial ties from dozens of research articles in prestigious publications like The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet.The researcher, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Baselga, a towering figure in the cancer world, is the chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He has held board memberships or advisory roles with Roche and Bristol-Myers Squibb, among other corporations, has had a stake in start-ups testing cancer therapies, and played a key role in the development of breakthrough drugs that have revolutionized treatments for breast cancer.According to an analysis by The New York Times and ProPublica, Dr. Baselga did not follow financial disclosure rules set by the American Association for Cancer Research when he was president of the group. He also left out payments he received from companies connected to cancer research in his articles published in the group\u2019s journal, Cancer Discovery. At the same time, he has been one of the journal\u2019s two editors in chief.At a conference this year and before analysts in 2017, he put a positive spin on the results of two Roche-sponsored clinical trials that many others considered disappointments, without disclosing his relationship to the company. Since 2014, he has received more than $3 million from Roche in consulting fees and for his stake in a company it acquired.Dr. Baselga did not dispute his relationships with at least a dozen companies. In an interview, he said the disclosure lapses were unintentional.He stressed that much of his industry work was publicly known although he declined to provide payment figures from his involvement with some biotech startups. \u201cI acknowledge that there have been inconsistencies, but that\u2019s what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I do not appreciate the importance.\u201dDr. Baselga\u2019s extensive corporate relationships \u2014 and his frequent failure to disclose them \u2014 illustrate how permeable the boundaries remain between academic research and industry, and how weakly reporting requirements are enforced by the medical journals and professional societies charged with policing them.\u201cIf leaders don\u2019t follow the rules, then we don\u2019t really have rules,\u201d said Dr. Walid Gellad, director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt says that the rules don\u2019t matter.\u201dMany journals and professional societies do not check conflicts and simply require authors to correct the record.Officials at the A.A.C.R., the American Society of Clinical Oncology and The New England Journal of Medicine said they were looking into Dr. Baselga\u2019s omissions after inquiries from The New York Times and ProPublica. The Lancet declined to say whether it would look into the matter.Christine Hickey, a spokeswoman for Memorial Sloan Kettering, said that Dr. Baselga had properly informed the hospital of his outside industry work and that it was Dr. Baselga\u2019s responsibility to disclose such relationships to entities like medical journals. The cancer center, she said, \u201chas a rigorous and comprehensive compliance program in place to promote honesty and objectivity in scientific research.\u201dAsked if he planned to correct his disclosures, Dr. Baselga asked reporters what they would recommend. In a statement several days later, he said he would correct his conflict-of-interest reporting for 17 articles, including in The New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet and the publication he edits, Cancer Discovery. He said that he did not believe disclosure was required for dozens of other articles detailing early stages of research.\u201cI have spent my career caring for cancer patients and bringing new therapies to the clinic with the goal of extending and saving lives,\u201d Dr. Baselga said in the statement. \u201cWhile I have been inconsistent with disclosures and acknowledge that fact, that is a far cry from compromising my responsibilities as a physician, as a scientist and as a clinical leader.\u201dMany top medical researchers have ties to the for-profit health care industry, and some overlap is seen as a good thing \u2014 after all, these are the companies charged with developing the drugs, medical devices and diagnostic tests of the future.Dr. Baselga\u2019s relationship to industry is extensive. In addition to sitting on the board of Bristol-Myers Squibb, he is a director of Varian Medical Systems, which sells radiation equipment and for whom Memorial Sloan Kettering is a client.In all, Dr. Baselga has served on the boards of at least six companies since 2013, positions that have required him to assume a fiduciary responsibility to protect the interests of those companies, even as he oversees the cancer center\u2019s medical operations.The hospital and Dr. Baselga said steps had been taken to prevent him from having a say in any business between the cancer center and the companies on whose boards he sits.Ms. Hickey said the cancer center cannot fulfill its charitable mission without working with industry. \u201cWe encourage collaboration and are proud that our work has led to the approval of novel, lifesaving cancer treatments for patients around the world,\u201d she said.From August 2013 through 2017, Dr. Baselga received nearly $3.5 million from nine companies, according to the federal Open Payments database, which compiles disclosures filed by drug and device companies.Dr. Baselga has disclosed in other forums investments and advisory roles in biotech start-ups, but he declined to provide a tally of financial interests in those firms. Companies that have not received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for their products \u2014 projects still in the testing phases \u2014 do not have to report payments they make to doctors.ProPublica and The Times analyzed Dr. Baselga\u2019s publications in medical journals since 2013, the year he joined Memorial Sloan Kettering. He failed to disclose any industry relationships in more than 100, or about 60 percent of the time, a figure that has increased with each passing year. Last year, he did not list any potential conflicts in 87 percent of the articles that he wrote or co-wrote.Early-stage research often carries financial weight because it helps companies decide whether to move ahead with a product. In about two-thirds of Dr. Balsega\u2019s articles that lacked details of his industry ties, one or more of his co-authors listed theirs.Dr. Baselga defended the articles, saying that \u201cthese are high-quality manuscripts reporting on important clinical trials that led to a better understanding of cancer treatments.\u201dSome of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Baselga\u2019s known relationships with health care companies.

She said the journal planned to overhaul its tracking of industry relationships.The American Association for Cancer Research said it had begun an \u201cextensive review\u201d of the disclosure forms submitted by Dr. Baselga.It said that it had never barred an author from publishing, and that \u201csuch an action would be necessary only in cases of egregious, consistent violations of the rules.\u201dAmong the most prominent relationships that Dr. Baselga has often failed to disclose is with the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche and its United States subsidiary Genentech.In June 2017, at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago, Dr. Baselga spoke at a Roche-sponsored investor event about study results that the company had been counting on to persuade oncologists to move patients from Herceptin \u2014 which was facing competition from cheaper alternatives \u2014 to a combination treatment involving Herceptin and a newer, more expensive drug, Perjeta.That same day, Roche announced it was scrapping plans to develop the drug. The news was another disappointment involving the class of drugs called PI3K inhibitors, which is a major focus of Dr. Baselga\u2019s current research.From 2013 to 2017, Roche also paid Dr. Baselga more than $50,000 in consulting fees, according to the database.ASCO said it would conduct an internal review of Dr. Baselga\u2019s disclosures and would refer the findings to a panel.Dr. Baselga said that he played no role in the Seragon acquisition, and that he had cut ties with Roche since joining the board of a competitor, Bristol-Myers, in March. As for his presentations at the ASCO meetings in the last two years, he said he had also noted shortcomings in the studies.Charles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Conservatism After Christianity", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new survey reveals the Republican Party's religious divide.Opinion ColumnistOne of the many paradoxes of the Trump era is that our unusual president couldn\u2019t have been elected, and couldn\u2019t survive politically today, without the support of religious conservatives \u2026 but at the same time his ascent was intimately connected to the secularization of conservatism, and his style gives us a taste of what to expect from a post-religious right.The second point was clear during the Republican primaries, when the most reliable churchgoers tended to prefer Ted Cruz but the more secular part of the party was more Trumpist. But it was obscured in the general election, and since, by the fact that evangelical voters especially rallied to Trump and have generally stood by him.Now, though, a new survey reveals the extent to which a basic religious division still exists within Trump\u2019s Republican Party. The churchgoers who ultimately voted for Trump over Clinton still tend to hold different views than his more secular supporters, and the more religious part of the G.O.P. is still the less Trumpist portion \u2014 meaning less populist on economics, but also less authoritarian and tribal on race and identity.The survey was conducted by the Cato Institute\u2019s Emily Ekins for the Voter Study Group, who analyzed the views of Trump voters based on their frequency of church attendance \u2014 from \u201cnever\u201d to \u201cweekly\u201d or more often. The trend was consistent: The more often a Trump voter attended church, the less white-identitarian they appeared, the more they expressed favorable views of racial minorities, and the less they agreed with populist arguments on trade and immigration.The differences were particularly striking on race. For instance, a quarter of Trump voters who never attend church describe being white as \u201cvery important\u201d to their identity; for the most frequent churchgoers voters, it was 9 percent. Among non-churchgoing Trump voters, only 48 percent had warm feelings toward black people, compared to 71 percent of weekly churchgoers; the same sort of pattern held for views of Hispanics, Asians and Jews.Churchgoing Trump voters were still more culturally conservative than Hillary Clinton voters \u2014 more likely to support the death penalty, more skeptical of immigration \u2014 and their views of Muslims, interestingly, seemed to have been influenced by Trump\u2019s own rhetoric, becoming more hostile between 2016 and 2017.But in general, churchgoing Republicans look more like the party many elite conservatives wanted to believe existed before Trump came along \u2014 more racially-tolerant, more accepting of multiculturalism and globalization, and also more consistently libertarian on economics. Secularized Trump voters look more like the party as Trump has tried to remake it, blending an inchoate economic populism with strong racial resentments.Interestingly in the survey the different groups make about the same amount of money, which cuts against strict economic-anxiety explanations for Trumpism. But the churchgoers and nonchurchgoers differ more in social capital: The irreligious are less likely to have college degrees, less likely to be married and more likely to be divorced; they\u2019re also less civically engaged, less satisfied with their neighborhoods and communities, and less trusting and optimistic in general.Meanwhile frequent church attenders, already a minority within the wider society, are also a minority within the Republican coalition. Relatively few Republicans are explicitly religiously unaffiliated (though that number has been climbing too), but only about a third of Trump\u2019s 2016 voters are in church on a typical Sunday, and almost half attend seldom or not at all.This suggests a possibility that should worry both Trump\u2019s religious supporters and anyone who finds his style of conservatism racially toxic. Despite their resistance to that toxicity, the churchgoers in this survey did vote for him, making a pragmatic bet that his policies on abortion and religious liberty were worth living with his Caligulan personal life and racial demagoguery. To defend that bet, some historically-inclined believers have cited past cases where Christians accepted bargains with a not-particularly moral leaders \u2014 including the way the early church accepted the patronage of Roman emperors, from Constantine onward, whose personal piety was limited at best.But the Constantinian bet involved a rising religion allying with a worldly power to accelerate its growth and gains. The bet under Trump involves the reverse sort of situation: A Christian community trying to make the best of its decline, and allying with a leader whose core appeal depends upon and possibly furthers the de-Christianization of conservatism.Such a bet might be understandable as an act of desperation. But it\u2019s hard to see how it can reverse de-Christianization, and easy to see how it might accelerate it.

I think that is part of human nature.\u201dMr. Ai, whose recent artwork has been inspired by the plight of refugees, said that all countries needed to unite and assert \u201cglobal leadership\u201d on the issue of migration, because it was \u201cnot going to stop\u201d and might worsen because of environmental disasters, famine and population growth.Yet a strikingly different response to global migration came from others at the forum, which was convened by The New York Times in cooperation with the city of Athens and the United Nations and is in its sixth year.\u201cWhat\u2019s corrupting politics in Europe today is the influx of migrants,\u201d said Kishore Mahbubani, former ambassador to the United Nations from Singapore, \u201cand that clearly is shifting the debate in Sweden, Germany and everywhere to the far right.\u201d Mr. Mahbubani, a professor at the National University of Singapore, then suggested that Europe should consider a \u201cstrategic pause\u201d on immigration.\u201cThat way the populations can breathe a sigh of relief,\u201d he added, speaking at the panel, \u201cThe Allure of the Illiberal.\u201d \u201cThen the political debate will shift to the middle, where you want it to be.\u201d Otherwise, \u201cyou\u2019re going to end up with illiberal regimes because of liberal principles.\u201dImmigration was a prominent part of the overall theme of the forum: that liberal democracy is facing perils on multiple fronts and must be defended to prevent the rise of more dictatorships.Participants at the conference \u2014 government officials, lawmakers, academics, business leaders and activists \u2014 warned that core components of democracy were being challenged in the United States and Western Europe, but also in Eastern Europe, Turkey, Venezuela, Sweden and India. The rule of law is being eroded, the press is being discredited, if not silenced, and social media is being used to spread illiberal ideas and sway elections.\u201cThe threat we face is very, very real,\u201d said Yascha Mounk, a lecturer on government at Harvard and the author of \u201cThe People vs. Democracy.\u201d \u201cIf you care about liberal democracy, if you care about those values, those are now imperiled in a very serious way.\u201dMr. Mounk said that people were \u201cfalling out of love with democracy at alarming rates.\u201dFor instance, he noted, less than a third of millennials in the United States considered it essential to live in a democracy. And across Europe, the average vote share of populist parties had more than doubled, to 20 percent from 8 percent, since the late 1990s.He attributed the surge in populism to economic stagnation; a shift from monocultural societies to multicultural ones following mass migration; and the rise of technology, which allowed \u201cfake news to spread, fabrications to be accepted as gospel and hate to have a real voice in our system,\u201d Mr. Mounk said.Under the circumstances, he warned, political systems that were \u201cnot sufficiently democratic\u201d could easily morph into dictatorships.Hungary was held up as an example of the populist peril by several panelists, including Mr. Mounk. There, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has applauded \u201cilliberal democracies\u201d in places such as Turkey, China and Russia, and undermined the rule of law. His example is being followed by Poland.While previous generations in Europe had a fear of World War II, she said, \u201cwith time, this fear of the past evaporated, and there was a certain shift from the fear of the past to the fear of the future\u201d \u2014 concerns about migrants, one\u2019s economic well-being and job prospects.\u201cAnd the fear of the future is the passion that is best embraced by the populists.\u201dAnother issue at the forum was the role of social media in amplifying illiberal ideas and affecting election outcomes.Facebook (a conference sponsor) was criticized for being too slow to react to the discovery that thousands of ads had been bought by Russians to mislead American voters in the 2016 presidential election and that the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had used personal information from up to 87 million Facebook users to compose targeted political ads in the United States.Damian Collins, a member of the British Parliament who is chairman of its Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said Facebook was taking actions only after these episodes had been uncovered.\u201cWe\u2019ve got these disclosures because the company has been forced into doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be more transparency about the internal investigation Facebook is running. \u201cIt\u2019s not good enough for us to get things piecemeal, when Facebook feels like telling us.\u201dRichard Allan, Facebook\u2019s director of policy in Europe and a member of the British House of Lords, replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve admitted that we\u2019ve made mistakes. We weren\u2019t particularly focused on various vectors of attack, and so trust has been damaged.\u201dMr. Allan acknowledged that there was \u201ca need for us to be accountable externally.\u201dAt the same time, he said, Facebook\u2019s efforts had to be verified. \u201cI do think that people want some formal regulatory body to be testing that proposition and either saying, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re right, Facebook, you\u2019ve done a good job,\u2019 or \u2018No, actually, it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors.\u2019\u201dMr. Allan said that in the first quarter of the year, Facebook had stopped 583 million fake accounts from going live, in a \u201crobot war\u201d led against computers that randomly generate names and try to register as many as 1,000 Facebook addresses per hour.Facebook was also hiring 10,000 more ad reviewers, engineers, security experts and others working on improving user safety.Ultimately, the populist tide has to be combated by individual citizens, said Mr. Mounk, the Harvard lecturer. He recalled the recommendation of Amos Oz, the Israeli author, that if you witnessed a calamity or a fire, you could always bring a bucket or glass or teaspoon of water to help put it out.Mr. Mounk suggested that conference attendants do exactly that. \u201cThere are a lot of us in the room. We all take a bottle of water and take it to the fire together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe future of our political system is in our hands, and I think it\u2019s our duty as citizens to fight for it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Does one person push a button that blasts a message to millions of residents?On days like today, the Weather Service\u2019s forecasters are constantly monitoring rainfall rates and the affected environments.\u201cIf they feel the rainfall rates are going to exceed the ability of the ground to absorb that rainfall, and you\u2019re going to see a threat to life and property from flooding, that\u2019s when the forecaster will issue a flash flood warning,\u201d Mr. Vaz explained.If your carrier participates in this program, and most do, the flash flood warning will be sent to your phone number using cell towers in the relevant area.Here\u2019s what else is happening:Yellow Newspaper BoxDear Diary:I lost my new pink water bottle on the way home from Chelsea Piers.

There, atop a stack of newspapers, was my pink water bottle.Later, using my caller ID, I contacted Tristan to thank him. After a nice long chat, I asked how he had thought to use a newspaper box to stash the bottle.He paused. You could almost hear his shoulders shrugging.\u201cI guess I thought it was the safest place,\u201d he said.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.A decade ago, that might have been the end of Gabo\u2019s story. While high-income countries like the United States have made tremendous strides against A.L.L. and a string of similar childhood cancers, those gains have not trickled down to low- and middle-income countries, many of which simply don\u2019t have the resources to treat complex diseases. In such places, the blood and fever of leukemia are often mistaken for malaria. And even when doctors do diagnose the disease properly, chemotherapy and radiation are in short supply, and bone marrow transplants nearly nonexistent.By the time Gabo got sick in 2014, doctors in San Salvador knew how to diagnose A.L.L., and pediatric oncologists were available to treat it. He received specialized care similar to what he\u2019d get in any high-income country. And he went into remission a month after his diagnosis.The collaboration marks a welcome opening of institutional borders. The W.H.O. rarely teams up with outside nonprofits, despite the obvious benefits of doing so: St. Jude has extensive specialized knowledge that is clearly lifesaving when shared; the W.H.O. has decades of experience working in countries marred by sweeping poverty and enduring violence.

I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a good idea to apply a standard of \u201cIf men can get away with it, women should be able to, too.\u201d Rather, I think the question we have to ask ourselves is this: What is the right way to behave to honor our sport and to respect our opponents?Ms. Williams was not happy about this warning and let the umpire, Carlos Ramos, know it. So far, not so bad. (It is also common for the umpire to talk to the player first about the coaching \u2014 a sort of \u201csoft warning\u201d before the real warning so that the player has a chance to \u201cmuzzle\u201d the coach. Had that been done, nothing at all might have followed \u2014 but we will never know.)[Discover the most compelling features and reporting from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]It was a few games later when matters really escalated. Williams lost her serve at 3-1 up and demolished her racket \u2014 an automatic code violation that, because it came on top of an earlier warning, resulted in the automatic loss of one point. It was here that Ms. Williams really started to lose the plot. She and Mr. Ramos were, in effect, talking past each other. She was insisting that she doesn\u2019t cheat \u2014 completely believable, but besides the point \u2014 while he was making a call over which he, at that point, had little discretion.It\u2019s worth noting that Ms. Williams has some serious scar tissue when it comes to this particular tournament. In 2004, she was subjected to some notoriously awful line-calling and umpiring in a match against Jennifer Capriati. In 2009, she suffered a self-inflicted wound when, at match point in a semifinal against Kim Clijsters, she lost her temper at a line judge, leading to a point penalty that resulted in her automatically losing the match. In 2011, in a final against Samantha Stosur, Ms. Williams lost a point for yelling, \u201cCome on!\u201d after hitting a forehand that appeared to help her regain her momentum in a game she\u2019d been losing. She went on to berate the umpire, calling her \u201cunattractive inside,\u201d and was hit with another code violation.All of this U.S. Open history, combined, perhaps, with always feeling like an outsider in the game of tennis \u2014 I know exactly how that feels \u2014 goes some way toward explaining why Ms. Williams reacted the way she did, and most of all, how she just couldn\u2019t let go. But what is clear is she could very much not let go.Much of the coverage has focused on what happened when Ms. Williams confronted Mr. Ramos a second time, demanding an apology and calling him a thief. Mr. Ramos handed Ms. Williams a third code violation \u2014 which cost her a whole game. After a long confrontation, play resumed. Naomi Osaka went on to win the match \u2014 her first major title, and the first major title for Japan as well \u2014 under an onslaught of booing and drama the likes of which, as far as I know, we have never seen in a final of a Grand Slam.It\u2019s difficult to know, and debatable, whether Ms. Williams could have gotten away with calling the umpire a thief if she were a male player. But to focus on that, I think, is missing the point. If, in fact, the guys are treated with a different measuring stick for the same transgressions, this needs to be thoroughly examined and must be fixed. But we cannot measure ourselves by what we think we should also be able to get away with. In fact, this is the sort of behavior that no one should be engaging in on the court. There have been many times when I was playing that I wanted to break my racket into a thousand pieces. Then I thought about the kids watching. And I grudgingly held on to that racket.Ms. Williams was absolutely marvelous toward Ms. Osaka after the match. A true champion at her best. But during the match \u2014 well, enough said. The way Ms. Osaka carried herself both during and after the match was truly inspiring.So is there a double standard in tennis?We do need to take a hard look at our sport, without any rose-colored glasses, and root out any inconsistencies and prejudices that might be there. Tennis is a very democratic sport, and we need to make sure it stays that way.But it is also on individual players to conduct themselves with respect for the sport we love so dearly. Because we all look so forward to the next time Ms. Williams and Ms. Osaka play each other; hopefully the drama will come from their magnificent shots and their fierce competitiveness \u2014 two athletes showing us how it is done, inspiring us all in the process.Martina Navratilova is a broadcaster, former tennis champion and human rights activist.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On the Debt Non-Spiral", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySecular stagnation means even less reason to worryOpinion ColumnistSo can we just chalk this one up to communication problems, and let it go? And can we talk about more interesting implications of the economy\u2019s apparent need for low real interest rates on average?Another implication, which I don\u2019t think has gotten enough attention, is that there is even less reason than before to obsess over government debt.The usual scare story about debt warns about a debt spiral: deficits mean higher debt, which means higher interest payments, which means bigger deficits, which means faster growth in debt, and so on until confidence collapses. But this kind of debt spiral can only happen if the interest rate on the debt is higher than the economy\u2019s growth rate.And this hasn\u2019t been true for a while. Here\u2019s the average interest rate paid on federal debt:These days that rate is well below 3 percent even when the economy is near full employment. Meanwhile, we think the U.S. economy has an underlying growth rate of maybe 2 percent, plus 2 percent inflation \u2013 which means 4 percent nominal growth.What this means is that debt doesn\u2019t spiral. On the contrary, it tends to fall as a share of GDP unless the government runs large primary deficits.I\u2019m not saying that we shouldn\u2019t worry about debt at all, because there may be future contingencies when real interest rates rise and debt becomes an issue. But debt is way, way down on the list of things to worry about \u2013 absolutely trivial compared with, say, crumbling infrastructure, which should be fixed without worrying about paying as you go.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How \u2018Hyphenated Americans\u2019 Won World War I", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly a quarter of the men sent to fight in Europe in 1918 were foreign-born.Mr. Wawro is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cSons of Freedom: The Forgotten American Soldiers Who Defeated Germany in World War I.\u201d A hundred years ago this week, on a bend of the Meuse River in northern France, Gen. John Pershing launched the final major Allied offensive against Germany, an assault that would bring an end to World War I two months later. Without American intervention, the war would have probably ended in a German victory, or sputtered to a stalemate, leaving the Germans in possession of much of France, Belgium and Russia. The victory, though, came at significant cost: In the Meuse-Argonne offensive, as the operation came to be known, the Americans alone suffered some 122,000 casualties, including 29,000 dead. During the offensive, the Germans tried to use the army\u2019s multiethnic background as propaganda. The doughboys, as the American troops were known, were \u201chalf-Americans,\u201d the Germans sneered. Many Americans were as contemptuous of the \u201cmelting pot\u201d as the Germans. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, for example, tried in 1896 to extend the class of \u201cexcluded immigrants\u201d from \u201cpaupers, convicts and diseased persons\u201d to include all \u201cItalians, Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks and Asiatics\u201d who arrived on our shores and failed a literacy test. Ideally, Lodge wanted citizenship confined to the \u201coriginal race stocks of the 13 colonies.\u201d The others, he averred, were chiefly \u201cslum dwellers, criminals and juvenile delinquents.\u201dAnd so nearly a quarter of draftees in 1918 were foreigners, often recent arrivals. The Army\u2019s 32nd Division, made up of National Guardsmen from Michigan and Wisconsin, was nicknamed the \u201cGem\u00fctlichkeit Division\u201d \u2014 the German word means \u201ccoziness\u201d \u2014 because it included so many German immigrants. Its rosters, one officer remarked, \u201csounded like Hindenburg\u2019s staff.\u201dHow did this \u201chalf-American\u201d army do in World War I?They were splendid. Even though the doughboys spoke 49 different languages, making training and command difficult, the immigrants fought as bravely and desperately as native-born Americans. Germans deployed against the United States 77th Division in the Argonne Forest, hearing the mix of voices from the other trench, assumed that they were fighting Italian troops who had been sent north to reinforce the French. They weren\u2019t Italians; they were Americans, from Little Italy in Manhattan.\u201cNa\u00efve confidence\u201d is as fine a description of what it means to be American as any \u2014 a superiority complex born of transformative, class-blind opportunity: the opportunity sought by the men and women who flooded into America at the turn of the last century, just like those who arrive today and continue to see the military as an avenue for gaining citizenship and respect.Americans wandering in our nation\u2019s World War I cemeteries in France today will be struck by how many of those \u201cforeign slackers\u201d and \u201chalf-Americans\u201d reside there. The unassimilated names on the gravestones \u2014 Ottavio Fiscalini, Aleksandr Skazhkows, Olaf Knutson \u2014 confirm that, through what Senator Lodge called the \u201cunguarded gates of American citizenship,\u201d passed thousands of men ready to die for America.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pudge Will Keep Us Together", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveThey were headed for a painful breakup. Then a stray dog wandered in.\u201cI saw your car,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201dAs I pulled my clothes back on, grumbling, I tried to give my boyfriend the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he wanted to make a nice gesture, like buying me a cup of coffee.Instead, I found him waiting on the sidewalk next to a knee-high, tan-colored dog. The dog trotted up to me, panting in the humidity, his jowly mouth smiling. I let out the involuntary sound I make whenever I see a new dog, something between an adult cooing at a baby and a child crying over a Christmas present.He was stocky with fine fur and a square head like a pit bull. His small ears folded over into symmetrical triangles.\u201cWhose dog is this?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name? He\u2019s so sweet!\u201dJeff said he had seen Pudge from his car wandering about a mile away. Worried about the dog being lost in the heat, he followed him for a block. \u201cEventually, I got close enough to pull over and open my door,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Pudge jumped in.\u201d\u201cHow did you know his name is Pudge?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cI named him that. I know you have plans, but do you think you could help me find his family?\u201dThis was something I had always loved about Jeff: his knack for derailing my plans in the best way possible. I hadn\u2019t indulged his spontaneity lately, and with Pudge wagging his tail at me, I couldn\u2019t say no.Jeff and I had been a couple for two years back then, and we\u2019d been living together for a year and a half. When we first moved in to the three-bedroom house we shared with two friends, I wanted us to get a dog. This became a nightly topic of conversation, until it became an argument.Jeff had logical reasons against us becoming pet parents: We were trying to save money, our jobs had odd hours, and we both wanted to leave Kansas City, Mo., soon.I countered that he was simply avoiding the commitment of a dog. And by \u201cthe commitment of a dog,\u201d I meant a commitment to me. We didn\u2019t argue often, but when we did it was about this. I never doubted that Jeff loved me, but he was more comfortable living day by day than making plans for a future with me.In the weeks before we found Pudge, life had only gotten more complicated. Jeff\u2019s sister had learned, at 33, that she had brain cancer, and he decided he would return home to Minnesota to care for her. Around then, I decided I would attend graduate school in Spokane, Wash.We had one month left on our lease. Neither of us wanted to break up, but we knew it was right given the circumstances. With the same sad optimism, we agreed we would remain friends.Since Pudge didn\u2019t have tags or a microchip, we walked the neighborhood where Jeff found him for three hours. We crisscrossed streets, Pudge plodding along as we knocked on doors and asked passers-by if they recognized him.\u201cNo,\u201d we kept hearing. \u201cBut he sure is cute. You should keep him.\u201dJeff and I laughed \u2014 and avoided eye contact.After two days of long walks and numerous social media posts, we were no closer to finding Pudge\u2019s owners. The day before, we had a vet check him over and learned he had a serious ear infection.When we squirted the medication into his ears, he squeezed his eyes shut but didn\u2019t pull away or snap. He never even barked, only whined softly if Jeff or I left the room and wagged when we returned.We couldn\u2019t believe that such a well-mannered dog didn\u2019t have a real home. But despite Pudge\u2019s good behavior, our roommates were, understandably, ready for the furry interloper to leave.On the third day, Jeff made the call, and the officer showed up within an hour. Pudge pushed his way out the screen door and greeted the officer the way he greeted everyone, as if she were a long-lost friend.\u201cCan we say goodbye?\u201d I said. I tried to hold myself together, but as I crouched down to pet Pudge, I started sobbing. So did Jeff.The officer looked at us like we were crazy. \u201cI don\u2019t have to take him, you know. He can stay here.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d I said, choking out the words. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep him.\u201dAs the officer led Pudge away, Jeff and I hugged each other.\u201cDid I mess up?\u201d Jeff said.\u201cNo,\u201d I said. But we both cried even harder.About two hours later, when Jeff left to buy beer so we could drown our sorrows, I received a message on Facebook from a woman who recognized Pudge from one of my posts. She said his name was Buddy and gave me the name of the owners. I messaged them to say Buddy was waiting at the shelter.\u201cThat\u2019s probably for the best,\u201d the man wrote. \u201cWe already have three dogs. We were thinking about giving him away anyway.\u201dBy the time Jeff returned, I needed something stronger than alcohol.Knowing that Pudge\u2019s owners didn\u2019t want him back changed everything. We were still broke. Our relationship was still on the verge of ending. And it was true that if we were to leave Pudge at the shelter, he might find another home. Yet we couldn\u2019t let him go.We had two weeks left on our lease, but we had not talked about breaking up. We only talked about getting that damn dog back.So we made a plan. Since I had farther to move and a busier schedule as a student, we decided Jeff would be the one to take Pudge. We begged our roommates to put up with Pudge a little bit longer, and for Jeff\u2019s father to let a dog move into his house at the end of August, along with his adult son.Our friends and loved ones met these requests with more grace than we probably deserved. Perhaps they guessed, correctly, that Jeff and I were both about to fall apart.We brought Pudge home in mid-August and had a normal life together for one week. We took him on walks, bathed him in the backyard with the hose, scolded him for begging for food. Pudge would spread out on the kitchen floor anytime I cooked dinner. He took approximately 10 naps per day yet slept soundlessly through the night.Days before our move-out date, I looked around at our suitcases and half-packed boxes, and at Pudge napping in his bed.\u201cYou know,\u201d I said to Jeff, \u201cit bothers me that we never really talked about long distance as an option.\u201dBefore, I had tried to slowly disengage from Jeff to lessen the looming heartbreak. But having a dog connected us. Rather than going out separately, Jeff and I took Pudge to the park or to brunch. We debated brands of dog food instead of fixating on the end of our relationship.Most important, neither of us ever could have afforded to adopt a dog alone. Splitting the cost of vet bills, adoption fees and supplies was our saving grace; it revived the generosity we\u2019d once shown each other.That night, Jeff and I weighed the pros and cons of staying together long distance, then took a break. We talked about it again the next day, then changed the subject. Took Pudge for a walk, talked about it some more. Talked about it in bed, with Pudge sleeping on the floor.Despite the distance between us, the daunting costs of airfare and the uncertainty about our futures, we couldn\u2019t let each other go any more than we could let go of this dog.One year later, Jeff and I are still together, though living hundreds of miles apart. I wish I could say Pudge was still with us too. But in early December of last year, four months after I had moved away, our vet discovered that Pudge had cancer throughout his body. The day after New Year\u2019s, we had to put him down.Pudge isn\u2019t the only reason Jeff and I didn\u2019t break up, but he played a crucial role, uniting us when we needed it most. By giving an old dog a new home for what turned out to be his final months, we gave our love a new place to live too.Maura Lammers is a graduate student at Eastern Washington University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Progressive Playbook: How These Candidates Pulled Off Their Upsets", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmong the surprises this primary season were several high-profile upsets from the left. The Times asked some of the strategists and candidates behind these wins to break them down.The New York Times spoke with the strategists, campaign managers and candidates at the front lines of progressive insurgent victories, in search of common threads that defined successful campaigns this election cycle.Here they are: A progressive candidate in a district full of moderate voters can overcome some ideological differences, and bring new voters into the process, through personality. A candidate\u2019s life experience needs to reflect those of the voters she needs to convince, the group of experts said. \u201cThere has to be the right coalition \u2014 it has to be the right message, it has to be the right candidate,\u201d he said. A nimble, grass-roots campaign must also be responsive to voter feedback, the experts said. Whether it\u2019s listening to the advice of on-the-ground organizers, or tailoring digital messages to response patterns, the advantage of a nontraditional campaign should be its ability to quickly adjust. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to spend $20,000 on direct mail, maybe spend $700 and test it on Facebook in a targeted way first,\u201d she said.Newer tools aren\u2019t an automatic path to victory, of course. And social media popularity doesn't always translate to votes. In New York, Ms. Nixon dominated the conversation on Twitter, but she was handily defeated by incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose campaign quietly spent more than $2 million on digital advertising, with a heavy focus on Facebook.Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign convened a weekly feedback circle of community leaders, local activists and volunteers. Sarah Groh, Ms. Pressley's 29-year-old campaign manager, said the advisers allowed the team to notice where their opponent was making gains. When the group felt some of the incumbent\u2019s messages were beginning to take hold in the later stages of the race, they decided that Ms. Pressley should record another video ad, focused on delivering her final message to voters in an easy-to-digest fashion. \u201cYou have to be willing to lose,\u201d she said.\u201cEveryone says, \u2018You're not taking the right path,\u2019 but I was just very firm that I don't want to just step into someone else's footprints: I want to create new footprints,\u201d Ms. Hayes said. Abolish ICE. No corporate PAC money. Medicare for all. As national Democrats wrangle with incremental, politically pragmatic solutions to policy problems such as immigration and health care, progressive Democrats are offering bold, sweeping proposals. \u201cOne of the things that we feel strongly about is that candidates run an unapologetically progressive campaign and speak authentically about the issues that they actually care about connect with voters,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, national director for the Working Families Party. The bold policy proposals gave liberals a progressive version of the Tea Party wave in the Republican Party \u2014 the angry, uncompromising conservative surge that consumed the party after President Obama\u2019s election. It is also a rebuttal to the idea that progressive Democrats are simply against President Trump. Ms. Groh, Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign manager, came to the campaign without any experience in traditional electoral races, but experience in issue-based grass-roots campaigns. Ms. Groh said she believed voters craved a \u201clevel of authenticity,\u201d and innovative policy solutions, delivered by the right messenger, can check that box. Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign manager said ignoring television was the source of internal campaign battles, but the move allowed them to invest an additional $130,000 in field organizers. It also allowed the campaign to spend money on targeted media \u2014 including an advertisement on Spanish-language television and outreach on several ethnic media outlets in Boston. Josi Nielsen, the Missouri political strategist who managed Mr. Bell\u2019s election, said the campaign advertised in community newspapers, which have a small but deeply engaged audience. \u201cIf the message resonates, the challenge is reaching enough people,\u201d Ms. Nielsen said. This year\u2019s insurgent candidates have also looked to another, new not-so-secret weapon: text messages. Several relied on peer-to-peer texting apps like Hustle and Relay to reach huge numbers of voters directly on their cellphones.Ms. Pressley\u2019s team started using Hustle on August 9, initially for event building and volunteer recruitment.The campaign communicated with 4,800 volunteer prospects through the service \u2014 25 percent of them replied to the texts, and close to 8 percent of those texted committed to help.During the campaign\u2019s final days, the campaign initiated conversations with 26,500 voters, reaching out with over 41,000 messages in total.\u201cHustle is a game changer for grass-roots organizing and fund-raising. It allowed us to connect with so many different parts of the district and was an important piece in our path to victory,\u201d said Gina Christo, Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign finance director.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s America: Reckless, Alone and Ridiculed", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s speeches before the United Nations foreshadowed his intention to ignore our greatest threats and to stoke fresh conflict needlessly.Ms. Rice was the national security adviser during President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.Trailed by the Russia investigation, back-stabbing within his administration, looming midterm elections and Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s troubled nomination, President Trump arrived this week in New York distracted and under siege. At first blush, Mr. Trump\u2019s second appearance at the United Nations General Assembly may have seemed like more self-congratulatory bluster, nationalist isolationism and rote genuflection to the altar of sovereignty \u2014 much like last year. But this time, Americans suffered the added humiliation of watching the world burst out laughing at their president, whose false bravado no longer induces shock but invites derision.Given this drama, it\u2019s easy to mistake Mr. Trump\u2019s visit for a mash-up of meetings and muddled messages. But careful observers should not be diverted from discerning the president\u2019s real purpose at the United Nations, because it is ominous.On four critical policy fronts, President Trump foreshadowed his intention to ignore our greatest threats and to stoke fresh conflict where it is neither necessary nor wise. More telling than his rabidly ideological speech to the General Assembly was the president\u2019s more substantive remarks before the Security Council on Wednesday. And by now we have ample reason to conclude that Mr. Trump generally means what he says and (eventually) does much of what he threatens.Not once in a visit whose central theme was American sovereignty did Mr. Trump mention Russia\u2019s extraordinary and continuing interference in our democratic process. For reasons we can only hope will soon become clear, President Trump remains determined to coddle our most dangerous adversary, to the increasing detriment of our national security.Second, President Trump persisted in fueling the false impression that he has effectively addressed the grave threat from North Korea. Granted, the reduction in tensions between North and South Korea and Mr. Trump\u2019s dialogue with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, are preferable to \u201cfire and fury.\u201d While the North\u2019s moratorium on missile and nuclear tests is a necessary first step, we are no closer to the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea than this time last year. The national security adviser, John Bolton, raised the ante, directly targeting our closest allies: \u201cWe do not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anybody else.\u201d Mr. Bolton warned Iran that, \u201cIf you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay.\u201d He added, \u201cWe are watching, and we will come after you.\u201d This intensified saber rattling against Iran presages the prospect of war in the Persian Gulf, should President Trump determine he needs a greater distraction than he can generate in a day\u2019s work on Twitter.Mr. Trump\u2019s trip to the United Nations this week set America on an ever more dangerous course in which we are courting conflict with powerful countries that don\u2019t seek it and ignoring persistent threats from committed adversaries with the will and capacity to do us grave harm. In these troubling times, up is down, black is white and America stands alone, reckless and ridiculed, among the nations of the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Chairman, Jack Ma, Plans to Step Down", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group said on Monday that Jack Ma would resign as chairman, unveiling a leadership succession plan for the Chinese e-commerce giant as it faces a more uncertain environment at home.Mr. Ma, who co-founded Alibaba in his apartment 19 years ago and has led it ever since, will step down as chairman a year from Monday, the company said. He will be succeeded by Daniel Zhang, currently Alibaba\u2019s chief executive.Alibaba said the move was meant to foster long-term growth and reduce its dependence on any one person. At the same time, it took pains to stress that Mr. Ma would remain involved with the company. It said he will remain on its board until 2020 and would remain in the Alibaba Partnership, a group of senior longtime managers who exercise significant control over the business and its affiliates.\u201cThis transition demonstrates that Alibaba has stepped up to the next level of corporate governance from a company that relies on individuals, to one built on systems of organizational excellence and a culture of talent development,\u201d Mr. Ma said in a company statement.In an interview with The Times on Friday, Mr. Ma said his retirement would be \u201cthe beginning of an era\u201d and that he would focus on education. \u201cI love education,\u201d he said.In exchanges with The Times after the article was published, Mr. Ma said his decision had nothing to do with some of the issues it mentioned, such as the Chinese government\u2019s growing role in businesses or the weakening business environment.Some investors in New York and Hong Kong said over the weekend that they aren\u2019t overly concerned about Alibaba\u2019s business and its leadership transition. But the confidence in China\u2019s economic and political conditions is so low that the departure of an iconic figure like Mr. Ma has made them wonder how they should evaluate their investment portfolios.On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, Alibaba posted an image of Mr. Ma\u2019s new business card. It listed 12 titles, including teacher, Alibaba\u2019s No. 1 employee, founder of the Jack Ma Foundation and spokesman for village teachers. It did not list Alibaba executive chairman.An Alibaba spokeswoman said it was not a formal business card and was intended to highlight Mr. Ma\u2019s other roles.Under Mr. Ma, Alibaba became one of the world\u2019s largest and most powerful technology companies. It dominates e-commerce in China, the world\u2019s largest single market of internet users. Hundreds of millions of Chinese use Alibaba\u2019s electronic payment affiliate, Alipay, to buy clothing and gadgets, order out lunch and invest their money. In recent years, as China\u2019s internet use has surged, Alibaba\u2019s market capitalization has risen to levels that rival Facebook\u2019s.It hasn\u2019t stopped there. Alibaba\u2019s sprawling businesses also include brick-and-mortar stores, online video, movies and other enterprises, and it has sought to expand in promising new markets like Southeast Asia and India.But investors have begun to worry in recent months that Alibaba\u2019s road is getting tougher, and shares of Alibaba and some of its rivals have fallen significantly in recent months.Alibaba and Mr. Ma on Monday portrayed the succession plan as a sign that the company isn\u2019t dependent on one person. Mr. Ma\u2019s involvement in the company isn\u2019t likely to end with his resignation, however. He has a stake of more than 6 percent in the company\u2019s shares. Crucially, he will also have considerable sway in the company and its affiliates thanks to its complicated legal structure. Under Chinese law, crucial licenses to do business in certain industries must stay in control of Chinese nationals when a company lists its shares overseas, as Alibaba has done.\u201cI also want to return to education, which excites me with so much blessing because this is what I love to do,\u201d he said in the company statement. \u201cThe world is big, and I am still young, so I want to try new things \u2014 because what if new dreams can be realized?!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Would You Hire Kavanaugh? ", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf a third of the men on the Supreme Court had faced allegations of sexual misconduct, what would that do to the court\u2019s legitimacy? Opinion ColumnistThis article has been updated to reflect news developments.Think of the Brett Kavanaugh nomination this way:A president who has faced at least a dozen allegations of sexual assault is attempting to appoint a second Supreme Court justice who has credibly been accused of sexual misconduct, and those two justices might well help form a new court majority to chip away at abortion rights in the United States. I don\u2019t pretend to know precisely what happened in the various incidents Kavanaugh is accused of. But this I know: When a man has a cloud over him, of multiple sexual assault allegations and of lies that come close to perjury, and when that man\u2019s defenders refuse to allow a thorough investigation, that person should not be elevated to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.Yet without any serious investigation, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Friday to recommend Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Senate Republican leaders then agreed to a limited F.B.I. investigation taking no more than a week, which is encouraging, but may still be inadequate, or simply ignored. What is clear is that Kavanaugh has moved a step closer to the Supreme Court.Hold on! Kavanaugh\u2019s defenders are right that the Supreme Court confirmation process has been politicized. Any doubts, just ask \u201cJustice Merrick Garland.\u201dIt would be a tragedy if Kavanaugh similarly were confirmed only to have further evidence become public. If a third of the men on the Supreme Court had a history of sexual misconduct, what would that do to the legitimacy of the institution?Of course, if Kavanaugh drank as much as some of his former associates suggest \u2014 he denies that \u2014 then he himself may not have clear memories of what he did. Or to him, it all may have been an awkward adolescent game, soon forgotten, even as to Blasey it was a terrifying assault.The way to end such assaults is to replace impunity with accountability. That\u2019s fundamentally what is at stake with the Kavanaugh nomination: Will we ignore serious, credible allegations and give a powerful man a pass, or will we at least try to ferret out the truth?Yes, it\u2019s still possible that Kavanaugh is the victim of a character assassination or mistaken identity. Liberals should remember a basic lesson of our flawed criminal justice system: Well-meaning eyewitnesses make mistakes all the time, and memory plays terrible tricks.On the assault charges, let\u2019s avoid a rush to judgment, but also a rush to confirmation. Let\u2019s investigate. Call more witnesses. Get the F.B.I. to investigate, as it did in the Anita Hill case, without any tight time constraint. Kavanaugh shouldn\u2019t be confirmed with this cloud hanging over him.This is not a criminal trial but a job interview. People often are not hired for jobs because of unproven concerns about their background. Sometimes this is unfair. But one would have to feel enormously entitled \u2014 an echo of the male entitlement that fueled the alleged assaults \u2014 to demand a job without a rigorous investigation.Few of us would hire a man who lied and is under a cloud from multiple sexual assault allegations. And if a man\u2019s character doesn\u2019t qualify him for other jobs, then how can he be elevated to the Supreme Court to sit in judgment for life over women and men alike?Advertisement"}

What does that mean for the court? Would there be an expectation for him to recuse himself on certain cases?Judge Kavanaugh is respected by the justices, and they would welcome him to the court. There\u2019s no reason to expect him to recuse from any cases as a result of the recent accusation.What happens if he doesn\u2019t get confirmed?After he withdrew, Judge Ginsburg went back to work at the federal appeals court in Washington on which Judge Kavanaugh serves. On the other hand, Judge Robert H. Bork stepped down from that court in 1988 after the Senate rejected his nomination.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.President Trump has never handled criticism well, but this past week has proved especially challenging. Mr. Trump quickly corroborated these accounts by demonstrating precisely the sort of erratic, antidemocratic behavior that is driving administration officials to come forward with their concerns. He ranted that the stories were all lies and raved that the gutless traitors who had slandered him must be rooted out and handed over to the government. Finger-pointing, name-calling, wild accusations, cries of treason \u2014 it was an unsettling display, not simply of Mr. Trump\u2019s emotional fragility and poor impulse control, but also of his failure to understand the nature of the office he holds, the government he leads and the democracy he has sworn to serve. Twenty months into the job, Mr. Trump has yet to grasp that the highest law of this land is the Constitution, not whoever occupies the Oval Office at any given moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know why they don\u2019t take care of a situation like that. I think it\u2019s embarrassing for the country to allow protesters. You don\u2019t even know what side the protesters are on.\u201dSomeone with the president\u2019s best interests at heart may want to explain to him that the First Amendment specifically protects political expression, no matter how befuddling some find it.

{"Headline": "Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Progressive Politics Made Her a Global Sensation. But Do They Work at Home?", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBetween parenting jokes and policy explanations, she called the $5 billion package of tax cuts and payments \u201cthe most significant change to the country\u2019s welfare system in decades.\u201d Of all her government\u2019s efforts, \u201cthis is the thing I\u2019m most proud of,\u201d she said, telling the audience that if she looked tired it was only because she was not wearing makeup.The video from July was just one example of Ms. Ardern testing the reach of what she describes as politics \u201cwith a bit of heart.\u201dIn many ways \u2014 temperament, style and policy, among them \u2014 Ms. Ardern is the polar opposite of President Trump and other brash male leaders.She has become a subject of global fascination for her progressive values, her youth and charisma, and her status as a new mother who has garnered more attention than any previous leader of this small Pacific country.This week, with her partner and daughter, now 3 months old, she is taking her pitch to New York. She will deliver New Zealand\u2019s national statement at the United Nations on Thursday.She is also doing interviews with the Today Show, Christiane Amanpour and Stephen Colbert. The international news media are fond of promoting her as a new kind of unconventional 21st-century leader \u2014 the unmarried mother and policy wonk who wore a traditional Maori cloak, while pregnant, to Buckingham Palace to meet the queen.But even as her star soars abroad, Ms. Ardern increasingly faces challenges at home. Corporate interests are lining up against her agenda after the country\u2019s business confidence rating dropped to a 10-year low in July; the confidence rating has since improved, according to new figures released this month, but it remains weak nonetheless.Important policies, including tax reform, are still being decided, and critics have cast doubts on Ms. Ardern\u2019s ability to maintain discipline within her governing coalition.Experts say New Zealand exemplifies the difficulty of enacting a progressive agenda at a time when politics are fractured and conservatives worldwide are emboldened. Ms. Ardern\u2019s supporters say she must push even harder for transformative change.Ms. Ardern, 38, grew up in small-town New Zealand, studied communications in college and joined the Labour Party at a young age.She has spent her whole career in politics, working as a staff member for former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and later for Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister, before entering Parliament in 2008.Ms. Clark has often described her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in glowing terms. In an interview last month, she predicted that Ms. Ardern\u2019s presence at the United Nations General Assembly would lead to a clamor from world leaders who want to be seen with her.This week, images of Ms. Ardern, the first head of government to take her baby to the United Nations, were published in newspapers and shared on social media around the world.She also made headlines for declining to sign a draft pledge on combating drugs that was introduced on Monday by Mr. Trump. Ms. Ardern said she preferred to view drug abuse not as a national security issue, but rather as a health matter with a focus on treatment for those in need.\u201cShe\u2019s definitely struck a chord with the comments about kindness, and she exhibits that herself; you don\u2019t hear a mean word come out of Jacinda\u2019s mouth,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cShe is genuinely a nice and decent and kind person. But we\u2019re also seeing as she develops into the office that she\u2019s firm.\u201dIt is that last point that remains an open question \u2014 at least for some.Ms. Ardern came to power last October. After nine years of center-right government in New Zealand, voters chose Ms. Ardern and her party because of their promise of a better deal for ordinary people, especially the marginalized and vulnerable.But her power is limited. In New Zealand, a party does not have to win an outright majority in Parliament to govern. Labour formed a governing coalition with minor parties and in recent weeks, disputes between Ms. Ardern\u2019s party and the party of Winston Peters, the deputy prime minister whose support was crucial to her victory, have become more frequent, leading critics to argue that Ms. Ardern is not in charge of her own government.Further undermining her standing, two of her cabinet ministers have been forced out in the past month: one was accused of an altercation with a staff member and another failed to disclose meetings with stakeholders tied to specific legislation.Ms. Ardern said that in both cases, she acted decisively, but opponents accused her of being weak and failing to manage her team.Opposition lawmakers have also criticized her tendency to appoint expert panels to explore dozens of topics, leaving the details vague on her plans for major issues like taxes.\u201cSupporters of the government have some expectations of quite big change happening, but I don\u2019t really know yet whether this is a transformative government or not,\u201d said Bryce Edwards, a New Zealand political analyst.

{"Headline": "U.S. Is Said to Allow Sanctions on Foreigners Accused of Interfering in Elections", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is preparing a new executive order to allow sanctions of foreign citizens suspected of interference in the American elections, officials who have reviewed the order said.The new order is aimed broadly at any potential outside interference in American elections, but is meant to give the government an additional tool to punish, and deter, Russian entities suspected of trying to spread disinformation or otherwise influence the midterm and subsequent balloting.The new sanctioning powers come as the Trump administration has been criticized for not doing enough to try to prevent Russian interference.The order could be signed as soon as Wednesday, although officials cautioned that the timing could shift because of the threat of Hurricane Florence or because of further White House review.The order, a concise document of less than two full pages, would give the director of national intelligence, working with other agencies, the power to identify when foreign interference in an election had taken place, the officials said. The Treasury Department would be responsible for administering the sanctions against individuals and foreign entities. The Justice Department, the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies would be involved in investigating allegations of interference.Democrats in Congress and others have criticized the Trump administration for being too slow to develop new policies and procedures to counter election interference. Some technology executives have also said the government has done too little to share intelligence with social media companies that Russian operatives have sought to use to spread disinformation.Administration officials have pushed back against that criticism, saying that the government was taking the threat of interference seriously and had been ramping up its response.The executive order, an official said, will be a demonstration of the seriousness of the effort to counter influence.After the summit meeting in July with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, criticism of President Trump has intensified. At that news conference, Mr. Trump was dismissive of the conclusion by intelligence agencies that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election.While Mr. Trump has at times acknowledged that Russia sought to intervene, he has often bristled at any suggestion that he did not win his campaign fairly and played down any role Moscow might have had in the outcome.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s ambivalence, intelligence officials have said that Russian entities have continued to try to interfere in American democratic institutions. Facebook and other technology companies have identified what they have said are fake grass-roots campaigns aimed at sowing divisiveness ahead of the November midterm elections.White House officials have insisted that Mr. Trump is acting against any foreign government or entity that seeks to influence American elections.\u201cPresident Trump is committed to protecting our nation\u2019s elections from foreign interference and has made it clear that his administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections from any nation state or other malicious actor,\u201d Garrett Marquis, a National Security Council spokesman, said Tuesday.Last year, Congress passed legislation requiring the government to penalize Russia in response to its efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. That law prompted the March and June sanctions by the Treasury Department.The new executive order could give the American government an additional tool with which to highlight individuals or entities involved in continuing interference.Russia has been accused of seeking both to infiltrate election infrastructure and to spread disinformation to try to influence voting. Senior administration officials are often careful not to simply focus on Russia, but note that a number of countries hostile to the United States may seek to interfere.In recent weeks, the Trump administration has been more public in its discussions about that threat.In August, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, Christopher Wray, the F.B.I. director, and other officials appeared at the White House to outline the steps they were taking to prevent foreign interference.Mr. Coats said at the time that intelligence agencies had learned the lessons of 2016.\u201cThe president has specifically directed us to make the matter of election meddling and securing our election process a top priority,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have done that, and are doing that, and will continue to do so.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s no coincidence to me that this opioid problem and the river crisis are happening at the same time,\u201d said Amy Cordalis, the Yurok tribe\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWhen that resource is gone, it leads to a sense of despair.\u201dLast year the tribe had to cancel commercial and subsistence fishing altogether because there were virtually no fish to catch. Four out-of-date dams upstream have led to residual ecological strain downstream, and now the solution tribal members hope for \u2014 their removal \u2014 awaits approval by an obscure federal government agency. The tribes, environmentalists and others hope the dams can be removed to address the ecological and cultural crises at once.The broader fight for the river, said Ms. Cordalis, is \u201call about cultural restoration. This is a story of cultural perseverance, and of surviving assimilation and oppression.\u201d\u201cI think a lot of our people who are on drugs have that same feeling: You want that culture back, because you feel it in your heart and you believe in it and you know what\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil that, I think people are really susceptible to all these bad influences.\u201dRelated efforts include the revival of their native language and the planned development of \u201cwellness villages,\u201d culturally appropriate sites along the river that can serve as rehabilitation homes, where basket weaving and sweathouses will play a role. Tribal leaders highlighted the success of young tribal members pursuing higher education at top tier schools, who they hope can come back home to the reservation and contribute to the cultural revival.Many struggling through drug addiction have found hope in reconnecting with traditions, like Codie Donahue, 38, who wound up homeless after he and his girlfriend became addicted to methamphetamine and heroin.Mr. Donahue, who has Yurok and Karuk lineage, recently checked into a drug rehab program in Eureka. He has been thinking a lot about the holy ceremony he once performed as a high priest for the Karuk Indians. In the ritual, he and others would pray in hopes that the river would wash away the sins of his tribe.\u201cEach morning, you go up to the altar in the mountains, and at the end of the ceremony, we go down to the river and it washes all the bad down to the deepest parts of the ocean,\u201d Mr. Donahue said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a new day, a new time.

{"Headline": "When Your Child Believes Meat Is Murder", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvice about health and dinner-table diplomacy for parents of vegetarian kids.After viewing \u201cBlackfish,\u201d a documentary about the mistreatment of animals at SeaWorld, Jeffrey Miller\u2019s daughter, Hannah, became concerned that eating meat was murder. Last year, she decided to become a vegetarian. \u201cOur 14-year-old has completely bailed on meat of her own accord, so we\u2019ve had to do some maneuvering,\u201d Mr. Miller said of his daughter, who is the lone vegetarian in a household where both parents and her 16-year-old sister, Emma, happily consume chicken, pork and turkey. He noted that in their town of Sioux Falls, S.D., the middle of the pork and beef belt, many of her friends view her vegetarian status as \u201cweird.\u201dBut the family has willingly accommodated her new dietary restrictions. Mr. Miller and his wife, Barb, often prepare rice, bean and pasta dishes for her, sometimes adding in meat for the rest of the family. They\u2019ve also discovered items they all enjoy, like spicy black bean burgers. \u201cIt\u2019s broadened our horizons as well,\u201d he said.When a child decides to become a vegetarian, parents should first probe what\u2019s driving this decision. \u201cRespect their choice. Approach it without judgment, but be inquisitive as to the rationale,\u201d said Caroline West Passerrello, a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, an organization of food and nutrition professionals. Rachel Goldman, a clinical psychologist with a private practice in New York, says it\u2019s important to rule out the possibility that the child is motivated by disordered eating \u2014 selecting a vegetarian diet to lose weight. The emphasis should be on discussing how to make this new lifestyle a healthy one.Although the vegetarian child is often very impassioned about what is on the table, it\u2019s important to have family conversations about mutual respect. Dr. Goldman suggests having a conversation that makes clear that no one else\u2019s eating habits need to change, but that perhaps other family members could be open to trying new foods and increasing their intake of fruits and vegetables.Inevitable tensions can arise when a child feels that eating meat constitutes murder and can\u2019t tolerate other family members doing so. Rachel Gunther\u2019s son, Elias, decided to become a vegetarian at the age of 4, repulsed by the idea that animals were being killed for food. He was deeply troubled that his younger brother, Theo, continued to eat meat. \u201cIt was a difficult parenting moment,\u201d said Ms. Gunther, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and is associate director for Youth on Board, which supports young people organizing for change in their communities and in their own lives.Parents do need to be vigilant in ensuring vegetarian children get enough of one essential nutrient: iron. Ms. Passerrello said that iron is more easily absorbed from animal sources than plants. Spinach and whole grains are the best vegetarian sources. She said iron is better absorbed in plant-based sources when combined with vitamin C, so squeezing lime, lemon or orange on a salad or adding citrus fruits to smoothies can be helpful. Cereals fortified with iron are another option.Vegan diets are slightly more challenging than vegetarian. The only essential nutrient found in animal products that is not usually found in plants is vitamin B12. While vegetarians can get that through dairy products, vegans cannot. So it\u2019s typically recommended that vegans take a B12 supplement or consume foods fortified with vitamin B12. Dr. Mangels points out that B12 is often added to soy milk, veggie meats and some breakfast cereals. Vegans can consume fortified plant milk to get calcium found in cow\u2019s milk, along with high calcium foods like dark green vegetables, she said. To satisfy the dietary requests of a vegetarian among a houseful of carnivores, Dr. Mangels suggests a three-pronged approach. First, determine which meals your family already likes that are already vegetarian, like macaroni and cheese or certain pastas. Second, consider dishes that can be easily adapted to meet the needs of meat eaters and vegetarians. Options include stir-fry vegetables or a burrito bar where diners can choose to add a protein, like tofu and chicken. Soups can be easily made with vegetable instead of chicken stock. Pastas can be made with and without meat. Third, keep options like veggie burgers in the freezer in case the entree can\u2019t be adapted for the vegetarian. Involving vegetarian children in the cooking is a great way to give them ownership over their choice and teach them a valuable skill, Dr. Mangels said. You might also look for meatless international options like packaged Indian or Mexican food that can be flavorful and convenient.Diana Knoll\u2019s daughter, Nikki Eldred, decided to become a vegetarian when she was 11 and became a vegan when she was 18 in 2013. Ms. Knoll, who lives in Richland, Wash., supported her daughter\u2019s desire to save animals and saw this as an opportunity for her to eat a healthy diet. She ate healthfully while at home. However, once she went off to college, \u201cshe discovered Oreos were vegan and went on a full vegan junk food diet,\u201d heavy on processed foods, bread and pasta, Ms. Knoll said. Ms. Levin said, \u201cit\u2019s important to understand what a healthful diet looks like. It\u2019s fruit, vegetables, grain, nuts and seeds, not Oreos, potato chips, soda and sports drinks.\u201dMs. Knoll has since educated her daughter about a whole food plant-based lifestyle and says she\u2019s now eating far more healthfully. In fact, the entire family has gone vegan. \u201cShe introduced the vegan lifestyle to us and then I, in turn, introduced a whole-food, plant-based lifestyle to her,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Based in Santa Ana, the program began amid a national opioid epidemic that had resulted in a surge of heroin use.It was organized by medical students and public health experts steeped in data about effective public health interventions.But the program, the first and only one in Orange County, soon found itself under fire by critics and concerned community members. A swell of needle litter in public libraries and parks in Santa Ana collided with a worsening homelessness epidemic in the region, and the two issues became intertwined in the minds of the public and political leaders.Transient individuals, critics said, were using the needles to shoot up in public and then improperly discarding them. And the syringe exchange program, they said, had facilitated their drug abuse and created the needle litter.The fallout has pitted worried public health experts against Orange County political leaders, who have fielded large numbers of complaints and concerns from constituents.The program\u2019s leaders and various public health experts have forcefully pushed back against the attacks but have struggled to change public opinion.\u201cThere are a lot of misconceptions about syringe exchanges despite lots of public health evidence around this. We know that syringe exchanges have been proven time and again here in the United States and internationally to reduce the spread of diseases,\u201d said Nathan Birnbaum, member of the board of directors for the syringe exchange and a fourth-year medical student at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine.In December 2017, Santa Ana terminated the needle exchange\u2019s permit. As part of an effort to remain open, the exchange requested authorization from the state\u2019s Department of Public Health to operate a mobile, countywide program in four cities: Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange and Costa Mesa. Last month, it was granted permission to operate the expanded program.Now Orange County leaders have escalated their battle by suing to permanently shut down the expanded syringe exchange before it begins operating again.\u201dYou have people shooting up in the public-library restroom. You have municipal employees who are being pricked when emptying the trash,\u201d said Andrew Do, the chairman of the Orange County board of supervisors.The first hearing on the case is set for later this month. But it is unclear if there will be an immediate or permanent resolution to the conflict.The state health department declined to comment on the matter, but voiced support for needle exchange programs as important public health tools.\u201cWe really understand people\u2019s concerns about syringe litter,\u201d said Dr. Karen Smith, the state\u2019s public health officer. \u201cThe challenge for us is communicating that the syringe exchange programs is one of your most potent tools for decreasing syringe litter.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)An Evening With \u201cThe Daily\u201d at the Theatre at Ace Hotel DTLA: Sept. 20Twenty minutes a day, five days a week, \u201cThe Daily\u201d brings transparency to how the news is reported and explores topics of the day in depth.

All of their major policy moves, on health care, taxes and tariffs, are playing badly with voters.Have they sent out their job applications? Because the American people aren\u2019t buying. A few weeks ago an internal G.O.P. survey found that \u201cwe\u2019ve lost the messaging battle\u201d on the legislation, with voters overwhelmingly believing that the tax cuts went to corporations and the rich, and many worried that increased deficits will endanger Social Security and Medicare.Finally, there\u2019s the Donald Trump twist \u2014 the one area where he is somewhat at odds with G.O.P. orthodoxy: His economic nationalism, embodied in a rapidly expanding set of import tariffs.After the 2016 election, many commentators argued that Trump\u2019s Electoral College win reflected a backlash against globalization. And that suggested that his protectionist turn might prove popular. But it hasn\u2019t.Why are Republican policy ideas falling so flat? At one level, the answer is obvious: G.O.P. policies are unpopular because they hurt far more Americans than they help. Why should anyone expect cutting taxes on the rich while taking health care away from the sick to be popular?When Bush pushed through his tax cut, we had a budget surplus, so it wasn\u2019t clear to voters that less revenue might mean cuts to programs they count on. When you push through big tax cuts in the face of a budget deficit \u2014 and when your own party has spent years warning about imminent fiscal doom and demanding spending cuts \u2014 the implications are more obvious.In the case of health care, it was a lot easier to peddle scare stories about Obamacare before it went into effect, insuring tens of millions, than it is to defend taking away coverage people already have.But if the G.O.P. does win, it will have won very, very ugly.

{"Headline": "As Storms Loom, Some Immigrant Families Wonder: Is It Safe to Seek Help?", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith Hurricane Florence looming, Lucy, her husband and their twin 16-year-old daughters sat frozen in their living room last week on Johns Island, off the coast of South Carolina, unsure of what to do.The storm threatened to plow into the modest home that the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity had built for them more than a decade earlier, but they were afraid to drive to a shelter. \u201cFor undocumented people, driving is always a stressful situation,\u201d said Lucy, who asked that her last name not be published because of her immigration status and that of her husband, who is also undocumented.Through their windows, the family saw red and blue lights multiply around them last week as government workers moved in to mark off emergency routes and clear brush that could become dangerous. The police were everywhere, Lucy said. \u201cYou feel fear from head to toe.\u201dFor families like hers who live with the constant fear of deportation, the storm that has devastated large swaths of the Southeast presented an extra set of challenges. Many immigrants in the Carolinas live in trailers and other forms of low-income housing that can be especially vulnerable in natural disasters. Hurricane Florence forced them to think about whether seeking government resources like shelter, food or other aid would help them get through the storm, or put them at greater risk.The dilemma was not helped by conflicting messages from the authorities in recent days about how they planned to deal, or not, with the issue of undocumented immigrants seeking help in a region that was facing not only intense rain and flooding, but months of recovery.Last week, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement that the agency would not conduct enforcement operations in areas affected by the storm. But Jeff Byard, an associate administrator for response and recovery for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said in a news conference the same day, \u201cI\u2019m not going to use the terminology \u2018guarantee,\u2019\u201d when reporters asked if immigrants without legal status would be safe in shelters.\u201cWe\u2019re going to help any human that needs help,\u201d Mr. Byard said, but he did not answer questions about whether his agency was coordinating with federal immigration authorities in any way.The Red Cross, the main operator of shelters during and after Florence, said that the organization does not allow immigration agents into shelters unless they have a warrant or court order. But that assurance did little to assuage fears among immigrants who were already skittish because of recent, stepped-up enforcement policies under the Trump administration, many of them supported by state and local government officials in the region.Border Patrol agents who were spotted over the weekend helping with response and recovery efforts in Kinston, N.C., set off an alarm that spread immediately on social media, according to Laura Gardu\u00f1o Garcia, an immigrant advocate in the region who quickly tried to spread the word that the agents were not making arrests.Ms. Gardu\u00f1o Garcia said she was frustrated that the officers had identified themselves as immigration agents. \u201cHow could they think that was a good idea?\u201d she said.Jeremy L. McKinney, an immigration lawyer with offices in Greensboro, Wilmington and Asheville, N.C., said that clients had been calling nonstop to ask for advice about where to go during and after the storm.\u201cThat\u2019s all good and well,\u201d he said, \u201cbut what our clients express is that it doesn\u2019t matter what amount of public relations work that the government does here at the last minute, they\u2019ve already created this climate of distrust.\u201dMr. McKinney\u2019s employees were using social media to spread information about the storm that had been translated into Spanish, but worried that it was not reaching everyone who might need it. Ms. Gardu\u00f1o Garcia, the organizer, said that people living in trailer parks in North Carolina had received evacuation notices in English demanding that they leave their homes by midweek. But she said that many people stayed put, confused by conflicting information and the language barrier.From her trailer home in Elgin, S.C., in the north-central part of the state, an immigrant woman named Maria said on Friday, before the worst of the storm, that she, her husband and their 15-year-old daughter were stocking up on canned food and water, but were still unclear about whether they were safe or needed to flee.\u201cWe still haven\u2019t received information about how much rain to expect,\u201d she said. She was concerned that the trailer could be overcome by floodwaters or crushed by a fallen tree. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much it can handle. We\u2019re trying to see where we can go, or if we should stay to see if things get more intense.\u201dMaria, who asked that her last name not be published because of her immigration status, said that her daughter\u2019s high school had opened up a shelter and was giving out free meals, but that she did not feel comfortable going there. For one thing, she said, it would have meant leaving behind their two cats. The family would go to a friend\u2019s house if they had to, she said, though she was not certain that they would be any safer there.Over the weekend, many immigrants turned to informal networks of support to avoid interacting with the authorities. Leticia Zavala, a farm labor organizer in Dudley, N.C., said that 40 farm workers slept at her organization\u2019s headquarters instead of going to shelters.North Carolina is a major producer of sweet potatoes and tobacco. Some of the farm workers are undocumented; others have guest worker visas. But Ms. Zavala said that many were mindful of a handful of cases in the last year in which growers turned over migrant workers to the authorities for using false Social Security numbers.Ms. Zavala said that most of these farm workers live in migrant housing, which is provided by growers and can vary from mobile homes that house six to eight people to barracks that accommodate hundreds.The workers who stayed in her offices pooled resources during the storm, Ms. Zavala said. They borrowed a generator from a mechanic across the street and a grill from a Mexican restaurant next door.But Ms. Zavala found herself batting down worries that the storm could put noncitizens at risk after a rumor started on Facebook that ICE agents were in her offices. They weren\u2019t. \u201cPeople are freaking out and asking what\u2019s going on,\u201d Ms. Zavala said.Some organizers said their work to prepare immigrants in their communities started even before Florence made landfall, because they had learned from previous disasters that some families may not come forward to ask for help.Pastor Daniel Soto of the Iglesia De Dios Puente De Salvaci\u00f3n, a predominantly Hispanic church with hundreds of members along the Grand Strand of South Carolina, contacted state officials to make sure that all relevant state emergency management documents were translated into Spanish and distributed them in print and on social media.Undocumented immigrants were fearful of arrest not only during evacuation, but also when encountering checkpoints upon returning home, Mr. Soto said. After Hurricane Matthew in 2016, he said, \u201cthey waited, sometimes two, three weeks before coming back home.\u201dThis time around, he said, state authorities had announced that they would not be checking driver\u2019s licenses or requiring proof of residency from people, even after Governor McMaster lifted the state of emergency.Mr. Soto told volunteers that they could reassure people who were nervous about going home. \u201cWe said, \u2018O.K., the governor has lifted the mandatory evacuation, here\u2019s the guidance. Bring in resources, bring in food, fuel up, drive safe and come back home.\u2019\u201dChristopher Dixon contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Sunny Side of the Senate", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJust take away Brett Kavanaugh and it was a great week.Opinion Columnist\u201cThis is all a gentlemen and women\u2019s agreement,\u201d said the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Approve Brett Kavanaugh Day.\u201cHuh?\u201d said the world, recalling that all 11 Republican senators are men.You may have guessed that our topic for today is The Power of Positive Thinking.Stop throwing fruit at me. Although hey \u2014 that apple looks very tasty. See? Something good can come out of something very bad.The Kavanaugh nomination\u2019s trip through the Judiciary Committee was stupendously depressing. But the chaotic finale seemed like a relief. Republican Jeff Flake, the swing vote, announced he was going to demand an F.B.I. investigation into charges that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford before he\u2019d back the nomination on the Senate floor. And if Blasey\u2019s supporters weren\u2019t super-thrilled, they at least had to feel that attention was being paid.Flake currently appears to be the swing vote on everything. Perhaps you\u2019d rather not have the entire future of the Supreme Court hinging on the feelings of one lame-duck Republican from Arizona. Makes sense. On the other hand, it\u2019s way better than Lindsey Graham.Pop Quiz: What was the weirdest moment during Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s trip through the Judiciary Committee?A) Graham\u2019s announcement that \u201cI know I\u2019m a single white male from South Carolina and I\u2019m told I should shut up, but I will not shut up.\u201dB) Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah\u2019s description of Blasey as \u201can attractive, good witness \u2026 in other words, she\u2019s pleasing.\u201dC) Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony that \u201cboofed\u201d meant \u201cflatulence.\u201dWe certainly have learned a lot about Kavanaugh over the last few weeks. From his affection for beer to the fact that he\u2019s the kind of guy who says \u201cshe and I did not travel in the same social circles.\u201d And did he mention that he was No. 1 in his class? And captain of the basketball team?Kavanaugh\u2019s opening rant unnerved even some of the Republicans. That was when he blamed attempts to destroy \u201cmy family and my good name\u201d on enemies seeking \u201crevenge on behalf of the Clintons\u201d and \u201coutside left-wing opposition groups.\u201dScary to imagine him sitting on a campaign finance case.On the plus side, Kavanaugh\u2019s performance was hardly the worst thing America\u2019s ever seen in the legislative process. There was the time a congressmen beat a senator to a bloody pulp with his cane. That was, however, in 1856.Some Republicans predicted that if Kavanaugh lost, every man in America would be afraid to accept an important judicial post. Because, of course, you could never tell when some unknown woman would leap out of nowhere and accuse you of sexual assault. \u201cIt is the end of good people wanting to be judges,\u201d Graham warned Friday.That\u2019s easily tested. Withdraw the Kavanaugh nomination and see how many male judges tell you they don\u2019t want to be considered for the Supreme Court. Or try picking a woman.On the other hand, one of the lasting effects of the Kavanaugh drama might be to encourage ambitious young men to be more cautious about the way they behave when they\u2019re at drinking parties. See? More good news.The Kavanaugh hearing was one tough slog, given the way the whole thing devolved into a wildly partisan yelling match. By the end of the week you got the impression that many of the senators had frightened even themselves.On Friday, Graham held out the Republicans\u2019 current favorite bipartisan olive branch, which involves saying something nice about Joe Biden. (\u201cHe\u2019s a decent guy. If he runs for president he\u2019ll be hard to beat.\u201d)But through it all, the great story was Blasey, whose appearance before the senators is going to change the way America looks at victims of sexual assault forever. For all the Republicans\u2019 desire to undermine her testimony, nobody dared to withhold respect.\u201cI thought her testimony was very compelling,\u201d President Trump told reporters, in what was for him a moment of extreme discretion and self-control. Of course, the president said he thought Kavanaugh was compelling, too.A lot of Republicans carefully said that everybody was right. Chairman Chuck Grassley managed to announce he found both witnesses \u201ccredible.\u201dWhich, of course, was impossible. Kavanaugh may wind up getting the Supreme Court seat, but Blasey was the one who triumphed. \u201cYou should be proud of your mom,\u201d Connecticut\u2019s Richard Blumenthal said to Blasey\u2019s sons. \u201cShe is a profile in courage and her name will be in the history books long after ours are gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Lehman Failed for Good Reasons", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToo many banks still lack the checks and balances that might have saved Lehman Brothers.Ms. Antoncic was the chief risk officer of Lehman Brothers from 2002 until 2007.At its peak, AIG had a market cap of about $240 billion (over four times that of Lehman at its peak), it had $1 trillion in assets, wrote insurance in 80 countries, and it had written protection on hundreds of billions of dollars of various forms of debt \u2014 much of which was helping American and European banks increase the asset quality of their balance sheets. Saving AIG avoided a global macroeconomic catastrophe.As it is, many lives were destroyed. What bothers me most is that the carnage created by developed economies reached people in every corner of the world.To be sure, some things could have been done better, and many decisions could have been made faster. So what have we learned? Are we more financially secure, or are we still vulnerable?There have been major reforms. There is more transparency and tighter controls. Banks, and in particular large international banks, have more capital and better quality capital. Liquidity and funding ratios have been introduced to address asset and liability mismatch. Regulators no longer rely only on banks\u2019 internal models to assess risks, but instead have introduced leverage ratios based on asset size to limit the size of a bank\u2019s balance sheet relative to its equity. New rules on derivatives have been introduced. And there has been an introduction of \u201cliving wills,\u201d in which banks must tell regulators how they would be unwound in the event of a failure.But these regulatory fixes, while necessary, are not a complete solution.The unintended consequences of some of these regulations is that risk has shifted away from banks to less transparent, unregulated entities. For example, the increase in capital requirements have helped feed the so-called shadow banking system. Because new rules limit banks from making leveraged loans, hedge funds and private equity firms have taken up this slack and provide direct financing. This is hardly the outcome intended by the regulators. This peer-to-peer lending is not regulated in the same way as banks are, and moving this lending to shadow banks reduces transparency to regulators.Also, the 2008 crisis was the consequence not of too little regulation, but of inconsistent and inconsistently enforced regulation. Entities doing similar trades were applying different rules and were supervised by different regulators depending on their location, and how they were incorporated or chartered. Without functional regulation, this problem persists.Third, no living will can solve the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem for a highly complex global financial institution. We still do not know how to address the failure of a large international financial firm with hundreds of legal entities across the globe. To do so would require harmonizing the bankruptcy legislation of all the world\u2019s major financial centers, something the European Union has not been able to achieve in 50 years. This is probably the most important lesson from the crisis and the most difficult to address.To me, the biggest risk of all has not been adequately addressed. What I learned from the Lehman experience is the importance of governance. Leadership is about doing the right thing, and no one should go unchallenged when they are about to make a questionable decision. This culture of checks and balances is still lacking in many organizations.While I do not think we will have a large credit-induced financial crisis in the near term, there is always the possibility that, in the next big financial crisis, taxpayers again will be forced to pay the bill \u2014 if not directly, through a bailout, then most certainly indirectly, through lost jobs and an economic downturn.The best one can hope for is to minimize the severity of the shock through better corporate governance and more consistent regulation.Madelyn Antoncic, an economist, is on the board of overseers of Weill Cornell Medicine. A former vice president and treasurer of the World Bank, she was the chief risk officer of Lehman Brothers from 2002 to 2007.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Thumps Don\u2019t Cause Stock Slumps", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street is learning to live with President Trump\u2019s criticism of prominent companies.Mr. Trump has made a habit of attacking well-known public corporations, including Amazon, Harley-Davidson and Google. In some cases, his supporters have piled on with threats to boycott the companies\u2019 products or services. The stocks of those firms have come under pressure as investors worry that business will suffer.But a look back at months of critical presidential tweets, and their effect on stock prices, suggests that investors are shrugging off Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides. The stocks of targeted companies typically recover, and there is little, if any, discernible harm done to their business.Nike is the latest firm Mr. Trump has singled out. The sportswear company confirmed this week that it had entered into a new marketing deal with Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback. Mr. Kaepernick made headlines in 2016 for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, and has not played in the N.F.L. since the end of that season.Nike may yet suffer. The same people boycotting the N.F.L. because of player protests during the national anthem may shun its products. Companies selling a narrow range of items to consumers are most at risk to a buyers\u2019 strike. But Nike may also benefit. Mr. Trump\u2019s castigations, and Nike\u2019s support of Mr. Kaepernick, may generate higher sales.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms can at times seem to affect the shares of the companies he targets.Even so, the company\u2019s shares have recently rallied and now trade at more or less the same price they did just before the announcement of its production shift.This suggests that investors may have adopted a simple rule: Keep an eye on what the government does, not what the president says.And even if the Trump administration were to threaten more actions against companies, it may not succeed in doing much harm to the firms, or it may simply fail to follow through.Investors may hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets amount to little more than noise, and that the rule of law and other constraints will prevent him from taking actions that could harm corporate profits.Any tweets from the president on this battle could move markets.Advertisement"}

It also detects and alerts rescue personnel to dangerous falls, a leading cause of injury, especially for older people.One detail was particularly compelling. Apple received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its device, meaning that when you take your watch\u2019s data to your doctor, there will be some basis for accepting its pronouncements.By themselves, these features won\u2019t change the world. But they may play a significant role in some people\u2019s lives, even saving some from an early death.It is significant that Apple is consulting with regulators as it does so. The prevailing ethos across much of the industry is to charge forward with new tech \u2014 to beg forgiveness from the world when things go wrong, instead of asking permission first. How refreshing it is, then, that Apple went through proper channels here. When it comes to health, moving fast and breaking things isn\u2019t an option.There was some other news in tech this week:And that\u2019s it, folks! See you next week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ayanna Pressley and the Might of the Black Political Left", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMajor electoral wins, and the reach of Black Lives Matter, show the rise of black progressives.Dr. Price is a political scientist who specializes in contemporary black politics, public opinion and political rhetoric. The most significant political shift in decades is happening, but it\u2019s not Trumpism or white nationalism or corruption or even on the right. It\u2019s in black politics. And for good reason: Mr. Gillum\u2019s platform calls for single-payer health care, abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as reforming the cash bail system and removing barriers to community re-entry after prison.Unapologetically left in his orientation, Mr. Gillum has rejected the idea that he needs centrist Democratics to win. His sights are set on young people and progressive voters. Stacey Abrams of Georgia, whose strategy is similar, has a good chance to become the state\u2019s first black female governor. Ben Jealous, the former head of the N.A.A.C.P., is vying to become Maryland\u2019s first black governor, winning the state\u2019s Democratic nomination by running to the left of his opponent. Beyond historic firsts, this new class of candidates is pushing the Democratic Party farther left. They also represent the new political power of black progressives who defy stereotypes of black politicians as wedded to respectability politics and unwilling to take on issues of people who live on the margins of the black community. It\u2019s clear that the era of centrist black politicians is on the wane. The time of black progressives is in ascent. To some extent, centrist black politicians have been the victims of their greatest success and what some perceive as their greatest failure: the election of President Barack Obama. That represented the height of black electoral power. A successful Obama presidency became the entire black political agenda. Before Mr. Obama, it was common for black activists and civil rights organizations to appeal to presidents when they were trying to win concessions from the federal government. But this strategy didn\u2019t work with a black president. African-Americans had more access to the White House than ever before, yet they couldn\u2019t use that access to wrangle specific policy reforms from the first black president without tarnishing the historical achievement of his election. Remember when Representative Maxine Waters of California critiqued Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks to the Congressional Black Caucus in 2011 because he told the audience to \u201cstop complaining\u201d about their problems? That was not as welcome as when she told Trump officials this summer she was \u201creclaiming her time.\u201d During the Obama presidency, traditional civil rights organizations like the N.A.A.C.P. and the National Urban League worked closely with the administration. This created a power vacuum in the black left. Which activists would drive black politics outside of the national spotlight? Young black activists filled the void, many of whom were already trained as local organizers. The political focus of the Black Lives Matter movement is much farther to the left than traditional black civil rights organizations. The movement supports reparations in the form of fully funded education, an end to money bail and the demilitarization of the police. Since turning to electoral politics, its constituent groups have said that the candidates they endorse must also represent similar progressive views.To be sure, there has always been a black progressive community whose politics skewed farther left than the Democratic Party\u2019s or civil rights organizations\u2019. Black progressives have long critiqued problematic policies of black elected officials and any solutions that left vulnerable members of the black community further marginalized. In the places where this movement has been most effective, young leaders are crucial. But there is an intergenerational nature to the work and the composition of activists. These young people have allowed for a more inclusive black politics. In fact, liberal leaders have emerged across a range of black institutions, not just formal politics. People like the Missouri pastor Traci Blackmon, the feminist scholar Brittney Cooper and the athlete Colin Kaepernick demand that businesses, organizations and candidates who want their endorsements represent their priorities. This change is as much a generational replacement as it is a widespread ideological shift. These candidates are comparatively young. Mr. Gillum is 39. Ms. Abrams and Mr. Jealous are in their mid-40s. While age, particularly youth, plays a part, there are others reasons black progressivism is attracting more candidates and voters. The black electorate is outraged at the perceived impotence of black politicians to ensure basic justice for black people who are killed by the police. The failures to convict or even indict the killers made clear targets out of prosecuting attorneys and other elected officials. But it has also inspired new candidates for public office. Last month, the gun control activist Lucy McBath won the Democratic nomination for a congressional seat in Georgia after the killing of her son, Jordan Davis, received national attention in 2012. The old political orthodoxy that has allowed black centrist Democrats to dominate black politics is being dethroned. Black progressives are on the rise.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe\u2019s Triumphs and Troubles Are Written in Swiss Ice", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPollen frozen in ice in the Alps traces Europe\u2019s calamities, since the time Macbeth ruled Scotland. While tens of millions of people were dying, pollen from the plants, trees and crops growing in Western Europe were being swept up by the winds and carried toward the Alps. Centuries later, the crop pollens trapped in the ice reveal the collapse of agriculture associated with the pandemic, as bad weather led to poor harvests and fields lay fallow because there was no one left to work them. For more than 50 years, scientists have drilled ice cores in the Arctic and Antarctica to reconstruct uninterrupted records of climate change over hundreds of thousands of years. But these glaciers can be difficult to get to and they are far from where most people on Earth live. Pollen levels rise and fall during the century, but their most pronounced peaks and valleys coincide with notable events. Europe suffered through a spate of calamities during the 14th century. Before the Black Death, there was the Great European Famine. Historical accounts tell of the relentless rains that spoiled back-to-back harvests in parts of Europe from 1315 through 1317, and may have helped bolster the plague\u2019s grip. Few people have conducted detailed studies of pollen in ice cores before, said Raymond Bradley, a geoscientist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and an expert in using lake-bed sediment cores to reconstruct past climates. \u201cMost ice cores are polar and they are a long way from major vegetation regimes. Those studies that were done were pretty boring, they didn\u2019t show much,\u201d he said. In the fall of 2015, a six-person crew flew by helicopter from Zermatt, Switzerland, to the saddle of the Colle Gnifetti glacier. They carried with them a ton of equipment, including tents, cookstoves, food and a solar-powered drill. Back in the lab, Dr. Schwikowski and her colleagues dated the different sections of the ice core using water, lead and carbon isotopes, and by identifying \u201cdating horizons\u201d such as well-known volcanic eruptions, Saharan dust transport and nuclear weapons tests. Once the timeline was in place, Ms. Br\u00fcgger began tracking pollen, spores and soot in the samples using a light microscope. In all, she counted more than 40,000 pollen grains in the ice core. Grass pollens were abundant in the segments that corresponded to the years 1100 to 1200. During the Medieval Warm Period, temperatures in Europe and the nearby North Atlantic were as warm or warmer than they are now, and crops and forests flourished. The spike in grass pollens corresponded to the expansion of open landscapes, a transition from forests to pastures. She also found the highest levels of a spore from a fungus called Sporormiella that grows only on dung. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that it\u2019s not only an open landscape, but that we also have a lot of cattle,\u201d she said. The record becomes more complex in 1750, which marks the expansion of the European economy and the start of the Industrial Revolution. Historical records tell us that Columbus introduced maize to Europe in 1493, but maize pollen doesn\u2019t show up in the ice core until the mid-1700s, a sign that its large-scale regional production didn\u2019t take off immediately. It was also around this time that European society started to become more industrial and urban. This is mirrored in the ice core with the first traces of small spherical carbon particles, evidence of a transition from wood to coal burning in Central Europe. Although poets, landowners, chroniclers and others noted these historical events, manual record-taking can be imperfect and limited in geography, and they don\u2019t quantify their scale over the whole region. Coupling ice-core data with historical records can yield new insights, said Alexander More, historian and climate scientist at Harvard University and the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine in Orono. \u201cThe combination provides a level of insight that is just not matched by either type on their own,\u201d he said. Many scientists, including Dr. Schwikowski, are concerned about the fate of these glaciers under climate change. Some glaciers are beginning to melt as temperatures rise. Meltwater from the upper layers of the glacier trickle through the airspaces between the snow granules, smearing the chemical signals and making the core unusable. Colle Gnifetti has, thus far, been spared, because of its high altitude. \u201cIt is becoming more and more difficult to find a glacier that is not melting and that can still be used for research,\u201d said Dr. Schwikowski. \u201cThe object for our research is melting away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But this is what it is to be a woman: You smile politely through thousands of life\u2019s indignities in a body that sometimes feels as though it isn\u2019t your own.Christine Blasey Ford, who recounted the worst moment of her life before the entire country on Thursday \u2014 reluctantly but with incredible poise \u2014 knows this. Her account of running into Mark Judge, an alleged witness and accomplice in her assault, at a grocery store shortly after the attack, hit home for me and many women.A female friend texted me on Thursday, saying Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimony about that encounter had sent tears streaming down her cheeks. \u201cThat feeling, too many of us know it, and the muscle memory of it is so deep that it is something that can never be forgotten,\u201d she wrote.For so many of us, this week has been a collective mourning, a deluge of grief and trauma. We watched Dr. Blasey, and we remembered.We sat beside Dr. Blasey in that Senate committee room, staring out at a sea of white-haired men.We felt the eyes of millions of Americans pore over us, searching to see if what we were saying was the truth.We watched a federal judge seethe at being accused, his body seeming to grow larger with rage as though he might be able to reach through the television screen and grab us.It has been over a decade since I was raped, and the boy who did it is now a man.

I dated him afterward. Part of the encounter was consensual. We had both been drinking, him far more than me. I thought maybe he didn\u2019t know what he was doing, and later didn\u2019t remember (an idea the men in my life whom I\u2019ve told, and whom I love and trust, have dismissed).

When we say them aloud, we release the shame that never should have been ours to begin with. I didn\u2019t want to hold onto this story anymore. I wanted to tell it and be free.And I don\u2019t want this to be a problem for only women anymore, one more thing for us to quietly endure, to not make a scene about. I want this to be America\u2019s problem. I want it to be Congress\u2019s problem.

A law professor on President Trump\u2019s contempt for the attorney general.Mr. Krotoszynski is a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law. TUSCALOOSA, Ala. \u2014 Among the many revelations in Bob Woodward\u2019s new book \u201cFear: Trump in the White House,\u201d it seems the president does not think much of Southern lawyers (in general) or graduates of the University of Alabama School of Law (in particular). He is mistaken on both counts.Mr. Woodward claims that President Trump has called Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, \u201ca dumb Southerner\u201d and an \u201cidiot,\u201d used an inappropriate epithet that targets people with developmental disabilities and parodied his Southern accent to aides. The president is said to have asked Rob Porter, his staff secretary at the time: \u201cHow in the world was I ever persuaded to pick him for my attorney general? He couldn\u2019t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama. What business does he have being attorney general?\u201dPolitico reports that President Trump wishes that Mr. Sessions had gone to a law school like Harvard or Yale, rather than Alabama, \u201cgriping to aides and lawmakers that the attorney general doesn\u2019t have the Ivy League pedigree the president prefers.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s contempt for non-Ivy-educated lawyers is all the more striking, given that he has surrounded himself with them. His own lawyer, Jay Sekulow, took his law degree from Mercer University, in Macon, Ga. Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer for many years and tasked with more than a few important lawyerly duties, is a graduate of the Western Michigan University Thomas M. Cooley Law School, in Lansing, while another personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, went to New York University for law school. The president\u2019s current White House counsel, Don McGahn, attended the Widener University Commonwealth Law School, in Harrisburg, Penn. Mr. Trump is not alone in holding a myopic, credentialist view when it comes to a person\u2019s legal acumen; it\u2019s no coincidence that every member of today\u2019s Supreme Court is a graduate of an Ivy League law school, with Ruth Bader Ginsburg the only one not to graduate from Harvard or Yale (she began at Harvard but transferred to Columbia). These are, of course, excellent law schools, and there is no denying that there are better and worse places to get a legal education. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that only the Ivies can provide a top-flight legal education, or, more to the point, that a person\u2019s abilities as a lawyer are entirely defined by the three years he or she spent in law school. Professional experience and judgment matter too.John Marshall Harlan, widely regarded as a \u201cjudge\u2019s judge,\u201d graduated from New York Law School. Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court justice, earned his law degree from Howard University. Earl Warren: Berkeley. John Paul Stevens: Northwestern. The list goes on, but the point is that just because our president \u2014 and the public generally \u2014 obsesses over credentials that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re right to do so.In fact, one could argue that while an Ivy League school provides a wonderful education in the law, it quite often sets a person on a narrowly defined career path. On the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the current Supreme Court, you find academic posts, high-level government positions, corporate law partnerships \u2014 but very little of the contact with everyday people that comes from, say, working as a trial lawyer (Sonia Sotomayor is an exception). The Ivies produce excellent trial lawyers, but generally speaking, it is schools like the University of Alabama that are producing the type of lawyers whose careers teach them to understand and practice the kind of law that impacts most Americans. What\u2019s more, there is something telling in Mr. Trump\u2019s sneering contempt for Southern lawyers in particular. It intersects with a general contempt for the South as an intellectually backward region and for the stereotype of the \u201ccountry lawyer\u201d as a backward, benighted legal mind. But the stereotype does contain a certain truth, in that many people who attend law school in the South and practice there experience the law in ways different from, say, lawyers in New York or Boston. Of course, the South produces its share of corporate lawyers. But the region\u2019s history of racial discrimination and entrenched poverty requires legal practitioners who can balance a deft understanding of the law with a deep appreciation for the way everyday people interact with it. Shouldn\u2019t we want people like that running our legal system as well?Whether or not Jeff Sessions is an excellent attorney general is a question about which reasonable minds can and will differ. But it has nothing to do with his legal education at the University of Alabama School of Law. Our president, who claims to be a man of the people, should know better.Ronald J. Krotoszynski Jr. is a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law.A previous version of this article misstated the law school attended by Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel.

Mr. Foa\u2019s appointment signals an opening gambit by Italy\u2019s populists to take their anti-establishment message, and ambition to reshape public perception, from social media to the televised media mainstream, where the vast majority of Italy still gets its information.On the eve of his appointment, Mr. Foa, 55 and affable, offered a glimpse of his new office with eight television screens in the wall, and shared passages of his book exploring the ways that politicians and spin doctors manipulate the truth and spread misinformation.Instead, he said, he would work to reverse what he claimed was a de facto veto at RAI of euro-skeptic politicians and government ministers, and to introduce voices to make the broadcaster \u201cmirror\u201d the current political reality.Italy\u2019s media have long warped standard journalistic practices like a fun-house mirror.The brother of Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate and former prime minister, nominally owned il Giornale, where Mr. Foa spent decades working as a reporter and editor.For years, Mr. Berlusconi flooded his private newspaper and channels and public airways with pro-Berlusconi propaganda, and it was Mr. Berlusconi who greenlighted Mr. Foa\u2019s nomination, in exchange for political concessions.All of that fueled polarization and national frustration over the media, which Italy\u2019s new populist leaders, Mr. Salvini and Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement, clobbered as they rose to power.The result is a largely impotent press that has failed to hold accountable populist leaders who reach enormous audiences directly with their social media accounts.Mr. Foa said this was only natural, because by suppressing alternative voices on the state broadcaster, \u201cYou push the success of Di Maio and Salvini\u2019s Facebook pages.\u201dAll the same, he said, attacking the news media was \u201cpart of the game\u201d and so it was wrong to blame the politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault, for me,\u201d he said.The Five Star Movement\u2019s hostility to the news media traces back to its co-founders \u2014 the comedian Beppe Grillo and the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, an internet entrepreneur.Mr. Grillo often featured his disdain for reporters on his wildly popular blog, calling them \u201cthe walking dead,\u201d among other things. Mr. Casaleggio was an admirer of Mr. Foa\u2019s right-wing blog and a futurist who envisioned a democratization of politics and media on the web.In July, the government\u2019s top spokesman, Rocco Casalino, an alumnus of the reality television show \u201cBig Brother\u201d and a Five Star power broker, made a thinly veiled threat to pull state funding from a newspaper, Il Foglio, which has been critical of the government.\u201cNow that Il Foglio will close, what will you do?\u201d Mr. Casalino said to a reporter from the paper. \u201cCan you tell me what purpose Il Foglio has? Why does is exist?\u201dThe outburst prompted the Order of Journalists in Lombardy, to which Mr. Casalino belongs, to open an investigation into whether he had violated professional guidelines. In turn, the Five Star Movement\u2019s blog advocated the abolishment of the organization.Instead, in the current government it is Mr. Salvini, a former radio disc jockey, who has begun the charm offensive, wrapping his extreme language in an earthy, endearing delivery.He has dominated Italian politics by dominating news cycles in Trumpian style \u2014 offering up some nugget, often over Twitter, that is outrageous and offensive to his haters, red meat to his supporters and simply irresistible to the Italian media. He has 3.2 million followers on Facebook and 880,400 on Twitter.Mr. Foa first met Mr. Bannon, the former executive chairman of the right-wing Breitbart News, at the Lugano house of the Swiss financier Tito Tettamanti. He said he later helped arrange a meeting between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Salvini.The mainstream press had a habit of \u201cportraying all these events in such a mysterious way,\u201d Mr. Foa said.Before the election, Mr. Morisi acknowledged that the official website \u201cWe\u2019re With Salvini\u201d shared the same Google codes as sites supportive of the Five Star Movement, as well as \u201cI\u2019m With Putin\u201d and other conspiracy sites.\u201cBut we have nothing to do with the pro-Putin or pro-Five Star sites,\u201d Mr. Morisi said at the time.Since becoming Italy\u2019s interior minister and vice premier, Mr. Salvini\u2019s constant social media posts, television appearances and campaign-style travel have raised the question of when he actually works. But that is perhaps an outdated conception of work in an age when the media message is the m\u00e9tier.Mr. Foa has had his own adventures on Twitter.A few days before the 2016 United States presidential election, he shared an Italian blog post claiming Mrs. Clinton had attended a \u201csatanic\u201d dinner with John Podesta.He said that the report seemed plausible to him because he recalled reading in some \u201cvery serious press\u201d about \u201cpedophilic\u201d art in the collection of Mr. Podesta. (John\u2019s brother, Tony Podesta, collects contemporary works.)\u201cI didn\u2019t go deep on this,\u201d he said in the interview this week in his defense, acknowledging that he \u201cmight be wrong,\u201d and that he sometimes succumbed to the temptation to publish the sensational to boost his audience on social media.\u201cIt\u2019s happened to me a couple of times,\u201d he said.In 2017, he falsely claimed the United States military was preparing to mobilize 150,000 reservists, possibly for a war against Syria or North Korea or Russia. He said a friend in American national security circles told him Mr. Trump had called up reservists and that he checked with an expert he knew in Italy who said it was true.\u201cSo I had two sources and I wrote just five lines on my blog, ten lines. And that\u2019s all,\u201d he said.Still, he thinks reporters could be more cautious, when, for instance, reporting that Russia was behind the March poisoning of a former Soviet Spy, Sergei V. Skripal.\u201cIt\u2019s too obvious for me,\u201d Mr. Foa said of the evidence in the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of saying, \u2018Oh, you see, Putin is the bad guy doing the bad thing.\u2019\u201dHis prime concern now, though, he said, is restoring the credibility of RAI, which he said had been destroyed by an establishment, anti-populist bias. Without that trust, he said, political parties, internet trolls and regular citizens would continue to use social media to misinform the public and erode democracy.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very dangerous territory,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the web team of Luca Morisi. The team has been compared to Casaleggio Associates, a company closely linked with the League\u2019s coalition partner, the Five Star Movement, but there is no evidence that alumni of Casaleggio Associates work in Mr. Morisi\u2019s team.Emma Johanningsmeier contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Not Deranged. Determined! ", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the midterm elections, the resistance will finally have a chance to push back against Trump. Opinion ColumnistThey told us that we suffered from Trump Derangement Syndrome, an emotional and illogical obsession with opposing and unseating Donald Trump.They saw our principled stand against corruption and criminality, against immorality and hatred, as born of hyper-partisanship and the bruises of defeat.They were unable to see that our objection to Trump was an achingly particular phenomenon that transcended party tribalism and went to the core of who we are as a people and a country.For us, it was clear: This man was wholly unacceptable, as a matter of character. And true patriotism demanded that we say so, without equivocation, and unrelentingly.Trump had become the president by a complex web of occurrences: white racial anxiety, reaction to the first black president, unease about the possibility of the first female president, voter suppression and voter apathy, and an attack on our elections by the Russians.This presidency has been haunted by the specter of illegitimacy from its inception.And yet, the markets didn\u2019t crash. The economy kept humming. We entered no new major foreign conflicts, although we have cozied up to people who should be enemies and spat in the faces of people who used to be friends.The Trump presidency was not the cataclysm that many had feared, but the possibility of damage hovers over us. What would he do if Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia probe inched too close to him, his family or his fortune? What would happen if one of his children were indicted? (Donald Trump Jr., I\u2019m looking at you.) What if Mueller produced a damning report? What if Congress used that report to begin impeachment proceedings?We know that Trump is volatile, uncontrollable and unpredictable. So, we live a life with nerves frayed and bodies pushed to the edge of our seats. We know that he remains defiant because there are people who support him without hesitation and without question. They are the deranged, not us.This constant state of chaos and anxiety has been exhausting and nearly unbearable, but it is all coming to a head in November when the defiant, the resisters, the never-Trumpers, will get to have their voices heard in a way that reaches beyond protests and rallies.It will be the rest of America\u2019s first chance at the polls to show just how unacceptable and repulsive we view Trump and his Republican enablers in Congress. It will be the first time for people to shift power away from him and his cronies and toward people willing to hold him accountable.\u201cMinnesota, you crushed it last night! With 100% Reporting: 902,119 people voted in the primary; the highest number of primary voters since 1982. Overall turnout was approximately 22.7%; the highest turnout percentage in a primary since 1994. Amazing!\u201dMost of that energy is coming from people opposed to Trump and his corrupt administration, thereby benefiting Democrats.This is the worst possible scenario for the president and his party less than two months from Election Day.\u201cThe president\u2019s party almost always suffers a net loss of U.S. House seats in midterm elections. However, losses tend to be much steeper when the president is unpopular. In Gallup\u2019s polling history, presidents with job approval ratings below 50 percent have seen their party lose 37 House seats, on average, in midterm elections. That compares with an average loss of 14 seats when presidents had approval ratings above 50 percent.\u201dTrump\u2019s approval rating is at 40 percent, and unlike his predecessors, he is not a normal president. He is a divisive lightning rod.Democrats are not only likely to win control of the House of Representatives; they also have a long-shot chance of taking control of the Senate, although the map is working against them.Resistance up to this point has largely been a statement of principle, but when we vote in November it will be an expression of power.

{"Headline": "The Real Lesson of Sept. 11", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI went to war to avenge my brother\u2019s death. But the only person I truly wanted to kill died 17 years ago.Mr. Quinn is a United States Army veteran.It has taken me a while to realize something.My 23-year-old brother, James, was on the 102nd floor.Staring at that picture of Atta, I would have visions of what my brother\u2019s final moments were like. I would envision my asthmatic brother slowly succumbing to smoke inhalation on the flat, gray corporate rug of his Cantor Fitzgerald office \u2014 trapped, climbing upward and afraid for the entire 102 minutes before the tower\u2019s collapse. Glaring at Atta\u2019s photo, I\u2019d imagine my brother\u2019s body buckling, falling, crumpling, burning, melting, and in that moment of imagination, my entire being wanted revenge against the people who did this.So I joined the Army.I joined the war. I deployed twice to Iraq and once to Afghanistan.I learned many things but realized just one.I learned that deploying for the second time was easier than the first, but each time it\u2019s harder to fully come home.I learned that I love soldiers. Nothing builds bonds more than living with a group of people in a war zone, getting shot at, not showering for months, roasting our own excrement in burn pits, cracking inappropriate jokes and serving something greater than ourselves.I also learned how that love turns to heartache when one of those soldiers gets killed, and you pack his gear up in duffel bags to be shipped home to his wife and unborn child. I learned that another family\u2019s losing a brother doesn\u2019t bring my brother back.But that wasn\u2019t the thing I realized.In Afghanistan, after an Afghan police officer demanded money from me at gunpoint to get through a checkpoint, I learned of the Kabul government\u2019s widespread corruption. I learned that spending $68 billion on Afghan forces doesn\u2019t buy the essential ingredients of a fighting force: loyalty, courage and integrity. I learned that most generals would always ask for more money, more troops, more time \u2014 and more war. It\u2019s like asking Tom Brady what he wants to do on Sunday.I learned that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. For the past 17 years in Afghanistan, we\u2019ve tried everything: a light footprint, a big footprint, conventional war, counterinsurgency, counter-corruption, surges, drawdowns.But that wasn\u2019t the thing I realized.I also learned that those who made the ultimate sacrifice are the very best of America.I learned to try to live a life worthy of their sacrifice, but perhaps this is a false platitude. We\u2019ll say, \u201cUntil Valhalla,\u201d after hearing the news of another brother killed, but perhaps preventing more brothers from dying is just as worthy of their sacrifice.I also learned to be a father. As I hold my son Graham James in my arms tonight, I feel selfish because there are thousands of fathers who never came home to hold their children. I feel selfish because there was a father who came home from war 17 years ago to hold his child in his arms and now that child is going off to fight in the same war.A hard lesson, but it\u2019s still not the thing I realized.But that, ultimately, was not the thing I realized.I learned that every part of me wanted to just stay quiet with my feelings about the war because I was afraid of what people might say. It\u2019s easier to bask in the warm embrace of \u201cThank you for your service\u201d without questioning what that service was for. One way or another, we were all affected by Sept. 11, which has caused us to view the war through a distorted lens. This is why most of us won\u2019t comment or share or at least have a dialogue about the war.But the main reason I wanted to stay quiet is because it has embarrassingly taken me 17 years to realize something, and what I realized was this: Seventeen years ago, staring at that picture of Mohammad Atta, I wanted revenge against the people who killed my brother. But what I finally realized was that the people who killed my brother died the same day he did.I refuse to take Atta\u2019s orders, or Bin Laden\u2019s. I will not \u201cstay quiet.\u201d End the war.Joe Quinn is a United States Army veteran. Advertisement"}

The store has been a significant source of revenue for the company, selling vitamins and nutritional supplements, as well as Infowars-branded apparel. PayPal has also handled donations that Infowars receives from its supporters.PayPal said it had made its decision not because of any policy violation but because Infowars\u2019 \u201cpromotion of hate and discrimination runs counter to our core value of inclusion.\u201d\u201cOur values are the foundation for the decision we made this week,\u201d PayPal added.The aggressive steps against Infowars have become fodder for claims that Silicon Valley companies are biased against conservative voices \u2014 an opinion expressed by President Trump and a number of Republican officials. Jeff Sessions, the United States attorney general, plans to meet with Republican state attorneys general next week to discuss the tech industry, competition and free speech.After the phaseout period of 10 business days, PayPal will stop doing any business with Infowars and its subsidiaries, like the site Prison Planet, a PayPal spokesman said.The spokesman declined to cite any specific problems that had led to the decision, but said that after \u201cextensive reviews\u201d the company had \u201cfound many instances of content that promoted hate and discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions.\u201dThis is not the first time that PayPal has waded into politically fraught territory. In 2010, the company cut off payments to WikiLeaks. More recently, PayPal stopped working with neo-Nazi and alt-right websites.Since being barred from Facebook and Twitter, Infowars has had to find new online platforms, and its audience has fallen off significantly. But PayPal\u2019s decision may be particularly damaging, because it will be much harder for Infowars to find another company to handle transactions for the site.For now, Infowars is still able to sell at least some of its goods on Amazon and eBay, where its payments are not handled by PayPal.An article on the Infowars site that announced PayPal\u2019s decision said the move was a \u201cpolitical ploy designed to financially sabotage an influential media outlet just weeks before the midterm elections.\u201dThe article said PayPal had told Infowars that the decision was made because Infowars had violated its \u201cacceptable use policy.\u201d PayPal\u2019s spokesman said its decision went beyond the violation of any single policy.Infowars did not respond to an email requesting comment.videoAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama vs. Trump? Trump vs. Trump? ", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conversationFraming the midterms as Election Day draws closer. Mr. Bruni and Mr. Douthat are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.There\u2019s so much potentially to chew over this week, including the confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, which we\u2019ll get to shortly, and it also makes sense that you and I, who both have written a lot over time about the Catholic Church, touch briefly on its moment of crisis.In 2016, Hillary Clinton was far too formidable and divisive a figure for that election to be a referendum on Obama. It was a referendum on her. So maybe 2018 more strongly reflects his standing and his determination \u2014 and voters\u2019 \u2014 to preserve his legacy. But there are enough lines he hasn\u2019t crossed since then (even if he\u2019s rubbed them out or kicked sand across them) to make me think that there must be some self-control lurking beneath the carapace, some ability to pull on the reins before the horse goes completely off the cliff. Even in the 2016 race, where time and again (the Judge Curiel business, the Alicia Machado business \u2014 even the \u201cTed Cruz\u2019s dad killed J.F.K.\u201d business around the time he clinched the nomination) he seemed unable to restrain himself from total folly, he did manage to avoid terrible blowups in those last two weeks before the election. And without that restraint he probably wouldn\u2019t be president. A little more seriously, I don\u2019t think the hearings matter for Democratic turnout because the courts never seem to matter for Democratic turnout. Antonin Scalia\u2019s death loomed large among Trump\u2019s reluctant Republican supporters and Trump made it clear he knew it; Merrick Garland\u2019s pocket-vetoed nomination was about 17 talking points deep in Hillary Clinton\u2019s list of reasons to vote Democratic. And likewise today: Sure, there\u2019s part of the Resistance that\u2019s ready to link Kavanaugh to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and show up in red dresses to protest him, but in general Democratic enthusiasm centers on Trump and his awfulness, not a conservative court and its potential works. The real problem for Catholics now is twofold. First, the bishops who presided over that horror are in many cases still in power, and so even decades-old revelations implicate our current leaders, in America and Rome. And second, the question of why exactly the scandal happened in the first place and how we should think about it is tangled up in a larger liberal-conservative conflict \u2014 over celibacy, marriage, homosexuality and more \u2014 that Pope Francis has only heightened. But that\u2019s probably a rabbit hole for another time.I\u2019m not talking about all or most priests, but I am talking about a troubling fraction of them, and the dangers of the celibate culture haven\u2019t disappeared with church reform. But that\u2019s enough about that for this time, Ross. We\u2019ll meet again in two weeks?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Executions With an Extra Dose of Cruelty", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "OpinionInmates on Tennessee\u2019s death row favor a firing squad over a torturous, deadly injection. Supported byContributing Opinion WriterIn August, four death row inmates filed a federal lawsuit in which they made an extraordinary argument: The state\u2019s new lethal-injection protocol is so inhumane that execution by firing squad would be preferable. They even pointed out the practicality of this plan, noting that \u201cthe Big Buck Shooting Range is located on the grounds of Riverbend Maximum (Security) Institution and can easily accommodate the equipment required for an execution.\u201dAfter Mr. Irick\u2019s death, Dr. David Lubarsky, an expert consulted by lawyers challenging the state\u2019s lethal-injection protocol, issued a statement: \u201cI conclude to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Mr. Irick was aware and sensate during his execution and would have experienced the feeling of choking, drowning in his own fluids, suffocating, being buried alive and the burning sensation caused by the injection of the potassium chloride.\u201dAt the core of the legal challenge is a drug called midazolam, a sedative. In minor medical procedures, like colonoscopies and heart catheterizations, it is used to induce sleep. To prevent the patient from feeling pain during invasive surgeries that require true anesthesia, a painkilling drug is administered after midazolam.Tennessee\u2019s lethal-injection protocol calls for the administration of midazolam followed not by a painkiller but by drugs that paralyze the body, including the lungs, and stop the heart. Because of the paralytic, the inmate\u2019s suffering might not be visible to onlookers without training in anesthesia, but it\u2019s nothing less than state-sanctioned torture. That\u2019s why Justice Sonia Sotomayor of the Supreme Court, writing in a powerful dissent to the court\u2019s refusal to stop Mr. Irick\u2019s execution, characterized the state\u2019s protocol as a descent into \u201cbarbarism.\u201dEarlier this year, 33 death row inmates in Tennessee challenged the protocol as a violation of the United States Constitution\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. After a judge ruled against them in July, lawyers for the inmates immediately appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The state executed Mr. Irick before the case could be heard. Two more inmates are scheduled to die this year \u2014 Edmund Zagorski on Oct. 11 and David Earl Miller on Dec. 6 \u2014 both by the lethal-injection method that relies on midazolam.Mr. Irick\u2019s crime \u2014 the rape and murder of a 7-year-old girl left in his care \u2014 was unimaginably hideous, a case tailor-made to challenge even the most ardent activist\u2019s desire to abolish the death penalty. Mr. Zagorski, by contrast, is on death row for something almost routine by maximum-security standards: a drug-related double murder. His 1984 conviction was complicated by the kinds of problems that so often spring up in death penalty cases: profound concerns about police interrogation methods, about the effectiveness of his legal representation and about his mental competence.There are egregious problems with the death penalty \u2014 its arbitrary application, its failure to deter crime, its outrageous cost to the state, its permanence in the face of a fallible judicial system. As it happens, Mr. Irick was white, as is Mr. Zagorski, but a nation committed to real justice would abolish the practice based solely on the overwhelming racial disparity between which inmates are allowed to live and which are given a death sentence.There are many pragmatic reasons for abolishing the death penalty. There are no pragmatic arguments for keeping it. Thirty-one states have the death penalty, and for one reason only: blood lust. We continue to execute our fellow human beings \u2014 methodically, barbarically, with determination \u2014 because of a primitive desire for revenge.On Wednesday, the Tennessee Supreme Court will hear opening arguments in the appeal of the chancery court decision permitting the state to proceed with executions that use midazolam. Though the introduction of new evidence is typically prohibited in appeals, inmates\u2019 lawyers hope to put details from the death of Billy Ray Irick into evidence in challenging the constitutionality of the lethal-injection protocol. Eight days later, unless Governor Haslam commutes his sentence to life without parole, or a state or federal court intervenes, Edmund Zagorski will be tortured to death by the State of Tennessee.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Anita Hill: How to Get the Kavanaugh Hearings Right", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Senate Judiciary Committee has a chance to do better by the country than it did nearly three decades ago.There is no way to redo 1991, but there are ways to do better.The facts underlying Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s claim of being sexually assaulted by a young Brett Kavanaugh will continue to be revealed as confirmation proceedings unfold. Yet it\u2019s impossible to miss the parallels between the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing of 2018 and the 1991 confirmation hearing for Justice Clarence Thomas. In 1991, the Senate Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to demonstrate its appreciation for both the seriousness of sexual harassment claims and the need for public confidence in the character of a nominee to the Supreme Court. It failed on both counts.As that same committee, on which sit some of the same members as nearly three decades ago, now moves forward with the Kavanaugh confirmation proceedings, the integrity of the court, the country\u2019s commitment to addressing sexual violence as a matter of public interest, and the lives of the two principal witnesses who will be testifying hang in the balance. Today, the public expects better from our government than we got in 1991, when our representatives performed in ways that gave employers permission to mishandle workplace harassment complaints throughout the following decades. That the Senate Judiciary Committee still lacks a protocol for vetting sexual harassment and assault claims that surface during a confirmation hearing suggests that the committee has learned little from the Thomas hearing, much less the more recent #MeToo movement.With the current heightened awareness of sexual violence comes heightened accountability for our representatives. To do better, the 2018 Senate Judiciary Committee must demonstrate a clear understanding that sexual violence is a social reality to which elected representatives must respond. A fair, neutral and well-thought-out course is the only way to approach Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s forthcoming testimony. The details of what that process would look like should be guided by experts who have devoted their careers to understanding sexual violence. The job of the Senate Judiciary Committee is to serve as fact-finders, to better serve the American public, and the weight of the government should not be used to destroy the lives of witnesses who are called to testify.Here are some basic ground rules the committee should follow:Refrain from pitting the public interest in confronting sexual harassment against the need for a fair confirmation hearing. Our interest in the integrity of the Supreme Court and in eliminating sexual misconduct, especially in our public institutions, are entirely compatible. Both are aimed at making sure that our judicial system operates with legitimacy.Select a neutral investigative body with experience in sexual misconduct cases that will investigate the incident in question and present its findings to the committee. Outcomes in such investigations are more reliable and less likely to be perceived as tainted by partisanship. Senators must then rely on the investigators\u2019 conclusions, along with advice from experts, to frame the questions they ask Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey. Again, the senators\u2019 fact-finding roles must guide their behavior. The investigators\u2019 report should frame the hearing, not politics or myths about sexual assault.In 1991, the phrase \u201cthey just don\u2019t get it\u201d became a popular way of describing senators\u2019 reaction to sexual violence. With years of hindsight, mounds of evidence of the prevalence and harm that sexual violence causes individuals and our institutions, as well as a Senate with more women than ever, \u201cnot getting it\u201d isn\u2019t an option for our elected representatives. In 2018, our senators must get it right.Anita Hill is university professor of social policy, law, and women\u2019s, gender and sexuality studies at Brandeis University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.T.C. Hearings Add to Efforts That Threaten Tech Industry", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have fought regulators in Europe on privacy, antitrust and taxes. In the United States, the tech titans were on friendly terrain.But on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission kicked off a series of hearings to discuss whether the agency\u2019s competition and consumer protection policies should change to better reflect new technologies and companies.Joseph J. Simons, the agency\u2019s chairman, expressed openness to a new approach.\u201cThe broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cI approach all these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what we see and hear at these hearings.\u201dThe F.T.C. hearings, the first of 15 to 20 over the next several months, are one of several efforts underway on the federal and state level that threaten to limit the expansion and power of tech companies. Later this month, Congress will bring executives from top tech companies to testify on proposals for privacy laws. The Justice Department has warned it may start investigations into whether Google and other social media sites are biased against conservative voices.The spotlight on the giants of Silicon Valley is a major shift for regulators in the United States. For years, they held up the growth of these firms as an emblem of American business leadership and ingenuity. But after a string of crises over privacy and misinformation on social media, a growing chorus of regulators from both political parties is casting a more skeptical eye on the industry.New regulations in the United States are unlikely to arrive anytime soon, and any new federal policies will probably be weaker than those in Europe and states like California. Tech companies have lobbied the Trump administration for voluntary rules and government officials have indicated their desire for light-touch regulation that would pre-empt some state laws.\u201cIt will be a slow-moving ship, faster on privacy than on antitrust, but it\u2019s an important moment,\u201d said Blair Levin, a senior adviser at the research firm New Street and a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission.Reaching an agreement on changes to antitrust policy will be particularly difficult.The field of antitrust law has focused for 30 years on whether prices increase when there is limited competition. Some academics and consumer groups have called for regulators to rethink that gauge. Amazon and Google, they say, defy that metric of antitrust law because the companies are gaining power even as they offer cheap or free goods.\u201cThe issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It\u2019s about the \u2018new economy\u2019 and the degradation of the human spirit \u2014 breaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies,\u201d Mr. Sanders said last week in a Twitter post.Amazon has disputed Mr. Sanders\u2019s accusations, saying the company offers stable pay and benefits for its employees. It has also disputed concerns the company has violated antitrust laws, saying it does not have a dominant market share of the retail market.Some Republicans have also voiced concerns about the industry, and a growing number of economists are studying whether technology\u2019s leading companies are increasing wage inequality. The economists are focused on whether the concentration of workforces at companies like Amazon have a disproportionate effect on wages, inflation and growth.\u201cThese concerns raise a challenge to antitrust agency leadership, the courts and legislators,\u201d Mr. Simons said on Thursday.Companies have argued against broad changes. Google, for instance, says that it offers free search services and that consumers can easily switch to rival search engines online. Companies argue that the tech market is fast changing and regulations could quickly become outdated.The F.T.C. hearing, held at the Georgetown University School of Law, was filled with antitrust lawyers, some of whom had ties to the tech companies. Many warned that changes could make decisions on mergers and antitrust enforcement vulnerable to politics.Janet L. McDavid, a panelist at the F.T.C. hearing and a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, said simply going after companies because they were big was dangerous.The \u201camorphous\u201d concepts of big and fair in antitrust law could lend itself to political decisions, Ms. McDavid said.\u201cWhich we certainly should eschew, especially now in the current political environment,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But sometimes they are also the result of years of preparation, research and commitment to an issue way before it explodes into the national consciousness and dominates the news.Ten years ago, John Moore returned to the United States after almost two decades covering conflict abroad. Having lived in Nicaragua, India, South Africa, Egypt and Pakistan, he had come home with \u201cfresh eyes\u201d that allowed him to encounter his own country anew. He was struck by the human drama in the struggle over immigration from Mexico and the people fleeing poverty and violence in their own country. When Arizona passed a restrictive immigration law in 2010, the \u201cfear and xenophobia toward immigrants\u201d that he began seeing inspired him to spend much of the next eight years traveling the length of the United States-Mexico border, working in immigrant communities and covering law enforcement and protests. It was a prescient decision. \u201cThat fear of immigrants was of course channeled by then-candidate Trump during his campaign to create a potent campaign issue,\u201d Mr. Moore noted.Not only was he deeply immersed in the immigration story when President Trump was leading chants of \u201cbuild that wall,\u201d he also was prepared when the administration\u2019s zero-tolerance policy that separated parents and children who illegally crossed the border triggered global outrage. Mr. Moore, a staff photographer for Getty Images, now has perhaps the most comprehensive body of work of any news photographer covering immigration. His images \u2014 his book \u201cUndocumented\u201d was published by Powerhouse and Getty Images \u2014 are being highlighted in two projections at the Visa pour l\u2019image festival in Perpignan, France. Mr. Moore, who grew up in Texas, spent a lot of time with the United States Border Patrol and was on a ride-along as officers detained and frisked families before taking them to a processing center, where they might be separated. In what would lead to a widely circulated \u2014 and debated \u2014 image, he watched as officers, about to search Sandra Maria Sanchez, asked her to put down her daughter. As she did, the child started crying and Mr. Moore took a few frames. He spoke with Ms. Sanchez briefly and she told him that she and her daughter had traveled for months from Honduras through Mexico. He filed his photos, making sure to point out that mother and child were taken for possible separation. \u201cA two-year-old Honduran asylum seeker cries as her mother is searched and detained near the U.S.-Mexico border on June 12, 2018 in McAllen, Texas\u201d he wrote in the caption. \u201cThe asylum seekers had rafted across the Rio Grande from Mexico and were detained by U.S. Border Patrol agents before being sent to a processing center for possible separation.\u201dThe images went viral. One photo of the crying child, Yanela, was often used as a potent symbol of the agony of family separation and led opponents of the hard-line policy to donate millions of dollars to fight for family reunification. When it turned out that Yanela and her mother actually stayed together, conservative commentators pounced on the image as an example of \u201cfake news.\u201d Time magazine featured part of the image in a cover photo illustration with President Trump towering over Yanela. The cover was pilloried from many sides in social media. Even though the photo of the crying child triggered an intense reaction, Mr. Moore said it was similar to many others he had taken over the years. And the scenes he saw that day were not unusual for him.\u201cThe best we can do, often as wire service photojournalists, is to photograph honestly and caption correctly,\u201d he said. \u201cOur photographs sometimes take on a life of their own later on. As photojournalists, we can\u2019t always control that narrative. And this is especially the case on social media, when the original captions by some people can be stripped off the pictures.\u201dMr. Moore was able to capture the dramatic moment of Yanela crying because of a decade of photographing immigration issues, relying on relationships and trust he has built with federal law enforcement as well as nonprofits and other groups that help immigrants along their torturous journey.\u201cThe goal of this project over all these years has been to humanize the issues of immigration and border security,\u201d he said. \u201cOftentimes, these things are discussed in statistical terms, which can be quite dry, and I\u2019ve always tried to put a human face on this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Several Reported Killed in Libya as Gunmen Storm National Oil Company", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGunmen stormed the headquarters of Libya\u2019s national oil company in Tripoli on Monday, setting off explosions, taking hostages and spraying gunfire, leaving several people dead or wounded before forces aligned with the government took control of the building. The identity and motives of the assailants were not clear.The oil company said two of its employees had been killed, and there were reports of two gunmen killed, putting the total number of dead at four. But an employee who escaped the assault said he believed that as many as six people had been killed, including three of the assailants.The attack follows a month of escalating violence among rival militias competing for control of Tripoli, the capital, where a United Nations-backed government has its headquarters but remains largely powerless. Last week, clashes killed more than 60 people.Any attack on the national oil company is significant because petroleum is the lifeblood of the Libyan economy, and competition for control of the country\u2019s vast oil reserves is at the heart of the often violent struggle for power there. Cuts in oil revenue because of the fighting have driven Libya into a severe financial crisis, with the government failing to meet the public payrolls, long lines forming at banks, and inflation soaring.The employee who escaped, Baha Elddin, said in an interview that six men armed with \u201cmachine guns\u201d had fought their way into the building. Three had blown themselves up, he said, and three others had climbed the stairs to the upper floors.Mr. Elddin said that local militia fighters had responded to the incursion by besieging the building and that their gunfire may have caused the most casualties. \u201cThey started shooting at the assailants inside while the assailants threw grenades down on them from the second floor,\u201d Mr. Elddin said. \u201cI think that most injuries happened because the respondents were shooting in.\u201dSpeaking in the early afternoon in Tripoli, Mr. Elddin said that the battle had ended with as many as 10 employees injured, and that it was unclear whether the three assailants who had climbed the stairs had escaped.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.The chairman of the state oil company, Mustafa Sanallah, escaped unharmed, and experts said it was unlikely that the attack would directly affect Libya\u2019s oil production. But the events demonstrated that the country\u2019s oil infrastructure remains vulnerable.\u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that the country remains at risk,\u201d said Riccardo Fabiani, a geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, a market research firm. \u201cThere is still a backdrop of violence and instability that could again cut production at anytime in the future.\u201dLibya has descended into chaos in the seven years since the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The United Nations and Western powers have tried to set up a government based in Tripoli that might be able to unify the country.But so far, power in Tripoli and Western Libya remains divided among rival local or Islamist militias. A would-be strongman, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, dominates the Eastern area around Benghazi, thanks in part to the backing of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, had controlled its own beachhead around the coastal city of Sirte until it was driven out by Western airstrikes and local militias in 2016. Many of its fighters have fled into the sparsely populated desert regions. They occasionally stage terrorist attacks on institutions of the rival governments backed by the United Nations and General Hifter, including a similar assault last spring on an election commission.Analysts say the National Oil Corporation has managed to remain neutral amid the turmoil. It has increased production \u2014 which fell to almost nothing after war broke out in 2011 \u2014 to around one million barrels a day.That is still significantly below prewar output, but analysts say that under current circumstances, it is probably close to the maximum Libya can produce. Oil producing centers, pipelines and export terminals around the country are vulnerable to attack.Monday\u2019s assault comes at a time of growing concerns about global oil supplies. As the Trump administration tries to cut off Iranian exports, they have declined to around two million a day in August from about 2.7 million barrels a day in May, and they are expected to drop to 1.5 million a day in September, according to Energy Aspects. Venezuela\u2019s output continues to decline amid political chaos and economic collapse.\u201cToo many market participants are way too complacent about Libya,\u201d said Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York.\u201cWe are one major supply outage away from a super spike,\u201d she added, referring to much higher prices.Stanley Reed contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Enforcement Officials Confront Tech Companies\u2019 Power", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Top Justice Department officials met with 14 state attorneys general on Tuesday to weigh whether they have the right tools to confront privacy and competition concerns surrounding Facebook, Google and other tech companies that have amassed extraordinary amounts of data about their consumers and advertising markets.Americans increasingly recognize that tech companies wield tremendous power and deserve greater scrutiny, the law enforcement officials said, and they discussed whether traditional approaches to antitrust issues were still suitable for modern disputes over privacy and the tech business model.Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, cautioned against comparisons to landmark antitrust cases. \u201cMost would agree, this is not Standard Oil, this is not even Microsoft,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201call of those situations inform you.\u201dThe Justice Department called the conversation productive, though no decisions were made or announced. The meeting, largely a forum for officials to share ideas, sharply contrasted with Monday\u2019s chaos at the Justice Department over the confusion of whether Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, would leave the job.He attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting, sitting alongside Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the acting associate attorney general, Jesse Panuccio, the department\u2019s No. 3 official. The head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, and the acting head of the civil rights division, John M. Gore, also attended.Three major issues were broached: the tech business model, which is based on accumulating consumer data; privacy; and user terms and conditions, according to people in the room.Google came up more than other companies, according to a person in the room who was not authorized to publicly describe the discussion and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A few attorneys general expressed concern about Google\u2019s ability to track, in a granular way, the everyday routines of people.Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, was set to meet with lawmakers in Washington on Friday, including Republicans who plan to ask him about the company\u2019s competitive practices; its work with countries accused of human rights abuses, like China and Russia; and whether its workers and search engine magnify biases.\u201cGoogle has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,\u201d the House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, said in a statement.Technology companies mine consumer behavior online for data, which they then sell on an open marketplace much in the same way that a company might sell oil. A handful of large companies control and sell the vast majority of that data.The conversation was originally billed by the Justice Department as a way to address free speech issues, as well as competitive concerns. Before it was announced, Mr. Trump, whose Twitter account is perhaps his core communications platform, amplified claims that tech and social media companies try to suppress conservative voices and opinions.But the law enforcement officials touched only briefly on whether the companies were politically biased or suppressing the free flow of ideas.Advertisement"}

At Fan Fried Rice Bar, Mr. Chen uses same-day rice, but cooks it with less water so it\u2019s drier and doesn\u2019t stick.The key is the wok, an apocalyptic inferno, smoking over a burner that shrieks like a jet engine. The restaurant\u2019s resident wok master, Peng Mai, a native of Guangzhou in southern China, coats the bottom with egg as a protective layer to absorb some of the oil and keep the rice light.Amounts of ingredients and spices vary. \u201cWe don\u2019t like cooking with recipes,\u201d Mr. Chen said. \u201cWith the wok, you have to adjust.\u201d One constant: The rice goes in last, swiftly taking on the flavor of all that\u2019s preceded it.The double-egg fried rice is comfort enough, but even better gilded with a bone-in pork chop. The meat is tenderized by a mallet with spring-loaded needles that break down fibers without sacrificing succulence. Soy sauce is allowed here, mixed with Shaoxing wine to bathe the pork, before it\u2019s dredged in sweet potato starch for a featherweight crust.Mr. Chen settled in New York five years ago while pursuing a career in fashion and beauty. As a homage to his new hometown, he takes pastrami, with its old-school deli funk, dices and deep-fries it, then tosses it in the wok with peanuts, chile paste and numbing Sichuan peppercorn, just enough to disorient the tongue.Another fried rice is littered with fat red checkers of Mexican chorizo, wafting spices meant to evoke a taco \u2014 sacrilege, but somehow it works. The meat bears a whiff of cumin, under crisp radish, cotija cheese and a slug of jalape\u00f1o sauce, the flavors loud and in unison.Even a Hawaiian-themed fried rice (with a wink of a mai tai paper umbrella) is improbably good, the pineapple\u2019s sweetness muted, yielding to ham and shrimp with their hits of brine.A few snacks round out the menu. Best among them are popcorn chicken, nubs of white meat in crunchy shells of sweet potato starch and glutinous rice flour; and tubby links of Taiwanese pork sausage, made to Mr. Chen\u2019s specifications in Flushing, Queens, with a pulse of cinnamon and five-spice.Taiwanese golden kimchi is less kimchi than pickle, layers of Napa cabbage and carrot doused with sugar and rice vinegar. It refreshes but has no sting. Mapo tofu, with pork swapped for dried shiitakes (resuscitated and poached in a gingery broth), is puzzlingly mild, missing its trademark buzz.Mr. Chen wants to challenge stereotypes of grungy Chinese takeout; thus, the room\u2019s stark white walls, scrupulously bare, and four black two-tops in a neat row. It\u2019s not quite cozy, but no matter: Fried rice is hardy enough to survive the journey home.It might even be improved by it. Wait a day and the flavors deepen. A flip on the stove and the grains remember their snap. You eat the rice straight out of the pan, and miss it when it\u2019s gone.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Victimizing the Victims, Again", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the Kavanaugh hearings, Republicans made it clear that the old, male-dominated order will prevail.Opinion ColumnistThe Federal Bureau of Investigation is on the case.The agency is now looking into allegations that the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh engaged in aggressive sexual misconduct \u2014 including assault and possibly rape \u2014 when he was in high school and college.And yet there is a gnawing in my gut that nothing we do now will fully or even sufficiently cause us to recover from the tremendous damage already done by the way the Senate has treated these allegations and the way that the media has covered them.We have severely damaged the confidence of survivors of sexual assault, particularly childhood sexual assault, to come forward to the authorities and talk openly about what happened to them.At the same time that the accuser Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s example has inspired countless victims to feel empowered and share their trauma in all manner of forums, the way that her courage has been met in the Senate with condescension, contempt and hostility has secured in many survivors a sense that power will not be sympathetic to the disclosure; it will treat it as an affront and an attack.The message that the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee sent to survivors, mostly women, but also many men, is this:Your pain is not our problem. Your bodies are not your own. Your voice, even at its strongest, is still weaker than any man\u2019s, no matter how sniveling and snide. We are here to protect the order, an old order, in which men rule, even when unruly and reprobate.They are saying to survivors: Your word and your credibility may be all that you have, but they are not enough for you to be believed. They are saying that fear and trauma may have shocked you into silence, but in the end, you will be punished for that silence. They are saying that the failure of survivors, including children, to properly report and document their victimizations will be viewed later not as evidence of fear and shame, but as evidence of concoction and deceit.These senators are telling teenage boys this:What those senators are saying to all of us is that, for them, patriarchy and privilege occupy positions of primacy in this country. And, when that primacy is threatened, it is perfectly reasonable that those affected would whine and rage at the possibility of being denied that to which they are owed, as birthright and gender benefit.As sexual assault accusers go, one would have been hard pressed to find one more able and affable than Ford. She is a professor who talked about the alleged assault before Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, one who by all accounts wanted to remain anonymous. Compelled by her own sense of patriotism, she finally came forward and told her story with grace and composure as millions of Americans watched.The senators, unable to impeach her credibility outright and leery of exposing their callousness and contempt, chose instead a patronizing paternalism. They shed crocodile tears for Ford, painting her as a victim, yes: not of Kavanaugh but rather of the Democrats on the committee. To them, somehow she was a clueless pawn in the Democrats\u2019 game to besmirch and indeed destroy the name of a good man.This diminished and belittled in every way the very real and very credible accusation that Ford made and completely blotted out the incredible courage it would take for a person to appear before them if it indeed happened to them.In other words, the Republicans on the committee patted her on her head while spitting in her face.And somehow we still have the gall to feign astonishment that people wouldn\u2019t immediately report an attack, instead holding it for a year, decades, maybe even a lifetime.People don\u2019t come forward because of authorities like the Republicans on the committee, the ones who will scoff at you, blame you and not believe you.Just as Ford was creaking the door open and empowering others to come out of the closet with their own stories, Republicans on the committee rushed to slam it back shut and secure its closure with enmity if necessary.They demand to make survivors quake with fear again.Advertisement"}

I have a feeling that\u2019s going to happen with us. In different ways, that\u2019s going to happen with us.\u201dWell, we can all rally around the \u201cdifferent ways.\u201dNononono. If we start going back over all the things we knew before Donald Trump was elected president, we will all fall into a deep depression. Pick yourself up. It\u2019s almost autumn, and remember, Donald Trump is having a worse week than you are.About the anonymous official\u2019s Op-Ed: Trump has of course been trying to prove it\u2019s all terribly wrong. For instance, the author had bemoaned the fact that \u201cin public and in private,\u201d the president \u201cshows a preference for autocrats and dictators\u201d like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un.Trump responded with a tweet. What do you think he said?A) \u201cNobody loves democracy more than Donald!\u201d B) \u201cKim Jong Un of North Korea proclaims \u2018unwavering faith in President Trump.\u2019 Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!\u201dYeah, yeah. You show you\u2019re not cuddling up to dictators by thanking a dictator for his support. But then we moved on to Stage 2, when he went off to Montana to prove that he hasn\u2019t \u201clost it.\u201d And gave that Lincolnesque speech. \u201cOur ancestors built the railroads, linked the highways,\u201d Trump somberly told his audience. \u201cAnd they proudly planted an American flag on the face of the moon, which is not shown in that movie.\u201dHmmm. Willing to let pass the idea that it was our ancestors who went to the moon. But where did the movie come from? Trump had lurched into a mini-tangent about the fact that \u201cFirst Man,\u201d a soon-to-be-released film about the astronaut Neil Armstrong, does not include a scene showing the flag being put on the moon. You\u2019ll recall that the unnamed official of Op-Ed fame complained that meetings with the president constantly \u201cveer off topic and off the rails.\u201d Just listening to the Montana speech, you could hear it happening. The man cannot keep one thought in his mind for more than two seconds. Try to imagine Abraham Lincoln telling the folks at Gettysburg \u201cthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and \u2026 you know they really need to install a telegraph system in the White House.\u201dTrump was supposed to be in Montana to stump for the Republican running against Senator Jon Tester, who earned the special enmity of the president when he opposed the nomination of Dr. Ronny Jackson to become head of the Department of Veterans Affairs. \u201cOne of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever seen is when Jon Tester and what he did to a great, great man \u2026\u201d our president told the crowd. Jackson, he added somberly, was \u201cactually the doctor that gave me my physical. And he said that I\u2019m in great shape.\u201dThe president was certainly bitter, complaining about the \u201clies\u201d that had been told about Jackson until suddenly, out of nowhere, he demanded: \u201cDo we love Sean Hannity by the way? Right?\u201dAnd then a complaint about how Hannity allowed \u201call these losers\u201d on Fox who say \u201cDonald Trump, he\u2019s lost it up here.\u201d Who do you think is worse, Elon Musk or Donald Trump?

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Antitrust Antagonist Has a Breakthrough Idea", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "With a single scholarly article, Lina Khan, 29, has reframed decades of monopoly law.Supported by\u201cAntitrust Dilemma.\u201d \u201cThe Antitrust Impulse.\u201d \u201cAntitrust in an Expanding Economy.\u201d Shelf after shelf of volumes ignored for decades. There are a dozen fat tomes with transcripts of the congressional hearings on monopoly power in 1949, when the world was in ruins and the Soviets on the march. Lawmakers believed economic concentration would make America more vulnerable.At the end of the antitrust stacks is a table near the window. \u201cThis is my command post,\u201d said Lina Khan.It\u2019s nothing, really. A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon.If competitors tremble at Amazon\u2019s ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon\u2019s customers, it is safe to say, spend much time thinking they need to be protected from it.Amazon has more revenue than Facebook, Google and Twitter put together, but it has largely escaped sustained examination. That is beginning to change, and one significant reason is Ms. Khan.Ms. Khan disagreed. Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, she presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the economy.Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: \u201cThe thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon\u2019s rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.\u201dThe paper got 146,255 hits, a runaway best-seller in the world of legal treatises. That popularity has rocked the antitrust establishment, and is making an unlikely celebrity of Ms. Khan in the corridors of Washington.She has her own critics now: Several leading scholars have found fault with Ms. Khan\u2019s proposals to revive and expand antitrust, and some have tried to dismiss her paper with the mocking label \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201d Unwilling or perhaps unable to accept that a woman wrote a breakthrough legal text, they keep talking about bearded dudes.\u201cAs consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.\u201dAt the S.M.U. library in Dallas, Ms. Khan was finding that vocabulary. These dead books, many from an era that predated the price-based era of monopoly law, were an influence and an inspiration. She was planning to expand her essay into a book, she said in an interview here in June.Then her life shifted, and she abruptly went from an outsider proposing reform to an insider formulating policy. Rohit Chopra, a new Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, pulled her in as a temporary adviser in July, at a time when urgent questions about privacy, data, competition and antitrust were suddenly in the air. The F.T.C. is holding a series of hearings this fall, the first of their type since 1995, on whether a changing economy requires changing enforcement attitudes.\u201cIdeas and assumptions that it was heretical to question are now openly being contested,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it.\u201dGenuinely original voices are rare in Washington policy circles, and Mr. Chopra is pleased to have Ms. Khan in his camp. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to come across a legal prodigy like Lina Khan,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing about her career is typical. You don\u2019t see many law students publish groundbreaking legal research, or research that had such a deep impact so quickly.\u201d\u201cIt takes time to crush men who are pursuing legitimate trade. But one of Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s most impressive characteristics is patience. \u2026 He was like a general who, besieging a city surrounded by fortified hills, views from a balloon the whole great field, and sees how, this point taken, that must fall; this hill reached, that fort is commanded. And nothing was too small: the corner grocery in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipeline. Nothing, for little things grow.\u201dWhen Ms. Khan read that, she thought: Jeff Bezos.Her Yale Law Journal paper argued that monopoly regulators who focus on consumer prices are thinking too short-term. In Ms. Khan\u2019s view, a company like Amazon \u2014 one that sells things, competes against others selling things, and owns the platform where the deals are done \u2014 has an inherent advantage that undermines fair competition.\u201cThe long-term interests of consumers include product quality, variety and innovation \u2014 factors best promoted through both a robust competitive process and open markets,\u201d she wrote.The issue Ms. Khan\u2019s article really brought to the fore is this: Do we trust Amazon, or any large company, to create our future? In think tanks and universities, the battle has been joined.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that antitrust enforcement has gotten far too weak,\u201d said Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan scholar who doesn\u2019t agree with Ms. Khan but credits her with opening up a much-needed debate. \u201cIt\u2019s a bridge much further to say we should go back to the populist goal of leveling playing fields and checking \u2018bigness.\u2019 \u201dThe analogies with Amazon are explicit. Don\u2019t let the government pursue Amazon the way it pursued A.&P., Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein warned.\u201cAmazon has added hundreds of billions of dollars of value to the U.S. economy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is a brilliant innovator\u201d whose \u201cbreakthroughs have in turn helped launch new waves of innovation across retail and technology sectors, to the great benefit of consumers.\u201dAmazon itself could not have made the argument any better. Which isn\u2019t surprising, because in a footnote on the first page, the authors noted: \u201cWe approached Amazon Inc. for funding to tell the story\u201d of A.&P., \u201cand we gratefully acknowledge its support.\u201d They added at the end of footnote 85: \u201cThe authors have advised Amazon on a variety of antitrust issues.\u201dAmazon declined to say how much its support came to in dollars. It also declined to comment on Ms. Khan or her paper directly, but issued a statement.\u201cWe operate in a diverse range of businesses, from retail and entertainment to consumer electronics and technology services, and we have intense and well-established competition in each of these areas,\u201d the company said. \u201cRetail is our largest business today and we represent less than 1 percent of global retail.\u201dHer father was a management consultant; her mother an executive in information services. Ms. Khan went to Williams College, where she wrote a thesis on the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. She was the editor of the student paper but worked hard at everything.\u201cWe were routinely emailing each other on separate floors of the library as it was closing at 2 a.m.,\u201d said Amanda Korman, a classmate.Like many a wonkish youth, Ms. Khan headed to Washington after graduating in 2010, applying for a position at the left-leaning New America Foundation. Barry Lynn, who headed the organization\u2019s Open Markets antimonopoly initiative, seized on her application. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to teach public policy to people who already know how to write than teach writing to public policy experts,\u201d said Mr. Lynn, a former journalist.Ms. Khan wrote about industry consolidation and monopolistic practices for Washington publications that specialize in policy, went to Yale Law School, published her Amazon paper and then came back to Washington last year, just as interest was starting to swell in her work.\u201cPolls show huge concerns about concentrated power, corporate power, but if people are asked, \u2018Do we have a monopoly problem?\u2019 they answer, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Lynn. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the language for it.\u201d\u201cThe whole country has been struggling to understand why the economy is not operating in the right way,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said. \u201cWages have remained stagnant. Workers have less and less power. All we\u2019re trying to do is create a level playing field, and that\u2019s harder when you have megacompanies that make it virtually impossible for small competitors.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning of solutions to this.\u201dSomewhere in the midst of all this, Ms. Khan found the time to marry Shah Ali, a doctor now doing a cardiology fellowship in Dallas, which explains why she was camping out at the S.M.U. law library. The honeymoon was in Hawaii. Dr. Ali took Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPersuasion,\u201d because he hadn\u2019t reread it in a while. Ms. Khan brought a book on corporations and American democracy.The battle for intellectual supremacy takes place less these days in learned journals and more on social media, where tongues are sharp and branding is all. This is not Ms. Khan\u2019s strong suit. She is always polite, even on Twitter. One consequence is that she didn\u2019t give much thought about what to call the movement to reboot antitrust. Neither did anyone else.\u201cAntitrust Hipsterism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything old is cool again.\u201dMr. Medvedovsky, who calls Ms. Khan\u2019s article \u201cthe face of this movement,\u201d said the term was designed to be \u201cplayful rather than pejorative.\u201dAdmirers of Ms. Khan and her fellow reformers have sometimes called them the New Brandeis School or the New Brandeisians, after Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era foe of big business. As brands go, these are somewhat less catchy than \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201dThe Hipster issue was sponsored by Facebook, another sign that Big Tech is striving to shape the monopoly-law debate. The company declined to comment.Things are moving fast, so there is a lot to write papers about.Contemporary antitrust regulation, the commissioner wrote, is conducted in the courts, which makes it numbingly slow and dependent on high-paid expert witnesses. He called for the agency to use its authority to issue rules that would \u201cadvance clarity and certainty\u201d about what is, and what is not, an unfair method of competition.These rules would not be \u201csome inflexible prescription\u201d but standards, guidelines, pointers or presumptions, he wrote. Since everyone affected by a proposed rule would have the opportunity to weigh in on it, the process would be more democratic.There is more than an echo here of Ms. Khan\u2019s notion that the past can help rescue the future.\u201cThese are new technologies and new business models,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cThe remedy is new thinking that is informed by traditional principles.\u201dMs. Khan was not the first to criticize Amazon, and she said the company was not really her target anyway. \u201cAmazon is not the problem \u2014 the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon depicts that in an elegant way,\u201d she said.From Amazon\u2019s point of view, however, it is a problem indeed that Ms. Khan concludes in the Yale paper that regulating parts of the company like a utility \u201ccould make sense.\u201d She also said it \u201ccould make sense\u201d to treat Amazon\u2019s e-commerce operation like a bridge, highway, port, power grid or telephone network \u2014 all of which are required to allow access to their infrastructure on a nondiscriminatory basis.Ms. Khan put those ideas out there, which is how Rachel Tsuna found them.Last fall, the Barnard College senior was casting about for a subject for her senior thesis. \u201cWhat is really interesting to you?\u201d her adviser asked. Ms. Tsuna, now 22, had worked for a chewing gum start-up \u2014 yes, there are such things \u2014 that sold through Amazon, and knew firsthand the retailer\u2019s tight grip. \u201cAmazon is scary!\u201d she exclaimed.This impulsive declaration suggested a topic: Did the F.T.C. have the grounds to move against Amazon? Ms. Tsuna made little progress until she came across Ms. Khan\u2019s paper.\u201cI finally felt like I was pursuing something valid,\u201d Ms. Tsuna said. \u201cLina Khan gave me the confidence I needed.\u201d The thesis, which is quite fair to Amazon, got an A minus.That\u2019s the way movements begin. Little things grow.\u201cThis is a moment in time that invites a movement,\u201d said Ms. Khan. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than antitrust, bigger than Big Tech. It\u2019s about whether the laws serve democratic ends.\u201dIt was late at night in late July, and she was eating a burrata concoction at a popular restaurant near the Washington apartment she uses when not in Texas with her husband. After the death of Judge Reinhardt, her options opened up. She had the Columbia fellowship. Maybe she would also write the book. Or go back to the F.T.C. full time. Or somehow do it all.\u201cAmazon is a monopoly, and I worry that it monopolizes Lina,\u201d said her husband, Dr. Ali. \u201cI learn about what she is doing from looking at her Twitter feed.\u201d\u201cI throw myself into things,\u201d Ms. Khan agreed. \u201cMy life is spread out now.\u201dWith some cajoling, she revealed her Amazon account. There were just three purchases in 18 months. An altimeter for her father, who has taken up hiking, is the only one she will agree to have mentioned, although the other two are incredibly benign. One attribute Ms. Khan shares with Amazon is a strong desire to control the flow of information.Balancing the attention and the achievement, the expectations and the demands, is difficult, perhaps impossible.\u201cI don\u2019t think of my work in grandiose terms. I feel an urgency but I\u2019m also wary of hubris,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cNobody has been expecting this to succeed. I\u2019m awed by the challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Most people recognized that it looked bad, a black woman fending for herself in front of a group of white men. Yet we can\u2019t acknowledge the central tragedy of 1991 \u2014 the false tension between feminist and antiracist movements. We are still ignoring the unique vulnerability of black women. I watched Anita Hill testify as a member of her support team. I worried that she would be trapped between an antiracist movement that foregrounded black men, and a feminism that could not fully address how race shaped society\u2019s perception of black victims. I thought this subtext might be subtle. But when Clarence Thomas denounced Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony as \u201ca high-tech lynching,\u201d I knew this nuance had exploded into full-scale war. Underlying his comment was the idea that sexual harassment, like the feminism that pointed it out, was a white preoccupation incompatible with antiracism.Meanwhile, Judge Thomas\u2019s counterassault contradicted a good deal of his own legal and political thought. Judge Thomas was an apostle of individualist self-help \u2014 blacks could advance only by pulling themselves up from their own bootstraps. He had long derided the civil rights movement\u2019s focus on structural racism and its corresponding calls for structural remedies. So my colleagues and I were stunned as Judge Thomas, who spent years attacking the work of civil rights leaders and his own black sister, asserted his own racial victimhood. More significantly, Judge Thomas\u2019s sound bite instantly divided the white feminists and antiracists, who might otherwise have been able to unite to block his confirmation.Consider what the other Hill supporters and I saw as we left the Capitol late that evening. A group of African-Americans, most of them women, had gathered at the bottom of the steps, in song and prayer. At first, we thought it was a mobilization in support of Anita Hill in the great civil rights tradition. But as we drew closer, we heard them praying for the Lord to intercede on Clarence Thomas\u2019s behalf, to rescue him from the scheming malice of Anita Hill. We fled and piled into a taxi, only to hear a black radio talk show host inveighing against Ms. Hill. One caller after another sided with Judge Thomas. We despaired as it became clear that our organizing on Anita Hill\u2019s behalf was ineffective in the face of outrage over a black woman who had dared to turn on a fellow African-American at the cusp of enormous judicial power. This complaint echoed across barber shops, churches and dining rooms across the country.To our distress, Anita Hill was not defended by the most influential Democrats on the Judiciary Committee or by a majority of African-Americans. Inside the hearing room, committee members painted her as an angry and sexually deranged woman. Outside, Republican senators described her as having nefarious motives and a dubious background. Dr. Patterson, of course, wasn\u2019t the first person to use a cultural defense to justify the abuse of black women. The \u201cothering\u201d of black women\u2019s sexuality has long been a part of American history. This reality informed \u201cthe talk\u201d black mothers would have with their daughters when they were summoned to work in the big house, the fields or later in factories. This stereotype has rationalized sexual abuse as culturally-sanctioned byplay between male predators of all races and black female victims. Black women are vulnerable not only because of racial bias against them, but also because of stereotypes \u2014 that they expect less nurturing, they are more willing, no one will believe them. This is what marks them as prey to men of all races. Long before Anita Hill\u2019s poised testimony, black women knew all too well the many ways in which the mere facts of their race and gender identities made them targets. Feminists rightly denounced the locker-room treatment of Ms. Hill by the Judiciary Committee and by the media. But they were largely flat-footed in their efforts to grapple with the racial undertow that sapped her support within the Senate chamber and in much of the African-American community. White feminists cast her as an accomplished lawyer and legal scholar whose race was immaterial. Such colorblind feminism did a profound disservice to Ms. Hill. And it marked another key moment of political erasure \u2014 in this case, one that effaced modern feminist history. Treating the racial backdrop of the hearing as just noise meant that we missed an opportunity to create a nuanced understanding of sexual harassment. In the great awakening around sexual harassment, race was politely ushered offstage.The failure of antiracists and white feminists to counter the racist stereotypes lobbed against Ms. Hill left a gaping hole. So black feminists filled it. They rallied together to purchase a full-page advertisement in The New York Times titled \u201cAfrican American Women in Defense of Ourselves.\u201d The 1,600 signatories noted the racism and sexism playing out in the Hill-Thomas drama. The advertisement showed what the mainstream media was determined to overlook \u2014 that black women were disbelieved and undervalued. Correcting the record would also mean that movements against police violence and gender-based violence should prioritize the abuse of black women, which has long been a distant afterthought in both. It would also mean that \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d and similar programs would include at-risk girls in their educational and mentorship programs. For too long, racial justice groups and leading women\u2019s groups have been silent about this exclusion or content with underfunded spinoffs that focus on reducing pregnancy rather than enhancing academic achievement.And rectifying the legacy of the Hill-Thomas hearing would mean that antiracist work against mass incarceration and juvenile justice would also focus on black girls, not just boys.Throughout history, black feminist frameworks have been doing the hard work of building the social justice movements that race-only or gender-only frames cannot. Intersectionality, my term for the urgent project of uniting the battles for race and gender justice, is an indispensable way to understand aspects of our history, that, to our peril, remain hidden. The Hill-Thomas conflict has gone down in history as a colossal failure of intersectional organizing. It\u2019s not too late, as the Kavanaugh nomination fight enters its next phase, to write a better history.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Liberalism of the Religious Right ", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConservatives who attend church have more moderate views than secular conservatives on issues like race, immigration and identity. Ms. Ekins in the director of polling and a research fellow at the Cato Institute.President Trump has been a regular speaker at recent Values Voter Summits, and for this year\u2019s event, he will send Vice President Mike Pence to rally the religious right. This will not surprise many people on the left who have questioned the authenticity of social conservatives\u2019 values and their place in the Trump-Pence coalition. They think the religious right has compromised its Christian values in order to attain political power for Republicans.Churchgoing Trump voters have more favorable feelings toward African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Muslims and immigrants compared with nonreligious Trump voters. This holds up even while accounting for demographic factors like education and race.Churchgoing Trump voters care far more than nonreligious ones about racial equality (67 percent versus 49 percent) and reducing poverty (42 percent versus 23 percent). These differences are reflected in their actions, too. Mr. Trump\u2019s most religiously observant voters are three times as likely as secular Trump voters to volunteer \u2014 and not just with their own church. Sixty-one percent of the president\u2019s most devout base volunteered in the past year compared with 20 percent of conservatives without religious affiliation.Religious participation also appears to pull Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters away from the administration\u2019s immigration policy. The more frequently Trump voters attend church, the more they support offering citizenship to unauthorized immigrants and making the immigration process easier, and the more opposed they become to the border wall.It seems church teachings can curb tribalistic impulses by regularly reminding worshipers that we are all God\u2019s children. This hasn\u2019t extended to sexual minorities as much as progressives may like, but it appears to be making a difference when it comes to race and immigration.These effects aren\u2019t confined to just Protestants or Catholics (who make up 63 percent and 26 percent, respectively, of Mr. Trump\u2019s devout supporters). Frequent participation in religious traditions also appears to bolster more tolerant attitudes and volunteer work among Muslims, Mormons and Buddhists.Some on the left might applaud such trends. Because of the L.G.B.T. culture wars, many incorrectly assume that if conservative churchgoers are less accepting of sexual minorities, they are also less accepting of racial and religious minorities. This may help explain why a majority (56 percent) of Democrats today have outright negative views of evangelical Christians, as the Views of the Electorate Research Survey found. Many progressives hope that encouraging conservatives to disengage from religion will make them more tolerant. But if the data serve as any guide, doing so may in fact make it even harder for left and right to meet in a more compassionate middle.Emily Ekins is the director of polling and a research fellow at the Cato Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trial by Fire: Critics Demand That a Huge Sepsis Study Be Stopped", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA trial enrolling new patients resembles \u201can experiment that would be conducted on laboratory animals,\u201d one advocacy group said. A large government trial comparing treatments for a life-threatening condition called sepsis is putting participants at risk of organ failure and even death, critics charge, and should be immediately shut down.A detailed analysis of the trial design prepared by senior investigators at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md., concluded that the study \u201cplaces seriously ill patients at risk without the possibility of gaining information that can provide benefits either to the subjects or to future patients.\u201dIn a letter to the federal Office for Human Research Protection, representatives of Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group compared the study, called Clovers, to \u201can experiment that would be conducted on laboratory animals.\u201d\u201cThe human subjects of the Clovers trial, as designed and currently conducted, are unwitting guinea pigs in a physiology experiment,\u201d Dr. Michael Carome and Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe wrote in their letter.Begun in March, Clovers is funded by the N.I.H. \u2014 despite the criticism of its own investigators \u2014 and aims to enroll 2,320 patients at 44 hospitals around the country. In interviews, the scientists leading the study defended its design, saying that participants are receiving all the care that sepsis patients normally would receive. \u201cThe guiding principle is patient safety, which takes priority over all else,\u201d said Dr. Nathan I. Shapiro, a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School and co-chairman of the protocol committee for the study.Sepsis develops when the body mounts an overwhelming attack against an infection, causing inflammation throughout the body. It is first treated with antibiotics. If sepsis progresses, the body may experience a catastrophic cascade of changes, including blood clots and leaky blood vessels that impede blood flow to organs. At least one million Americans are diagnosed with sepsis every year, and the death rate is high: up to 30 percent succumb to the illness. But while most adults know they must seek care immediately for a heart attack or stroke, only about half know that sepsis requires urgent medical attention, according to a survey by Sepsis Alliance, a nonprofit organization.Signs of sepsis include an abnormally high or low temperature, an underlying infection (which may not be apparent without a blood test), signs of confusion or sleepiness, and feelings of extreme illness, pain or discomfort that make people feel they are about to die.Clovers is designed to test a new strategy for treating septic shock, a dangerous drop in blood pressure that chokes blood flow to organs, affects the heart and can result in death.The goal of the trial is to determine whether it is better to limit fluids and start vasopressors \u2014 drugs that constrict blood vessels \u2014 quickly, or to use more intravenous fluids and postpone giving the drugs to patients. At issue is whether patients participating in Clovers are being given treatment that deviates from usual care \u2014 so much so that lives may be endangered by the research. Participants are only enrolled for 24 hours, but the first hours of treatment are critical for survival. Both fluids in large amounts and vasopressors can cause serious complications, but when a patient\u2019s condition continues to deteriorate, doctors use both interventions, adjusting them depending on the severity of illness. They generally start with fluids, which in small amounts are considered less toxic than vasopressors.But participants in Clovers are randomly assigned to a \u201cliberal fluids\u201d group who receive large infusions of fluids in a very short time but limits the use of vasopressors, or to a \u201crestrictive fluids\u201d group in which fluids are minimized and drug treatment begun earlier. Scientists leading the study note that treatment is not hard and fast, and insist that all participants are getting medical care that \u201cfalls within the range of usual care.\u201d Still, they recently altered one of the treatment protocols after physicians in the study complained that its protocols were inconsistent with their practices.Critics say the change did not allay their concerns: Patients in both treatment arms potentially could go without lifesaving therapy and are not being properly informed of the risks.\u201cBoth vasopressors and fluids are lifesaving, and inadequate or excessive amounts of either one can cause death,\u201d Dr. Carome said.If neither treatment arm approximates usual care, as critics contend, the investigators may be unable to draw meaningful conclusions \u2014 they won\u2019t know how the two experimental treatments stack up against the usual care. It will also be difficult for safety monitors to know if participants are dying at abnormally high rates.Though patients in the trial are randomly assigned to one of two groups getting very different treatments, Dr. Shapiro insisted all are receiving what would be considered \u201cusual care\u201d \u2014 because treatment for sepsis already is variable in hospitals around the country.In the study, a patient\u2019s physician may deviate from the experimental treatments at any point to provide a lifesaving alternative. \u201cIf the physician at the bedside thinks the patient needs a specific treatment, they will get it,\u201d Dr. Shapiro said. The trial protocol, he noted, was developed by more than 20 experts in emergency and critical care medicine, reviewed by an independent peer review committee and approved by a central institutional review board tasked with protecting the rights of human subjects.Medical experts in the field generally agree there is a need for better scientific evidence on how to treat sepsis. \u201cThere is not a lot of data about how much fluid to give, how much is enough, how much is too much, how much is too little,\u201d said Dr. Tiffany Osborn, an emergency physician and critical care specialist speaking on behalf of the College of Emergency Medical Physicians. \u201cThat information is hard to get a handle on.\u201dAnother expert not involved in the trial said the study appears designed to challenge current care guidelines. \u201cCertainly care is often fluids and then vasopressors, and this study is provocative in that it goes against that and says maybe what we\u2019ve been doing for decades may not be the right thing, and maybe we should be giving the vasopressors early on,\u201d said Dr. Matthew Churpek, an assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Chicago.Dr. Carome, of Public Citizen, is not convinced that the study provides anything like the usual care. \u201cWe think Clovers can\u2019t be fixed,\u201d he said.

It long ago became clear that Mr. Trump regards federal law enforcement \u2014 as he sees all of government \u2014 as a political tool to advance the interests of himself and of his party (assuming those interests align, of course; if not, the party is on its own). \u201cTwo long-running, Obama era, investigations of two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTwo easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time.

{"Headline": "Will Saudi Arabia Cease to Be the Center of Islam?", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySaudi Arabia, or the Arabian Peninsula before the formation of the modern kingdom, has been and remains a place both central and marginal to Muslims around the world.Mr. Devji teaches history at the University of Oxford.An Urdu novel published in 1869 by Nazir Ahmad, a writer in Delhi, portrays two young Muslim girls at their geography lesson. As they identify various countries on a map, the girls come across the Arabian Peninsula. Their teacher describes it as an empty space infested by marauding Bedouin, one whose only significance lay in its historical role as the site of Islam\u2019s birth. The monuments and institutions of Mecca and Medina, the birthplaces of Islam, had always been minor in architectural quality and financial endowment compared with the splendid mosques, tombs and seminaries found at the centers of Muslim power in Baghdad and Cairo, Istanbul and Isfahan, Delhi and Samarkand. Muslim kings rarely visited Mecca and Medina. Instead, those cities served as places of exile for their enemies.Saudi Arabia, or the Arabian Peninsula before the formation of the modern kingdom, has been and remains a place both central and marginal to Muslims around the world. Even as Mecca and Medina represent the most important sites of Muslim pilgrimage, the vision of the holy cities as remote and perilous is still reinforced by the occasional stampede of pilgrims during the Hajj.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has been moving fast to make his country a political and military power for the first time since its founding. He has engaged in a pitiless war with Yemen, imposed a blockade on Qatar and embraced increasingly aggressive positions toward Iran and other rivals. Whether or not Prince Mohammed\u2019s strategy succeeds, it will transform Saudi Arabia\u2019s religious status in the Muslim world. In the late 19th century, for the first time since the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s day, the Arabian Peninsula was placed at the center of Islam\u2019s modern geography as Ottoman power waned over the Middle East and British influence extended outward from its economic and military base in India.Mr. Blunt was among the first to make an argument that eventually redefined the geography of Islam by placing Arabia at its center. He argued that Istanbul and its Turkish emperor could never be true Muslim leaders, a role he saw as reserved for Arabs and their homeland. Istanbul, the capital of the only remaining Muslim power, had to be divested of its claim to the caliphate, and Islamic authority had to return to an Arabian Peninsula defended by the Royal Navy. And the British writer saw British India as crucial in the making of this new Muslim world centered on the Arabian Peninsula. Apart from India\u2019s large Muslim population, the country\u2019s armed forces, traders, laborers and pilgrims had become crucial to the security, economy and demography of Arabia even in Ottoman times. During this period Arabia was witnessing a consolidation of power through an alliance between the Wahhabi movement and the family of Ibn Saud, which led to the establishment of modern Saudi Arabia in 1932.But attitudes changed over time, and the Wahhabis came to be viewed more favorably in Muslim societies with weak or colonized elites well beyond Arabia. By the 20th century, the British themselves had got into the habit of admiring the Wahhabis and those who appeared to be their Indian followers, whom they saw as the Protestants of Islam out to destroy the decadence and superstition of their corrupt and Catholic coreligionists. The movement\u2019s Muslim admirers included both extreme conservatives and liberal modernizers who, like the English, saw Wahhabis as rationalists willing to break with the \u201cpopish\u201d authority of traditional religious authorities as well as of Muslim kings and return to the pure Islam of its Arab origins. When Britain decided to support Ibn Saud and his Wahhabi troops in the 1930s, Indian Muslims were prepared to welcome the creation of Saudi Arabia. The ground for this welcome had been laid once Istanbul, or for that matter Cairo or Baghdad, was replaced by Mecca and Medina not only at the geographical center of Islam but also as the historical models for an ideal Muslim society. The new geography of Islam was also a Protestant one, with Rome\u2019s decadence mirrored in Istanbul and forsaken for Geneva\u2019s austerities as found in Arabia\u2019s holy cities. At its birth, Saudi Arabia looked very much like Mr. Blunt\u2019s vision of it, the center of Islam protected by the Royal Navy and placed firmly in the camp of Christian powers. After World War I, the American Navy replaced the British, and oil turned the kingdom into a crucial resource for Western capitalism. But its religious and economic centrality was contradicted by Saudi Arabia's continuing political marginality, with Britain, the United States and even the Pakistani Army responsible for its internal stability and defense from external threats.Today, Saudi Arabia is ostensibly countering Iran, but its claims to dominance are also made possible by the decline of Egypt and the decimation of Iraq and Syria. Turkey remains its only and as yet ambiguous rival apart from Iran.What will the subordination of religious to secular if despotic authority mean for the geography of Islam? In the aftermath of World War I, when the Ottoman defeat placed Islam\u2019s sacred cities under indirect European control, Muslim thinkers debated the idea of neutralizing Mecca and Medina politically on the model of the Vatican or internationalizing them in the name of the world\u2019s Muslims. Iran still refers to the latter option when trying to prise the holy cities from the grasp of the Saudis. The project to make Saudi Arabia a politically rather than religiously defined state is likely to demolish the century-old vision of an Islamic geography, which has always been premised upon Arabia constituting its depoliticized center. Mecca and Medina will still receive their pilgrims, but Islam may finally assume a truly global form and dispense with a colonial cartography in which the Middle East enjoys pride of place despite containing a small minority of the world\u2019s Muslims. Islam would inevitably find itself at home in Asia, where by far the largest number of its followers live, and toward which global wealth and power are increasingly shifting.

{"Headline": "A Supreme Court Transformed", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat will the court look like when neither side of the ideological divide has to walk on eggs to win the favor of the justice in the middle? Contributing Opinion Writer So it\u2019s all over but the voting. I\u2019m writing this column on the assumption that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will soon be Justice Kavanaugh, despite the Democrats\u2019 continuing efforts to convert a futile battle over ideology into an ugly one over transparency and ethics. By the first Monday in October or soon thereafter, the Roberts court version 5.0 (accounting for the earlier arrival of Justices Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch since Chief Justice John Roberts took his seat in September 2005) will be underway.What then?Most answers to the \u201cWhat then?\u201d question have offered side-by-side comparisons of Brett Kavanaugh and the justice he will be succeeding, Anthony Kennedy. What part of Justice Kennedy\u2019s 30-year legacy will he embrace? What part will he repudiate?I\u2019d like to shift the field of vision and consider the impact of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s arrival on the eight other justices \u2014 on the dynamic of the Supreme Court as a whole. Justice Byron White, who saw 13 new justices take their seats during his own 31-year tenure, once remarked that every time a new justice joins the court, \u201cit\u2019s a different court.\u201dOn one level, that\u2019s a truism: In a group of people as small as nine, it\u2019s hardly a surprise that the departure of one and arrival of another would alter some established patterns, even beyond a measurable shift in the group\u2019s ideological midpoint. But it seems to me that Justice Kennedy\u2019s departure and his replacement by a justice reliably to his right could well be transformative, and not just because the right to abortion may lose its tenuous hold or because the sun may finally set on affirmative action.\u201cTransformative\u201d is a strong word. But consider the sustained impact that Justice Kennedy\u2019s position in the center of the court had on colleagues both to his left and to his right. An odd-numbered court always has a center, of course, a \u201cmedian justice,\u201d in the language of political science. But Justice Kennedy was not just any median justice, and the court during the 12 years that he occupied that position after Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s retirement was not a typical Supreme Court.People may assume that the court has usually displayed some version of 4+4+Kennedy, but that\u2019s not the case. The current extreme polarization, with most important issues resolved by votes of 5 to 4 and one justice in a position to determine the course of constitutional law, is a historic anomaly. When I started covering the court in the late 1970s, there were three or four justices clustered at the center to whom lawyers presenting their cases had to make their pitch. (Pop quiz: What was the vote in Roe v. Wade? Answer: 7 to 2.) Number-crunching no doubt could identify one or another of this group as the median justice during a given term, but in the absence of today\u2019s polarization, the designation had far less significance than it has attained.I guess I see the logic of Justices Breyer and Kagan bolstering Justice Kennedy and providing some insulation for him from Justices Gorsuch and Thomas, who indicated in concurring opinions that they would have ruled for the baker on more far-reaching grounds, not dependent on the supposed facts of this particular case. But did Justices Breyer and Kagan really think the multipart, multi-actor proceedings were so \u201cinfected by religious hostility\u201d that the business owner who discriminated against a gay couple was actually himself the victim of discrimination? Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in a dissenting opinion that Justice Sotomayor joined, argued convincingly that in no way \u201cdo the comments by one or two members of one of the four decision-making entities considering this case justify reversing the judgment below.\u201d Justices Breyer\u2019s and Kagan\u2019s support didn\u2019t matter in the end anyway: Justice Kennedy had the votes he needed from Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito and Gorsuch, along with a partial concurrence by Justice Thomas. The final vote was 7 to 2.What will the Supreme Court look like when neither side has to walk on eggs to win the favor of the one in the middle? It will be a more conservative court, for sure, and maybe a more honest one. Justices may feel more free to say what they really think, and the public will ultimately judge the result by expressing itself in electoral politics. History does not stop in 2018.This is what Justice Kennedy wrote: \u201cAn anxious world must know that our government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect, so that freedom extends outward, and lasts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The decision to evacuate it comes at the confluence of several separate events.First, the Trump administration has begun a new campaign highlighting Iranian military activity in the region. Second, in Basra in August and September, violent protests by local residents led to the burning of the Iranian consulate and conspiratorial declarations by some Iraqi politicians that American officials had incited the protests.Third, and perhaps most important, the State Department has been internally debating for more than a year whether to shut down the Basra consulate to save money.Basra is in Iraq\u2019s far south, in a region of rich oil fields near the Persian Gulf. The vast majority of the people are Shiite Arabs, and Shiite political parties dominate. Some of those parties, as well as some militias, are supported by Iran, which is majority Shiites.In August and early September, thousands of residents took to the streets of central Basra to call for the Iraqi government to deliver crucial services, including power and clean water. Frequent blackouts take place across the city in the summer months, when the region is sweltering.The Trump administration has sought to highlight Iran\u2019s military activities across the Middle East. It is part of a campaign to contain Iran and justify President Trump\u2019s decision in May to withdraw from the nuclear agreement that the Obama administration forged in 2015 with Iran and world powers.Separately, senior State Department officials have been debating for more than a year whether to close down the Basra consulate, mainly to save money, according to three former State Department officials. The consulate costs at least $200 million to operate each year; some estimates put that number at $350 million.Before he left office in March, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson demanded deep budget cuts from bureaus across the department. As a result, senior officials at its Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs began to consider closing the Basra consulate, the former officials said.The consulate was put under a security review process, which meant that each year officials would assess the security situation to determine whether it was safe to keep it open.The State Department said Friday night that it does not comment on internal deliberations.Andrew Miller, a former State Department official, said that before the current Basra unrest, the debate took place mainly because of budget concerns, though some of the costs were because of the security requirements of the mission.The head of the bureau, David M. Satterfield, and Stuart E. Jones, the former ambassador to Iraq, were in favor of closing the consulate. Thomas A. Shannon Jr., a top department official, and Mr. Davis were among those arguing to keep it open.\u201cFrom a purely informational perspective, closing it would be detrimental to U.S. interests and maintaining contact with people in the community there,\u201d said Mr. Miller, now deputy director for policy at the Project on Middle East Democracy.Advertisement"}

Many species have shown the ability to hold off on an immediate treat \u2014 like a dry corn kernel \u2014 for something tastier later on, like a bit of walnut. Chimpanzees, monkeys and cockatoos, among other species, can defer gratification. But using tokens for trading had not been tried before in birds, Dr. Krasheninnikova said.Here\u2019s how it worked. First the birds, great green macaws, blue-throated macaws, blue-headed macaws and African grey parrots, learned that they could barter tokens for foods of different value \u2014 to the birds, that is. A metal hoop could be traded for a piece of dry corn, the lowest value food, a metal bracket for a medium value sunflower seed and a plastic ring for the highest value food, a piece of shelled walnut. The birds were then offered various choices, like a piece of corn or the ring. They all reliably chose to forgo the corn and take the ring. Then they were able to trade the ring for a piece of walnut.They also did well choosing a bracket instead of the corn, and in other situations where the token was of higher value than the food. The green macaws were consistently the best. The African greys, who have a reputation as very intelligent birds, did reasonably well on the obvious choices, but had some trouble when faced with a food and a token of the same value.The right move, according to the experimenters, was to take the immediate reward of food. But the African greys, one in particular, often took the token. So instead of an immediate walnut it would get the ring and then trade it for a walnut. Why take the extra step?So maybe, those birds were making the right choice after all. They would get a moment to hold the ring, and still get the walnut in the end. After all, it was the humans who decided that it was better to get the food right away, not the parrots.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Zuckerberg Asserted Control, Instagram\u2019s Founders Chafed", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In a companywide meeting earlier this year, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if Instagram could have hit one billion users if it had not been bought by Facebook.Probably not, he said. At least, not as quickly.But at a later meeting a mile or so down the road at Instagram\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., a few streets, interestingly enough, off a thoroughfare called Independence Drive, the popular photo-sharing app\u2019s co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, had a slightly different answer to that question.Perhaps. Eventually.No one thing led to their decision to part ways with Facebook, which acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. But little things added up over time: disagreements over tweaks to their product, staffing changes and how over the last year Mr. Zuckerberg asserted more control over their business, which had essentially operated independently inside Facebook.Within the last few months, they had decided it was time to leave, according to a dozen current and former Instagram and Facebook employees, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company.Instagram seemed to avoid that turmoil. It was still growing fast, while Facebook\u2019s user count had stalled in the United States and Europe. It was wildly popular with younger people, while Facebook was decidedly not. And to outsiders, Instagram\u2019s founders appeared to be working well with Mr. Zuckerberg, unlike the founders of Facebook\u2019s other big acquisitions, WhatsApp and Oculus.But inside the company, there was tension. Mr. Zuckerberg viewed Instagram as one of a \u201cfamily of apps,\u201d several properties under the Facebook umbrella that he thought should work more closely together, according to two people with knowledge of his thinking.The Instagram founders thought Facebook\u2019s increasing interest in shaping Instagram\u2019s product direction and growth was overbearing, according to several people familiar with their thinking. They were accustomed to autonomy, and they were chafing at losing it.Facebook declined to comment on their departure.Instagram began as an accident of sorts. It was spun out of an app called Burbn that Mr. Systrom had created in 2010. It was supposed to help friends find one another online.As smartphones became more popular, Mr. Systrom and his new partner, Mr. Krieger, shifted their focus to the smartphone camera. Burbn was rereleased as Instagram, and the new app was a hit. So much so that the tiny company struggled to keep up with demand and keep their servers online.In 2012, Mr. Zuckerberg announced he had purchased Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock. It was a shocking move \u2014 a lot of money for a software app with little more than a handful of employees and about 30 million users. The timing, shortly before Facebook\u2019s initial public offering, made investors worry that Mr. Zuckerberg was too loose with his company\u2019s money.Today, some analysts estimate Instagram would be worth $100 billion if it were an independent company.Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger were allowed to make many of their own product decisions. The relationship between parent company and fast-growing unit was held as a model for how acquisitions of start-ups should work. When courting other possible acquisitions, Facebook executives often mentioned how well things had worked out with Instagram.In June, the photo-sharing app hit the billion-user mark. Instagram\u2019s advertising business is expected to reach more than $6 billion in revenue in 2018, according to projections from eMarketer, an industry research firm.But Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s views on how to treat his \u201cfamily of apps\u201d \u2014 which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 began to change, according to the two people familiar with his thinking.Mr. Zuckerberg reorganized the top of his management team earlier this year, installing Adam Mosseri as vice president of product at Instagram. Though Mr. Mosseri is liked by Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger, many employees viewed Mr. Mosseri\u2019s promotion as a sign of Mr. Zuckerberg installing a trusted lieutenant in the photo-sharing organization because of his close relationship to Mr. Zuckerberg and other top Facebook executives.Mr. Zuckerberg also put a layer of management between himself and Instagram\u2019s co-founders, asking Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger to report to Chris Cox, Facebook\u2019s chief product officer.As Instagram kept on growing, Mr. Zuckerberg believed there were ways it should help Facebook grow and improve Facebook\u2019s \u201cuser engagement.\u201d That included small tweaks, like automatically sharing Instagram \u201cStories\u201d videos to Facebook without clear signs indicating the videos were taken on Instagram.Earlier this year, Facebook also removed a shortcut link to Instagram from its \u201cbookmarks\u201d menu inside the Facebook app, a small but significant source of traffic that flowed from Facebook to Instagram.As the relationship began to sour, Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger over the last few months openly disagreed with their Facebook counterparts in meetings. The relationship was still courteous. But employees were surprised when Mr. Krieger, an affable, widely liked figure inside the company, voiced his clear dissent against Facebook leadership in meetings and on company message boards, according to four current and former employees.After years of leaving WhatsApp untouched and independent, Mr. Zuckerberg was insistent that the free service start making money. Mr. Koum balked.Inside Instagram, many believed Mr. Mosseri, who is likely to be its next chief executive, was installed in the anticipation that the relationship between the two sides could fall apart.And their departure, despite its suddenness, does require some perspective. Both Instagram founders stayed on for six years after being acquired \u2014 much longer than entrepreneurs usually do after selling their company and long after they had received their full payout in stock. They said they planned to take time off before embarking on another venture together.In the meeting where the Instagram co-founders were asked if they could have hit one billion users without Facebook\u2019s backing, they acknowledged Facebook\u2019s vast resources helped. A lot. But, they added, Instagram also had a lot to do with its own success.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s time to test that proposition by bringing an indictment that can be reviewed by the Supreme Court.Mr. Avenatti is the lawyer for Stormy Daniels in her lawsuits against President Trump and his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.The grand jury system has been employed in hundreds of thousands of cases involving all manner of crimes committed by all manner of people. All, that is, except one: the president. No grand jury has ever indicted a president, and consequently no court, let alone the Supreme Court, has ruled on the critical question of whether the Constitution allows a president to be indicted while in office. Legal scholars have opined on both sides of the issue, and Department of Justice attorneys have drafted memorandums arguing against indicting a sitting president. But none of these analyses establish definitive rules of law. It is time to clarify the issue. Provided there is sufficient evidence to support an indictment of President Trump \u2014 and there are many indications that there is \u2014 the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, and prosecutors from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, who are investigating payments to my client, Stormy Daniels, and Karen McDougal, should present their evidence to grand juries. Those jurors, citizens of our communities, should then determine whether the evidence supports an indictment of Mr. Trump. The fact that Mr. Trump is a sitting president should not derail a process that applies to all Americans, regardless of stature or station. He would still have the post-indictment relief available to all citizens, including the ability to challenge the constitutionality of the indictment. Some also argue that indicting the president would critically impair his ability to lead the country. But this is a White House already engulfed in chaos and daily distractions. And if the House were to initiate impeachment proceedings, it is hard to see how that process would be any less distracting than a criminal indictment. But however well intentioned and instructive those memorandums and analyses might be, they do not begin to approach the weight of an actual Supreme Court decision. Our democracy and our belief in the rule of law for all, including presidents, should not rest on such a soft foundation.Instead, if the facts and evidence are adequate for indictment, then prosecutors must be blind to the officeholder\u2019s position \u2014 especially so in this case because, unlike in President Clinton\u2019s case, the investigations relate to how Mr. Trump won the election. Ultimately, the question would almost certainly be decided by a panel of judges previously confirmed pursuant to the Constitution \u2014 either in the courts of appeals or, more appropriately, the Supreme Court.Should Mr. Trump be indicted and in the event that the case reaches the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s recusal should be mandatory. The American public\u2019s view of impartiality of the rule of law and of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.Michael Avenatti is the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in her lawsuits against President Trump and his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Having Trouble Finishing This Headline? Then This Article Is for You.", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySelf-HelpedFirst, some math. If Chris Bailey\u2019s new book, \u201cHyperfocus: How to be More Productive in a World of Distraction,\u201d is 215 pages long, and I can read 40 pages per hour, how long should it have taken me to read the book? Answer: A weekend. Reality: three weeks.It\u2019s not Mr. Bailey\u2019s fault. He\u2019s written an engaging book about how managing your attention can make you more productive, but every time I tried to sit down and read, I was pulled in a different direction, mostly by way of my phone: Instagram, email, more email, Facebook, WhatsApp; sometimes, I just scrolled from screen to screen aimlessly. When Mr. Bailey was writing this book, he may as well have pinned my photo above his desk and labeled it \u201cmy audience.\u201d\u201cHyperfocus\u201d teaches readers to control their limited capacity to focus on and process things in the moment, which he calls our \u201cattentional space.\u201d It turns out our brain\u2019s scratchpad is pretty small and can only hold a handful of tasks at a time. When one of those tasks is complex \u2014 like putting together a business proposal or taking care of a toddler \u2014 that number dwindles down to one or two.The problem is that our brains are predisposed toward distraction, wandering for an average of 47 percent of the day, writes Mr. Bailey. And those of us who sit in front of a computer, an endless source of novelty, typically work for only 40 seconds before being distracted or interrupted. As a result, our attentional space is constantly filled, which slows down our work.I always thought my brain\u2019s resistance to concentration was a character flaw I needed to learn to work around. \u201cHyperfocus\u201d helped me recognize the limits of my attentional space and make my environment more conducive to focus.Mr. Bailey splits his book into two sections: one on hyperfocus, which is the state of devoting all your attention to one complex task, and the other on scatterfocus, intentionally allowing your mind to wander in order to connect ideas, plan for the future and recharge. While hyperfocus is key to productivity, scatterfocus supports creativity.Mr. Bailey teaches how to re-examine your tasks, determine your priorities and minimize interruptions. Our most insidious distractions are self-perpetuated; they are the personal concerns nagging at us throughout the day or the too frequent reaches for our phones. Addressing this, Mr. Bailey invokes David Allen\u2019s \u201cGetting Things Done,\u201d a productivity book published in the early aughts that introduced a time management method based on the notion that our brains are designed to come up with ideas, not hold them. Mr. Allen calls these unresolved thoughts, projects or tasks \u201copen loops,\u201d and Mr. Bailey argues that they gnaw away at our attention.\u201cWhen you capture the tasks, projects and other commitments on your plate, you\u2019re able to stop thinking about them and focus on your other work,\u201d writes Mr. Bailey. Once you\u2019ve written all the thoughts that are distracting you, he gives recommendations for changing your environment or habits to tame distractions ahead of time, like putting your phone on airplane mode or blocking the sites where you tend to waste time.\u201cWhen our intention is to focus, daydreaming can destroy our productivity. But daydreaming is immensely potent when our intention is to solve problems, think more creatively, brainstorm new ideas or recharge,\u201d writes Mr. Bailey.The gag is that it needs to be \u201cdeployed on purpose.\u201d When I started the second part of the book, I excitedly placed exclamation points next to all the examples of places your mind could go if it was left to do its own thing. It could slip \u201cinto a pattern of ruminating on the stupid things we\u2019ve said,\u201d (Yes); \u201cfantasize about how great we\u2019d feel if we had come up with a witty retort to something said earlier,\u201d (That\u2019s me!); and also harp on \u201cworries about work and money\u201d (O.K., now this feels like a personal attack).The point is: My mind was already inclined toward scatterfocus, but I wasn\u2019t using it strategically. In filling my attentional space with lingering thoughts and low-priority tasks, I was leaving little room for deep concentration.As I read \u201cHyperfocus,\u201d I visualized my attentional space; my thoughts were silver specks inside a walnut-sized circle. They began to feel more malleable and movable.One day during lunch, I left my phone on my desk at work and went out for a walk, my copy of \u201cHyperfocus\u201d in tow. Maybe physical distance from my phone would make it easier to power through the book. I walked several blocks to a pizza place adjacent to a plaza near my office. On the way, my brain did mental cartwheels, landing on a dozen different thoughts or tasks: \u201cremember to text Lia\u201d; the lyrics to \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman\u201d; a pang of regret over leaving my cellphone, another and another; random bits of prose (\u201cher hair spiraling in unplanned directions\u201d); and these very sentences. I wrote all my lingering distractions, my open loops, into the margins of the book (seriously, this line is on page 135), and so when I sat down in the plaza, there was nothing to pull me away.Don\u2019t get me wrong: Later, I lost track of my attention a few times and then got sucked into a family group chat. I\u2019m a working draft! But I\u2019ve learned to check in with myself more and catch my mind when I feel it spiraling. Knowing that my brain can only process one complicated task at a time takes off the pressure to multitask and fit as much as possible into each moment.Concepci\u00f3n de Le\u00f3n is the digital staff writer for the Books desk at The Times.Self-Helped is a monthly column devoted to the books that have changed the way we live.Advertisement"}

And it must be stated that Republicans have zero space to complain because of the way they blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland.If Trump was truly interested in finding out the truth of these allegations, he could have ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into their veracity as soon as he heard about them.

{"Headline": "How Trump Betrays \u2018Forgotten\u2019 Americans", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the Supreme Court to labor organizing rules, the president undermines workers\u2019 greatest champions.Mr. Greenhouse is a former labor and workplace reporter for the Times.Donald Trump promotes himself as a friend of \u201cforgotten\u201d workers, but in ways large and small his administration has undermined what has traditionally been the biggest champion of workers: labor unions. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has installed a conservative majority on the National Labor Relations Board that has moved quickly to make it harder for unions to organize. Last December, the board overturned a rule, beloved by unions, that made it easier to organize smaller units of workers in big factories and stores. In another board decision, his appointees made it tougher for workers at fast-food restaurants and other franchised operations to unionize, although that \u201cjoint employer\u201d ruling was vacated when a labor board member later recused himself because of a conflict of interest. The board is also looking to slow down unionization elections, a move that unions oppose because it would give corporations more time to pressure workers to vote against unionizing. Mr. Trump\u2019s first nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, was the deciding vote in a case that delivered this year\u2019s biggest blow to workers. In Janus v. AFSCME, the court\u2019s conservative majority, in a 5-to-4 vote, ruled in June that government employees can\u2019t be required to pay any fees to the unions that bargain for them. By allowing many government workers to become \u201cfree riders,\u201d that ruling is expected to chop revenues to many public employee unions by one-tenth to one-third. With private-sector unions badly weakened by factory shutdowns and corporate resistance to unions, government employee unions have become the most powerful part of the labor movement. That\u2019s one reason anti-union billionaires and foundations underwrote the Janus litigation: to hobble the strongest part of labor. The Koch brothers and other billionaires have seized on Janus to finance efforts, through emails and door-to-door canvassing, to urge government workers \u2014 teachers, police, firefighters, social workers and many others \u2014 to quit their unions and stop paying union fees. It doesn\u2019t look as if Mr. Trump\u2019s latest nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, will be a friend to workers or unions. In an astonishingly anti-worker opinion in a case involving a SeaWorld trainer killed by an orca whale, Mr. Kavanaugh wrote in 2014 that the Labor Department was wrong to fine SeaWorld. Dissenting in a 2-to-1 case, he suggested that the Labor Department should not \u201cpaternalistically\u201d regulate the safety of SeaWorld\u2019s trainers because they, like tiger tamers and bull riders, were sports and entertainment figures who accepted the risk of injury in hazardous businesses that usually regulated their own dangers. His opinion had echoes of 19th-century state court rulings that factory workers assumed the risk of injuries from machinery that cut off their hands.Labor unions might get a boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to increase coal, steel and aluminum production and from his push to renegotiate Nafta to spur domestic auto production. The Trump administration and many unions hope those moves will bring back tens of thousands of mining and manufacturing jobs. That could lift unions\u2019 ranks, but those gains would be a fraction of the losses expected from Janus. Some experts estimate that more than a million workers will quit their unions over the next few years as a result of that ruling. Steven Greenhouse was a labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times for 19 years. He is writing a book about the history and future of the American labor movement.Advertisement"}

She believed this would cut down on conflict. The summer of this road trip, I had just finished my junior year of high school and I was slowly coming to the realization, at a later stage than most, that I was separate from my family. The coming year would be the first one when I was the only sibling at home \u2014 a terrifying prospect for a family as close as ours. Even though my oldest sister was in her early 20s, we all still spent weekends together, as we had since we were children. Every Saturday morning, my mother, Kerri and I drove to Kirsten\u2019s apartment so that we could all run errands together. It was a glorious place to be, with a language all its own. A single word \u2014 \u201cmango,\u201d \u201cdonkey\u201d \u2014 said with the correct inflection could make us all dissolve into hysterical laughter, until someone would finally gulp for air, to tell the origin story of the special word, even though we had all been there when the word gained its significance, because back then there was not any part of our memories or existence in which we did not exist apart from one another.This was a fantasy, of course. Even in the confines of the car, I understood that the idea that we all had the same memories, the same stories of childhood, was less an objective truth and more a desperate wish for cohesion. The four of us had just lived through my parents\u2019 traumatic divorce, were still in the midst of a protracted custody battle and in the previous years had gone from a black-bourgeois life to living on public assistance. Amid all that change, it was a point of survival to constantly remind ourselves that our memories and experiences, at least, were all the same. We could laugh at the same things.But this road trip was something else. In the morning, I would sit across from my sister as she painstakingly ate her full breakfast. At night, I lay back in the muddied, grayish pools of highway budget hotels and stared at the ceiling or sky and thought about what it meant for my oldest sister to leave, for my middle sister to go on to college, for me to stay behind at home.The trip broke apart early on, though, when we reached upstate New York. Our U-Haul became ensnared in a miles-long traffic jam. We kept trying to get off and check into a hotel to avoid the worst of it, but every hotel for miles around was booked. \u201cIf we can just make it to Schenectady,\u201d my mother said.\u201cSchenectady?\u201d\u201cSchenectady!\u201d\u201cIs that the sign for Schenectady?\u201dThis was a refrain for what felt like miles until I yelled, from the back jumper seat. \u201cStop saying Schenectady!\u201dThere was a shocked, stunned silence. And then, worse. Peals of laughter.\u201cYou don\u2019t like that word?\u201d\u201cKaitlyn doesn\u2019t like that word?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about Schenectady?\u201dI can only remember the intense fury at this whole exchange. My cheeks burned, tears sprang to my eyes. \u201cStop, stop,\u201d was all I could say, but of course, this only made everyone laugh harder.It\u2019s a strange, hard thing to pull away from family, to create yourself, and still try to stay close to them. I\u2019m still not sure how to do it. The answer I came up with in my late teens and 20s was to pull away completely, to move to another city, to make friends with people they would never meet, to date men they would never see. But that only results in a false self, one that is as shaky and unknown as the stunted self that comes from sublimating your desires for those of your family.This summer, I took another road trip with my sisters, again to upstate New York. As the signs approached, my middle sister began to smile.\u201cRemember Schenectady?\u201d she said, already laughing.\u201cOf course.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is a New Russian Meddling Tactic Hiding in Plain Sight?", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo an untrained eye, USAReally might look like any other fledgling news organization vying for attention in a crowded media landscape. Its website publishes a steady stream of stories on hot-button political issues like race, immigration and income inequality. It has reader polls, a video section and a daily podcast.Caught flat-footed by the influence campaigns of 2016, intelligence agencies and tech companies in the United States have spent months looking for hidden Russian footprints ahead of the midterm elections.USAReally\u2019s website, which began publishing in May, does not advertise its Russian roots. But in many ways, it is operating in plain sight.Today, USAReally\u2019s website depicts the United States as a democracy in decline, riddled with crime and divided by partisan rancor.Many of the site\u2019s stories are similar to the divisive content that Russian trolls circulated on social media in 2016, down to their conspiratorial tone and telltale grammatical errors. (\u201cRabid Squirrels Is Terrorizing Florida,\u201d read one headline.) Some of its articles appear to have been lifted word for word from legitimate American news websites.\u201cIt\u2019s a very overt operation,\u201d said Lee Foster, an intelligence analysis manager with the cybersecurity firm FireEye. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s an attempt to move this type of activity more into the mainstream, to try to legitimize it as a media entity so that it\u2019s tougher to take action against it.\u201dLast month, in a two-hour interview while traveling in New York, Mr. Malkevich, USAReally\u2019s founder, explained his vision.Red-bearded and combative, Mr. Malkevich wore a T-shirt printed with an image of cartoon spies, accompanied by a Russian sentence that translates as \u201cthe motherland is listening.\u201d Accompanied by a translator but mostly speaking in his own heavily accented English, he peppered his speech with American political catchphrases like \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d and he denied that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election, calling it a paranoid conspiracy theory.\u201cI cannot imagine how several people from Russia or from Australia or from Japan can change the electoral situation in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy do some representatives of a deep state think that Americans are so foolish?\u201dStories from USAReally, a site run from Russia, were posted to Reddit under web addresses that masked where they originated.Vladimir PutinPresident of Russiagives orders toYevgeny PrigozhinRussian oligarch charged with interfering in the 2016 electionwho is believed to control theFederal News AgencyPro-Kremlin media outletwhich sponsoredUSAReallyPro-Russia website run byAlexander Malkevichwhich created content that was routedthrough web addresses likeGEOTUS.armyGEOTUS.bandand then posted tor/the_donaldA popular forum on Redditwhere President Trump isreferred to as the \u201cGod Emperorof the United States.\u201dVladimir PutinPresident of Russiagives orders toYevgeny PrigozhinRussian oligarch charged with interfering in the 2016 electionwho is believed to control theFederal News AgencyPro-Kremlin media outletwhich sponsoredUSAReallyPro-Russia website run byAlexander Malkevichwhich created content that was routedthrough web addresses likeGEOTUS.armyGEOTUS.bandand then posted tor/the_donaldA popular forum on Redditwhere President Trump isreferred to as the \u201cGod Emperorof the United States.\u201dBy The New York TimesBut Mr. Malkevich, who said he had several types of visas that allowed him to enter the United States, denied any connection to the Internet Research Agency. He quoted a Russian proverb \u2014 translated roughly as \u201cthe son is not responsible for his father\u201d \u2014 to distance himself from the group\u2019s 2016 trolling campaigns.\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody from so-called troll farms,\u201d he said.Mr. Malkevich characterized the map as \u201cnormal,\u201d and said it helped the site\u2019s editors focus their work on different states.Spokeswomen from the Justice Department and F.B.I. declined to comment on USAReally.Mr. Malkevich said he aimed to turn USAReally into a kind of digital-first version of RT or Sputnik \u2014 both Russian media organizations that broadcast pro-Kremlin views inside the United States \u2014 and a counterweight to organizations funded by the United States, like Radio Free Europe, that broadcast in Russia and other countries.USAReally, by contrast, was quickly banned by both Facebook and Twitter, although it recently opened a second Facebook page. A Twitter spokesman said that USAReally\u2019s account was suspended for violating the site\u2019s rules against spam. A Facebook spokesman said the company had enough evidence that the first page was involved in coordinated inauthentic activity to take action against it. He said the group\u2019s second page was being investigated, and that the company had been aware of the account before being contacted by The New York Times.Despite Mr. Malkevich\u2019s claims, there are hints that USAReally may be drawing from the Internet Research Agency\u2019s playbook, in addition to adopting the more open tactics of RT and Sputnik.In a text message, Mr. Malkevich called the Reddit ban \u201cjust another illustration of censorship in America.\u201d He said he had never heard of the G.E.O.T.U.S. domains, and that USAReally had no need to post its stories to Reddit, given the small amount of traffic it received from the site.Without a presence on major social media networks, it has been difficult for USAReally to build an audience. Mr. Malkevich said USAReally\u2019s website typically receives 5,000 to 10,000 visitors a day, a pittance compared to more established news sites, although several recent posts have received thousands of views apiece.Mr. Malkevich, 43, was born in Leningrad, now called St. Petersburg, and has had a career trajectory similar to other successful post-Soviet media managers. He started in music journalism, spent time in political public relations, then ran a television station in Omsk, Siberia.Recently, he has positioned himself as a champion of freedom of speech. In a column on the Federal News Agency\u2019s website, he wrote that American social media networks were guilty of \u201cselective censorship that Orwell did not dream of.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an easy victim for American media,\u201d Mr. Malkevich said. \u201cYou can showcase this Russian journalist \u2014 he wants to destroy our democracy with his bad English. But I don\u2019t want to destroy. I want to build.\u201dUSAReally has a full-time staff of 15 in Moscow, according to Mr. Malkevich, and a handful of American writers who contribute to the site. One of those writers, Jeffrey K. Silverman, said in a phone interview that USAReally\u2019s Russian origins weren\u2019t a concern. He had previously written for other pro-Kremlin sites, and when he learned that USAReally was looking for American writers, he volunteered. The site paid him $50 to $100 for each of his articles, he said, and didn\u2019t instruct him to cover particular subjects or parrot a party line.\u201cWhenever I write for anything Russian, they don\u2019t censor me,\u201d Mr. Silverman said. \u201cIf I write for American publications, I get censored.\u201dUnlike the Russian trolls of 2016, who posed as Black Lives Matter activists, pro-gun Republicans and other American groups, many of USAReally\u2019s writers use their real names. Several of them also write for a variety of other pro-Kremlin media outlets and think tanks.\u201cThere\u2019s a wide-ranging collection of Russian propaganda sites online that are connected,\u201d said Renee DiResta, the head of research at New Knowledge, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in disinformation networks. \u201cUSAReally has drawn from many of them to create a site that appears to be using the less-academic style of I.R.A. content to reach a much broader American audience.\u201dWhen not recruiting writers, Mr. Malkevich has been busy touring America, conducting interviews and posting dispatches to a group of supporters on the messaging app Telegram.In New York, he posed for a photo in front of Trump Tower, then stopped at a bookstore, where he filled a shelf with books about Russian collusion, took a photo and posted it to his followers, mocking what he sees as a conspiracy-obsessed American public.With a smirk, Mr. Malkevich said that despite the bleak vision of America that his website paints, he was not interested in sowing discord and division.\u201cI am interested in cooperation and friendship between our two great countries,\u201d he said.Graphic by Keith Collins.

Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Despite being doused by floods of vitriol, Mr. Bannon rose days later like some particularly insistent zombie to talk with reporters about \u201cAmerican Dharma,\u201d a new documentary about him by the filmmaker Errol Morris. No surprise, Mr. Morris, who did 16 hours of interviews over three days with Mr. Bannon, was soon receiving the same criticism Mr. Remnick had gotten. How could he give someone whom many see as a white nationalist a platform that legitimizes and normalizes him?\u201cThe first job of journalism is to investigate,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be pundits in a room saying things that they all agree with.\u201dI might as well be plain because no one who likes me or what I do is going to like this: Mr. Morris is right, and I would do the exact same thing.I felt that our audience could benefit from seeing Mr. Bannon questioned in a pretty tough stage interview. The denizens of Silicon Valley live in a bubble, which Mr. Bannon\u2019s acid theories would surely penetrate.In the end, we never invited him for one simple reason: He had been hip-checked out of the administration (we had Linda McMahon, the head of the Small Business Administration, instead). But had we proceeded, I was well aware of the anger we would have faced. The objections are substantive and deserve to be taken seriously. They include: that he\u2019s a liar, and you cannot interview a liar who is only playing you; that he is a racist and a Nazi \u2014 or at least affiliates with racists and Nazis \u2014 and deserves no place on any stage; that mainstream journalists, especially white ones, do not grok the harm Mr. Bannon does to people of color and are talking to him simply for the ego gratification of maybe being the one to finally break him; and, perhaps most important, that we would have been giving him a space that could have been occupied by those too often ignored by the media. Many made these points in response to my tweet. While some more delicate media figures whine about out-of-control Twitter mobs, I actually think most social media mobs serve an important role these days. They make journalists think hard about their choices and their words. If you write or say something controversial or more likely dumb, you should not be surprised, aggrieved or sanctimonious if a lot of people on social media tell you you\u2019re an idiot. As soul-sapping as it can be, we need to suck it up and take it. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to back down, as Mr. Remnick did. I still want to interview Mr. Bannon. Coincidentally, just before the New Yorker debacle, I had emailed him asking him to come on my podcast, largely because a lot of what he had previously said about tech was now emerging from the mouth of Mr. Trump. Mr. Bannon\u2019s squeal has a real-world impact, and we can\u2019t make him go away by not looking at him. In that vein, Mr. Morris added one more thing to his explanation about why he went ahead with the Bannon documentary, despite the wrenching compromises he was making: \u201cIf I\u2019ve done anything to help us understand who he is \u2014 I don\u2019t want to go overboard here, but I think it\u2019s an important service. It\u2019s part of what journalism should be doing.\u201dWhat he said. Oink.Advertisement"}

This seemed like a long shot given Mr. Trump\u2019s positions and his close association with some of Israel\u2019s most extreme American supporters. Still, we Palestinians wanted to give this effort a chance.One of my first tasks was preparing for a visit in May by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. My team and I began to meet with officials at the White House, the State Department and Congress. We also held encouraging meetings with universities, churches, think tanks and the news media, in which I saw how American opinions are changing on the Palestinian struggle for freedom and independence.At the same time, my family began to get used to our new home. My son, Saeed, then 6, and my 5-year-old daughter, Alma, began school. My wife, Suzan, who trained as a biomedical scientist, took time off as our children adjusted to their new life and I started my demanding job. In no time, we all made many wonderful American friends. It was a hopeful new beginning.We are in the middle of a political and diplomatic crisis. I resent, of course, the toll this is taking on my family. But as a diplomat, I can see the upside. This situation presents three strategic opportunities.Third, this crisis will help redirect Palestinian attention away from just high-level American officials and toward an equally, if not more, important investment: long-term engagement directly with the American people. American public opinion, especially among young people, is shifting toward supporting peace and Palestinian rights.Peace is never about extortion, coercion or blackmail. It is about vision, leadership, trust and investment. The Trump administration lacks all of those. In seeking liberation from the Israeli occupation, which steals our land and denies us our most basic human rights, we are demanding no more than what Americans would demand for themselves: freedom, liberty and equality.I\u2019m not sure when I will be back in the United States. I\u2019ll miss all of the great people I met there. But even in my short time there, it was clear that there is much hope for peace and justice. I am confident the United States will one day restore commitment to the legitimate rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people. I hope that day will come soon.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After 7 Deployments and 6 Bronze Stars, Killed by an Afghan Ally", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommand Sgt. Maj. Timothy A. Bolyard did not wear all his body armor on Monday for a routine meeting with Afghan troops at a base outside Kabul. He was an experienced Army leader among allies. It was a customary gesture of trust and respect.But in a smoldering war where closure has proved elusive, even years after American combat operations officially ended, that gesture of friendship was his last.The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the specific motive for the attack was not yet clear, but that tensions had been simmering between American and Afghan troops in the region since an airstrike in August, which the Afghans say killed more than a dozen Afghan police officers.After the shooting on Monday, American advisers in the area went on lockdown, the official said. The Army said the episode was under investigation.The sergeant major\u2019s death was the latest in a long string of what are called green-on-blue killings of coalition soldiers by their Afghan allies. It ended a 24-year Army career that spanned the entire history of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Sergeant Major Bolyard, 42, was deployed to combat zones seven times. He drove over the desert berm that marked the Kuwait-Iraq border during the invasion of Iraq in 2003 for what Pentagon planners had said would be a short and relatively tidy liberation, and he stayed through repeated extensions of that mission as lawlessness ignited into insurgency in Iraq. He went back again to lead soldiers through the bloodiest months of sectarian fighting around Baghdad in 2006, and helped forge the calm that emerged in Iraq, at least for a few years, at the end of the American occupation, when bombings subsided, markets reopened and families returned to shattered neighborhoods.\u201cThis man\u2019s career was this war \u2014 he was the boots on the ground in nearly every stage of this effort,\u201d said Nathan Metcalf, who served with Sergeant Major Bolyard in Iraq.Comrades called him Sergeant Bull. He earned six Bronze Stars, including two for valor in combat. Roadside bombs, firefights, mortar shells whistling down in the night \u2014 men he fought with say he faced them with a generous wad of tobacco in his cheek and a laconic confidence they found contagious.Tim Bolyard grew up on a quiet country road in the West Virginia hills, and joined the Army right after high school in 1994. He liked fishing. He liked Metallica. And he liked the Army. As he rose through the enlisted ranks, he read widely and took classes toward a college degree, according to Adam Tymensky, who served with Sergeant Major Bolyard on two deployments to Iraq.\u201cHe was constantly trying to learn, always wanting to better himself,\u201d Mr. Tymensky said. \u201cHe never cut corners.\u201dThe meandering strategies of wars that have dragged on for a generation were Sergeant Major Bolyard\u2019s to execute. For much of his adult life, his home was a simple military cot with a photo of his son taped to the wall.During the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Tymensky said, their scout platoon would often go days without rest: providing security for the battalion commander during the day, and raiding houses at night to search for insurgent fighters. \u201cWe\u2019d be dead tired, but if someone needed something, he was right back up again,\u201d he said.Combat experience made the sergeant major a demanding leader. He rarely raised his voice, men who served under him said, but he pushed them hard to be ready for the worst.On one training exercise in 2007, he had his troops run through the hills outside Fort Carson, Colo., taking turns carrying loaded stretchers.\u201cIt was brutal,\u201d said Mr. Metcalf, who shared a stretcher with the sergeant major. \u201cBut he had been in combat, and knew this training would pay off.\u201dIn combat zones, he found time to dress as Santa and hand out gifts, and to grill holiday steaks for his soldiers.Repeated deployments left a long list of birthdays missed and anniversaries apart. His marriage ended in divorce. Even so, his son, Preston Bolyard, 20, thanked him in a Facebook post for managing to be a \u201cgreat father, husband, and friend to many people.\u201d\u201cMy dad is definitely my hero,\u201d he wrote.Sergeant Major Bolyard died on what was likely to be his last deployment before retirement. Though the United States officially ended combat operations in Afghanistan nearly four years ago, the Army still has some 15,000 troops in the country. Many of them are doing what the sergeant major was sent to do: help train Afghan forces and pave the way for an eventual American pullout from what veterans of the conflict have come to call \u201cthe forever war.\u201dHe was sent to Forward Operating Base Shank, a small base that had been shuttered in 2014 only to be reopened in recent months, along with some other abandoned posts, as American advisers shifted their activities closer to the front lines.Sergeant Major Bolyard was the 154th member of the American-led coalition to be killed by an insider attack, according to an Army document. The frequency of those attacks reached a peak in 2012, accounting for roughly 15 percent of coalition deaths that year, and then dwindled as Western troops withdrew. There were four insider attacks in 2017, and there have been two so far this year. Significant numbers of heavily armed troops are assigned to try to protect trainers like the sergeant major against threats from their allies.As news of the sergeant major\u2019s death circulated through his network of Army friends on Facebook, there was little talk of strategy or mission; the focus of most comments was on a man they loved and respected who gave his all, even though his efforts could sometimes be swallowed up and forgotten in the \u201cforever war.\u201d\u201cWhen I first saw the news, something slipped out of my mouth,\u201d Mr. Metcalf said. \u201cI said, \u2018He was just killed, and for what?\u2019 And I was ashamed of myself for saying it.\u201d\u201cI know what he died for,\u201d Mr. Metcalf continued. \u201cHe died because he really did believe in protecting innocence and looking for the bad guys.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alex Jones Said Bans Would Strengthen Him. He Was Wrong.", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe more I\u2019m persecuted, the stronger I get,\u201d Mr. Jones said on his live internet broadcast three days later. \u201cIt backfired.\u201dYet a review of traffic on Infowars several weeks after the bans shows that the tech companies drastically reduced Mr. Jones\u2019s reach by cutting off his primary distribution channels: YouTube and Facebook.In the three weeks before the Aug. 6 bans, Infowars had a daily average of nearly 1.4 million visits to its website and views of videos posted by its main YouTube and Facebook pages, according to a New York Times analysis of data from the web data firms Tubular Labs and SimilarWeb. In the three weeks afterward, its audience fell by roughly half, to about 715,000 site visits and video views, according to the analysis.The analysis did not include traffic to the two-month-old Infowars app or views of videos that Mr. Jones posted on Twitter, where his accounts remain active. He also still shares posts inside private Facebook groups, and his followers repost his content from their social-media accounts. But data suggest that those sources of traffic are smaller than Mr. Jones\u2019s main Facebook and YouTube pages.That Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, muffled one of the internet\u2019s loudest voices so quickly illustrates the tremendous influence a few internet companies have over public discourse and the spread of information.Now that access to Infowars is mainly through its website or app, Mr. Jones\u2019s ability to reach new viewers is severely limited because they will no longer come across his videos while scrolling through Facebook or YouTube, said Monica Stephens, a geography professor at the University at Buffalo who has studied the spread of misinformation online.\u201cThis increases the likelihood Infowars is preaching to a filter bubble versus reaching new audiences,\u201d she said.In an email, he wrote, \u201cSocial justice warriors machinate to get speakers canceled, and social networks purge conservatives, for the same reason: no-platforming works.\u201dNeither Mr. Jones nor Infowars responded to requests for comment.The main Facebook pages for Mr. Jones and Infowars, meanwhile, had drawn 668 million views of their videos over the past three years, according to Tubular Labs.YouTube erased Mr. Jones\u2019s channel for flouting a penalty for a previous punishment for hate speech. YouTube also quietly deleted more than a dozen other channels associated with Infowars for trying to circumvent its rules.Since then, Mr. Jones has made the companies a central theme of his near-daily show. In recent shows broadcast on his website, he has falsely accused YouTube and Facebook of being controlled by the Chinese government and assisting in an elaborate global conspiracy to control the world\u2019s population.\u201cIt is a panopticonic, total internet-of-things-integration, global-social-score, complete command-and-control system,\u201d Mr. Jones said three days after the ban. \u201cIt is the virtual-reality, A.I. weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies blocking Trump\u2019s resistance of the program.\u201dHe added, \u201cI have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information.\u201dMr. Trump has since accelerated his criticism of Silicon Valley and how it surfaces information, alleging that Google doctored search results for his name. Google has denied the claim.For a brief period after the bans, Mr. Jones enjoyed a bump in publicity. Traffic to Infowars.com soared 67 percent to about 777,000 visits a day in the two weeks after the ban, compared with the previous two weeks, SimilarWeb said. Downloads of the Infowars app surged sixfold to 25,500 downloads a day over the same period, according to Apptopia, which tracks app data.But both figures have since fallen to nearly pre-ban levels. And the spike could not replace the lost traffic from the top three Facebook and YouTube channels for Infowars, which together averaged roughly 900,000 video views a day in the three weeks before the ban, according to Tubular Labs.Other outlets have not helped much. Even as Mr. Jones\u2019s account has remained on Twitter, his videos there attract 21,000 views on average, compared with 44,500 views per YouTube video, according to NeoReach, which helps brands market on social media. The Infowars accounts on other sites, such as Dailymotion, Amazon\u2019s Twitch and BitChute, a video site mostly for people barred from YouTube, garner views in the hundreds for videos \u2014 and often fewer.NeoReach said an analysis of Mr. Jones\u2019s followers on social media showed that most were white married men, with an average age of 28 and average annual income of $46,500. NeoReach said his Twitter account \u201chas a notable audience concentration in New York.\u201dDespite Mr. Jones\u2019s early pronouncements that the bans would make his Infowars operation stronger, there are signs he is concerned.On one recent show, he ranted without evidence that Silicon Valley companies gave liberals like the billionaire George Soros access to their users\u2019 personal data, including \u201cyour film roll, what you did with your wife, your kids, you know, in the bathtub, Grandma.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all theirs,\u201d he shouted. \u201cAnd everybody\u2019s lining up to kiss these monsters\u2019 disgusting satanic souls.\u201dSeconds later, the show went to a break, cutting to a recorded promotion in which Mr. Jones urged his followers to share Infowars\u2019 videos on social media and to sign up for its newsletter \u201cso there\u2019s no way the censors can get between us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Dorsey \u2014 who sported a nose ring, a popped-collar shirt and a craggy Moses beard \u2014 looked more like a hipster version of a Civil War officer than a tech icon. Yet more striking than his look was his manner before skeptical lawmakers.Faced with tough questions, Mr. Dorsey did not mount an aggressive defense of his company and his technology, as an earlier generation of tech leader might have. Instead, he demurred, conceded mistakes and generally engaged in a nuanced and seemingly heartfelt colloquy on the difficulties of managing tech in a complex world. Even in response to Mr. Barton\u2019s comment about his look, Mr. Dorsey was solicitous. \u201cMy mom agrees with you,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony prompted questions about what we expect from tech leaders today \u2014 and how thoroughly what we expect has been upturned in the last few years. Since the 1980s, a common leadership archetype has loomed over the tech business: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Sometimes unconsciously and often deliberately, a generation of tech leaders attempted to ape the Apple and Microsoft founders\u2019 charisma, their quirks, their style and above all their irrepressible, hard-charging confidence, to say nothing of arrogance.That is, Mr. Dorsey sounded less like a quotable visionary who can see beyond the horizon and more like what he actually is and ought to be \u2014 a thoughtful, accessible, transparent and, despite the beard and nose ring, kind of boring manager of a serious company whose decisions have world-changing consequences.When it comes to tech C.E.O.s, boring is the new black. Under the glare of global scrutiny, the daring, win-at-all-costs ethos that defined so much of the tech industry in the last couple of decades has been undergoing a thorough metamorphosis.Google once played up the nerdy antics of its founders, but now the company\u2019s leaders are almost unidentifiable ciphers. Larry Page, who runs Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has become a recluse, and even Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s achingly pleasant chief, declined to appear at last week\u2019s hearings.Oh, and I almost forgot about Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O. In my defense, everyone forgets about Mr. Nadella.\u201cA start-up that has five million people using it \u2014 that\u2019s small for Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s a tremendous number of people, and so even they have a large amount of responsibility in the world,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.The tech press has also gotten tougher. Once, novelty alone would merit coverage, but in the social media age, even the tiniest misstep can be ruinous. It has become crucial to get a leader who doesn\u2019t speak out of turn.Mr. Musk\u2019s odd behavior underlines the tensions at play as understated style takes over tech. There is a reason that a big, Jobsian personality was once so prized. Tech companies are leaps of faith. In their early days they exist on the knife edge of oblivion, and it is often only through a founder\u2019s force of personality that investors, employees and the media take any notice. The most beloved founders possess an uncanny genius for selling the world on ideas that look useless, pointless or impossible before we all realize we can never live without them.Though he has made good on only some of those points \u2014 Tesla is now struggling to fulfill orders for the Model 3, the \u201ceven more affordable\u201d car in the plan \u2014 posting the plan was part of an impish ploy to generate publicity for what looked like an outlandish idea. That ploy worked; ever since, Mr. Musk has leveraged his growing celebrity as if it were a currency.Every few months, he makes new promises about this or that amazing thing coming soon. Each time, he reaps more attention and financing and, eventually, builds real cars that are sold to real people. In this way, Mr. Musk\u2019s personality became a key element of not just his companies\u2019 brands, but their business models.But it\u2019s a tricky, high-stakes gamble. For one thing, Mr. Musk has to deliver on his promises. More recently, another problem has eaten at this strategy: The future has been getting less obviously wonderful, so it\u2019s hard to take any tech chief\u2019s assurances that their new thing will indeed be as great for the world as they say.\u201cI tried to convince people to slow down A.I.,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cThis was futile. I tried for many years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.\u201dThus, the tension: On one hand, Mr. Musk wants us to believe that everything he\u2019s building is going to turn out wonderfully. On the other, he\u2019s telling us to be very scared. This sounds like a contradiction, but in its admission of doubt and complexity, it\u2019s actually a pretty good picture of the future.No wonder he sounds crazy. No wonder everyone else is going for boring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Avalanche of Japanese Shave Ice", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPastry chefs in the United States are exploring the countless possibilities of kakigori, a traditional dessert that\u2019s both exacting and amenable to interpretation. Before Norie Uematsu became a pastry chef, she waited all year for shave-ice season at home in Japan. Now, she decides when that season begins and ends.All kakigori starts with a block of plain ice. A machine locks the ice in place and spins it against a blade, shaving off soft, sheer flakes. As the ice piles up, kakigori makers add syrups, pur\u00e9es and other sweet toppings. The dessert is endlessly adaptable, which is one reason so many pastry chefs in the United States are not only adding kakigori to their menus but also extending its season.When prepared with skill, kakigori is a feat of texture \u2014 a tall structure of uniformly light, airy and almost creamy crystals that never crunch, but deliver flavor as they dissolve on the tongue.\u201cTo get it really fluffy, you adjust the angle of the blade,\u201d said Ms. Uematsu, turning an iron knob on her machine. \u201cBut the finer it is, the harder it is to work with.\u201d As the ice melts, or is worn down, the machine must be adjusted to keep the shavings downy.Before the development of freezers, shave ice was an extravagant dessert reserved only for those who could pay for the luxury of ice carved from frozen lakes and mountains and transported at great cost.\u201cIt was this ginormous green spectacle that came on a tray, at least 12 inches tall, and it was very intense,\u201d Ms. Chung recalled. \u201cI was shocked how it kept its shape despite having all this syrup.\u201dShe compared the texture of perfect kakigori to flower petals \u2014 not quite powder and not quite grain \u2014 making it distinct from other kinds of shave ice. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple thing that\u2019s really hard to execute,\u201d Ms. Chung said.Stonemill serves a traditional kakigori, ujikintoki, doused with matcha syrup and finished with a touch of sweet red bean paste. Every day, the restaurant\u2019s pastry chef, Mikiko Yui, makes coffee jelly and soft mochi to garnish it. The cafe will keep the dessert on the menu through early October.Cha-an Teahouse has been serving ujikintoki and other kinds of kakigori in New York for more than a decade. Ms. Uematsu drew from her own experience with the sweet as well as her training as a chef to develop the white peach kakigori made from poached fruit and decorated with chewy, housemade peach gummies, cut into the shapes of stars and hearts.\u201cShe\u2019d go to these kakigori competitions and jams where people would just get together and show off their craft,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, who does not employ a pastry chef and was eager to figure out the technique.He found that the more delicate the shavings, the faster they melted. Kakigori makers often press the ice very gently with their hands, giving it a distinct rounded shape; but if packed too firmly, those soft, feathery crystals can freeze together as hard, wet clumps.Mr. Bellaver freezes 300-pound blocks very slowly, usually over the course of several days, in machines that keep the water constantly agitating so that impurities are pushed to its edges and the ice freezes crystal clear. He cut pieces to fit Majordomo\u2019s electric Taiwanese shave-ice machine, designed for ribbon-style ice.But a common problem with making kakigori is that the ice can crack on contact with the machine, and the pieces become too small to shave. Mr. Johnson ran into this issue early on.When Majordomo opened, citrus was in season in California, so Mr. Johnson layered the ice with pieces of blood orange and grapefruit. Later in the year, inspired by the surrounding Mexican restaurants in Los Angeles, he made horchata kakigori, spooning rice pudding into the bottom of each bowl, and squirting the shaved ice with coffee syrup and a strong cold brew made with horchata. He hid pockets of caramelized sweetened condensed milk and whipped cream in its layers.The kitchen can make only one shave ice at a time, and the dessert has been so popular that Mr. Johnson recently added a message to the menu, warning that kakigori can take about 15 minutes to prepare. Orders haven\u2019t slowed down. Majordomo served strawberry kakigori at the end of summer, and when strawberries disappeared from the market, switched to avocado. If Mr. Johnson keeps updating the dessert, it can stay on the menu all year long, and kakigori season never has to end.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Regime Change or Stalemate?", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Swedish election is a reminder of just how far populism has come, but also how a disliked and weakened center holds.Opinion ColumnistOn Sunday the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing party with roots in fascism, scored their highest share yet of the Swedish parliamentary vote \u2014 and the mandarins of Europe breathed a sigh of relief, because that higher-than-ever share was only 17.6 percent, and there had been fears that the cleaned-up fascists would reach 25 percent instead.That such an outcome, in progressive Sweden of all places, came as a relief rather than a shock is a reminder of just how far populism has come, how much the fringes matter in Western politics and how weak the center has become.That\u2019s the scene in Germany and France, where Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron are isolated between restive rights and left. (Macron, the great centrist hope, has worse approval ratings than Donald Trump.) It\u2019s basically the scene in Britain, where an ineffectual center-right prime minister, Theresa May, is trying to manage the populism of the right, while a populist of the left, Jeremy Corbyn, is locked in combat with a weakened center-left establishment.In a somewhat different way, allowing for our presidentialism and durable two-party system, it\u2019s the scene in the United States. A right-wing populist insurgency appeared to take over the Republican Party under Trump, but it turned out to be ill-equipped to run anything larger than Breitbart News. So the Trump administration has mostly been run, ineffectually, by the discredited establishment that Trump defeated.Meanwhile the left is energized as never in my lifetime, while the center-left seems bankrupt, dazed and paranoid. But the thesis that a populist left can win elections consistently, let alone govern a country that has so far responded to a more ideologically liberal Democratic Party by voting more often for Republicans, has been confirmed only in the imaginations of Jacobin subscribers.The common thread in all of these Western stories is that if you put together all the voters who have given up on the old centrist parties (in Europe) or the old party establishments (in America), you would have the kind of majority upon which political realignments can be made. But because the people rejecting the establishments don\u2019t begin to agree on why or what they want instead, because some of them are voting for Greens or Communists and others for reformed Fascists (or some for Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein and others for Trump), the establishment forces can find a way to hang on to power.Thus you get populist shocks like Brexit and the election of Trump, you get figures like Corbyn or Marine Le Pen or the Sweden Democrats as important political actors \u2026 but then Le Pen gets clobbered in the runoff, Brexit ends up supervised by its former critics, and Trump\u2019s own appointees take to the pages of this newspaper to explain how they aren\u2019t really letting him run his own show. The center is hated, but whether overtly or covertly it finds some ways to hold.The question is how long this situation can last. It might be that the current stalemate is just a transitional phase, a necessary step on the path from one order to another, and that at some point a group of politicians will figure out how to channel populist energy into a program or coalition that can make Western countries governable again.Or, for that matter, the new political regime might turn out to be more socialist in an increasingly multicultural America and more right-wing-nationalist in a mass-migration-troubled Europe, with the continents drifting apart ideologically instead of imitating each other.But all this speculation assumes that the stalemate will end relatively quickly, that with a discredited establishment harassed by not-quite-ready populisms, something has to give. No iron law of history requires that to happen, and all kinds of structural factors in Western societies \u2014 our aging populations, our costly and complicated welfare states, our hysterical media environment, the veto points of the United States Constitution and the dysfunctional pseudo-federalism of the European Union \u2014 converge to make reform and realignment more difficult than in the past.Moreover there are plenty of historical precedents for a situation in which a system stalemates or stagnates for generations, where revolts and reform programs founder again and again, where a disliked or despised elite holds on to power for a long time against divided and chaotic forms of populism.Advertisement"}

Mosquitoes buzz as Samantha Apgar holds aside a tangle of marsh grass, or salt hay, to show me the hidden nest. It\u2019s the size of half a baseball, tucked in under a tangle of grass. The incoming tide is rising over the soles of our boots and the hatchlings won\u2019t stay dry long.Ms. Apgar, a graduate student at the University of Connecticut, is working with Christopher Elphick, an ornithologist there, to record what happens when high tides flood the nests of marsh birds. She has automatic video cameras and is also collaborating with videographers from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, one of whom has his camera trained on this nest and had recorded the hatching of these babies a couple of hours before. She warns me that the outlook for these fragile hatchlings is grim. If they last through the night, they still have five days of increasingly high tides ahead of them until the new moon. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to make it,\u201d Ms. Apgar says.The species, which breeds in coastal marshes from Maine to Virginia, and lives only on the Atlantic Coast, has always been at the mercy of time and tide, nesting between the highest spring tides. But now a sea level rise of a fraction of an inch a year caused by climate change is pushing tides higher and higher, threatening the birds\u2019 survival. Their population has been declining about nine percent a year since the late 1990s. They now number somewhere from 40,000 to 80,000, although overall population estimates are tentative because the birds are not always easy to find. Dr. Elphick and his colleagues recently predicted that they will reach a threshold, when the highest spring tides come too often to allow the birds time to raise their young. \u201cAfter that threshold is crossed,\u201d he says, \u201cthese birds have maybe six years before they\u2019re extinct.\u201d Over just a few years, he said, the situation could change \u201cfrom most birds in the population having a moderate chance of successfully breeding, to most birds having a poor chance of breeding.\u201dThe birds\u2019 precarious existence is one example of the threat to the coastal marshes of the Eastern Seaboard and all the species that depend on them. The end may not come gradually for the species living on the edge. \u201cWe could suddenly lose a lot of stuff very quickly,\u201d Dr. Elphick says. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s scary to those of us who study this stuff. The recognition of how rapidly things can change.\u201dIn the morning, the newly hatched sparrows are gone, drowned in the night\u2019s high tide and the mother sparrow is already looking for fathers for her second brood. She can\u2019t waste time; the tides won\u2019t wait. Those hatchlings drowned on the night of June 10, near the beginning of a nesting season that runs from May through August. Ms. Apgar followed nests at the Connecticut site throughout the season. Of 59 nests found, 40 failed. She knows that 16 were flooded and failed. The others may have, but she doesn\u2019t have the evidence. Four nests produced young that survived at least long enough to leave the nest, and she doesn\u2019t know what happened to the hatchlings in the other 15. This is not research for the faint of heart. \u201cThey get out of the egg and pretty soon after are inundated with cold water and either drown or make it through and fledge,\u201d Ms. Apgar said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard way to be born I think.\u201dDr. Elphick said it is common to come out and find \u201clittle baby chicks drowned everywhere.\u201d But, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s part of their life history. That has happened ever since they\u2019ve been living in marshes, to some extent.\u201dIt is certainly hard to watch the videos that document chicks drowning when the water rises.If the scientists are used to the fragility of sparrow life, some of their friends are not. Ms. Apgar recalled posting a picture of nestlings on Facebook and a friend said, \u201c\u2018Are they going to make it Sammie?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh Brookie, I don\u2019t think so.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Don\u2019t \u201cOh Brookie\u201d me!\u2019\u201d The birds do have what seem to be adaptations to their hard lives. The eggs can go underwater for 90 minutes at a time, surviving the temperature drop and loss of oxygen absorption through the air. When the chicks are old enough, they can climb up the marsh grass to get away from the rising water, even if they are not fully ready to leave the nest.Dr. Elphick says it\u2019s very difficult to pin down an evolutionary cause for a behavior, but for the female sparrows, promiscuity seems to make good sense. Mating quickly is of utmost importance so you can\u2019t be too choosy, and if you\u2019re not being picky about prospective fathers, \u201cyou may be better off mating with multiple males.\u201d Unfortunately, none of these apparent adaptations will help if the birds don\u2019t have around 23 days between nest-flooding tides to lay eggs, incubate them and raise the chicks to the stage when they\u2019re able to leave the nest.That\u2019s where lunar cycles and tides come in. The highest spring tides, very likely to flood the nests, occur roughly every 28 days. Whether the highest tide is at the new or full moon depends on multiyear cycles. Now, new moon tides are the highest. No matter, there is always a secondary peak midway between the highest tides. Right now those secondary peaks don\u2019t cause nest flooding as predictably as the new moon tides do.Their computer models, designed to accommodate the complexity of a reality that is far messier than a tide table, produced the prediction of the sparrow\u2019s dire future. And their conclusion showed that gradual change cannot be counted on. You can approach a cliff gradually, but the last step is pretty abrupt.As we squished through the marsh after examining the doomed nestlings, I asked if his work felt like a deathwatch.\u201cIt is disconcerting,\u201d he said, \u201cto come to the realization that the species you\u2019re studying that doesn\u2019t seem that rare could go extinct within your lifetime.\u201d Then he laughed, \u201cYeah, for sure.\u201d\u201cThe conservation of this species right now \u2014 and not just this species but the whole suite of things that live in salt marshes \u2014 centers around where are the places where it\u2019s possible for there to be marshes 30 years, 50 years, 80 years from now,\u201d Dr. Elphick said. One stopgap measure might be drainage ditches. Many Eastern coastal marshes like Hammonasset already have such ditches, dug in the 1920s and 30s for mosquito control. Or earlier to keep the marsh dry enough for cattle to graze on salt hay, the very plant that the saltmarsh sparrow nests in. More ditches might be dug or old ones widened or deepened.Inevitably a sort of gallows humor evolves in studying a species that seems destined for extinction. Enter the ghost cameras. Ms. Apgar and Dr. Elphick are making video recordings of nests during high spring tides so they can see what actually happens. At what age can the chicks climb up the grass to survive? Do they live after being inundated? What do the mothers do?And they do this in the dark. \u201cMost of the chicks were dying at night in the years we had been studying the birds,\u201d Dr. Elphick said. So they needed cameras that could record video at night. Most small video cameras have infrared filters to improve colors, with one notable exception. \u201cI wound up buying these cameras,\u201d Ms. Apgar said, holding one up for inspection, \u201cthat are actually from a paranormal activities shop.\u201d Apparently ghost hunters also need to see in the dark. Ms. Apgar paired the cameras with lights in the infrared spectrum, which neither birds nor humans can see so the mothers and nestlings are not disturbed. It seems to be working.But, as the sun went down and the waters rose, Ms. Apgar said that their team sometimes jokes that the cameras may also \u201cpick up the ghosts of chicks past.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The U.S. Can\u2019t Punish the Palestinians Into Negotiating ", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDiplomacy as coercion goes against everything American foreign policy stands for.Mr. Allin and Mr. Simon are the co-authors of \u201cOur Separate Ways: The Struggle for the Future of the U.S.-Israel Alliance.\u201dAre President Trump\u2019s advisers checking his worst impulses? From trade to NATO, we\u2019ve been assured that the \u201cadults\u201d in the White House are working quietly to prevent the president from following through on his often erratic foreign policy proclamations.In fact, many of those advisers are leaving their own mark on American international relations by amplifying the president\u2019s instincts or, in some cases, using the opportunity to advance their own radical agendas. While we focus on the president\u2019s latest utterances, they have been fundamentally altering the direction of United States foreign policy, from one based on cooperation and leadership to one rooted in punishment and domination. Nowhere is this more clear than in America\u2019s Middle East policy. Last week John Bolton, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, announced the closing of the Palestine Liberation Organization\u2019s office in Washington; the administration also revoked the visas for the organization\u2019s envoy and his family. Mr. Bolton suggested that the Palestinians needed to be punished, for both their readiness to refer Israeli construction in occupied territory to the International Criminal Court and their reluctance to engage with the Trump administration\u2019s peace efforts.Both charges are spurious, and in any event trivial. It is true that Palestinian leaders have a habit of investing unrealistic expectations in an international community as a kind of deus ex machina. What is also true, however, is that they have hardly any other options.Sanctions and deterrence should always be part of the American diplomatic arsenal. But punishment for its own sake is not how the United States traditionally conducts diplomacy. Nor is there much evidence that punishment works \u2014 just ask Israel, which has been using it for years to try to wring Palestinian concessions.In the Israeli view, Palestinians must be taught a lesson \u2014 for example, by withholding tax revenues \u2014 whenever they go outside the confines of bilateral negotiations with appeals to the United Nations or other international bodies. Not only do the Palestinians ignore the punishment, but each episode further erodes trust and the possibility of constructive negotiations.Israelis at least have the excuse of a genuine sense of vulnerability and isolation; they have to play hardball because they believe their backs are to the wall. The American excuse is that after decades of failure to bring about a negotiated settlement, a new approach is necessary. Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers seem to believe that punishing the Palestinians ahead of their forthcoming peace plan will make them more willing to make concessions and therefore make negotiations easier. In this way, Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers are not checking but clarifying and amplifying the president\u2019s radically misguided approach to diplomacy: that it is about sticks and rarely carrots, that every negotiation is zero sum and that trust is dangerously na\u00efve. (Of course, the administration is not applying sticks to everyone \u2014 by stacking the deck in Israel\u2019s favor, it is making sure that the Palestinians have no choice but to accept an outcome determined by Jerusalem.) This theory of diplomacy-as-coercion is clear enough and probably has its appeal for people unversed in the intricacies of international peace negotiations. But problems will arise when the Palestinians do not react in the docile manner that administration officials somehow expect. It is a dangerous time, and not just for any chance at a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In traditional American diplomacy, problems are managed, policy choices are hedged and partners, however weak, are not antagonized for no good reason. And while it is true that this approach has not brought lasting peace to the region, that is no excuse to throw caution aside and bank on such a dangerous gambit. The traditional emphasis on diplomacy through negotiation and compromise speaks to the best qualities in the American character \u2014 qualities that have allowed American diplomats to resolve seemingly intractable conflicts over the decades, from the Camp David Accords to Northern Ireland.Diplomacy is generally about preserving options, not foreclosing them. The extinction of hopes for Palestinian independence will generate future trouble. This is the problem with mistaking punishment for statecraft.Dana H.

Lehmann, a researcher at the R Street Institute, a nonprofit organization that promotes free markets, calculates that the two federally supervised mortgage finance institutions known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could lose as much as $50 billion to $100 billion in a big earthquake because they own so many uninsured mortgages in seismically risky areas like California.\u201cOur message is that this is the largest uninsured catastrophe risk currently in the financial markets,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said in an interview. \u201cAmong those who are holding the bag is the U.S. Treasury.\u201dResidents of Atlanta, Dallas or New York may be thousands of miles from areas at most risk for earthquakes. But they are exposed, Mr. Lehmann argues, because Fannie and Freddie would most likely need a bailout of taxpayer money after a big earthquake.Only 13 percent of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, raising questions on whether earthquake insurance should be mandatory for mortgage holders.In a response to questions, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae emailed a statement that said while Fannie encourages borrowers to obtain earthquake insurance, it is \u201cunaffordable for many.\u201dIn the Bay Area, earthquake insurance for a home that would cost around $500,000 to rebuild has an annual premium of about $3,000 per year with a 5 percent deductible, according to the California Earthquake Authority.Mr. Lehmann says that he recognizes the high cost of insurance but that the government should study ways to make it more affordable \u2014 and to lower the risk to a national mortgage system still recovering from the financial crisis a decade ago.\u201cTaxpayers can no longer be asked to bear the risk that hundreds of billions of dollars could come crashing to the ground in the blink of an eye,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said in his study.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)You might recognize Marshawn Lynch\u2019s signature dreads (one of which was torn out during a game in 2014) or Beast Mode (his nickname and clothing line).Happy Tuesday indeed.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Your Fall Political Preview", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this still-summery Tuesday.And welcome back.Over the next two weeks, New York Today will be asking local reporters for The New York Times to give us a preview of some of the most compelling issues they\u2019re covering as we head into the fall.\u201cAll across the country, Democrats are fighting over what the future of their party looks like, and now it\u2019s New York\u2019s turn,\u201d Mr. Goldmacher said.As is often the case in New York, which is heavily Democratic, the primary could be tantamount to the entire election.Here\u2019s what you need to know about key races.Governor:\u201cAndrew Cuomo has been in office for 12 years and he is selling himself on his experience,\u201d Mr. Goldmacher said. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy to take on Trump. Well, Cynthia Nixon says it\u2019s time to blow up that argument \u2014 and that all that really matters now is how progressive you are.\u201dHe pointed out that the candidates have visibly different strategies for this final push: Ms. Nixon is crisscrossing the state campaigning and holding events, and Mr. Cuomo is keeping a lower profile (except for big, official announcements). Instead, Mr. Cuomo is relying on a heavy circulation of campaign mailings and television ads.Mr. Cuomo has a 30-point lead over Ms. Nixon in every poll, but in several races this year, the polls have been notably wrong.Mr. Goldmacher told us: \u201cHere\u2019s something the primary will test: Was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s shock win in June an aberration? Or was it \u2014 and the polling misfire by Crowley, who by the way used one of the same pollsters as Cuomo \u2014 a sign of what\u2019s to come?\u201dAttorney General:Ms. James, the New York City public advocate, is backed by the Democratic Party in New York.He added: \u201cThe attorney general\u2019s race is getting less attention, but don\u2019t forget that this is one of the single races of most interest to President Trump in the country because of all the investigation potential into his businesses and foundation.\u201dLieutenant Governor:\u201cShe has had more than a million dollars in her campaign account; his campaign is basically dead broke,\u201d Mr. Goldmacher said.\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable is the concern that he\u2019s competitive anyway \u2014 based partly on demographics of New York in that he is from New York City, is relatively well known for a city councilman, and is an African-American candidate in a year in which every campaign is focused heavily on turning out African-American voters.\u201dHere\u2019s what else is happening:Labor Day may mark the unofficial end of summer, but that hardly seems the case today.Enjoy.Parking LessonDear Diary:I pulled onto West 130th Street between Lenox and Fifth Avenues looking for a parking spot. I noticed one between two cars. I knew there wasn\u2019t a fire hydrant there.Getting into the spot would have been a tight squeeze, but nothing I couldn\u2019t handle. Luckily, though, I saw that there was a man sitting in the Jeep parked in front of the empty space. He had easily half a car\u2019s length ahead of him that he could move up into. I figured I would ask if he would mind making my job easier.Pulling alongside the Jeep, I saw that the man was leaning back in his seat. His window was already down. I rolled down my front passenger-side window.\u201cHi, excuse me.\u201d I said, \u201cWould you mind pulling up a bit so I could squeeze in behind you?\u201dNo response.\u201cExcuse me, sir?\u201dThis time, he answered.\u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m busy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI just wanted to ask if you could move up a tad, maybe three feet.\u201d\u201cI heard what you said,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll move up two feet, and learn how to park.\u201dNow I was annoyed.He pulled the Jeep up, and I backed into the empty spot easily. Turning off the ignition, I decided to ask the man if he would evaluate my parking job. After all, he had said I needed to learn.As I approached the Jeep, the man was reaching out the window with his hand open. Almost magnetically, my hand was drawn into his.\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m on the phone with the funeral home. My father just passed. Please, go easy on me.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t take much to set us off when we\u2019re surrounded by millions of people, especially in the heat. So go easy on each other.\u2014 Ray FurlongEating lunch in a cafeteria today? You can thank New York for that.The first self-service restaurant, the predecessor to today\u2019s cafeteria, opened in Lower Manhattan on this day in 1885.The restaurant was popular among busy New Yorkers, who didn\u2019t have to wait for a server to take their order.But before a customer left, he had to clear his dishes and calculate his bill.As one customer later said: \u201cAlmost everyone had a \u2018ham on rye and coffee\u2019 \u2014 35 cents. Many had indeed enjoyed a full turkey dinner.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Expecting Women to Describe How Sexual Assault Affected Them Creates Barriers to Reporting It", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cCan you tell us what impact the events had on you?\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Christine Blasey Ford during Thursday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.It was the first of several questions aimed at getting Dr. Blasey to outline the toll on her life of a sexual assault that she testified involved Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh.Many people who work in the area of trauma found her answers, which included \u201canxiety, phobia and PTSD-like symptoms,\u201d familiar and credible. But they said it\u2019s important to remember something Dr. Blasey, a research psychologist, drew attention to during her testimony.\u201cI think the sequelae of sexual assault varies per person,\u201d Dr. Blasey told the committee, using a scientific term for aftereffects.Sometimes those effects are difficult to discern or articulate, one of many reasons that women often fail to report sexual assaults to authorities \u2014 or even discuss the incident with loved ones, researchers say.\u201cThere is lots of research showing the survivors cope in many different ways, but there does seem to be a societal image of how they need to act \u2014 and if not they are not believed,\u201d Antonia Abbey, the editor of the journal, Psychology of Violence, said in an email.\u201cResearch indicates that people are less likely to believe a victim\u2019s account and believe an assault was less severe when the assault and victim\u2019s response doesn\u2019t follow people\u2019s scripts.\u201dThough she appeared certain that the answer was yes, for many victims, the effects are more murky, researchers said. Reinforcing the idea that one must be able to clearly outline the concrete effects of trauma in the form of poor grades, broken relationships or days spent weeping in order to be believed, they said, can do more harm than good.This phenomenon may also push a woman to minimize the incident for herself. She may feel like her own experience was not worthy of documentation or discussion because she did not observe the same effects other victims talk about.\u201cI think we intuitively understand that if a gun was forced into your mouth or put to your head, you would be traumatized,\u201d said Neil Malamuth, a social scientist at UCLA who studies sexual violence.But in the realm of sexual assault, many people\u2019s view of the crime continues to be shaped more by the response of the victim than by the actions of the perpetrator, he said.\u201cIf you are too upset, you are crazy,\u201d said Mary Koss, a professor at the University of Arizona who has published numerous studies on sexual assault, in an email. \u201cIf you are not upset enough, people don\u2019t believe you were raped. So you have to be just the right degree of upset, whatever that is.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sushi and Kaiseki in an Exceptional One-Man Show", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cPeople always say summer is not a good time for sushi,\u201d Derek Wilcox said. \u201cI have no idea what they\u2019re talking about.\u201dIn the broad view, having the place to myself was unjust. In the year since Mr. Wilcox took over the restaurant \u2014 at first his work there was termed a residency or pop-up, but in June the owner, Idan Elkon, announced that he\u2019d put a ring on it and made the arrangement permanent \u2014 he has firmly placed it in the top tier of the city\u2019s Japanese restaurants. On the basis of sushi alone, Shoji has few plausible rivals, and for sushi embedded within a longer, kaiseki-derived menu, it has no parallel. There should be no empty seats, no matter how many New Yorkers are off lolling at the beach.Taking a selfish view, though, I wasn\u2019t particularly unhappy to be the only customer. Mr. Wilcox, who grew up in Virginia, cooked at a kaiseki restaurant in Kyoto called Kikunoi for seven years and then spent three more at a traditionalist sushi parlor in the Ginza district of Tokyo. You might think of this as the equivalent of earning a master\u2019s degree followed by a Ph.D. in Japanese cuisine, and one side benefit of a meal across the counter from Mr. Wilcox is the chance to hear what he learned studying abroad.Show some curiosity and you could get a short education in the mineral-rich clay used by potters in the town of Shigaraki, or the various aliases and false names under which a particularly delicious, pink-fleshed fish known as akamutsu in Japan travels under when it is away from home. On this August night, I was about to get a two-hour schooling on the pleasures of summer sushi.Mr. Wilcox\u2019s opening move was a squiggle of what looked like short, thick noodles and turned out to be lengths of chilled eggplant; Mr. Wilcox had given them a cool bath in the light sauce in which icy coils of somen noodles are dipped in summer. Laid over the top were two tongues of bafun sea urchin, a species with the color of a nearly ripe persimmon. With one dish, he had shooed away the heat outside, shown off the uncanny harmony of urchin and eggplant, and introduced a minor theme of the night, the summer urchin harvest in Japan.This overture out of the way, Mr. Wilcox lifted what appeared to be a machete. This was a hamo knife, a heavy swath of sharp steel that can reduce the daggertooth pike conger\u2019s dozens of tiny bones to edible smithereens; before the first one was forged in the 19th century, he explained, the eel had to be fully cooked and separated from its skeleton. This hamo would be quickly scorched on one side and served with a lick of wasabi and pur\u00e9ed salt-cured plums thinned with dashi.Sashimi came next in the form of shioko, or kanpachi caught when it is young and its flavor is leaner and softer than it will get later in the year. This was followed by a local fish that in the spring Mr. Wilcox had told me he didn\u2019t like, striped bass. He had been working with it, though, salting it overnight and then grilling it until the skin crackled. Now I don\u2019t want striped bass cooked any other way. After this was Mr. Wilcox\u2019s nod to the kaiseki tradition known as takiawase, a plate of simmered vegetables and, in this case, seafood: a small potato, some Japanese eggplant, a crisp pink ginger shoot and the most flavorful piece of octopus I have ever put in my mouth.After my first meal at Shoji I learned to hope that chawan mushi, a bowl of steaming-hot tofu custard, was on the menu. In spring Mr. Wilcox made it with spot prawns, but tonight, in homage to clambake season, he was serving lobster chawan mushi.To this point, the menu had faithfully followed kaiseki\u2019s ritualized sequence of courses and its stopwatch-precise attention to seasonality. It was about to veer in a different direction, but it was enough to suggest that Mr. Wilcox could open a kaiseki restaurant that would set a new standard in the city. I\u2019m not sure the city would support it, but it would be spectacular while it lasted.While in Japan, Mr. Wilcox learned to make fresh ikura from sacs of salmon roe, a slow process that requires massaging the eggs apart by hand in many changes of water. Normally the roe is then heavily cured with sugar and salt, but the roe he was serving last month was very lightly seasoned before being spooned into a shot glass and served as is \u2014 sticky, fatty, sweet and fresh.After the last piece of fish, the kaiseki format kicks in again with a soup, which may be as simple as a classic bowl of miso or may break with tradition, like the extraordinary corn soup I ate in August. There will be something cold and refreshing, maybe a granita made from ginger or matcha, and finally a more substantial dessert. Sometimes this is a sort of tart with seasonal fruit \u2014 candied kumquats, maybe, or white peaches and blueberries \u2014 arranged in a mochi wafer called monaka.For all this the charge is $252, service included. A shorter menu is available at $190, or a longer one at $295, again with service included. That service is somewhat minimal; lately it has meant a single employee assiduously refilling water glasses and taking orders from a drinks list whose cheapest item is a $12 bottle of beer.Could my server have been more adept at deciphering the wines, sakes, shochus and Haitian rums Mr. Elkon and Mr. Wilcox have put together? Perhaps, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily want the scene cluttered by a sommelier in full pocket-square-and-cuff-links regalia. More employees hovering at the counter might take away from the bond Mr. Wilcox builds with the people he feeds.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by ResyAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for Impeaching Kavanaugh", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the Democrats win the House this fall, they can investigate the charges against him, should he be confirmed.Mr. Krotoszynski is a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law.Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, seem determined to call a vote next week on the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, even in the face of this week\u2019s sexual assault allegations against him. Senate Republicans assume, correctly, that if they can hold the party line, his installation on the Supreme Court is a sure thing. This is certainly true \u2014 even if the Democratic caucus in the Senate holds firm against Mr. Kavanaugh, they simply lack the votes to block him. But the Republicans\u2019 calculus contains a significant error \u2014 namely, the assumption that if Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, that\u2019s the end of the discussion of whether he is fit to serve.The Constitution does provide that federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, \u201cshall hold their offices during good behavior.\u201d The settled understanding of this phrase is that so-called Article III judges enjoy lifetime tenure. But the Constitution also makes both judicial and executive officers subject to impeachment. And, as it happens, the House of Representatives holds \u201cthe sole power of impeachment.\u201d If the Democrats win back the House in November, they can exercise that power.Impeachment proceedings in the House are investigative in nature and come with a full panoply of quasi-judicial powers, including aids to investigations, such as the power to subpoena witnesses to compel them to appear and testify (subject, of course, to constitutional privileges, if applicable, such as the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against self-incrimination). If a simple majority of the House decided to proceed with impeachment, the House Judiciary Committee would be empowered to conduct a thorough and careful investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations that Christine Blasey Ford has made against Mr. Kavanaugh involving a drunken sexual assault when both were high school students in suburban Washington.Nor should the Democrats wait to formally take control of the House in January. The House Democratic leadership should pledge now that if they win a majority, they will conduct an impeachment investigation, to get to the truth. Doing so today would make clear to the Senate Republicans that if they rush to judgment, in the absence of a full and fair investigation, there will still be an investigation.Of course, even if the House impeached Judge Kavanaugh, it would still take a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and remove him from the court. But the Senate vote would surely have at least something to do with the merits of the House\u2019s case: If a full and fair investigation shows that Judge Kavanaugh has lied regarding the incident \u2014 he has denied it categorically and says nothing even remotely like it ever occurred \u2014 Republican senators may find it hard to vote no in the #MeToo era. It would be a terrible blow to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, of course, but this is the risk that Senators McConnell and Grassley seem willing to take.Attending a strategy session as a White House staff member is not a crime. Lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is. Perjury would be a perfectly justifiable, and constitutional, basis for impeachment. An important caveat: Congress must take care to maintain the constitutional convention that has existed since the failed impeachment of Justice Chase. Federal judges, including members of the Supreme Court, should not be impeached based on their judicial rulings or philosophy. Accordingly, if the House were to initiate impeachment proceedings against Justice Kavanaugh in 2019, such proceedings should be strictly limited to questions associated with his alleged intentional and deliberate efforts to mislead the Senate about his character and fitness to serve.We do not know the truth of the troubling allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. But, before someone is confirmed to the Supreme Court, good faith efforts to discover the truth should be made. And if the Senate won\u2019t conduct a credible investigation now, the House should offer its assistance next year.Ronald J. Krotoszynski Jr. is a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Only the Truth Can Save Us Now", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore we accept a permanent division over the Kavanaugh Affair, here are some ways to make a last bid for greater clarity.Opinion ColumnistStart with the issues with Blasey\u2019s account. She gave us a story of a teenage house party in which she remembered five of at least six attendees, in which she left in a stumbling terrified hurry, in which she, then 15, didn\u2019t drive herself there or back but isn\u2019t sure who did.Maybe not \u2014 but it would be very interesting to hear from them. It would also be interesting to pursue the likelihood that this small party, which took place somewhere within a relatively limited geographic area, was probably held at the house of one of the small group of people whom Blasey remembers attending. (That being, after all, how spur-of-the-moment teenage parties tend to work.)All of these possible areas of inquiry \u2014 her female friend and family\u2019s recollections, the probable locations for the party, the boy who connected her with her alleged attacker \u2014 were unmentioned by Senate Democrats as they went about praising Blasey and cross-examining Kavanaugh, and their possible relevance is mostly being dismissed by the liberal side as of a piece with Whelan\u2019s reckless public speculations. Instead the only person that liberals insist absolutely needs to be questioned more rigorously is Mark Judge, the alleged other participant in the assault.But if the liberal interest in Judge is too partial, it\u2019s still entirely reasonable. The sworn statements from him and from the other boy named, P.J. Smyth, are obviously insufficient given the stakes here. They should be asked under oath if they knew Blasey, if they ever attended parties with her \u2014 a whole litany of obvious questions. And the fact that both of their names appeared on the calendar that Kavanaugh offered up in his defense, listed as attendees at precisely the kind of weeknight drinking party that he suggested was vanishingly rare, seems like another useful area of inquiry \u2014 one, again, that the cross-examiner (God bless her!) pursued a little before Senate Republicans decided that the time for grandstanding had arrived.There are many ways these strands might be gathered in. But the easiest would be for the on-the-fence Republicans and red-state Democrats who hold the balance of power to simply make Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation conditional on the Senate Judiciary Committee interviewing Keyser, Blasey\u2019s parents and siblings, Judge and Smyth and definitely \u201cSqui.\u201dMaybe that somebody isn\u2019t on the list of people I\u2019ve just suggested asking for further information. But before the vote, I\u2019d like to hear what they have to say. Advertisement"}

Decades of armed conflict between the Colombian government and rebel groups rendered vast swaths of the country\u2019s northwest off-limits to interlopers, who risked being kidnapped, or worse. Those perils have largely vanished after peace accords with the main rebel group, the FARC, removed man-made dangers. But this remote area \u2014 thick with vegetation and resources \u2014 still has many natural obstacles.Undaunted, Sebastian Villegas trekked over 120 miles by boat, mule and foot through mountain grasslands and muddy jungles to photograph the lives of people who had been cut off from the rest of the country for years. He found a region where the official state has long kept its distance, and where people eked out a living not just through agriculture, but also through less-sustainable, extractive means, like artisanal gold mining or logging for fine woods.The result of his arduous journey is \u201cEl Resto es Selva,\u201d or \u201cThe Rest is Jungle,\u201d a book and exhibit that looks at these places blessed by nature and contested by man. \u201cThere has to be some reciprocity,\u201d said Mr. Villegas, who was selected for the project through a competition financed by the World Bank administered initiative Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and conducted by Colombia\u2019s Ministry of Environment and the NGOs Fondo Accion and Puente Consultorias. \u201cWe take from them, but we don\u2019t replace. That\u2019s where I started on the project, looking at how we use up natural resources, but never go to these territories. When you buy a camera or cellphone, you don\u2019t know where the materials come from. We have the object, but not the knowledge of how we extract the materials.\u201d\u201cThese communities, which are isolated, have been through years of conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of minerals, oil, bananas. These were all areas affected by the war. But you could feel it change with the peace process. They were opening up, and civilians could enter to tell their stories.\u201dWhile there is no more armed conflict, danger remains. Recently, four police officers were kidnapped in the region, and daily life remains a struggle. Children have their education cut short in order to go to work and help their families. The discovery of gold in one location 13 years ago led to a local rush of sorts, and Mr. Villegas\u2019s photos show the deleterious impact of contaminated water and a landscape of felled trees.With the project completed, some 3,000 books have been given to libraries, NGOs and members of the diplomatic community, Mr. Villegas said. There have also been exhibits and workshops in Bogot\u00e1. But his goal is to take the photos back to the source, printing them on cloth that can be hung from the trees in remote villages.\u201cWe want to bring it to the people who are in the book,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gave me access to their lives and stories.

{"Headline": "Life With No Males? These Termites Show That It\u2019s Possible", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesA discovery among termite colonies in Japan suggests that males can be discarded from advanced societies in which they once played an active role.Termites are often dismissed as nothing but home-destroying pests, less charismatic than bees, ants or even spiders.Now, add \u201coverthrowing the patriarchy\u201d to that list.Toshihisa Yashiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Sydney and lead author of the paper, said in an email that he was utterly surprised by the discovery: \u201cI got a headache, because we believed that having both males and females is the rule in termite societies.\u201dThe complete loss of males is rare across the animal kingdom, especially in animals with advanced societies. All-female lineages have previously been documented in a few ant and honey bee species, but their colonies are already dominated by queens and female workers.Termites, in contrast, are known for having colonies in which males and females both participate in social activities. Dr. Yashiro\u2019s research is the first, in other words, to demonstrate that males can be discarded from advanced societies in which they once played an active role.Genetic analyses suggested that the asexual termites evolved from ancestors that split from other G. nakajimai around 14 million years ago. The asexual termites have an extra chromosome compared with the sexual ones, suggesting the two groups may now be diverging into different species, said Nathan Lo, an evolutionary biology professor also at the University of Sydney.Tanya Dapkey, an entomologist at the University of Pennsylvania, said that there was much to learn from successful \u201csocieties in nature run without any input from males.\u201dEdward Vargo, an entomology professor at Texas A&M University who was not involved in the study, added that determining how and why certain colonies evolved asexuality might yield insight on the big question of \u201cwhat is the purpose of sex and sexual reproduction.\u201dDr. Yashiro has a few hypotheses. To start, sexual populations of G. nakajimai do occasionally produce offspring from unfertilized eggs, which perhaps \u201cpre-adapted\u201d them to get along fine without males, he said.Crucial to this transition may have been a willingness, by termite queens, to cooperate when establishing colonies. In most asexual colonies the researchers studied, multiple queens, as many as 25, were found.Furthermore, the scientists noticed that asexual colonies had fewer soldiers than sexual ones. The all-female soldiers in asexual colonies were more uniform in the size of their heads, which they use to block enemies from invading their nests. It\u2019s possible that asexual soldiers are more efficient at defense, Dr. Yashiro said.At the end of our interview, I asked Dr. Yashiro if he had last thoughts to share. He declared, simply: \u201cFor asexual Glyptotermes nakajimai, the future is female!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tentative Deal Reached for Christine Blasey Ford to Testify on Thursday", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee and lawyers for the woman who has accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago reached a tentative agreement on Saturday for her to publicly testify on Thursday, an apparent breakthrough that could alter the course of a bitter confirmation fight.After a brief call late on Saturday, the woman\u2019s lawyers and aides to Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, planned to talk again Sunday morning to continue the halting negotiations over the conditions of the testimony, according to three people familiar with the call. Aides to Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the committee\u2019s top Democrat, were also involved.But in a possible setback for the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, Republicans on the committee received a statement on Saturday that seemed to eliminate any chance of corroboration of Dr. Blasey\u2019s account by anyone who attended the high school party where she says she was assaulted.A woman named Leland Keyser \u2014 who is believed to have been identified by Dr. Blasey as one of the five people at the party \u2014 told the committee through a lawyer that she \u201cdoes not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.\u201d Two men said to have been at the party, Mark Judge and Patrick Smyth, have also told the committee that they have no recollection of the events.Still, even without corroboration, any testimony by Dr. Blasey would set up a potentially explosive showdown, and it could greatly complicate matters for Judge Kavanaugh, who just last week \u2014 before Dr. Blasey came forward with her account of the assault \u2014 seemed destined for confirmation to the Supreme Court.While the negotiations over Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimony seemed to gain momentum, they could still falter over the details, which include who will question her. But in tentatively agreeing to a Thursday hearing, Republicans made a significant concession that suggested they were working to ensure that the session occurred after several days of uncertainty.If no final deal is made, Mr. Grassley will be left to decide on Sunday whether to move ahead with a committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination that is scheduled for Monday, or give Dr. Blasey more time. Judge Kavanaugh, who has vigorously denied the allegations, has repeatedly expressed his desire to testify.Mr. Grassley had set 2:30 p.m. Saturday as a final deadline for Dr. Blasey to agree or decline to appear. In a letter to the committee sent to meet that deadline, lawyers for Dr. Blasey, 51, a research psychologist in Northern California, said they were hopeful that an agreement could be reached on the details.Dr. Blasey \u201caccepts the committee\u2019s request to provide her firsthand knowledge of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s sexual misconduct next week,\u201d they wrote. The lawyers called details of Mr. Grassley\u2019s earlier proposal, including a Wednesday hearing date, \u201cfundamentally inconsistent with the committee\u2019s promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations.\u201dThe tentative deal reached hours later came as White House officials and Republicans on Capitol Hill were growing increasingly frustrated at what they said was a ploy to delay the Monday vote. After the Judiciary Committee revealed Ms. Keyser\u2019s statement, the White House swung into the offensive against Dr. Blasey.\u201cOne week ago, Dr. Christine Ford claimed she was assaulted at a house party attended by four others,\u201d said Kerri Kupec, a White House spokeswoman. \u201cSince then, all four of these individuals have provided statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee denying any knowledge of the incident or even having attended such a party.\u201dDemocrats praised Dr. Blasey and said they hoped the agreement would hold together. \u201cShe is a profile in courage,\u201d said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a committee member who was briefed on the back-and-forth. \u201cShe has come so far in meeting truly outrageously arbitrary and unfair demands simply to speak her truth to power and to the American people.\u201dThe tentative agreement was the latest turn in an on-again-off-again negotiation that began cordially, with Dr. Blasey voicing an openness to testifying, but quickly turned acrimonious. There have been several sticking points, including who would question her at a hearing \u2014 Republicans want to hire an outside counsel; Dr. Blasey would prefer to be questioned by senators \u2014 and how many news media cameras would be present. The lawyers have also asked for the committee to subpoena testimony from Mr. Judge, who Dr. Blasey has said witnessed the assault.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has said that he has enough votes to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, but with at least two Republicans in the Senate undecided and with the party holding only a 51-to-49 majority, it is hardly assured. It is increasingly unlikely that Judge Kavanaugh will have the support of even a single Senate Democrat.Privately, Republican senators were working to resolve differences among themselves about how to proceed. Some favored cutting off negotiations over the hearing and moving swiftly to a vote, while others pushed to accommodate Dr. Blasey\u2019s wishes.One of those who has favored accommodation, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said on Twitter on Saturday afternoon that he saw progress. \u201cThis is good,\u201d he wrote.Among the many considerations, according to one official close to the discussions, was how Republican voters would react to any move to push past the allegations. President Trump suggested at a rally on Friday night that he believes that the public, including many women, want to \u201cfight for\u201d Judge Kavanaugh.After breaking his silence about Dr. Blasey on Friday and questioning her allegations, the president on Saturday stayed mum about her, heeding the advice of aides who have warned him repeatedly against appearing to attack her.Dr. Blasey\u2019s accusations, coming just days before the Judiciary Committee was initially set to vote on Judge Kavanaugh, have rocked official Washington, evoking memories of the 1991 confirmation of Justice Clarence Thomas, who was accused of sexual harassment by the law professor Anita Hill. They have further energized Democrats, and women particularly, in a midterm election in which Republicans are struggling to court the female vote.Dr. Blasey has said that a drunken Judge Kavanaugh assaulted her during a small party in suburban Washington when they were both in high school. As Mr. Judge watched, she said, he pushed her onto a bed, jumped on top of her, groped her, covered her mouth and tried to remove her clothing. Dr. Blasey was able to leave the room when the friend jumped atop both of them, she said.Officials said Judge Kavanaugh, who spent much of this past week at the White House preparing for a hearing, was well rehearsed and ready to appear on Capitol Hill if senators opted to go forward with a session. At mock hearings last week, according to a White House official, he practiced fielding specific questions about the accusations and deflecting broad inquiries about his social life, such as his general drinking habits.The adviser, Garrett Ventry, said the sexual harassment claim against him was false. A spokesman for the committee, Taylor Foy, noted the denial of wrongdoing but said that Mr. Ventry had decided to step aside \u201cto avoid causing any distraction from the work of the committee.\u201dBefore joining Mr. Grassley\u2019s staff, Mr. Ventry worked for CRC Public Relations, a Virginia-based firm whose conservative clients include the Federalist Society and other groups backing Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. A spokesman for CRC said that Mr. Ventry had been on a leave of absence and that the firm had accepted his resignation on Saturday.Michael R. Bromwich, a prominent Washington lawyer, joined Dr. Blasey\u2019s legal team on Friday. After doing so, he resigned from his law firm, Robbins Russell, amid objections within the firm about his work, including potential public appearances on Dr. Blasey\u2019s behalf.Mr. Bromwich, a former inspector general of the Justice Department, is also at the center of another leading story line in Washington: He represents Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director, who was fired this year and witnessed many of the most sensitive episodes of the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation.\u201cBecause objections have been raised within the partnership to my doing so while employed by the firm, I am resigning from the firm, effective immediately,\u201d Mr. Bromwich wrote in a letter to the firm\u2019s staff, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times.Sheryl Gay Stolberg reported from Washington, Nicholas Fandos from New York, and Julie Hirschfeld Davis from Berkeley Heights, N.J.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This I Believe About Blasey v. Kavanaugh", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI believe Blasey deserves to be fairly heard, not automatically believed.Opinion ColumnistI have absolutely no idea what, if anything, happened between Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford at a party in Maryland in the early 1980s.Unless you were at the party, I believe that you don\u2019t, either.I believe Kavanaugh\u2019s more vociferous defenders should ask themselves how they\u2019d react if that had been done to them or their daughter.I believe it will not do to defend Kavanaugh with the argument that this was one long-ago youthful mistake in an otherwise upstanding life. Nor will it do to note that his classmates thought he was a great guy. Or that this is the only known allegation against him. Or that, as a judge, he hired lots of female clerks.I believe the thing that matters now is that Kavanaugh categorically denies the sexual assault allegation.I believe that nobody who sits in judgment of others, whether as a federal judge or Supreme Court justice, should ever be guilty of such an assault at any age, much less of brazenly lying about it as an adult.I believe in the presumption of innocence. I believe this is fundamental, and that it should apply in courts of public opinion as well as those of law. I believe that sexual assault is evil, but so is bearing false witness.I believe that Blasey has a moral obligation to demonstrate, as best as she can, that the serious charge she has brought against Kavanaugh is true. I believe that if she fails to do so, after having reluctantly but voluntarily come forward, she will have smeared Kavanaugh.I believe human memory is imperfect. I believe it deteriorates over time. I believe most of us have had the experience of thinking we remember something clearly, only to discover we got important details wrong.I believe the F.B.I. should be given a few days to conduct an investigation before a Senate hearing for Blasey is held. I believe that following the precedent set by George H.W. Bush during the Clarence Thomas hearings is reasonable and should not push a vote beyond the midterms. I believe this is important for the Senate to fulfill its advise and consent function.I believe Blasey\u2019s credibility will be tarnished if she can vividly recall the unverifiable parts of her story, but not the ones that can be verified. I believe Kavanaugh deserves to be accused of actions he can potentially disprove, not merely deny.I believe whatever report the F.B.I. produces will be imperfect. I believe that a Senate hearing, whatever form it takes, will be imperfect. At this point, I believe every conceivable alternative is worse.I believe in letting the chips fall where they may. I believe the republic will survive either way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Addiction Doesn\u2019t Always Last a Lifetime ", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "OpinionIn fact, most people recover, often on their own. Here are some of their stories.Supported byFilthy hands gripping bloody needles, pregnant women shooting up, angelic toddlers in car seats with their parents slumped upfront, overdosed \u2014 media images of the opioid crisis are relentlessly dire. To improve the odds, we need to recognize and champion recovery \u2014 and the wide variety of forms it can take. In media and pop culture, when recovering people are seen at all, one type usually appears: someone who goes to rehab and then abstains from all drugs by relying on 12-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous. Other people take their own routes entirely. We find new passions in relationships, parenting, culture, exercise, work, art, spirituality, activism and community service. Some recover primarily by learning better ways to manage the trauma and mental illness that underlie many addictions. Some even kick opioids by using marijuana or psychedelic drugs. I believe people like me can no longer stay silent \u2014 our stories are the only antidote to a picture of addiction that fails to include recovery. After two overdoses that required hospitalization, his wife insisted that he get help. And, for the first time, his depression was diagnosed, along with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, both conditions that sharply raise risk for addiction. After several relapses, he stabilized on buprenorphine (Suboxone) and an antidepressant. He also attended meetings of SMART Recovery, a secular abstinence-focused support group. \u201cWhat I connected with most was the idea that it\u2019s all about choices and that you\u2019re not powerless,\u201d he said. He attended even during relapses. \u201cI\u2019d come back, kind of hanging my head after one of those episodes; everyone was so supportive and so emphatic about making sure I didn\u2019t think I was starting over.\u201d \u201cI grew up believing that addiction was a choice and feeling really confused about why my mom would choose to use drugs over showing up for me and my brother and being in our lives,\u201d she said. At 13, she ran away. When her father found her, she demanded her mother\u2019s address. After years of equivocation, he admitted that she\u2019d recently died of a heroin overdose. \u201cI kind of lost my mother twice,\u201d she said.Ms. Feldman became suicidal and defiant. Her teens were spent cycling through psychiatric hospitals and juvenile prisons, often drinking or heavily medicated. She came out as a lesbian at 18. At 21, she was introduced to Percocet by a girlfriend and occasional use soon turned daily. But as she watched friends transition to heroin, the drug that killed her mother, she decided to seek treatment. \u201cI very much prided myself on not being like my mom, and it was this line in the sand for me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we see in the media is a tale of addiction in which us white folks are painted simply as victims of big bad pharma. This simply was not my experience.\u201dShe found solace in the fellowship of 12-step meetings in 2005. She also began working at a recovery community center, which supported people through multiple recovery paths. \u201cWhile for myself and many, recovery includes abstinence from alcohol and other drugs, recovery does not have to include abstinence.\u201d In high school, he discovered opioids. The drugs made him feel \u201ccomfortable in my body,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was a very powerful feeling for me as someone who had really bad anxiety and had been very self-conscious.\u201d His addiction took off at 17, after a friend sold him OxyContin. Before long, he\u2019d switched to cheaper heroin. His parents sent him to several inpatient and outpatient rehabs. \u201cI gave those 12 steps a really honest try,\u201d he said. But what ultimately helped him most was writing and studying the science of addiction. \u201cI just put on paper what I thought was going on with me, and I could also read what other people thought was going on with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing that at the time, but I feel like I was making sense of my story.\u201d His relationships with his girlfriend, his family and friends have also been crucial. \u201cSo long as those are supportive and loving and stable, I don\u2019t really feel the need to fill any voids or comfort myself.\u201d He has not used opioids since 2012 but says he does drink alcohol and uses marijuana in moderation, where it is legal.  In 1975, however, the friends he sold drugs with were indicted. \u201cI decided I was done,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Christmas Day, I shot myself up the last time and I started drinking. I drank until the 29th and that monkey on my back was gone.\u201d His friends, however, were in prison or had criminal records. \u201cThey got out and they went back to the same street life,\u201d he said. He graduated college and became a successful high school math teacher, now nearing retirement. He drinks \u201csometimes, but not a lot\u201d and this is the first time he has ever told his story. He wanted to share it \u201cto help others\u201d and to show that addiction doesn\u2019t always last a lifetime. \u201cI turned to drinking and I was like, \u2018This is the only way I\u2019m going to get rid of this pain,\u2019 \u201d she said. Her younger sister was already using prescription pain pills and heroin \u2014 and soon, Valerie was, too. As a child, Ms. Zhaawendaagozikwe, a member of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, said she was sexually abused. Opioids made her feel invincible. \u201cThey took all the bad feelings away and it was replaced by euphoria.\" Between the age of 22 and 24, Valerie attempted treatment at least 20 times; she had about nine overdoses. During her last overdose, she briefly went blind, which terrified her. She tried conventional treatment, but it didn\u2019t work. She returned to her roots to find recovery. She began attending Native American ceremonies and praying using ceremonial pipes and tobacco. \u201cI try and tell people that if you learn those songs and if you drum, that can change the way that you think and your mind and the way you feel,\u201d she said. She met the man who became her partner at a ceremony and soon became pregnant. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have my son, I\u2019m not sure how far I would\u2019ve made it,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "A Genetic Love Story", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTiesA new diagnosis of a rare disorder identifies my daughter as a kind of person whose definition barely exists, and yet I can already see the generalizations hovering around her.My daughter and I visited a geneticist. He said, \u201cYou like your vegetables, don\u2019t you, Ruby?\u201dRuby said she did.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d I asked. He said her palms were orange from beta carotene. I was impressed.I hadn\u2019t come expecting to learn anything at all. You read of children defying limits, you hear the pride of a mother reporting that doctors said her child would never walk, never talk. But Ruby\u2019s doctors had no clues about whatever hidden flaw was causing her inscrutable developmental delays. When Ruby was 8 months old, I sat on a bench in Central Park and watched a younger baby energetically prance upon a woman\u2019s lap. That looks funny, I thought. I\u2019d only ever seen Ruby\u2019s legs dangle. That Thanksgiving, I said to my mom, furrowing my brow, \u201cSometimes it seems like she\u2019s kind of floppier than other babies.\u201d So it began.When Ruby was 2, a speech therapist used the word \u201capraxia\u201d to describe what hindered her motor skills, and all the tiny movements that make acquiring speech automatic for most people and nearly impossible for her. Apraxia is a disorder in motor planning; for Ruby, a profound lack of coordination.Called back to the geneticist months after the blood test to discuss results, I got nervous. Ruby was now 9 years old; I was certain I knew more about her than any genetic analysis could reveal. Still, this conversation was a long time coming.The geneticist said sequencing of Ruby\u2019s DNA had revealed a mutation on a gene called GATAD2B, important in embryonic neurodevelopment. It controls other genes, he explained, so a disabling mutation here meant \u201ca whole slew of other genes are downregulated \u2014 they don\u2019t make other proteins that enhance the function of the neurons and the development of the brain.\u201dThis didn\u2019t surprise me at all. What surprised me was the deep sense of peace and wonder his words gave me.For years, I\u2019d had a strong aversion to others\u2019 attempts to define what was wrong with Ruby, slot her into a designated spot that would be more easily understood than the girl herself. As I settled into life as the single mother of an abnormal but sweet and healthy child, Ruby\u2019s pediatrician and, more pressingly, my dad \u2014 Ruby and I had moved in with my parents when I started nursing school \u2014 wanted to pursue testing and imaging to identify the source of her delays. I felt differently.I was training to be a nurse: I wasn\u2019t in denial about the importance of diagnosing and treating disease. But I believed that putting Ruby through medical testing for a diagnosis wouldn\u2019t benefit and could harm her. Whatever we discovered would only satisfy our drive to sanction and label every human mystery, not help Ruby. Originally, I had finally agreed to genetic testing when Ruby was 3. Back then, \u201cwhole exome sequencing\u201d was not on the table and the testing that was available found nothing, so the imaging of Ruby\u2019s brain, which the pediatrician speculated could be structurally abnormal, loomed even larger. So be it, I said. What difference would it make to see it? Sedation for an M.R.I. brain scan, I knew, bore real risks.I read as victories comments in Ruby\u2019s medical notes such as this one, from a prominent neurologist: \u201cMother does not wish to pursue MR imaging at present, and I think this is very reasonable since it would likely not affect management.\u201d I had in mind the philosopher of science Ian Hacking\u2019s ideas about labeling. He wrote that \u201cto acquire and use a name for any kind is, among other things, to be willing to make generalizations and form expectations about things of that kind,\u201d and \u201cIf you see someone whom you love (or see yourself) as of a kind, that may change your entire set of perceptions.\u201d I don\u2019t doubt I\u2019m oversimplifying Hacking\u2019s philosophy, but I\u2019ll wager he\u2019d approve of my using his concept to improve my young daughter\u2019s life.I didn\u2019t want a label, but finally something forced me back to a doctor, seeking answers.Ruby and her baby sister, Ellie, and I had visited my friend Marisa in Long Island. On the rocky beach, the girls scrambled gleefully while I darted after them, minding the slippery seaweed, the points of driftwood. Marisa moved slower, free of that maternal pathology, the sense of keeping catastrophe at bay.Later, in the kitchen, Ruby yelped and took several jagged steps sideways before falling down. I knelt over her and saw her eyes beating to the left, her mouth peeled in a grimace, her body out of her control.I made myself say it aloud: \u201cShe just had a seizure.\u201d The time had come.The EEGs and brain M.R.I. were, somewhat surprisingly, normal. But the neurologist suggested we follow up with genetics. So here we were, spilling all the secrets of our blood.But I didn\u2019t completely abandon my skepticism. For one thing, I did not embrace the name on the website: GATAD2B Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorder. It defined \u201cGAND\u201d as a syndrome characterized by \u201cintellectual disability, low muscle tone, and limited speech.\u201dBefore her diagnosis, all there was to know about Ruby had come directly from her. The lack of expectations was wearying, but it was a freedom that\u2019s afforded to people without disabilities \u2014 a right.At 9 years old, Ruby had never been identified as intellectually disabled. In fact, no one had even counseled me to switch from calling her \u201cdevelopmentally delayed\u201d to \u201cdevelopmentally disabled.\u201dThere\u2019s always been a question as to how to parse Ruby\u2019s challenges. How much of it is her body inhibiting her mind?When she was 5, she had a neuropsychological evaluation. She couldn\u2019t read, and her vocabulary was tiny. It was obvious her body made things difficult for her, and I watched her slide around the chair, distracted; watched her carefully place a block to imitate a pattern and then knock it over with the side of her hand. No credit.He spoke of a \u201cdomino effect\u201d \u2014 apraxia had severely impacted Ruby\u2019s language development and \u201cprevented all cylinders kicking in and developing at an age appropriate level.\u201d Her few sparkling \u201clow average\u201d scores, though, made him \u201cfeel like we\u2019re not dealing with a MR/cognitive thing.\u201dShe\u2019s been making her way with all kinds of impairments, and only now, because of her genetic diagnosis, she\u2019ll be labeled intellectually disabled. It\u2019s not going to make things easier for her. I met another mother of an older child with a mutation in the same gene; she hadn\u2019t shared the diagnosis with his school. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to know that,\u201d she said. For children given diagnoses before they enter the school system, the label \u201cGAND\u201d will explain everything about them, and hiding it will not be possible.Bearing witness to the mapping of meaning onto this gene has shown me how correct Hacking was. Ruby is one of a brand-new kind of person whose definition barely exists, and yet I can already see the generalizations \u2014 less nuanced, poorer, overlooking a lot \u2014 hovering around her.With diagnoses of ultrarare genetic conditions increasing and our reflexive embrace of medicine\u2019s authoritative perspective, we must wonder, who is in the position to tell the world what is true about people who are unusual and complicated?Advertisement"}

SoHo, once the stomping ground of artists and punk rockers, is a high-end shopping mall.

{"Headline": "The Truth in Trump\u2019s Law-Enforcement Hypocrisy ", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs a public defender, I\u2019m not mad at how well Manafort and Cohen have been treated. I just want that same treatment for my clients. Mr. Hechinger is a senior staff attorney and the director of policy at the Brooklyn Defender Services, a public defense law firm representing 30,000 people arrested in Brooklyn each year. President Trump has a long history of callousness and hostility toward the plight of those involved in the criminal justice system. So for me, a public defender, one of the most surprising developments of the past two years has been to see him, of all people, vilify the kinds of aggressive law enforcement tactics and unfair prosecutorial practices that criminal justice reform advocates have been challenging for decades.Needless to say, Mr. Trump\u2019s apparent justice renaissance has nothing to do with how our criminal justice system actually operates, and has always operated, for communities of color and people living in poverty, the vast majority of those who face arrest and prosecution in this country.No, he is outraged by how the system treats his friends. Still, it would be a mistake to dismiss his outrage over the government\u2019s ability to turn a person\u2019s life upside down as mere hypocrisy.The framers of our Constitution were equally concerned. Over half the protections in the Bill of Rights restrict government action against people suspected of committing crimes.The cases that have pushed Mr. Trump to criticize American criminal justice, however, only underscore our two-tiered system. Mr. Manafort, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Page are among the increasingly rare defendants for whom criminal \u201cjustice\u201d has worked relatively well. These exceptional cases actually illustrate how the system could do far better for the rest.Take Mr. Manafort\u2019s experience with pretrial detention. Despite the seriousness of the allegations and his clear ability to flee, he was not in jail for a majority of his case pretrial. He and his attorneys were able to arrange an intricate bail package that was tailored to his financial circumstances, including $10 million bond and the surrender of his passport. This is how bail is supposed to work \u2014 not as punishment to lock someone up before a conviction, but as a way to guarantee that the accused will return to court while at liberty. Mr. Manafort was detained pretrial only after the presiding judge found evidence of witness tampering, following nearly two weeks of motion practice and then oral argument while Mr. Manafort continued to sleep in his own bed.This kind of accommodation is unheard-of for the roughly quarter million people, my clients included, in jail for no reason other than their inability to pay bail. In the real world, despite the constitutional prohibition on excessive bail, decisions to detain people happen in a matter of seconds, with little to no consideration of an individual\u2019s ability to pay. In just the past month alone, prosecutors requested and judges set bail totaling over $200,000 on clients of mine who, collectively, could not have afforded one one-thousandth of that.Mr. Cohen was privileged to be able to make an informed decision, unburdened by time constraints and the inherent pressures of jail, about whether to accept the government\u2019s plea offer. Paul Manafort\u2019s recent guilty plea came only after he had the benefit of a full preview of the strength and scope of the government\u2019s evidence in his previous jury trial.Just look at how my clients are treated and you will understand the real reasons that about 95 percent of convictions in the system are the result of guilty pleas. Unlike Mr. Manafort\u2019s experience, my clients are forced to make decisions without knowing the evidence against them, often detained away from their families who would offer them solace, with limited access to private space, critical tools and technology to assist in their defense, and deprived the ease of working collaboratively with their attorneys that is so necessary for optimal representation. By contrast, my clients are routinely targeted, stopped and frisked without any warrant at all. I now represent a 19-year-old so afraid of being stopped again for no reason by the police that he fears walking a block to get a sandwich at his corner deli. Even when the police seek a warrant in advance, they often cite confidential informants, who may or may not exist, and the alleged observations of discredited police officers with little to no internal oversight before judges sign off. Searches are executed in early-morning home raids in which police break down doors, guns drawn, and order everyone, including children, onto the ground to be cuffed. My clients rarely get to challenge these constitutional violations. They are forced to give up their right to a hearing to contest the legality of government intrusion in exchange for more favorable guilty pleas.This is the difference between justice for the masses and justice for the few. I\u2019m not upset at how well Mr. Trump\u2019s friends and colleagues have been treated. After all, the Constitution worked for them. I just want that same treatment for my clients.Mr. Trump and his friends are the lucky ones. We should not begrudge their privilege. We should demand that same treatment for all.Advertisement"}

In addition, some of the networks are not as secure as their companies claim.But after events like the Equifax hack, the repeal of net neutrality rules and Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, downloads of Hotspot Shield spiked.It\u2019s a little perplexing, since a VPN would not have protected people affected by any of those events. David Gorodyansky, the founder and chief executive of AnchorFree, said they had pushed typical consumers to take privacy and security more seriously.Hotspot Shield has been downloaded 650 million times. Lately, it has averaged 250,000 downloads a day. For most of the summer, it has been the top-grossing app in its category in the Apple App Store, and in the top 50 over all, according to the app-ranking site App Annie. AnchorFree\u2019s other apps, Betternet and HexaTech, ranked high on the App Store charts this week, as well as competing VPN apps owned by Norton, McAfee and a variety of obscure companies.\u201cTwo years ago, there were no privacy or security apps in the top 100,\u201d Mr. Gorodyansky said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a massive shift.\u201dVirtual private network technology is open-sourced, or freely available to use, making it easy for anyone to enter the market. There are hundreds of VPN apps. Some, including AnchorFree, have built additional technology on top of the open-source software.Some free services log users\u2019 browsing data and sell it or turn it over to governments when asked. Others say they are based in the United States or the Cayman Islands but actually operate out of countries with censorious governments.Still others obscure what a VPN can actually protect people from.\u201cThey are marketing themselves as \u2018sprinkle our security or privacy dust on your device and suddenly it will become private and secure,\u2019\u201d said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights.AnchorFree made for an attractive venture investment because the technology it has built on top of the open-sourced VPN software makes it faster than other VPN services, said Sujay Jaswa, a partner at WndrCo, the investment firm that led the latest round of financing. Many of AnchorFree\u2019s competitors license its technology, including Bitdefender, Dashlane, Kaspersky and McAfee.AnchorFree\u2019s tech is also prevalent in smartphones and the products of telecommunications companies. Samsung Galaxy phones come loaded with AnchorFree\u2019s VPN software; Verizon and Telef\u00f3nica license it as well. The companies split revenue earned from anyone who becomes a paying customer.The company said it has been profitable since 2010. It has just 110 employees; 80 are engineers, and it has no salespeople. Hotspot Shield is free, but a small percentage of users pay a monthly fee for extra features, including faster internet speeds, the ability choose their internet server, and added protection from phishing, malware and spam. The company recently added a product specifically for businesses.In 2017, the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that promotes digital rights, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate AnchorFree and Hotspot Shield, accusing the company of deceptively redirecting users to certain websites and sharing data.AnchorFree, which has denied the allegations, declined to comment on the investigation. But after the criticism, the company rewrote its terms of service, to avoid legalese, and AnchorFree began to release transparency reports. The first one, issued in November, showed the company received 81 requests for user data from government agencies in the first 10 months of 2017 and 79 in 2016. AnchorFree complied with none of the requests.Hotspot Shield does not log any of its users\u2019 activity, Mr. Gorodyansky said. As a result, the company could not provide the data to the government.\u201cOur conversations are super simple,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no data. End of story.\u201dThe latest round of funding comes from WndrCo along with Accel Partners, 8VC, SignalFire and Green Bay Ventures. AnchorFree would not disclose its valuation or revenue.AnchorFree said it would use the capital to expand into related areas, such as security for internet-connected devices (say, smart doorbells or thermostats). The company will also pursue acquisitions, potentially of companies with sales teams in place.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the AnchorFree competitors that licenses its technology. It is McAfee, not TunnelBear, a VPN service that McAfee acquired this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Play Our Way to a Better Democracy", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf we want saner politics, we need to start building better foundations from the playground up.When Alexis de Tocqueville toured America in 1831, he concluded that one secret of our success was our ability to solve problems collectively and cooperatively. He praised our mastery of the \u201cart of association,\u201d which was crucial, he believed, for a self-governing people.The trend has continued in the 2000s. Recess and free play time were reduced to make room for more standardized testing and academic work. Homework became common for even the youngest schoolchildren. After-school playtime morphed into structured activities overseen by adults. The constant presence of adults is intended to keep children safe, but what are its likely effects? How might kids deprived of opportunities for free play, risk-taking and self-governance differ from previous generations when they leave the nest? We would expect two main areas of difficulty.Unsupervised play is the perfect apprenticeship for Tocqueville\u2019s art of association, but this art can be lost if children are prevented from practicing it. Professor Horwitz\u2019s essay warns us that play deprivation will likely lead to a \u201ccoarsening of social interaction\u201d that will \u201ccreate a world of more conflict and violence, and one in which people\u2019s first instinct will be increasingly to invoke coercion by other parties to solve problems they ought to be able to solve themselves.\u201dIf such a future comes to pass, it will not be the fault of today\u2019s young people. It will be the result of well-meaning parents, teachers and college administrators who tried to protect young people from harm without understanding that overprotection itself is harmful.Democracy is hard. It demands teamwork, compromise, respect for rules and a willingness to engage with other opinionated, vociferous individuals. It also demands practice. The best place to get that practice may be out on the playground.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I Was Sexually Assaulted by Another Marine. The Corps Didn\u2019t Believe Me.", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt WarI would never have guessed that closure would come to me in a small courtroom in Manhattan, Kan. A year and a half ago, on my 34th birthday, I sat on a witness stand and recounted how I was sexually assaulted on New Year\u2019s Day 2006 by a fellow Marine \u2014 someone I had considered a friend while we were deployed to the Horn of Africa.This wasn\u2019t the first time I had told my story in front of a judge. Seven months after the incident occurred, my assault was the impetus for a military court-martial. I flew to MacDill Air Force Base, in Florida, with three other Marines from my unit, to testify against our assailant in front of a military judge. That judge found our testimony not conclusive enough for a conviction. According to the defense, we were liars, telling stories meant to ruin the career of another Marine who happened to come from a different place, geographically and culturally: He was a Midwesterner from a religious background, and we were from the Northeast and not accustomed to his kind of Christian fundamentalism. That we would try to conspire against this Marine for those differences was easier for the judge to accept than the truth: that a male Marine had sexually assaulted other male Marines. At that time, male-on-male sexual assault was not something that society was ready to talk about or think about, especially in a subculture as driven by the norms of heterosexual masculinity as the Marine Corps is.In the immediate aftermath of my assault, my own thoughts spun in an orbit of stunned disbelief. I couldn\u2019t stop asking myself, \u201cDid that really just happen to me?\u201d I\u2019m not sure that feeling has ever totally left. My disorientation only worsened when I reported what had happened and the first question from my chain of command was, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not making this up?\u201d That line of questioning, that attack on the victim\u2019s credibility, persisted right up until the trial seven months later. And at the trial, it won.Long after the attack itself is over, you\u2019re left dealing with all the toxic doubts and self-blame that come with being sexually assaulted. I fought with the idea that I somehow invited this upon myself, that I deserved it or was somehow to blame for the assault. It stripped away my confidence and degraded the trust I had in my fellow Marines. I questioned the values that I first bought into when I became a Marine: the belief in honor, courage and commitment that was instilled by our drill instructors. I didn\u2019t immediately confront my attacker face to face \u2014 so where was my courage or honor? How would I react to real combat? Where was the commitment from my fellow Marines, when I needed support in the aftermath of the attack? Would they be there for me if I needed their help on the battlefield one day?I was promoted to corporal in June 2006, a few months after returning home from deployment. Though I had earned the title and the authority of a leadership position, my self-esteem had been ruined. I was a Marine who, while sleeping, had been sexually touched by another Marine, inappropriately and without consent \u2014 and I hadn\u2019t done anything about it. A real Marine would have fought back, I thought. A real leader would have resorted to violence as an immediate and instinctual means of retribution against his attacker. My inaction that night crippled me, and I had no way to fix it. And the response of my fellow Marines only made things worse. In a Marine unit nothing stays a secret forever, and my confidence was misplaced when I trusted in my noncommissioned officers to keep my story quiet. Within days my story had spread throughout our small camp. Usually, when a Marine finds a weakness or something another Marine is insecure about, he is relentless in attacking it. It\u2019s how Marines bond, in their own aggressive, competitive way. So I took the constant references to the incident when they came my way. I laughed along, hoping to be in on the jokes, instead of being the subject of them. To do anything else would be to admit how deeply I was struggling with what had happened.During the court-martial, the defense lawyer built his case on challenging the character of me and my peers. We were called liars and co-conspirators. Our integrity, honor and loyalty to the Marine Corps were questioned. By the time it was over, the Marine Corps had failed me three times: It had failed to take my claims seriously; then made my attacker out to be the victim and me the criminal; and finally failed to provide adequate support and resources in the aftermath of my assault (whether through access to sexual-assault counseling or something as simple as believing my story).In the years since then, I came to realize that it wasn\u2019t the assault that had the most enduring effect on me. It was people\u2019s refusal to believe that one man would assault another man. It was the mockery from leaders I had trusted and the implication that, if it had happened, I must have done something to invite it. The second trauma of losing that support structure was orders of magnitude worse than the first. I could no longer wear the same uniform as the person who had assaulted me and the many more who had let him get away with it. In 2007, I left the organization I had once so deeply loved and accepted a commission with the Army Reserve. I promised myself that no soldier under my leadership would experience the anguish that I had. Every year, I sit down with my soldiers and tell them my story, so that they won\u2019t feel ashamed to come forward if something similar happens to them. I want them to know they will be treated with respect and empathy.Ten years after my assault, I received a call from a detective in Kansas who was building a case against the man who had assaulted me. After he had left the Marine Corps, he had continued assaulting and violating people. In 2010 he had been convicted of a sexual assault, but served no prison time. Now he was facing 54 years for sexually assaulting three male soldiers from the Army post at Fort Riley. I was asked to testify to help build the case against him. On my birthday, I left my wife and 2-year-old daughter at home to retell the story of what had happened to me that night in the Horn of Africa \u2014 a story that, a decade before, no one had believed.I felt no cascade of emotion when the guilty verdict came down, with a prison sentence of 49 years \u2014 only relief that my assailant was finally held accountable for what he had done and heartbreak that he had managed to hurt at least four other men before that happened. I also felt vindicated. Someone had finally listened to me and believed in my story. I opened Facebook Messenger and typed out a message to my old team leader: \u201cI wish you had believed me.\u201d Then I quickly deleted it. Instead, I fired off an email to my Army Reserve staff, the men and women that I\u2019m in charge of leading and teaching. It said, \u201cWhat do you want your legacy to be, and what did you do to accomplish that today?\u201dJustin Rose is a U.S. Army captain.

One year, the students would be enrolled; the next year, they wouldn\u2019t be. Sometimes they left in the middle of the year.Over a two-year period, the number of Latino students in these counties fell 10 percent \u2014 or by almost 300,000 children. The vast majority of the children who disappeared from the rolls were American citizens. Some moved elsewhere in the United States, while others likely left, returning to the countries where their parents had been born.So what was going on in these 55 counties?The I.C.E. partnerships are a fairly recent phenomenon. They were part of a law passed in 1996, and the partnerships didn\u2019t really begin to grow until 2007, under the George W. Bush administration. But it was not clear how much of an effect they had.I understand that some Americans will view the price that these children have paid \u2014 and are still paying \u2014 as an unavoidable side-effect of proper law enforcement: Someone in their family violated the law, by entering this country illegally.

{"Headline": "20 Wines Under $20: When Any Night Can Be a Weeknight ", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe PourWhen you come home and you just want to flop, you want a wine that is inexpensive and undemanding. But that doesn\u2019t mean the wine can\u2019t be great. 21 PhotosWeeknight wines are a genre of their own, but don\u2019t take the phrase too literally.Plenty of people work weekends. Their days off might be Tuesdays and Wednesdays. On those days they might spend a few hours in the kitchen to prepare something brilliant, worthy of an extraordinary and expensive bottle of wine.What happens on their Saturday evenings? Just another night of coming home from work, changing into comfies and flopping on the couch in front of the TV. Those are times for eating something easy to prepare and drinking something simple and moderately priced, wines that do not require rapt attention or prolonged contemplation.But that doesn\u2019t mean the wines can\u2019t be great.Greatness in a wine is not solely a measure of complexity or profundity. It\u2019s also a gauge of how well it matches a particular occasion, and how well it fulfills its reason for being.Yet, weeknight wines can be full of character. They can express a place, a vision and a culture just as fancy bottles left to age for years might do. Wines that can do this and still be inexpensive are great weekday wines, like these 20 bottles, each under $20.If you want something better, a wine that may not always be predictable but more often than not will be delicious and inspiring because it represents a people and a culture and a love of wine, then a few extra dollars is a worthwhile investment. It depends on what you value.For wines like that, which require hard work and are made with few technological or laboratory shortcuts, the question is not why do they cost so much, but how do they cost so little?One reason is that few of these wines come from high-status areas. You will not find among this selection the great villages of Burgundy or Napa Valley. You will find wines from Croatia, South Africa, Greece and Chile, and bottles from little-known regions of historic wine-producing countries, like a good verdicchio from the Marche in Italy. In all, these 20 bottles, listed in no particular order, come from 11 countries.Guess what else? These are all pretty good on your days off, too.It\u2019s fair to say that Italy has not always done well by verdicchio. It\u2019s a grape of great potential, capable of making lovely, intense, complex wines. Too often, when planted in the wrong places, overcropped or made carelessly, it disappoints. But good ones, like this wine from La Staffa, grown in the Castelli di Jesi region in the northern Marche near the Adriatic, reawaken curiosity. It is fresh, crisp and refreshing, with flavors of peaches and citrus and underlying minerality. (Artisanal Cellars, White River Junction, Vt.)Aside from the Loire Valley, South Africa is the other major home for the chenin blanc grape. It has not always been easy to find good examples of these bottles in the United States, but this one is excellent, with classic chenin blanc character: aromas of flowers, honey and beeswax, richly textured and not heavy, with a pleasing dose of minerality. (Vine Street Imports, Mt. Laurel, N.J.)The Mullineuxs, a husband-and-wife team, make excellent syrahs and chenin blancs from the Swartland region of South Africa. Kloof Street is their entry-level label and gives a good impression of their style. This wine is 84 percent syrah, with cinsault and carignan making up the rest. It\u2019s got a savory syrah aroma with an unexpected bright, juicy, floral note. (Skurnik Wines, New York)The phrase \u201cMediterranean wines\u201d rarely conjures up Croatia, but the country has a gorgeous coastline along the Adriatic Sea, made notable by the beautiful cities of Split and Dubrovnik. Alen Bibic of Bibich makes wine in the region of Skradin north of Split, focusing on indigenous grapes, like this blend of babic, plavina and lasin. It\u2019s deliciously spicy, with just a touch of oak. (Blue Danube, Los Altos Hills, Calif.)The Giacometti estate is on an isolated plain on the northern end of the gorgeous island of Corsica. Its wines tend to be easygoing and inviting, like the juicy, generous Cru des Agriate, which is made primarily with niellucciu, a grape that is genetically identical to sangiovese, but, when planted in the Corsican earth, has very much its own identity. This is a pleasingly fruity wine, with an underlying earthiness that pulls it all together. (Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant, Berkeley, Calif.)Compelling albari\u00f1os are not easy to find, but this one, made of organically grown grapes, is delicious, with depth and presence. It is steely and bone dry, with aromas and flavors of apples, herbs and minerals. Perfect for your next shellfish feast. (Owen Kotler Selections, Seattle)While Weinviertel is not one of Austria\u2019s high-status riesling areas (like Wachau), the wines can be very good and are generally reasonably priced. The 2015 Falkenstein from D\u00fcrnberg is dry and minerally. It reminds me of a gray cloud, a kind of moody riesling, albeit tangy and delicious. (Massanois, New York)Blaufr\u00e4nkisch, from the Burgenland region of eastern Austria, is one of the more underestimated grapes. Still it has the ability to make bright, juicy wines with an underlying chalky minerality, like this entry-level beauty from the cool 2016 vintage. If you love pinot noir, give yourself a treat and try a good blaufr\u00e4nkisch. (Schatzi Wines, Milan, N.Y.)Vallana is one of the historic producers of the Alto Piemonte in the foothills of the Alps, the other great source of nebbiolo wines beyond the Langhe in the Piedmont region of Italy. From appellations like Ghemme, Boca and Gattinara, these spanna wines, as nebbiolo is called in that area, can last for decades. This bottle, from the Colline Novaresi zone, is an introductory wine, easygoing and relatively gentle, focused, floral and dark edged, with just enough tannic grip to remind you that, yes, this is nebbiolo. (Skurnik Wines)The world has discovered the joys of great Beaujolais. Nonetheless, amid the bottles now selling for $40 to $50, you can still find terrific bottles from excellent producers for under $20, like this Morgon from Louis Claude Desvignes. This is the introduction to the Desvignes range of Morgons, but it is still deep, long and intensely mineral, with a silky texture and just a touch of refreshing bitterness. (Louis/Dressner Selections)It\u2019s a bit of a mystery: The production company is Compa\u00f1ia Vin\u00edcola del Norte de Espa\u00f1a, or CVNE. The wine itself is Cune, and both acronyms are pronounced COO-nay. Regardless, this wine, with spicy red fruit caressed by oak flavors that blend in seamlessly, is classically styled Rioja, aged by the producer and still under $20. (Skurnik Wines)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tariff and Trade Disputes Are More Than a Money Problem", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesThat may sound hyperbolic. But two Yale law professors, Oona A. Hathaway and Scott J. Shapiro, make a persuasive case that the world could become a far more dangerous place if the Trump administration seriously disrupts the global consensus that has been in place for decades.\u201cImperfect as it may be, the world operates under the understanding that war is illegal and trade sanctions are a legal method of punishing aggressive behavior,\u201d Professor Shapiro said. \u201cBut sanctions only work with a healthy regime of international trade, and under the rule of international law. That is all coming into question now.\u201dThe Chinese authorities quickly retaliated with new levies on $60 billion in American products. And the United States also has trade disputes brewing with several allies. The costs for consumers, businesses and the world economy are being closely tallied.But the two scholars say the administration\u2019s aggressive approach could have a much higher cost: It could unravel a complex series of rules and agreements that have served to moderate the behavior of great powers like the United States, China, the Soviet Union and, now, Russia.In a provocative book, \u201cThe Internationalists: How a Radical Plan to Outlaw War Remade the World\u201d (Simon & Schuster, 2017), they provide a history of international law. They say the relative prosperity and peace of the post-World War II world owes a great deal to a now-obscure international treaty \u2014 the Kellogg-Briand Pact.At stake are even bigger issues, the professors say.Consider, Professor Hathaway said, what kind of a world we could be re-entering, if the Trump administration\u2019s escalation of its conflicts with other nations were to shred the current international consensus.\u201cSome pivotal principles are at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cRecall that punishing aggressive behavior through trade sanctions was illegal before the treaty in 1928, and acquiring territory through war was legal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut in 1928, and with the rules that gradually developed, that was reversed.\u201dShe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that if you disrupt the world trading system \u2014 and the consensus outlawing war that is in place today \u2014 you are disrupting the financial means of punishing violations of war. In the end, you may be left with nothing but reliance on force.\u201dWithout robust trade, she said, geopolitical disputes over such issues as dominion over the South China Sea could flare more easily into military confrontations between great powers. Mutually beneficial commerce \u2014 and the need to abide by the international rules that make it possible \u2014 have successfully moderated the behavior of sovereign states.That has been the explicit aim of a succession of United States presidents, starting with Richard M. Nixon, who sought to give China \u2014 formerly an isolated Communist giant \u2014 a stake in the world economy and in the American-dominated global economic and political system put in place in the aftermath of World War II.This has never been entirely smooth. Disagreements over the terms of trade and the structure of the Chinese economy have rankled Americans since the early 1980s, when China entered the modern world economy. But given their political and economic differences, China and the United States have had a remarkably calm relationship until now.Strong, respectful negotiating to improve the relative standing of the United States is entirely appropriate, Professor Shapiro said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would defend the current system as being perfect. Far from it. But there\u2019s a difference between trying to reform the system from within, and blowing it up, which is what seems to be happening.\u201dFor example, he said, the day-to-day rules and arbitration procedures of the World Trade Organization don\u2019t usually attract much attention, but they are crucial if trade is to proceed smoothly \u2014 and peacefully \u2014 around the world.In a remarkable turnabout, he threatened to use economic sanctions \u2014 which became a prime tool for enforcing international law as a result of the Kellogg-Briand Pact \u2014 as weapons to deter the court\u2019s judges from enforcing international law, Professor Hathaway said.Furthermore, Mr. Bolton has in the past condemned the W.T.O. as well, generally advocating a unilateral approach by the United States and an end to the decision-making process enshrined in the organization.Under the circumstances, boring, negotiated resolutions to the current trade disputes would be a happy ending, Professor Hathaway said. What the world may face instead, is the dismal prospect of conflict without the rules or means for resolving it peacefully. The United States would remain a powerful player in that world, but it would be playing a much more dangerous game.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

Worse yet, L.A. had been outright shunned in recent summers by the league\u2019s top free agents.The Lakers\u2019 struggles to connect with the biggest names in the game, especially in the wake of Kobe Bryant\u2019s retirement in April 2016, are a big reason the club\u2019s controlling owner, Jeanie Buss, appointed Magic Johnson as president of basketball operations without warning in February 2017.Then, at 5:05 p.m. California time on July 1, it happened: LeBron James announced via his agent Rich Paul\u2019s Twitter feed that he had decided to leave his home-state Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 for the second time \u2014 to sign the four-year contract Buss and Johnson offered him.Just like that, the Lakers became the Lakers again.Or so they hope.That was arguably the last time one of James\u2019s teams, in the eyes of preseason prognosticators, was seen as a better bet to miss the playoffs entirely rather than to win the N.B.A. championship.James\u2019s demeanor would suggest he already recognizes how much work and meshing it will take for this group \u2014 without a clearly established second superstar \u2014 to get anywhere near the Western Conference elite as currently constituted.\u201cWe got a long way to go to get to Golden State,\u201d James told reporters, referring to the two-time defending champion Warriors.Perhaps seeking to play down expectations, James also insisted that the 2018-19 Lakers should not be judged solely on whether they win the championship. \u201cThere\u2019s only one champ,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not successful.\u201d(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Henry Wessel was a New Jersey native, but California enthralled him from the moment he arrived in Los Angeles in 1969.\u201cI walked out of the airport into one of those clear, sharp-edged January days,\u201d he said. \u201cThe light had such physical presence; it looked as though you could lean against it.\u201dThat light became a fixture of many of his photographs, which offer black-and-white glimpses of vernacular scenes in the American West. One of his most well-known images, \u201cSanta Barbara, Calif., 1977,\u201d draws the viewer in with the axial light of the early morning sun.Mr. Wessel was never without his Leica and became a cornerstone of the photography program at the San Francisco Art Institute.

{"Headline": "Photographing an Indelicate but Deadly Subject", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLens\u201cIt almost seemed so ridiculous that I had to do it,\u201d Ms. Bruce said. \u201cBut once you start researching you realize that it\u2019s among the most important issues today, affecting nearly a billion people. If you don\u2019t have proper sanitation, you don\u2019t have clean drinking water, and then you don\u2019t have a healthy population.\u201d Ms. Bruce said her challenge was to take a complex story that was difficult \u201cto make visual\u201d and produce images that would engage and educate her audience. The photos are on display this week at the Visa Pour l\u2019Image photography festival in Perpignan, France. Toilets that safely dispose of waste save lives because human feces spread diseases like cholera, diarrhea, typhoid and hepatitis. But Ms. Bruce discovered in her research that 950 million people around the world \u2014 with more than half of those in India alone \u2014 routinely relieve themselves outside. Around 60 percent of the global population either have no toilet at home or one that doesn\u2019t safely dispose of human waste, according to the United Nations, while 1.8 billion people drink water from contaminated sources.Ms. Bruce photographed in Haiti, India and Vietnam, countries that have had varying degrees of success in providing safe indoor toilets for their citizens. The Vietnamese government made providing indoor toilets in public schools and houses a priority and has largely succeeded, Ms. Bruce said. Schoolchildren were educated on using toilets and washing hands and were encouraged to spread the practice to their families. In most communities she visited, most homes had indoor toilets and practiced \u201chealthy sanitation,\u201d she said.Haiti, beset by natural disasters, a lack of infrastructure and poor sanitation, has had a more difficult path. When Hurricane Matthew hit Haiti, Ms. Bruce covered it as spot news for the National Geographic\u2019s website, including documenting its effect on sanitation and the availability of indoor toilets for her project. She also photographed the people she sees as the \u201cunsung heroes of sanitation in Haiti,\u201d the \u201cbayakou\u201d who often strip down and climb into pit latrines to clean them out. By hand. \u201cThey only work at night because people throw rocks at them, and even their family members often don\u2019t know what they do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re like masked superheroes.\u201dIndia\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned on ending the unsanitary practice and set a deadline for Gandhi\u2019s 150th birthday in October of next year. He has set aside more than $40 billion to build latrines and toilets and change public behavior. But in a country the size of India, with its large and sluggish bureaucracy, Ms. Bruce said, that ambitious target may not be met. Open defecation is particularly dangerous for women and girls who are vulnerable to rape when they walk away from their houses to relieve themselves in private. Ms. Bruce often photographed women going out in the fields as a group, \u201cbecause there\u2019s safety in numbers,\u201d she said. Even worse, the lack of toilets in schools often leads girls to drop out once they start menstruating because there is no privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s not a sexy topic or as dramatic as some war zone photos, but it causes just as much death and destruction.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After the Battle: A Warning From Mosul ", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOrganized combat in Iraq\u2019s second city ended more than a year ago, but the city remains crippled by deadly munitions that still lie hidden beneath huge mounds of rubble.Mr. Lodhammar leads the United Nations mine-clearing effort in Iraq.Here, more than a year after the formal end of fighting that drove out the Islamic State\u2019s fighters, the path to recovery runs literally through a three-dimensional minefield with the dangers of war still present everywhere. Explosive hazards implanted by the Islamic State, too dangerous and numerous to deactivate, still strew destruction, allowing the terrorist group to continue fighting in absentia and on the cheap. Their strategy has been, in a word, shrewd: Retreat from Mosul only after making life unlivable by making infrastructure all but impossible to fix.  I.E.D.s are everywhere \u2014 lethal needles placed in haystacks of uncleared rubble, some triggered by infrared sensors, some by tripwires.Teams like ours from the United Nations Mine Action Service (Unmas) find the needles, but the going is slow: They can never be sure how many still lie there as they assess the risk, probe, and render safe the armaments that they find.The work takes a practiced eye and a delicate touch. Tools range from hook-and-line kits used to disarm I.E.D.s to armored heavy equipment that can help dispose of 500-pound bombs buried under several feet of debris. Both tasks take time, lots of it. At the present pace, clearing just Mosul is expected to take teams like ours at least 10 more years.Sometimes the I.E.D.s provide sad and grisly evidence of Islamic State tactics. More than once, our teams in Mosul have found suicide belts among the corpses of unwilling human shields, deployed by the terrorists to cover their retreat. The victims included children, some not more than 10 years old. After each new discovery, heavy equipment on the scene to clear the site of explosive hazards would stop work to allow the government to recover, identify and return the remains for proper burial.Is another $5 billion spent over 10 years enough to free Iraq of explosive hazards? Perhaps, but nobody can be sure. Working at our current pace, Unmas in Iraq can expect an unfunded shortfall of $170 million for 2018 alone, despite generous support from 11 countries that make voluntary contributions to the United Nations, our sole source of funding. For the international community at large, one reason to step up efforts to accomplish more, and quicken the pace, should be clear: Delaying stabilization works to the Islamic State\u2019s advantage and against Iraq\u2019s people and efforts to pacify the region. Stabilization can ultimately deprive terrorists of a safe haven, but it can\u2019t begin without the clearance of deadly hazards.As soon as areas are cleared, work crews from other agencies \u2014 notably the United Nations Development Program \u2014 can seamlessly move in to make stabilization a bricks-and-motor proposition, even here in parts of devastated Mosul. The repaired Al Qasoor Water Treatment Plant now supplies clean and safe water to more than 300,000 people. In Nineveh Province, clearance work has allowed the High Court to access deeds that validate land claims of residents seeking return.Hanging in the balance is the future of Iraq, already a middle-income country and primed for recovery. Each of the 1.9 million displaced persons still waiting to return safely home to resume a normal life in a normal community bolsters Iraq\u2019s own chances for a turnaround. But not before their homes are free of hazards, the roads are safe to travel, the power works, and basic services are restored.  After open combat in Idlib ends, the recovery needed to achieve true pacification among bitter enemies and terrorist renegades will begin. As in Mosul, we expect I.E.D.s and unexploded munitions to complicate and challenge a recovery that is long, difficult and contested by enemies of reconciliation operating as they do here \u2014 hide in plain sight and, when they choose, fight from shadows.Without a restoration of normalcy, the terrorists can still \u201cwin from home\u201d if we let them.Pehr Lodhammar is the senior program manager of the United Nations Mine Action Service in Iraq.

{"Headline": "Satellite Images and Shadow Analysis: How The Times Verifies Eyewitness Videos", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnderstanding the timesVisual investigations based on social media posts require a mix of traditional journalistic diligence and cutting-edge internet skills.Was a video of a chemical attack really filmed in Syria? What time of day did an airstrike happen? Which military unit was involved in a shooting in Afghanistan? Is this dramatic image of glowing clouds really showing wildfires in California? These are some of the questions the video team at The New York Times has to answer when reviewing raw eyewitness videos, often posted to social media. It can be a highly challenging process, as misinformation shared through digital social networks is a serious problem for a modern-day newsroom. Visual information in the digital age is easy to manipulate, and even easier to spread. The following provides some insight into our video verification process. It is not a comprehensive overview, but highlights some of our most trusted techniques and tools. We review numerous videos on any given day. In addition to news agencies, we scour social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat for news-relevant content. We also access eyewitness videos through WhatsApp, either by directly interacting with witnesses on the ground or by joining relevant groups.All of this content needs careful vetting.Our verification process is divided into two general steps: First, we determine whether a video is really new. Second, we dissect every frame to draw conclusions about location, date and time, the actors involved and what exactly happened.A major challenge for journalists today is to avoid using \u201crecycled content.\u201d This challenge is exacerbated in breaking news situations. When the U.S. launched airstrikes against Syria the night of April 13, little footage was initially available on wires and social media. As our team closely monitored Twitter that Friday night, a video started to circulate that showed a series of explosions, reportedly in Damascus. What the video actually showed, however, was fighting in the Ukrainian city of Luhansk in February 2015. This did not stop major broadcasters from using it in their coverage.Whether it\u2019s about natural disasters, school shootings or armed conflicts, we see this sort of misattributed content all the time. The more dramatic the footage, the more careful we have to be. We strive to establish the provenance of each video \u2014 who filmed it and why \u2014 and ask for permission to use it. In the perfect scenario, this involves obtaining the original video file or finding the first version of the video shared online, vetting the uploader\u2019s digital footprint and contacting the person \u2014 if it\u2019s safe to do so.Once we believe a video is genuine, we extract as much detail as possible. Since situations of armed conflict and severe state repression often make it challenging to connect with sources, for logistical or security reasons, we\u2019ve developed skills and methodologies to independently confirm or corroborate what\u2019s visible in a video.When we receive footage from wires such as The Associated Press or directly from a source\u2019s cellphone, our job is easy: Such content comes with provided or intact metadata \u2014 embedded, detailed information about what camera or cellphone was used, date and time, sometimes even exact coordinates that reveal the place.The metadata of content from social media and messaging apps, on the other hand \u2014 while it might reveal if a video was downloaded from Facebook or Twitter (which could debunk false claims from people who say they filmed an event) \u2014 comes with altered or removed metadata. We thus have to look for visual clues regarding location and date in the video itself.It\u2019s important to pay attention to the audio as well, as local dialects might help corroborate the general location.Determining the exact date and time of an incident is more challenging. We can use historical weather data to detect inconsistencies in a video, but of course that does not provide an exact date.Several projects are keeping our team busy. We have gathered security footage that \u2014 combined with shoe-leather reporting \u2014 has allowed us to reconstruct how a brutal murder in the U.S. unfolded. We are working with our international team to analyze a deadly crackdown on protests in one country and cut through the fog of war to distinguish real from fake atrocities spread on social media in another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Can\u2019t Just Let Boys Be Boys", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLocker rooms are not the place to learn about sexual ethics. Neither is the internet.Ms. Orenstein is writing a book about teenage boys, young men, emotional intimacy and sex.True enough, and maybe that influenced his ultimate insistence on an F.B.I. investigation into the allegations against the judge. But I wanted to shout something else at Senator Flake (and O.K., I admit it, I yelled it at my TV screen), something that hasn\u2019t been emphasized enough in this discussion: the message we are sending to boys.For the past two years I have been interviewing high school and college-age men for a book on their experience of physical and emotional intimacy. I\u2019m not convinced they are always reliable narrators of their own experience. At times, I can almost see the shadow of a girl behind them as they speak \u2014 a girl who is furious, traumatized, grieving over harms big and small that the boy in question simply didn\u2019t recognize, or didn\u2019t want to. At some point in our conversation, these young men usually referred to themselves as \u201cgood guys,\u201d and mostly, I would say, they were. They had also all been duly admonished by some adult in their lives \u2014 a parent, a coach \u2014 to \u201crespect women.\u201d But that, along with \u201cdon\u2019t get anyone pregnant,\u201d was pretty much the totality of their sex education. As one college sophomore said to me, \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like telling someone who\u2019s learning to drive not to run over any little old ladies and then handing him the car keys. Well, of course, you think you\u2019re not going to run over an old lady. But you still don\u2019t know how to drive.\u201dIn a quick, informal survey on Thursday, some of my interview subjects homed in on Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony that Brett Kavanaugh placed his hand over her mouth to prevent her from screaming. They were disgusted. They said that neither they nor any of their friends would ever do such a thing, and I believe them; but that repellent detail also allowed them to distance themselves from the more common coercive or nonconsensual behavior that too many young men do engage in. \u201cYou never think that you\u2019re part of the problem,\u201d a college junior in Chicago told me when explaining why he\u2019d engaged in only a single conversation with another boy about the implications of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. \u201cIt\u2019s always someone else that\u2019s the bad guy, so you never think about addressing something that doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201dIt is natural for parents to think their own sons would be incapable of sexual misconduct, but that does not absolve them of responsibility for educating their boys. Yet according to a survey of more than 3,000 18- to 25-year-olds published last year by the Making Caring Common project, which is part of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, more than 60 percent of respondents had never had a single conversation with their parents about how to be sure that your partner wants to be having sex with you. A similar share had never been told about \u201cthe importance of not pressuring someone to have sex with you.\u201dOther research has found that parents are vastly more likely to talk to their daughters about sexual readiness and disease protection, perhaps because they believe girls are more vulnerable, emotionally as well as physically. But that leaves boys to learn appropriate behavior from one another as well as the digital street corner.Boys grow up in a world in which women are either hyper-sexualized or absent. In the G-rated movies little boys watch, according to researchers at the University of Southern California, fewer than a third of the speaking characters are female \u2014 a figure that has held steady over the 10 years it has been tracked \u2014 and the percentage of skin women show is similar to that in R-rated movies (and that\u2019s not because R-rated movies have gotten more conservative). By their teen years, according to survey results released this month by PerryUndem, a research and polling firm, about half of boys say that several times a week or more they see female characters in video games presented as \u201chot,\u201d as well as \u201cunrealistic images\u201d of female bodies, or \u201cwomen whose bodies are more important than their brains or abilities\u201d on TV and in movies and videos. Frankly, 50 percent seems low \u2014 and \u201cunrealistic portrayals\u201d an almost comic euphemism.These days, many parents (myself included) have been vigilant, nearly obsessive, about providing our daughters with positive images of women to counteract the incessant messages telling them their greatest value comes from their body and appearance. We buy them \u201cNevertheless, she persisted\u201d T-shirts. We provide books and videos featuring estimable female characters. We encourage bravery, intelligence, resilience. We point out the misogyny of the culture and engage them in media critique from the time they can say \u201cSnow White.\u201d That has had an impact: Most of the young women in the PerryUndem survey believed that while sexism was still rampant, there were \u201cmany ways to be a girl.\u201d Still, that is only half the equation, and I fear that the quest for equality \u2014 including a reduction of violence against women \u2014 will stall if we don\u2019t start providing more powerful counternarratives about women\u2019s worth, particularly in sexual encounters, to boys.That education can never begin too young. Recently, a friend of mine gave birth to a baby boy. I sent him a onesie with the words \u201cWild Feminist!\u201d emblazoned on it.

{"Headline": "How to Stop Poaching and Protect Endangered Species? Forget the \u2018Kingpins\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAuthorities keep arresting people said to be bosses of wildlife trafficking, but that isn\u2019t making a dent in the problem. In 2003, enterprising criminals in Southeast Asia realized that they could exploit a loophole in South Africa\u2019s hunting laws to move rhino horns legally across international borders. Normally, North Americans and Europeans account for the bulk of South Africa\u2019s rhino hunting permits. But that year, 10 Vietnamese \u201chunters\u201d quietly applied as well. Hunters are allowed to transport legally obtained trophies across borders under various international and domestic laws. The Vietnamese hunters each returned home with the mounted horn, head or even whole body of a rhino.Word spread. Though Vietnam and other Asian countries have no history of big-game sport hunting, South Africa was soon inundated with applicants from Asia, who sometimes paid $85,000 or more to shoot a single white rhino.No one knows just how many rhino horns were actually sent back to Asia as purported hunting trophies. South Africa has records of more than 650 rhino trophies leaving the country for Vietnam from 2003 to 2010 \u2014 goods worth some $200 million to $300 million on the black market. Vietnam, however, has corresponding paperwork for only a fraction.By 2012, South African investigators had identified at least five separate Vietnamese-run criminal syndicates exploiting the pseudo-hunting loophole. Chumlong Lemtongthai, a Thai citizen, and his band of gun-toting prostitutes were surely the most remarkable of those gangs.To acquire more hunting permits, Mr. Chumlong hired more than two dozen women to pose as hunters. The women received around $550 just to hand over copies of their passports and to take a brief \u201choliday\u201d with Mr. Chumlong and his men in South Africa.Mr. Chumlong likely would have gotten away with the scheme were it not for Johnny Olivier, a fixer and interpreter in South Africa. Mr. Olivier worked for Mr. Chumlong, but after fifty or so rhino kills, his conscience began to nag at him.\u201cThis is not trophies or whatever,\u201d Mr. Olivier told me he recollected thinking. \u201cThis is now getting into slaughtering, purely for money. These rhinos are my nation\u2019s inheritance.\u201dMr. Olivier discussed Mr. Chumlong\u2019s dealings with a private investigator, who began digging. The investigator eventually compiled 222 pages of evidence. When the case went to court in 2012, South African prosecutors described Mr. Chumlong as the mastermind behind \u201cone of the biggest swindles in environmental crime history.\u201d To Mr. Chumlong\u2019s shock, and that of many observers, he was sentenced to forty years in prison.It was a punishment unheard-of in its severity, especially in a country with notoriously low rates of conviction for alleged wildlife crimes. Of 317 arrests related to rhino poaching in 2015, for example, just 15 percent resulted in guilty verdicts.But Mr. Chumlong served nowhere near 40 years. In 2014, Mr. Chumlong\u2019s sentence was reduced to 13 years in prison, plus a fine of about $78,000.This month, South Africa granted Mr. Chumlong early release after serving six years. Amid an uproar of criticism from conservation groups and government officials, he was swiftly deported to Thailand.It\u2019s not often you get to talk to a man convicted of systematic rhino slaughter. I interviewed Mr. Chumlong at the Pretoria Central Correction Center on a sunny Sunday morning in October 2016.The guards led me into a spartan office where I found Mr. Chumlong seated on a bench near the wall, wearing an orange jumpsuit with \u201cCorrections\u201d written in circular patterns all over it. Wire-rimmed glasses framed his dark eyes, and his hair, once dyed black, was shaved short and gray, matching the stubble around his chin and upper lip.I introduced myself, turned on my tape recorder and told him that I was there to hear his story. After some hesitation \u2014 he didn\u2019t appreciate how the press had depicted him in the past, without even speaking to him, he said \u2014 he agreed to talk.\u201cCan you tell me about your involvement with rhino hunting?\u201d I began.In a gush of broken English, Mr. Chumlong told me that he was a legitimate businessman who recruited Asian tourists to hunt in South Africa. \u201cI get tourists to shoot, I get commission,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m never poaching. I go legal way.\u201dHe described having what he thought were legitimate hunting permits, only to be arrested by the South African police for fraud and railroaded into jail after signing what he believed was an agreement to pay a fine.Soon enough, he was practically shaking, his eyes wide, his voice high.\u201cHe said lie to me, my lawyer! Rhino farmer go home, me go to jail 40 years!\u201dThe way he told it, it did sound possible that Mr. Chumlong had been a scapegoat for savvier criminals who took advantage of his ignorance to help get rhino horns out of the country. \u201cVixay never talk. Only me, \u2018kingpin,\u2019\u201d Mr. Chumlong scoffed. \u201cCompany, friend, family \u2014 never talk to me.\u201dMr. Chumlong\u2019s case illustrates one of the most profound obstacles to disrupting the international trade in illegal wildlife: the decentralized, constantly morphing networks along which poached goods are transported. South Africa tightened its sport hunting rules after Mr. Chumlong was arrested, and in the overall story of the illegal wildlife trade, pseudo-hunting proved a \u201ctemporary sideshow,\u201d as Ronald Orenstein, a conservationist, put it in his book \u201cIvory, Horn and Blood.\u201dStraight-up poaching and trafficking now dominate. Yet many of the players are still the same.But because of the way the poaching and trafficking networks work, taking down any one of these supposed kingpins will not stop the illegal trade.To get their prize, rhino poachers \u2014 who are often desperately poor local men living on the fringes of parks and reserves \u2014 tend to sneak in under cover of darkness, sometimes during the full \u201cpoacher\u2019s moon,\u201d as it\u2019s often called.Once in the park, they usually wait until first light to kill a rhino. Afterward, they may await well-organized pickups, or they may bury the horn for later retrieval. Others simply run home with the horn as quickly as they can.After a horn \u2014 or a tusk, bag of bones, box of scales or other animal contraband \u2014 is smuggled out of a park, the goods are usually transferred along a chain of \u201crunners\u201d who take them to larger and larger cities. At some point, Asian businessmen based in Africa are likely to get involved \u2014 generally Vietnamese bosses for rhino horn, Chinese bosses for ivory.Once the contraband begins its trafficking journey, the route often isn\u2019t direct. A China-bound ivory shipment may be sent first to Spain from Togo; a passenger carrying rhino horn may fly to Dubai before heading to Kuala Lumpur and then to Hong Kong.This roundabout travel obscures the goods\u2019 true origin and destination, and the route often reflects the placement of compromised officials who allow for a smooth journey.\u201cPeople who operate in the legal field \u2014 in government or in the transportation or wildlife industry \u2014 play a vital role in ensuring that rhino horn or any other wildlife contraband passes along the supply chain,\u201d said Annette H\u00fcbschle-Finch, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cape Town\u2019s Center for Criminology.\u201cThey are the gatekeepers and intermediaries. They provide the link between the bush and the market.\u201dTrafficking bosses themselves are often also involved in legitimate and even well-known local businesses.In the West, \u201corganized criminals live in a somewhat parallel society,\u201d said Tim Wittig, a conservation scientist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. But among wildlife traffickers, \u201cthe big criminals are typically also big business people.\u201d\u201cUsually, they\u2019re involved in logistics-type businesses \u2014 trading or shipping companies, for example \u2014 or in commodity-based ones, which is why it\u2019s easy for them to move things around,\u201d he added. These individuals are sometimes referred to as kingpins, a term that experts say is overused.\u201cIn some ways, chasing after a Mr. Big behind it all is a bit of a myth,\u201d said Julian Rademeyer, a project leader with Traffic, a conservation group, and author of \u201cKilling for Profit: Exposing the Illegal Rhino Horn Trade.\u201d One of the most important characteristics of poaching and smuggling networks is their diversity, according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on international crime at the Brookings Institution in Washington. While some networks are highly organized, others are completely dispersed. A dealer smuggling ivory out of an African port may not know the local boss overseeing poaching or the trader who eventually sells the contraband in Asia. In the cartels run by just one or a few individuals, vacuums left by arrests are quickly filled. That is why these convictions, even high-profile ones like Mr. Chumlong\u2019s, usually have little effect on shutting down illegal trade \u2014 in wildlife, drugs or any other kind of contraband, Dr. Felbab-Brown pointed out. Three recent arrests for illegal wildlife trafficking have received wide attention among conservationists: Feisal Mohamed Ali, charged with trafficking in ivory in Kenya; Abdurahman Mohammed Sheikh, another alleged ivory trafficker in Kenya; and Yang Fenglan, Tanzania\u2019s so-called queen of ivory. All have denied the charges and await trial. But even if they were all eventually found guilty, Dr. Wittig noted, their trade would account only for a meager 10.9 tons of ivory over the past decade, or the equivalent of 1,500 elephants. By Dr. Wittig\u2019s estimate, the total amount they may have trafficked accounted for just 10 percent of African ivory smuggled over that period. Nor has poaching declined since those individuals were arrested.\u201cArresting a few alleged wildlife-trafficking \u2018kingpins\u2019 may be a useful symbolic tool for promoting the importance and feasibility of strong enforcement to the general public,\u201d Dr. Wittig said. But \u201cit is not likely to be effective in actually saving protected wildlife, especially if done in isolation.\u201dChanging this largely depends on changing the way the world addresses illegal wildlife trade.John Sellar, formerly chief of enforcement for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, has argued that we should instead just think of wildlife trafficking more simply as a crime, not a conservation issue.But most of those tasked with fighting this type of crime are conservationists, rangers and wildlife managers. Mr. Sellar and other experts argue this job should instead be assigned to police, detectives, money-laundering experts and the courts. That criminal groups dealing in wildlife tend to include multinational players further complicates investigations. Governments often do not share information or effectively collaborate across borders.Dr. Wasser could produce a map showing officials and law enforcement exactly where they need to go to shut down the ivory trade in its current form. Yet most countries don\u2019t get around to sending him samples of poached ivory for a year or more after a seizure. Some refuse to share any samples at all. \u201cThat\u2019s the hardest part for me, seeing how powerful a tool we have. Yet countries are so reluctant to let us use it,\u201d Dr. Wasser said.Even officials within a country plagued by poachers may not cooperate. Police officers don\u2019t talk to customs officials who don\u2019t talk to rangers. Rangers don\u2019t have access to policymakers who don\u2019t consult conservation groups. \u201cThe intelligence environment is like spy-versus-spy,\u201d said Ken Maggs, head ranger at Kruger National Park in South Africa.Breaking up the decentralized criminal networks of poachers, experts say, will require the building of new networks among those who oppose the decimation of animal species. Arresting a few \u201ckingpins\u201d here and there will never be a substitute. \u201cIf the genie in the bottle were to grant me just one wish to combat international wildlife crime, I would ask that everyone work more collaboratively,\u201d Mr. Sellar has written. \u201cI remain convinced, utterly convinced, that we would make major inroads into combating international wildlife crime if we could only get our act together.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And Women Need to Wield It.", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "OpinionWhat the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh showed us about who gets to be angry in public.Supported byMs. Traister is the author of \u201cGood and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women\u2019s Anger.\u201dInside the room, in the morning, she spoke carefully, precisely, in a high voice; she made jokes about caffeine, asked deferentially about whether it would be O.K. to take a break. She acknowledged her terror, but remained calm, and cited her scientific expertise in how the brain responds to trauma. Her voice trembled in moments of intense recollection; it sounded as though she might be crying, though no tears appeared to fall. She described a past sexual assault and the more recent media assault on her in excruciating and vulnerable detail, but did not yell, did not betray a hint of the fury she had every reason to feel as she was forced to put her pain on display for the nation.That is how women have been told to behave when they are angry: to not let anyone know, and to joke and to be sweet and rational and vulnerable.Outside the room where Christine Blasey Ford was testifying on Thursday morning, women were incandescent with rage and sorrow and horror. They were getting angry in a new way, a public way, an unapologetic way \u2014 a way that is typically reserved for men, and that would again serve men well, when afternoon came.What happened inside the room was an exceptionally clear distillation of who has historically been allowed to be angry on their own behalf, and who has not.And outside the room was a hint of how it might be changing.Most of the time, female anger is discouraged, repressed, ignored, swallowed. Or transformed into something more palatable, and less recognizable as fury \u2014 something like tears. When women are truly livid, they often weep.Maybe we cry when we\u2019re furious in part because we feel a kind of grief at all the things we want to say or yell that we know we can\u2019t. Maybe we\u2019re just sad about the very same things that we\u2019re angry about. I wept as soon as Dr. Blasey began to speak. On social media, I saw hundreds of messages from women who reported the same experience, of finding themselves awash in tears, simply in response to this woman\u2019s voice, raised in polite dissent. The power of the moment, the anxiety that it would be futile, the grief that we even had to put her \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 through this spectacle, was intense.Whatever the connection, there\u2019s been a lot of crying in politics, and very little of it has stemmed just from women\u2019s feeling sad.[Discover the most compelling feature writing and reporting from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]Barbara Lee, the liberal Democratic representative from Northern California, knows well how to titrate rage in a palatable way; as a black woman in the House, she has had to learn. When I spoke to her last year about anger and tears, she recalled to me how the nation\u2019s first black congresswoman, Shirley Chisholm, whose presidential campaign brought a young Ms. Lee into politics, used to cry \u201cbehind closed doors when she was hurt,\u201d adding, \u201cYou know how pain leads to anger.\u201d The tears, Ms. Lee recalled, were a product of Ms. Chisholm\u2019s being \u201cvery sensitive, very hurt and very angry.\u201dAnd she was never the only one crying. In 1972, at the Democratic National Convention to which Ms. Chisholm brought her delegates, George McGovern persuaded many feminists to support him (over Ms. Chisholm and others). But Mr. McGovern then double-crossed them, instructing his delegates not to support a plank that would legalize abortion and violating an explicit promise to the women by permitting an abortion opponent to speak from the floor. The journalist (and later screenwriter) Nora Ephron covered the messy convention for Esquire: At four o\u2019clock in the morning, Ms. Ephron wrote, Gloria Steinem \u201cin tears, was confronting McGovern campaign manager Gary Hart: \u2018You promised us you would not take the low road, you bastards.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that they won\u2019t take us seriously,\u201d Ms. Steinem told Ms. Ephron through tears. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just tired of being screwed, and being screwed by my friends.\u201d Later, she said: \u201cThey won\u2019t take us seriously. We\u2019re just walking wombs.\u201dIt is a righteous diatribe, months and years of fury spilling over, and she can\u2019t get it out without weeping.\u201cWe cry when we get angry,\u201d Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s uncommon, do you?\u201d She continued, \u201cI was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she\u2019d say to the person she was talking to, \u2018You may think I am sad because I am crying. No. I am angry.\u2019 And then she just kept going. And I thought that was brilliant.\u201dTears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood. One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman \u2014 a chilly manager of whom I\u2019d always been slightly terrified \u2014 who dragged me into a stairwell. \u201cNever let them see you crying,\u201d she told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t know you\u2019re furious. They think you\u2019re sad and will be pleased because they got to you.\u201dWhen she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions \u2014 gratitude for the people who\u2019d supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism \u2014 that she got choked up.\u201cYou would have thought I\u2019d had a nervous breakdown,\u201d recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her. \u201cYou\u2019d have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor. I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone? \u2018She cried\u2019?\u201d For a while Ms. Schroeder kept what she called \u201ca crying file,\u201d a list of all the male politicians who\u2019d wept publicly that year. \u201cReagan would tear up every time he saw a flag,\u201d she remembered. Her file included John Sununu, who cried as he was stepping down as governor of New Hampshire, and George H.W. Bush, who was a steady weeper.No one would say it set men back, because most men are allowed to cry and yell the way Judge Kavanaugh did on Thursday. They are allowed to rant the way Lindsey Graham did. Their expressions of ire serve as a signal of their strength and power. This is how men get to behave, to emote, to communicate.Slowly, women are beginning to behave that way too. Ms. Gallagher, weeping but also shouting, told him, \u201cYou\u2019re telling all women that they don\u2019t matter, that they should just stay quiet because if they tell you what happened to them you are going to ignore them!\u201d \u201cLook at me when I\u2019m talking to you,\u201d she added. \u201cDon\u2019t look away from me!\u201dIf you are angry today, or if you have been angry for a while, and you\u2019re wondering whether you\u2019re allowed to be as angry as you feel, let me say: Yes. Yes, you are allowed. You are, in fact, compelled.If you\u2019ve been feeling a new rage at the flaws of this country, and if your anger is making you want to change your life in order to change the world, then I have something incredibly important to say: Don\u2019t forget how this feels.The future will come, we hope. If we survive this, if we make it better \u2014 even just a little bit better \u2014 the urgency will fade, perhaps the ire will subside, the relief may take you, briefly. And that\u2019s good, that\u2019s O.K.But then the world will come and tell you that you shouldn\u2019t get mad again, because you were kind of nuts and you never cooked dinner and you yelled at the TV and weren\u2019t so pretty and life will be easier when you get fun again. And it will be awfully tempting to put away the pictures of yourself in your pussy hat, to stuff your protest signs in the attic, and to slink back, away from the raw bite of fury, to ease back into whatever new reality is made, and maybe you\u2019ll still cry angry tears at your desk and laugh with sharp satisfaction in front of late-night television, but you won\u2019t yell anymore.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Anyone Stop Australia\u2019s Slut Shaming?", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing a spate of sexist taunts, one politician who was told to \u201cstop shagging men\u201d is fighting back.Julia Baird is a journalist at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the author of \u201cMedia Tarts: How the Australian Press Frames Female Politicians.\u201dSYDNEY, Australia \u2014 Slut shaming \u2014 that is, turning women\u2019s sexuality into a weapon that can be used against them \u2014 may be a new term, but it is an ancient practice in Australia. As recorded by the historian Sian Rees, the passage of these women \u2014 many of them former London prostitutes who had been banished to the colonies as penance \u2014 exemplified the true burden of slut shaming: its permanence. \u201cIt was a regrettable fact,\u201d Ms. Rees wrote in \u201cThe Floating Brothel: The Extraordinary True Story of an Eighteenth-Century Ship and Its Cargo of Female Convicts,\u201d \u201cthat disgraced females found \u2018their character is utterly gone, may never be retrieved\u2019, whereas disgraced males \u2018after many errors, may reform and be admitted into that same society and meet with a cordial reception as before\u2019 \u2014 but there it was, nature\u2019s way.\u201d Today, \u201cnature\u2019s way\u201d abides. We witness prominent men cheat on their wives or girlfriends, or otherwise make evident that they are sexual beings, without such revelations leading to convulsions. Women who do the same, however, are still pilloried: sluts, whores, tarts, strumpets, harlots, trollops. In recent weeks, slut shaming has become a household term in Australia, thanks to the vile public taunting of two of our female politicians. The most recent target was the Labor politician Emma Husar. When Ms. Husar found out that she had been publicly accused by a former staffer of exposing her genitals to another colleague while his young child was present, she walked to the bathroom in her Sydney home and vomited. For the record, Ms. Husar told me the flashing allegation was \u201c1000 percent fabricated\u201d by a complainant who was not even present on the occasion he says it occurred; she pointed out that, given that she\u2019d recently injured her knee and wears only pencil skirts, \u201cit was physically impossible.\u201d Two days after she announced she was leaving, the investigation\u2019s findings were released: There was \u201cmerit\u201d to staff complaints of \u201cunreasonable management,\u201d but the allegations of sexual harassment and exposing herself were unfounded. If the case of Ms. Husar demonstrates how quickly anything hinting at her sexuality \u2014 whether grounded in truth or not \u2014 can crush a woman\u2019s career, the case of another politician, Sarah Hanson-Young, provides a glimmer of hope that women can begin to erode the impact of slut shaming by naming it, condemning it, and discrediting those who seek to stigmatize them by employing it. In June, Ms. Hanson-Young, another female politician and single mother, was told to \u201cstop shagging men\u201d by a fellow senator during a parliamentary debate. The ugly spectacle of disrespect played out over several days. Ms. Hanson-Young, 36, a senator for the Greens Party, had been participating in a debate on how to stop violence against women. Just as she was making the point that, instead of focusing on arming women against attacks, we should work on preventing men from attacking them, Senator David Leyonhjelm called out from across the chamber, \u201cStop shagging men, Sarah.\u201d Mr. Leyonhjelm has refused to apologize, claiming that his remarks were justified because Ms. Hanson-Young was accusing all men of being rapists. (She was not.) Instead, he has embarked on a media campaign during which he has repeated his innuendos about Ms. Hanson-Young\u2019s sexuality. He told male presenters on Sky News that Ms. Hanson-Young was known for \u201cliking men\u201d around Canberra, and that the rumors were \u201cwell-known.\u201dMs. Hanson-Young announced in July that she was suing Mr. Leyonhjelm for defamation. It\u2019s rare for a journalist to support such a suit \u2014 but women in politics have historically had so little recourse against such obscenities that it seems fair. If she is successful \u2014 if she can wrestle this archaic weapon, slut shaming, away from her tormentor and perhaps manage to fire it back at him \u2014 she will set a new precedent. (She has reportedly just offered to settle the case for $75,000 with a verdict in her favor.)While powerful women are being shamed for things they did not do in Australia, women whose sexuality has intersected with politics are now being taken seriously in America. Where just a few decades ago, women like Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky were belittled, porn star Stormy Daniels is being held aloft like a homecoming queen, photographed by Annie Leibovitz while wearing Zac Posen for Vogue. Perhaps America has learned something.Take Candice Warner, the wife of the former vice captain of the Australian cricket team, David Warner, and an athlete in her own right. (She\u2019s a former Ironwoman.) Eleven years ago, before she married and had children with Mr. Warner, a photograph, captured by a member of the public, of her entwined with a rugby player, Sonny Bill Williams, in a toilet cubicle was made public. It\u2019s hard to imagine that all those cricket players are pristine, or celibate. And yet somehow, the sexual past of one of their wives, an episode that took place when she was 22, becomes material with which he can be sledged. This is why Ms. Hanson-Young\u2019s case is crucial: If there are consequences for trying to shut down or shame women on the grounds of sexuality, even if it\u2019s just vehement, broad public disapprobation, the weapon will be blunted. It\u2019s risible to think that in 2018 a woman\u2019s character can be impugned by suggesting she might have sex. It\u2019s not \u201cnature\u2019s way.\u201d It\u2019s ludicrous. Advertisement"}

I had, for four springs in a row, worked at Princeton\u2019s reunions, waiting on the men who, with their families, returned to a formerly all-male institution and reminisced, loudly and within earshot of me, my fellow alumnae and their own daughters and granddaughters, about its former glory, and how women had lowered the standards, how the university had been forced to change the words of the alma mater, how women had pushed their way into the school\u2019s most sacred spaces, including the eating clubs, how they were ruining the place.I\u2019d smile, and pretend I didn\u2019t hear, while clearing dirty dishes.

I felt diminished, a little less real, and, certainly, a lot less likely to be believed if I had anything to say about male colleagues.Watching the #MeToo movement gain traction, as women\u2019s voices were finally heard and powerful men finally, finally experienced consequences, felt like a restoration, as if someone was coloring me in again. Here we are. Yes, we matter. We\u2019re real, just like you.Except, even putting Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination aside, over the past few weeks it\u2019s felt like someone fired a starter pistol, one whose report was pitched only for abusers\u2019 ears.

Do they have any notion of how to fix what they\u2019ve broken, or what it would take to repair the damage they\u2019ve wrought? And could women seek revenge?

{"Headline": "\u2018Five Eyes\u2019 Nations Quietly Demand Government Access to Encrypted Data", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration and its closest intelligence partners have quietly warned technology firms that they will demand \u201clawful access\u201d to all encrypted emails, text messages and voice communications, threatening to compel compliance if the private companies refuse to voluntarily provide the information to the governments.\u201cShould governments continue to encounter impediments to lawful access to information necessary to aid the protection of the citizens of our countries,\u201d the joint statement said, \u201cwe may pursue technological, enforcement, legislative or other measures to achieve lawful access solutions.\u201dOn Wednesday, leaders from two major social media firms, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, will testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on curbing election interference by Russia and other powers. The social networks are also expected to answer Republican charges that their firms, and others, use their platforms to emphasize news media sources with liberal bias.But the new demands by the five nations threaten to rekindle a debate that seized Washington and Silicon Valley after Apple gradually began encrypting more data on its phones.At the core of the dispute is whether Apple, Facebook, Google and others should be compelled to provide a \u201cback door\u201d to their products that would allow government investigators to gain access to all communications, with a legal order.It is far from clear that Congress is ready to take on the technology companies on this issue, especially because more companies and citizens are turning to encryption to protect sensitive conversations and financial transfers.Ordinary Americans \u2014 including President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen \u2014 are also increasingly using encrypted apps to conduct delicate conversations to prevent monitoring by the government or others.On Tuesday, staff members of key congressional committees said they had received no briefings on the new accord from Australia, and questioned how they could construct rules that provided access to all encrypted communications.One Senate staff member said the memo was unenforceable in its current form.Facebook and Google were similarly surprised, and questioned what sort of measures would be put into place with companies that did not comply.\u201cCybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it\u2019s impossible to create any back door that couldn\u2019t be discovered \u2014 and exploited \u2014 by bad actors,\u201d Facebook said in the blog post. \u201cIt\u2019s why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.\u201dIn response, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, contended that once phones or messaging systems were designed to allow legal access, hackers from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere would use the breach to pry their way in, destroying technology devised to protect privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s our job to provide you with the tools to lock up your stuff,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview in 2015.He tried, unsuccessfully, to convince former President Barack Obama that there was no safe technological way to create back doors; Apple deliberately does not retain the keys to unlock those communications, so they can tell investigators, or the courts, that they are unable to comply with demands for access.But Mr. Obama left office without resolving the issue of the government\u2019s ability to compel access. Both Mr. Trump and his rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, sided with law enforcement authorities on giving access to the government.One Facebook official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said that the memo from Australia had no teeth, and was part of an escalating war between government officials and Silicon Valley over access to people\u2019s private data.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Today\u2019s Hearing Could Affect Kavanaugh\u2019s Confirmation", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Baker, our chief White House correspondent, answered readers\u2019 questions on Facebook Live about the coming Senate hearing with Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh.On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will question Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the first of three women who have accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct when he was a young man.Peter Baker, our chief White House correspondent, responded to readers\u2019 questions about the hearing and Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s prospects of confirmation on Facebook Live on Wednesday. Below are excerpts from the segment, which have been edited and condensed. Right now, we have a 51-to-49 Senate. That means Republicans have 51 seats and can only afford to lose one vote if the Democrats don\u2019t go along with Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. If the Republicans lose one senator, Vice President Mike Pence will have the tiebreaking vote, and they can still confirm Judge Kavanaugh. If they lose two Republican senators and don\u2019t get any Democrats, this confirmation is over. That\u2019s why Thursday is so important. The impressions that four or five key Republican senators get from this hearing will probably determine Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s fate. Those senators are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, maybe Bob Corker of Tennessee and maybe Dean Heller of Nevada. It\u2019s a matter of time for one thing. The Republicans say that Democrats are trying to drag out the confirmation process by asking for an investigation into the allegations. The Democrats, on the other hand, say, \u201cThe F.B.I. can actually do a lot in just a handful of days; why are the Republicans rushing this?\u201d This is also taking place during a heated midterm election season. In just six weeks, voters will decide who the next Congress members will be.We just don\u2019t know. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said on Tuesday that he\u2019s confident they have the votes to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. In fact, Republicans are so confident that they scheduled a vote for the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning without waiting for the results of the hearing on Thursday. But that may be misplaced confidence. Just two Republican senators can stop this nomination if the Democrats unanimously vote against him. Dr. Blasey took a polygraph administered by a former F.B.I. agent hired by her attorney. She passed it, according to the agent. Judge Kavanaugh has not been formally asked by the committee to take a polygraph or volunteered to take one.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, broached the idea of impeaching Justice Kavanaugh if he were confirmed to the Supreme Court and Democrats took control of Congress. That\u2019s possible, but unlikely. Impeachment is a big deal: It would require not just a majority of the House, which Democrats may have after the election, but two-thirds of the Senate. That would mean some Republicans would have to vote for conviction to remove him. And they would have to be convinced that Judge Kavanaugh lied under oath when he denied these allegations. Judge Kavanaugh will be subject to penalty of perjury on Thursday, just as Dr. Blasey will be. But proving in the future that he lied is harder than saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t think he should be on the Supreme Court.\u201d About two weeks ago, there were probably four or five Democrats in red states won by President Trump who were considered possible votes for Judge Kavanaugh by the White House \u2014 senators like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota.But those senators are now seen to have a freer hand to vote against Judge Kavanaugh. They\u2019re no longer as worried about the political ramifications of their votes in these Trump-friendly states because the allegations of sexual misconduct give them a reason to do so that they think would pass muster with their constituency. President Trump would come forward with another nominee. He had three other finalists before selecting Judge Kavanaugh in July. Mr. Trump could go back to one of those three or choose somebody else. But it seems very unlikely that the Trump administration could get another nominee vetted and confirmed before the November midterms. It starts at 10 a.m., and The Times will be live-streaming it on our site. We\u2019ll also have a live briefing with commentary by our reporters telling you what\u2019s important and what\u2019s not.The questions will rotate back and forth with Democratic senators, who plan to question her themselves. And after lunch Judge Kavanaugh will come in and be questioned as well. He will also have an opportunity to respond to the allegations.Long before these allegations came up, most Democrats and Republicans were probably pretty close to certain about how they were going to vote just based on his judicial philosophy, his qualifications and their views of the Supreme Court. They\u2019re not planning to do the hearing together. Dr. Blasey will appear first and then Judge Kavanaugh. Dr. Blasey will make her allegations and answer questions, and when she\u2019s done, she will leave the chamber. Judge Kavanaugh will then come in. Advertisement"}

Andrew M. Cuomo.\u201cMy wife, my six-month pregnant wife, is out of your league,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said in a video posted to Twitter last month. \u201cOut of your league. She is above you. You want to pick a fight? Stick with me. She\u2019s a class act. You\u2019re not.\u201dWith Election Day less than six weeks away, a recent flash point in the New York governor\u2019s race is not the economy, the city\u2019s subways or the $160 billion state budget. It\u2019s about two women \u2014 the significant others of Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive \u2014 and questions surrounding those women\u2019s personal finances.It is a curious take on the year of the woman, with accusations and invective lacing both men\u2019s campaigns at a time when female voters and candidates have proven to be a potent force in the electorate.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign has suggested that Ms. Adams\u2019s employment at the company was questionable, citing about $70,000 in county contracts and hundreds of thousands of dollars in other subsidies that Tinkelman received from a Dutchess County development agency.That ad blurred out the word \u201cwife,\u201d in reference to Ms. Adams, though it was still visible. An earlier video advertisement was more explicit, suggesting that in return for \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks,\u201d Tinkelman \u201chired Molinaro\u2019s wife.\u201dThat video, released on the same day that Mr. Molinaro unveiled a revitalization plan for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, led to Mr. Molinaro\u2019s \u201cyou want to pick a fight\u201d post on Twitter \u2014 which effectively overshadowed his own transportation plan.\u201cDo you know anything about the house that he lives in, the place that he calls home, or the individual that he lives with?\u201d Mr. Molinaro said last week in Albany, adding, \u201cIf he wants to go down that road, God bless him, but at the end of the day, I think New Yorkers expect better.\u201dGet messages from our politics correspondent Alex Burns as he covers the biggest races this election season. Along the way, he\u2019ll take your questions and help you understand what\u2019s at stake on Nov. 6.Mr. Molinaro\u2019s family is in a much lower tax bracket: He earns about $140,000 as county executive, and says that his wife\u2019s total income at Tinkelman, for doing public relations and social media work for the firm, was about $80,000 over three years.\u201cShe had no role in the company\u2019s administration, and no role in advocating for government contracts,\u201d he said, adding that she left on good terms earlier this year to focus on her pregnancy and the couple\u2019s other child, a toddler.That\u2019s roughly the time Ms. Adams was hired, though the firm\u2019s managing member, Steven Tinkelman, says that the subsidies had been in the works long before that, calling them standard development incentives, an argument echoed by Mr. Molinaro.\u201cHow this has gotten twisted around really makes us sad,\u201d he said.For his part, Mr. Molinaro says the county development agency wasn\u2019t under his direct purview, though its members are approved by the county executive. He added that Tinkelman\u2019s contracts with the county were competitively bid, and \u201cminuscule\u201d in terms of the millions in design and architectural spending by the Dutchess County government.Mr. Molinaro has seized on the conviction of Mr. Percoco as emblematic of the administration\u2019s problems. After Mr. Percoco was sentenced, Mr. Molinaro released a statement saying, \u201cAndrew Cuomo was sentenced today. He just doesn\u2019t have to do the time.\u201dThe Cuomo campaign noted that the governor was not accused of any wrongdoing in the Percoco case, and that its political ads targeting Mr. Molinaro were meant to highlight his own potential pay-to-play issues, and were not meant as ad hominem attacks.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, did not address Mr. Molinaro\u2019s call for more disclosure about Ms. Lee\u2019s finances, but reiterated that the alleged connections between the Tinkelman job for Ms. Adams and county contracts were \u201csurely unethical and possibly criminal.\u201d\u201cMolinaro should worry about his illegal conduct under the current law before proposing a new law,\u201d Ms. Lever said. \u201cThe real question is why Marc Molinaro violated the public officers law.\u201dMr. Molinaro and Ms. Adams are expecting their second child this November, not long after Election Day, at which point the political attacks should end.And not a moment too soon, said Mr. Molinaro, who said that his wife hadn\u2019t really appreciated his bringing Ms. Lee into the skirmish, either.\u201cI went home and my wife said, \u2018Don\u2019t attack her,\u2019\u201d Mr. Molinaro said, adding that his wife was educated, competent and intent on not being a political pawn. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be dragged into any of this.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But with the creation \u2014 and inexorable rise \u2014 of ranch, we have forged the one true American dressing. It is a routine dip for chicken wings, baby carrots, French fries, tortilla chips and mozzarella sticks. It is incorporated into American classics like macaroni and cheese, fried chicken, potato salad and Thanksgiving-turkey stuffing. And it is drizzled over tacos, Tater Tots, casseroles and \u2014 perhaps most controversially \u2014 pizza.Any home cook can make a lovely, full-flavored ranch dressing using real garlic, freshly ground black pepper and bright green herbs. But the particular flavor of traditional ranch can only be achieved with the dry versions of all those aromatics: garlic and onion powder, dried herbs, powdered pepper and buttermilk.\u201cPeople carried it home in mayonnaise jars,\u201d Mr. Henson said. \u201cSeemed like we were always mixing it, and we put it on everything: steaks, vegetables, potatoes.\u201dThe product was a runaway success. \u201cThe dressing pretty much took over the ranch,\u201d said Mr. Henson, who spent hours as a child filling seasoning packets. \u201cThat\u2019s what I remember from birthday parties when I was young, and on late nights in college,\u201d said Ms. Reisner, 25. \u201cRanch and pizza, pizza and ranch.\u201d Other members of her generation agree. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a whole extra course,\u201d said Alvin Lim, 31, a culinary student in Providence, R.I. \u201cYou eat your pizza, but then you\u2019re probably still hungry, so you stick the crusts in the ranch.\u201d\u201cWe really believed in ranch from the beginning,\u201d said Jim Hayden, one of the restaurant\u2019s founders. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a gimmick.\u201d Every dish on the menu contains some form of ranch: the house Bloody Mary is made with ranch-infused vodka and has a ranch-salt rim on the glass. To create new dishes, said Mr. Hayden, he and his fellow founder, Chad Allen, start by dreaming up a new ranch flavor \u2014 like Greek, with feta cheese and oregano, or curry, with yogurt and Indian spices. \u201cWe lead with the ranch, then we build a dish around it,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s very different from ranch in the way that it\u2019s made,\u201d Ms. Hong said; the dip contains two kinds of Asian preserved soy beans, as well as cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and chive-infused oil. \u201cBut it\u2019s creamy and tangy, and it has salt and umami, and it definitely reminds people of ranch.\u201d While it comes with vegetables, she said, customers are always angling for more dip to eat with fries, with bread and with chicken. The restaurant still serves the original dressing.\u201cI think she would come back from the grave and haunt us if we changed it,\u201d Ms. Wilson-Potts said.An earlier version of this article misstated the origins of Ranch, a pizzeria in Portland, Ore.

It\u2019s September!", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe have seen the future, and it\u2019s in North Dakota.Opinion ColumnistHappy International Vulture Awareness Day! Honest to gosh. No snickering. Vultures do a lot of good things for the environment, and they\u2019re tired of being dismissed just because they look creepy and eat carrion. No vulture, for instance, has ever been known to drive a golf cart onto the putting green. Or brag about grabbing a lady vulture by her private parts. Or separate children from their mothers at the border. Go vultures.I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a coincidence that this is also the start of the big election campaign season. Time to get focused. Lots of critical races all over the place, but let\u2019s begin with North Dakota. Next week the president goes to Fargo to help raise money for Kevin Cramer, the Republican congressman who\u2019s trying to knock off Democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp. President Trump was in the state for Cramer not too long ago, but he just can\u2019t get enough of the place. It\u2019s possible that by Election Day we will be able to calculate he spent more of the autumn with North Dakotans than with his wife. Of all the states the Democrats are worried about this fall, North Dakota may be No. 1. And that is fine by North Dakota, which doesn\u2019t usually get much attention. This may be, in part, because it has approximately as many people as visit Grand Central Station on an average day. Yes. North Dakota\u2019s population is about 755,000 residents. (State slogan: \u201cBigger than Wyoming!\u201d) Correction: North Dakota\u2019s official motto is not really \u201cBigger than Wyoming.\u201d We are fiends about accuracy and I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea just because I made a joke. It\u2019s \u201cLiberty and Union Now and Forever, One and Inseparable.\u201d Although I believe many of you will agree that mine is better.We will pause for a minute to let those of you who did not know crayons were made of soybeans a chance to catch up. Actually, a lot of crayons are still made with petroleum byproducts, but soybeans are the environmental alternative of the future. Go soybeans!  \u201cAbout two-thirds of our soybean market is in China,\u201d Heitkamp told me in a phone interview, before launching into a detailed explanation of soybean pricing. The bottom line was that talking tough about trade sounds good in theory, until the other side starts putting tariffs on the stuff you grow. Republican Cramer, who frequently wraps himself around Trump like a famished boa constrictor, has had a certain amount of trouble trying to sound supportive on this front. \u201cHe really did nothing but vote on the bill. I think he should be grateful to have been invited to begin with,\u201d sniffed Heitkamp.She\u2019s a very likable woman \u2014 warm, outgoing \u2014 while her opponent can seem sort of cardboardy. That\u2019s important in a state like North Dakota, where the voters not only expect to meet their senator frequently, they can often tell you about the last time they were at her house for dinner.So the situation is far from hopeless. And North Dakota could wind up dictating who runs the Senate. A state with fewer people than Indianapolis gets to determine a large chunk of the nation\u2019s future.It\u2019s true, people, it\u2019s true. If you live in California your vote for the U.S. Senate is worth about 1/50th as much as a North Dakotan\u2019s. Which is super fine with all of them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First I Met My Children, Then My Girlfriend. They\u2019re Related.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA former sperm donor, searching online, finds both offspring and love. Let me explain. Nearly 25 years ago, I returned from a year of teaching English abroad, moved in with my mother and, lacking prospects, began driving a cab. One day I saw a newspaper ad seeking healthy men, 18 to 35, to participate in a semen donation program.\u201cDonors\u201d is the standard industry word, yet virtually all of us are paid. Forty dollars a pop was what I received in 1994.I applied to sell my sperm and sold twice weekly for a year. At the time I was in a long-distance relationship, so this seemed like a good outlet. When I told my mother, she presciently wondered aloud if this was the only way she was going to have grandchildren.Today, sperm buyers view detailed profiles for potential vendors, whereas I wasn\u2019t asked to provide much beyond college major, hobbies and family health history. Jessica and her partner at the time chose me primarily because I was a writer and musician.After a year of selling my sperm, I went back to giving it away and largely forgot about the whole thing. Occasionally the subject of whether I had children would come up, and I\u2019d make a joke about probably having a bunch. I had signed a nondisclosure waiver and assumed there would never be a way for my progeny and me to find one another.Then the internet happened.In the early 2000s, I searched online for a way to find my offspring and discovered the Donor Sibling Registry but didn\u2019t see any leads there and never got around to checking back. (I had looked way too early: My progeny began to use the site to find each other when they became teenagers in the 2010s.)A couple of years ago I began seeing ads for 23andMe, a service that analyzes your saliva \u2014 you spit in a test tube and mail it off for analysis \u2014 and provides you with information about ancestry, health and DNA relatives. The opportunity was obvious, but I assumed the odds of finding my children were low. I procrastinated for months before curiosity and an urge to know them made me order a kit.I got my results back, and boom: I had a son, Bryce. His full name was unusual enough that I easily Googled him, and the picture resembled me enough that I felt confident this senior geography major was mine (mine?). Guessing he had been notified of my existence by 23andMe, I mulled in agitation for a week before finally putting fingers to keyboard.\u201cDear Bryce,\u201d I wrote. \u201cI recently joined 23andMe and found you listed as my \u2018son,\u2019 so I believe myself to be your biological father. I hope my existence isn\u2019t a shock and wonder whether you joined in hopes of connecting with me.\u201d My letter continued awkwardly from there, giving him a brief sketch of my life.Bryce replied almost instantly: \u201cDad, I cannot express how excited I am to be hearing from you. I did join 23andMe hoping that you would have already done so and was upset to see you hadn\u2019t. This is amazing though and I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019m one of six of your children that I\u2019m aware of and in contact with. I\u2019m 20 years old and live on Long Island but I\u2019m studying in upstate New York.\u201d\u201cDad?\u201d I was briefly concerned that Bryce might have some fatherly expectations of me and show up on my doorstep, but my worries were unfounded. It\u2019s a brave new world, and we\u2019re all struggling with the terminology.More important, six children? Yikes! I did some napkin math based on the number of samples I provided and the odds of conception and estimated that I may have as many as 67 children.Bryce connected me with Madalyn, 19. Upon viewing her Facebook page, I had my first parental thought ever: My daughter should put some more clothes on.I may be biased, but I found my children to be ridiculously attractive. I felt a sudden need to share their photos with all the ex-girlfriends who chose not to marry and procreate with me.A few months later a new DNA relative appeared on 23andMe: Alice, age 11. Her mother, Jessica, wrote me a note. She and her former partner had each given birth to one daughter conceived with my sperm. They broke up years ago but had been raising both girls together until recently, when the other mother moved away with the daughter she had given birth to.Jess and I began to chat online. She knew a lot about buying sperm and self-impregnating, which was fascinating for me to learn, and, it turns out, more difficult than my role: masturbating into a cup. She also no longer identified as lesbian and was dating a man who, incredibly, had my same first and middle names (Aaron David), with a similar, monosyllabic last name.Had there been a mix-up at the Bureau of Boyfriends? Was I the one who was supposed to be dating her?My children and I exchanged written biographies. Bryce\u2019s showed me how little I know of young adult culture and reminded me that one\u2019s 20s are a difficult decade. Madi\u2019s revealed a keen understanding of her upbringing and the parts of it she would like to break from. But it was Alice\u2019s, entitled \u201cA series of awkward events separated by snacks,\u201d that floored me.Hers was a hodgepodge of lists and memories written under duress (\u201cMom: Write or death!\u201d). Favorite color: \u201cBlack. Like my soul.\u201d Favorite holiday: \u201cHalloween (because candy and murder).\u201d She liked Alfred Hitchcock films. \u201cBasically,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI\u2019m an angsty teen in a child\u2019s body.\u201dThis kid\u2019s 11?A plan developed for Bryce and Madi to come to Seattle for a couple of weeks in the summer. Jess and Alice lived a few hours south and would drive up. I figured meeting my children was going to be the closest thing I\u2019d ever have to a wedding, so I decided to host a party. I had told my news to a few people, but most learned of it from the \u201cMeet My Kids Party\u201d Facebook invitation, featuring photos of Bryce, Madi and Alice. The shock value was high.Be it genetics, good luck or force of circumstance, I loved my children right away. They have an uncanny aura of me-ness. Bryce is shy but sharp and obsessed with memes in a way I might have been had I grown up Gen Z. Alice has little use for adults, as I still don\u2019t. Madi, especially, has my sense of humor and eyes: Locking gazes with her makes my brain explode, but then we laugh.At the party, we played a nature-versus-nurture question-and-answer game and discovered we were all quite liberal and that none of us believed in God. None of them, however, sleeps with a pillow between their knees, as I have long done.The first time Jess and I found ourselves alone we hugged at length in a way entirely inappropriate for people who had just met. Jess says I have mannerisms that remind her of both of her daughters and thus felt instantly comfortable with me.Whether we were pawns of fate or unwitting participants in a chromosomally arranged marriage, Jess and I quickly bonded. I deployed my Bureau of Boyfriends mix-up line to a grudging but sweet reception. During the vacation, she and I fell easily into the mom-and-dad role for Bryce, Madi and Alice. We soon had in-jokes and teased each other about our foibles, just like any family. I even gave Bryce and Madi a lecture about smoking.At the end of the visit, Bryce somehow managed to get Jess and Alice kicked out of the house they were renting by climbing onto the roof to retrieve a toy, so I invited them to stay with me while they figured things out. What Jess soon figured out was that she wanted to keep staying with me. Alice rolled her eyes as if she had been tricked into a traditional family arrangement.While 23andMe is not generally considered a dating site, Jess and I are grateful to the technology that has made our backward-formed relationship possible. We have a lot of questions about love and genetics and whether we would have felt this connection had we met in a more conventional way. Our bond has survived the \u201cHow cool is this?\u201d phase, though we still enjoy cybermonitoring my other progeny and speculating about how many more may emerge. (I\u2019m up to 10 now; I have had some contact with the new ones\u2019 mothers but haven\u2019t made plans to meet yet.)Madi liked the West Coast and us and recently moved into our place. We\u2019re hoping to lure Bryce back, too.In the end, the sci-fi trappings of our love story are irrelevant: Jess and I work as a couple because we like spending time together. I suppose it doesn\u2019t hurt that I happen to be the father of her child.Aaron Long is a writer in Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Better Way to Get New York\u2019s Traffic Moving", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe city can fight congestion and raise revenue through parking regulations. Mr. Primus managed parking in San Francisco for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency for six years. There is a good alternative. New York could use a parking-based approach to achieve much of the same congestion management and revenue goals. This has three elements.First, the city would prohibit garage operators from selling parking by the month. Monthly parking is like an all-you-can-eat buffet \u2014 if the parking next to your office is already paid for, why not drive to work every day? Whether someone takes a car to work really matters because such trips are usually at peak times when alternatives are most viable \u2014 that\u2019s when trains and buses run most frequently and it\u2019s easiest to car pool. Requiring parking to be sold by the hour is like moving from all-you-can-eat to \u00e0 la carte. Even if the hourly cost is the same as what\u2019s implied in a monthly rate ($400 a month is equivalent to about $2.50 per hour if you park 40 hours a week), simply ensuring that people pay for parking every time they drive in will change how they decide to make some trips and, as a result, reduce congestion. Garage operators could still charge whatever they like, but would be required to price parking in a way that will reduce traffic.Third, New York could require all garage and lot operators to offer an off-peak discount, as is already done in San Francisco\u2019s municipal garages. People who park for at least four hours would receive, say, a $4 discount for arriving before streets are congested as well as a $4 discount for leaving after traffic subsides, for a total discount of up to $8. That is a powerful incentive for people to drive when there\u2019s less traffic. Every year, city transportation managers would review and adjust the time thresholds (say, 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.), minimum length of stay and discount level to ensure consistency, a level playing field for parking operators and sufficient incentive for drivers. The magic of this approach is that it is tantamount to a peak period surcharge but framed as an off-peak discount \u2014 no one (other than economists) likes peak period surcharges, but everyone loves a discount. The effect is the same but the political viability is crucially different. This is also more politically feasible than congestion pricing because it affects parking, something people are already accustomed to paying for, and requires only local rather than state approval. It also avoids the technical complexity, cost (hundreds of millions of dollars to install, maintain and operate) and privacy concerns raised by the hundreds of surveillance cameras congestion pricing would require.This parking-based plan for congestion management does not preclude other ideas, including some that have already been considered in New York \u2014 a fee for commercial vehicles and trucks entering Manhattan at peak times, a surcharge on trips in for-hire vehicles (like yellow taxis and Uber cars) and traditional congestion pricing. No city has pursued a parking-based congestion management plan before. New York could show the world how sound parking policy, rather than heavy investments in technology, can help address the urgent and universal issue of congestion. Cities are looking for ways to be smart \u2014 and this no-tech, no-cost, data-free and politically feasible approach to congestion management could be the smart way forward.

{"Headline": "Killer Whales Face Dire PCBs Threat", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesConcentrations of the toxins are very high, lingering in the orcas\u2019 blubber, and are passed from mother to calf. But a new study based on modeling shows that they\u2019re lingering in the blubber of killer whales \u2014 and they may end up wiping out half the world\u2019s population of killer whales in coming decades.Whales sit at the top of their food chain. Chemicals like PCBs are taken up by plankton at the base of the food chain, then eaten by herring and other small fish, which are themselves eaten by larger fish, and so on. At each step in this chain, PCBs get more and more concentrated. The most at-risk killer whales are those that eat seals and other animals that are themselves fairly high on the food chain and quite contaminated, Dr. Desforges said.Killer whale populations in Alaska, Norway, Antarctica and the Arctic among other places, where chemical levels are lower, will probably continue to grow and thrive, the study found. But animals living in more industrialized areas, off the coasts of the United Kingdom, Brazil, Hawaii and Japan, and in the Strait of Gibraltar are at high risk of population collapse from just the PCBs alone \u2014 not counting other threats.Dave Duffus, who directs the whale research lab at the University of Victoria in Canada and was not involved in the new research, said its conclusions are \u201cshocking, but I don\u2019t doubt them.\u201dThe researchers used blubber samples to estimate the amount of PCB contamination in killer whales around the world. They also developed a model to forecast the amount of PCBs passed on to calves through the placenta and breast milk as well as from eating prey. Researchers then compared these concentrations to the known damage that can come from different amounts of PCBs.According to their calculations, roughly half of the killer whale populations in the world will stop expanding and then will shrink in coming decades. Dr. Desforges said he could not be certain how long it would take for these populations to collapse, but his team estimated the impact of contamination over a century \u2014 and the clock started ticking about 40 years ago when PCB exposure levels were at their highest, he said. PCB exposures declined with the bans, but levels have stopped falling in long-lived marine predators like killer whales, he said. The whales only very slowly metabolize the PCBs during a life span of 50 to 80 years in the wild, Dr. Desforges said.

{"Headline": "A Pasta as Versatile and Reliable as Your Pantry", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA GOOD APPETITEMost pantry pastas aren\u2019t as interesting as the larders they come from. This is an exception.This pantry pasta is different: It asks you to reach deeper into your cupboard and fridge, unearthing olives, a couple of onions and that bunch of parsley, spinach or arugula (wilted is fine) you probably have somewhere in there. You\u2019ll also need some butter and a lemon.These extra ingredients build flavor, adding a gentle sweetness from the onion that matches the salty tang of olives. The herbs lend freshness, while the butter enriches and the lemon brightens.Even with the additional ingredients, this dish is still fast and convenient enough for any given weeknight, which, when it comes to pantry pastas, is exactly what you\u2019re after.The most time-consuming part is saut\u00e9ing the onions until they\u2019re golden and soft. This can take as little as 20 minutes or as long as 30, depending on how large your pan is and how high the heat is. If the onions seem to be taking forever \u2014 or if you\u2019re really, really hungry \u2014 crank up the flame and stir them a lot. Just don\u2019t turn your back, or they may burn. Getting them dark brown is perfectly fine, but even a few black shards will make the whole pan taste bitter, so don\u2019t stray too far from the stove.While the onions cook, you can boil your pasta. I routinely splurge on pasta because even though it may seem a little crazy to pay upward of $6 for a bag of spaghetti, I can really taste the difference. The texture can be a lot better, too, with a firmer, meatier bite. But use whatever you\u2019ve got in your pantry. After all, isn\u2019t that point?Precision pairing is not easy with this dish. The sweetness and almost smoky notes of the onions might call for a chenin blanc or chardonnay, particularly barrel-aged versions. Piquant olives and anchovies need something more incisive, a fino sherry, perhaps. You could certainly try any of these wines, and I think they would be enjoyable. Finding a wine that bridges all of these flavors is a little more difficult. My first thought would be of a broader style of riesling, from Alsace or Austria, which I think would work fairly well. You could also try a richer fiano di Avellino from the Campania or a barrel-aged Soave from the Veneto. Steer clear of reds. ERIC ASIMOVAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Hacking of America", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "OpinionPolitical and technological disruption have fed off each other since the nation\u2019s founding. Now they are dangerously out of whack. Supported byMs. Lepore is a historian at Harvard and a staff writer at The New Yorker.Every government is a machine, and every machine has its tinkerers \u2014 and its jams. From the start, machines have driven American democracy and, just as often, crippled it. The printing press, the telegraph, the radio, the television, the mainframe, cable TV, the internet: Each had wild-eyed boosters who promised that a machine could hold the republic together, or make it more efficient, or repair the damage caused by the last machine. Each time, this assertion would be both right and terribly wrong. But lately, it\u2019s mainly wrong, chiefly because the rules that prevail on the internet were devised by people who fundamentally don\u2019t believe in government.The Constitution itself was understood by its framers as a machine, a precisely constructed instrument whose measures \u2014 its separation of powers, its checks and balances \u2014 were mechanical devices, as intricate as the gears of a clock, designed to thwart tyrants, mobs and demagogues, and to prevent the forming of factions. Once those factions began to appear, it became clear that other machines would be needed to establish stable parties. \u201cThe engine is the press,\u201d Thomas Jefferson, an inveterate inventor, wrote in 1799.The United States was founded as a political experiment; it seemed natural that it should advance and grow through technological experiment. Different technologies have offered different fixes. Equality was the promise of the penny press, newspapers so cheap that anyone could afford them. The New York Sun was first published in 1833. \u201cIt shines for all\u201d was its common-man motto. Union was the promise of the telegraph. \u201cThe greatest revolution of modern times, and indeed of all time, for the amelioration of society, has been effected by the magnetic telegraph,\u201d The Sun announced, proclaiming \u201cthe annihilation of space.\u201dTime was being annihilated too. As The New York Herald pointed out, the telegraph appeared to make it possible for \u201cthe whole nation\u201d to have \u201cthe same idea at the same moment.\u201d Frederick Douglass was convinced that the great machines of the age were ushering in an era of worldwide political revolution. \u201cThanks to steam navigation and electric wires,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca revolution cannot be confined to the place or the people where it may commence but flashes with lightning speed from heart to heart.\u201d Henry David Thoreau raised an eyebrow: \u201cWe are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.\u201dEven that savage war didn\u2019t diminish Americans\u2019 faith that technology could solve the problem of political division. In the 1920s, Herbert Hoover, as secretary of commerce, rightly anticipated that radio, the nation\u2019s next great mechanical experiment, would make it possible for political candidates and officeholders to speak to voters without the bother and expense of traveling to meet them. NBC began radio broadcasting in 1926, CBS in 1928. By the end of the decade, nearly every household would have a wireless. Hoover promised that radio would make Americans \u201cliterally one people.\u201dThat radio fulfilled this promise for as long as it did is the result of decisions made by Mr. Hoover, a Republican who believed that the government had a role to play in overseeing the airwaves by issuing licenses for frequencies to broadcasting companies and regulating their use. \u201cThe ether is a public medium,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand its use must be for the public benefit.\u201d He pressed for passage of the Radio Act of 1927, one of the most consequential and underappreciated acts of Progressive reform \u2014 insisting that programmers had to answer to the public interest. That commitment was extended to television in 1949 when the Federal Communications Commission, the successor to the Federal Radio Commission, established the Fairness Doctrine, a standard for television news that required a \u201creasonably balanced presentation\u201d of different political views.After the war, computers that had been built by the military split the electorate into so many atoms. Univac, one of the first commercial computers, was completed in 1951 for the Census Bureau, to count and sort its data. The next year, CBS used the Univac on election night. \u201cA Univac is a fabulous electronic machine, which we have borrowed to help us predict this election from the basis of early returns as they come in,\u201d Charles Collingwood told his audience as the evening\u2019s coverage began. Walter Cronkite read the early, East Coast returns; Edward R. Murrow provided the commentary. Around 9:30 p.m., when the Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, was ahead in the popular vote and the Democrat, Adlai E. Stevenson, was winning the electoral vote, Cronkite said, \u201cAnd now to find out perhaps what this all means, at least in the electronic age, let\u2019s turn to that electronic miracle, the electronic brain, Univac.\u201dBut when the camera turned to Collingwood, he could get no answer from Univac. Murrow ventured that perhaps the computer was cautious. At 10:30 p.m., Cronkite turned again to Collingwood. Univac was having \u201ca little bit of trouble,\u201d Collingwood said. Murrow called the election for Eisenhower. Fifteen minutes later, Univac made the same call. Cronkite smiled and said, \u201cI might note that Univac is running a few moments behind Ed Murrow.\u201d The next day, Murrow, speaking on CBS Radio, celebrated the triumph of man over machine: \u201cWe are in a measure released from the petty tyranny of those who assert that they can tell us what we think, what we believe, what we will do, what we hope and what we fear, without consulting us \u2014 all of us.\u201dThat release proved short-lived. By 1959, a team of Democratic strategists was developing a secret plan known as Project Macroscope. They wanted to build a machine that could predict voter responses to any conceivable issue or candidate, a Univac for politics. Newton Minow, an Adlai Stevenson campaign adviser who would soon become chairman of the F.C.C., wrote to the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., \u201cMy own opinion is that such a thing (a) cannot work, (b) is immoral, (c) should be declared illegal.\u201d Project Macroscope went ahead anyway. We live, each minute of every day, within its clockwork, and under its giant, all-seeing eye.All of this history was forgotten or ignored by the people who wrote the rules of the internet and who peer out upon the world from their offices in Silicon Valley and boast of their disdain for the past. But the building of a new machinery of communications began even before the opening of the internet. In the 1980s, conservatives campaigned to end the Fairness Doctrine in favor of a public-interest-based rule for broadcasters, a market-based rule: If people liked it, broadcasters could broadcast it.Wired began publishing the same year that the Newt Gingrich-affiliated Progress and Freedom Foundation was founded. Its key thinker was the irrepressible George Gilder, who in the 1970s had achieved celebrity as an anti-feminist and in the 1980s as a supply-sider. At a 1994 Progress and Freedom Foundation meeting in Aspen, Colo., Mr. Gilder, along with the futurists Alvin Toffler, Esther Dyson and George Keyworth, wrote a \u201cMagna Carta for the Knowledge Age,\u201d which called for \u201cremoving barriers to competition and massively deregulating the fast-growing telecommunications and computing industries.\u201dThe machine is no longer precisely constructed, its every action no longer measured. The machine is fix upon fix, hack after hack, its safety mechanisms sawed off. It has no brake, no fail-safe, no checks, no balances. It clatters. It thunders. It crushes the Constitution in its gears. The smell of smoke wafts out of the engine room. The machine is on fire.Jill Lepore is a professor of American history at Harvard, a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of \u201cThese Truths: A History of the United States,\u201d from which parts of this essay are adapted.Advertisement"}

That exceeds the 3.3 percent of adults surveyed who declare themselves vegetarian. Many children at very young ages are deciding to become vegetarians on their own, driven primarily by ethical concerns and the toll that meat production takes on the environment. \u2026Inevitable tensions can arise when a child feels that eating meat constitutes murder and can\u2019t tolerate other family members doing so. Rachel Gunther\u2019s son, Elias, decided to become a vegetarian at the age of 4, repulsed by the idea that animals were being killed for food. He was deeply troubled that his younger brother, Theo, continued to eat meat. \u201cIt was a difficult parenting moment,\u201d said Ms. Gunther, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and is associate director for Youth on Board, which supports young people organizing for change in their communities and in their own lives.She used the conflict as an opportunity to teach empathy.

The bacteria go to work. This is how you get sick.\u201d She said to store mushrooms in a box, basket or paper bag. Incidentally, she got her Ph.D. from another land grant school, Virginia Tech.Meanwhile, back in Washington, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, questioning the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, slipped in a quaint conservative complaint that\u2019s about as old as the W.P.A.-funded courthouse on Bozeman\u2019s Main Street, where I first registered to vote.

{"Headline": "Celebrating the Fish Fry, a Late-Summer Black Tradition", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCatfish, hot sauce, a few sides: For many African-American families, these are makings of a time-honored gathering that feeds a sense of community. The chef Todd Richards remembers the fish fries that his mother hosted for their family in Chicago: The gatherings would spill into the street from their front yard. Tables packed with platters of cornmeal-crusted fried catfish, hand-cut fries, bottles of beer, homemade hot sauce and plenty of lemon slices sat waiting for waves of guests to enjoy at their leisure. Music from the family\u2019s record player would drift into the street outside their home on the city\u2019s South Side. \u201cShe made the fish in batches, and would talk and hang out while the fish was cooking,\u201d Mr. Richards recalled. On its surface, the fish fry is a humble get-together exalting the simple pleasure of crispy fried fish, flecked with orange-red hot sauce, resting on a slice of white bread alongside various side dishes. But the tradition has deep roots, and special meaning, in black communities across the country. For many families, late summer is prime time for the fish fry, which becomes a wistful embrace of the season\u2019s last days.But the tradition took on a different meaning in the South during the era of slavery. \u201cThe work schedule on the plantation would slow down by noon on Saturday, so enslaved people had the rest of that day to do what they wanted,\u201d Mr. Miller said. Those who finished work early could go fishing and bring back their catch to be fried that night; plantation owners didn\u2019t mind, Mr. Miller said, because it was one less meal they had to provide. \u201cSo the fish fry started as a Saturday-night thing on plantations, and it was like an impromptu get-together,\u201d he said. She has run the small takeout operation, which serves fried and grilled seafood, since 2001, when her father died. \u201cA lot of our customers come here because they remember their grandmother or mother bringing them here, and it brings back that nostalgia,\u201d she said. Ms. Powell serves catfish, tilapia and snapper. But the type of fish and sides in a fish fry can vary from place to place. In the South, bone-in or filleted catfish is king, with whiting and tilapia close behind because of their relatively low price. In the Midwest, perch and carp are big; in the Mid-Atlantic States, porgy is an option. Side dishes also showcase regional differences in the fish fry. Coleslaw is popular across the country, while hushpuppies and meatless spaghetti are part of the spread in the Carolinas. In the South and Mid-Atlantic, hushpuppies are common. Condiments, too, are an essential part of any fish fry. Different types of fish require different accompaniments. \u201cCatfish is already an oily fish,\u201d said Mr. Richards, the Atlanta chef. \u201cSo if you use tartar sauce, that\u2019s like oil on top of oil.\u201d At Mel\u2019s Fish Shack, Ms. Powell makes a garlic dill sauce instead of tartar sauce, and says lemon\u2019s acidity is a must for fried fish. \u201cAnd you absolutely have to have some good hot sauce,\u201d she added with a laugh. \u201cYou can make good fish taste bad with bad hot sauce.\u201dBut perhaps the most enduring part of the fish-fry tradition is the sense of fellowship it brings. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple way of gathering, and it doesn\u2019t require much in terms of ingredients,\u201d Mr. Richards said. The homemade version may be on the wane, Mr. Miller said. \u201cFewer people are frying fish at home because they don\u2019t want to deal with the smell, or they think it\u2019s unhealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s kind of like a treat to have it now.\u201d Ms. Powell sees her restaurant, Mel\u2019s, as a means for her community to continue the tradition. \u201cWe\u2019re busy every Friday night.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then the number kept growing. At least seven more died the next year.Their fellow alumni, feeling more anxious with each death, started to keep count. By the time a classmate in Ohio died of a heroin overdose in October, the toll had reached at least 87.\u201cDamn,\u201d a friend of the last victim wrote on Facebook. \u201cThis is outta control.\u201dAll of the dead were alumni of the Family Foundation School, a small boarding academy in rural Hancock, N.Y. Since its opening in the 1980s, the school was an option of last resort for parents who sought help for their teenagers troubled by drug and alcohol abuse or behavioral issues. The students ate and bunked together, were dressed down and punished together. Some attempted to escape together, dashing through the woods to the nearest town and hiding in a McDonald\u2019s bathroom.And now, alone and back at their respective homes, they were dying, largely of drug overdoses and suicide, their names joining classmates on the list. Again, together.The school closed in 2014 after a drop in enrollment that followed a self-described truth campaign by alumni telling of abuses there: solitary confinement, so-called \u201cblackouts\u201d of silence and isolation from others, the restraining of unruly students by wrapping them in rugs and duct tape. There were reports of physical abuse in complaints to state officials and the police.In 2015, a year after the school closed, at least four former students died. The next year, there were at least seven. In a recent Facebook post, a man remembered hanging out with two friends from the school in 2016, following the funeral of another. Both those friends have since died.Former students sought to find someone to blame, their first target being the school, only to come to terms with a more likely truth, that their dead classmates had been overcome by the sources of despair and addiction that took seed in their youth and brought them to the school in the first place.It is unclear how many students attended the Family Foundation School over its roughly 30 years in business. A 1986 newspaper article about the school puts its student population at 34. The next decade, a 1998 yearbook \u2014 roughly the halfway point in the school\u2019s existence \u2014 refers to that year\u2019s graduating class of 30 as its largest ever. The school grew some in the years to come, alumni said.Emmanuel Argiros, the son of the school\u2019s founders and its former president, declined to comment on the school\u2019s history. \u201cI\u2019m trying to move on,\u201d he said. He has had many conversations with angry former students, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful to go through it over and over and over again.\u201dThere is no clearinghouse for data regarding mortality rates among secondary schools. Robert M. Friedman, formerly with the Alliance for the Safe, Therapeutic and Appropriate use of Residential Treatment, said he was familiar with the Family Foundation School and the push by alumni to close it down. He said the deaths of graduates are not typically tracked.\u201cNobody knows how these kids have done, over all,\u201d he said.In recent months, many of the school\u2019s former students have pivoted to a sort of social media suicide watch, urging alumni on Facebook to look out for one another. The effort is led by Elizabeth Ianelli, 39, an alumna of the school and a former police instructor, who has tallied the death count \u2014 now up to 101, all under the age of 50 and the vast majority under 40.Parents who were struggling with troubled teenage children sent them to the Family Foundation School, near Binghamton, where they were promised their sons and daughters would receive a quality education as well as counseling and tough-love discipline.A special-education teacher, Lillian Becker, heard about a job opening at the school in 1998 and went for an interview. It was her first time on the campus, where she saw a schoolhouse, trailers and a red barn arranged on a hill that sloped gently down to a pond.\u201cIt looked wonderful,\u201d Ms. Becker said in a recent interview. \u201cVery professional, very clean, very neat and orderly and everybody was very friendly. They had a student give me a tour. She just seemed so happy to be there.\u201dMs. Becker got the job. On her first day, she saw something strange. She was asked to monitor a timeout room for 20 minutes until a staff member arrived to take over. \u201cA storage room, probably like 6 feet wide by 12 feet long,\u201d she recalled. \u201cOn the floor was this student wrapped in a blanket with duct tape to hold the blanket shut. Just the head was sticking out.\u201dShe was told the student was at risk of hurting others or himself.She settled into her job as a de facto nurse, making outside medical and dental appointments for students and tending to their aches and pains. She saw other practices that, looking back, she wonders why she didn\u2019t openly question.The school was arranged in \u201cfamilies,\u201d with staff members designated as \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d and their \u201cchildren,\u201d the students, eating meals together before retiring to bunk beds in trailers, separate for boys and girls. A regular occurrence during meals were \u201ctable topics,\u201d when students would stand and accuse, or \u201cbring up,\u201d another classmate over some infraction, Ms. Becker and former students said.\u201cSusie would get up and say, \u2018I want to bring up John,\u2019\u201d Ms. Becker said. \u201cJohn had to stand up. Now it\u2019s time to basically break this kid down. \u2018I saw him flirting,\u2019 something like that.\u201d What regularly followed was a tirade of mocking and scolding from other students and adults, she said. \u201cThe staff would chop this kid up.\u201dSanctions varied, some involving food \u2014 a diet of tuna fish on a dry English muffin was a common punishment \u2014 or menial labor, with students burying rocks in the dirt one day, only to be ordered to dig them up the next. Others were social in nature, called \u201cblackouts.\u201d\u201cIf you were on house blackout, you were not allowed to talk to anyone outside of the family you were in,\u201d said Emily Valentine, a student in 2001 and 2002. The most extreme blackout was called exile, leaving the student to sit in a corner, alone, at meals. \u201cYou weren\u2019t allowed to talk to anyone or look anyone in the eye,\u201d said Wesley Good, an alumnus from 2009. \u201cYou were a ghost.\u201dSome students reacted physically. \u201cI flipped out and punched my counselor,\u201d said Elizabeth Boysick, who entered the school in 2000. Ms. Boysick said she was placed in a janitor\u2019s closet for the infraction. \u201cRugs in there, rugs on the wall. Nobody was to talk to you.\u201dSteve Sullivan attended the school from 1999 until 2002, and went on to serve time in prison years later for burglary and robbery. He said he would fight others at every opportunity, beginning on his first day, when he lashed out at staff members who were trying to search him for contraband. \u201cI was thrown in an 8-by-8 isolation room,\u201d he said. \u201cLunch and dinner were both tuna. I\u2019d spend days in there on end.\u201d Once, he kicked the door off its hinges.Former students could remember who watched them while they were bound or locked up: other students, effectively deputized by staff members to serve as jailers.Some of those accounts are corroborated by the reports of state officials who, after receiving complaints, conducted surprise inspections over the years.In 2010, inspectors noted \u201ca previous culture of harsh treatment at the facility,\u201d adding, in a letter to the school, \u201cThe Family Foundation School has been working to change this culture,\u201d according to documents released by the state\u2019s Justice Center for the Protection of People with Special Needs.In a written response to the inspectors, Mr. Argiros, the president, denied that the school acknowledged its past as harsh, and said it has always been open to outside agencies and new protocols for \u201cdealing with often incorrigible and oppositional adolescents who have failed to thrive before coming to our school.\u201dStudents ran away from the school. Mr. Sullivan fled one day in the winter of 2002, unprepared for the eight-mile journey to Hancock, N.Y.\u201cI get to town, and I\u2019m frozen,\u201d he said. \u201cI ended up sleeping in a doghouse. I woke up frozen stiff and I couldn\u2019t move.\u201d He walked to a police station. \u201cI tried to turn myself in. There\u2019s no cop there.\u201dMr. Good, the 2009 alumnus, was initially brought to the school by force; he said men in a van grabbed him off the street at his parents\u2019 request \u2014 an occurrence known as \u201cgooning.\u201d One day, he hurt his elbow and was sent home on a 24-hour pass. Knowing his parents planned to send him back, he ran away from home and hid in a friend\u2019s basement until his 18th birthday some days later, when he was free to leave the school on his own.He wrote his parents a note, \u201cHey, I love you guys, but you don\u2019t understand.\u201dOther students, desperate, saw another means of escape.\u201cI tried to commit suicide one night in my bunk,\u201d said Walter Huff, now 27 and living in Chicago. \u201cI thought it was the only way out. I took a belt and put it around my neck and put it on the top bunk, and woke up the next morning with the belt. It had broken.\u201dIn 2004, a 17-year-old student died after jumping from an upper floor of the school. Ms. Becker, the former nurse, remembers treating students who she believed had attempted to take their lives.\u201cA young lady, it was winter, but the pond had a slight freeze,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThe girl had threatened suicide and went out and jumped in the pond.\u201d Others brought the student to Ms. Becker, who treated her for hypothermia.Ms. Ianelli, who calls herself the \u201ccrypt keeper\u201d of the alumni, believes that the school left some students more damaged than they were when they arrived.\u201cWe call ourselves an endangered species,\u201d she said in an interview.Ms. Ianelli said she was repeatedly groped by an employee of the school and then reprimanded when she tried to report the behavior. The experience left her so distraught that she grabbed a plastic jug marked \u201cbleach\u201d and entered a walk-in cooler. She gulped the liquid.\u201cI was so excited to die,\u201d she said.Nothing happened. She looked at the jug again and saw another word written on the other side: \u201cvinegar.\u201dJames Clemente, 61, of Trumbull, Conn., sent his son Mark to the Family Foundation School in 2002 when the boy was 17; he described it as a last-ditch effort to treat Mark\u2019s heroin addiction.\u201cI thought it was a great school,\u201d Mr. Clemente said. \u201cHe was getting an education, not just going to rehab.\u201dMark left the school when he turned 18 and moved to Manhattan, where he lived on the streets for more than a decade, a fixture in Union Square and the East Village. He died of liver failure in 2017.\u201cThey had all the tools he needed to use,\u201d Mr. Clemente said of the school. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t use them.\u201dAnne Moss Rogers sent her son, Charles, to the school in 2012 in hopes of treating his depression and anxiety. He left the school in 2014 and killed himself a year later while suffering from withdrawal from heroin.\u201cWhen Charles died, there was one before him and one right after. A girl overdosed, then he died, then a child died due to alcohol, a car accident.\u201d She believes the school actually prolonged Charles\u2019 life: \u201cHe would have been dead at 17.\u201dMs. Rogers, who became a speaker and mental health advocate after losing her son, said the list of dead classmates should be placed in a larger perspective. \u201cThese are high-risk kids,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in an opioid epidemic and a suicide epidemic.\u201dJon Martin-Crawford, an alumnus, achieved notoriety among his peers when he testified about the school before a congressional hearing regarding treatment programs for teens in 2008.\u201cThe nightmares and psychological scars of being dragged from your home to a place in the middle of nowhere; restrained in blankets and Duct tape; assaulted, verbally and physically \u2014 those scars and that trauma never go away,\u201d Mr. Martin-Crawford, then 28, testified. \u201cFor my friends who have since died from suicide because of the nightmares or those who still suffer the nightmares, our time and our voice will not be in vain.\u201dSeven years later, he hanged himself.\u201cIt\u2019s like, who\u2019s next?\u201d a former student, Sara McGrath Brathwaite, said when contacted by a reporter earlier this year. \u201cWhy?\u201dThirteen former students died in 2017, among them a nurse anesthetist in Colorado, Suzanne Leffler, who took her life with drugs through an IV from her job. Ms. Leffler and another teen, Lauren Durnin, met at the school in the 1990s and remained friends. \u201cShe was always trying to make you laugh,\u201d Ms. Durnin said. \u201cShe just seemed like she had it all together.\u201dIn August, the police went to Ms. Leffler\u2019s house and found her on her bed. \u201cShe had put herself to sleep,\u201d Ms. Durnin said.Ms. Durnin said she found herself contemplating her own death.\u201cAll I could think to myself is, \u2018You could have called me and I would have been there for you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the time, after she died, I thought if she had said, \u2018Will you do it with me?\u2019 I would have.\u201dToday, a sports camp stands where the school once did, the buildings on the property under new ownership. Roads once dirt are paved now, but off-season at the camp, they are quiet. There is the pond where the girl dropped through the ice. There is the old barn.Ms. Boysick, the former student who described the room with rugs on the walls, said she was repeatedly sexually abused in the barn by a teacher. She recently went to the police, after almost two decades, to press charges. The statute of limitations had passed, she was told. Nothing could be done.A white pickup drove past the property one evening in April. Behind the wheel was Randy Whiting, 64, whose family has owned the property for many years, and who used to work in maintenance at the school. He was an insider and an outsider at the same time, his front-row seat unrelated to education or the school\u2019s cause. News of recent deaths among alumni has found him, too.\u201cYou know some of them, and you hear it,\u201d Mr. Whiting said. He believes the school did a lot of good for a lot of teenagers. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones you don\u2019t hear much about,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were some of the kids you just can\u2019t reach.\u201dSome of those apparently beyond reach make their appearances on Ms. Ianelli\u2019s Facebook page, alongside victims of tragic accidents.In January, an alumnus crossing a busy road in Moonachie, N.J., was struck and killed in a hit-and-run collision. He became No. 94.In April, reports of more deaths arrived back-to-back-to-back. A 27-year-old man was killed in a scooter accident in Florida. In Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a 35-year-old graduate and medical equipment salesman, Kyle Nelson, learned that his stepfather had died overnight. When he left to go to his grieving mother\u2019s home the next morning, he dropped dead of a heart attack. In July, when some past deaths were added, the list reached, and then passed, 100.Last year, Ms. Ianelli and others from the school planted a tree near the property in Hancock, beside a Catholic church in Long Eddy. They placed a plaque before it and named it the Lost Souls Tree.Up close, markings can be read on rocks, remembering dead friends, but in the winter, the tree is bare and slight, easily missed when passing by.An earlier version of this article misstated the year a student died after jumping from an upper floor of the Family Foundation School. It was 2004, not 2007.Advertisement"}

Six tenderfoot crew members stood sweating in the shadows nearby.

Perhaps try a \u201cjittery\u201d Satanist.\u201cI wanted a front-row seat in seeing this new world unfold,\u201d Ms. Murdoch, 50, said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s harder than it looks. Great mobile video is unforgiving, labor-intensive and often counterintuitive to produce.\u201d\u201cIt would be your \u2018Law & Order\u2019 if you were 13,\u201d said Adam Lederer, 27, the showrunner for \u201cSolve.\u201dWith Vertical, Ms. Murdoch wanted to experiment. Could the upstart studio find novel ways to entertain 13-to-25-year-old users of apps like Snapchat \u2014 and spin off that content into traditional television shows, books and other media?She has reached a verdict after two years of stops and starts. \u201cIt looks like we can,\u201d Ms. Murdoch said.An episode of \u201cPhoneSwap.\u201d Vertical NetworksVertical will also publish an advice book based on its Brother e-magazine, which specializes in audacious lifestyle tips. An example from a recent edition: \u201cFun fact!

She joined Vertical two years ago and tracks the performance of the studio\u2019s content across more than 100 variables to learn how viewers behave. What do they like?

(HBO\u2019s meandering \u201cWestworld\u201d this is not.)\u201cWe\u2019ve been disproportionately successful because we have built an amazing team that leans really heavily into audience insights,\u201d said Mr. Wright, who will remain involved in the studio. \u201cThe default is to lean into the expertise that you already have \u2014 to do what you already know.\u201dMr. Chavez added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just TV for a smaller screen.

In one misfire, the studio tried to make a mobile show, \u201cEpic Quit,\u201d that involved people quitting their jobs in over-the-top ways. But no matter how much Vertical tweaked the series, viewers did not materialize.

{"Headline": "Botching the Great Recession", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy the slump went on so much longer than it should have.Opinion ColumnistIt has been ten years since the failure of Lehman sent the global financial system into freefall. Why is this date different from any other date? No particular reason. But round-number anniversaries do have the virtue of giving people a reason to look back at experience, and maybe even learn from it.So how does the crisis response look 10 years later? Well, it could have been worse. But it could and should have been much better.Let\u2019s start with what went kind of right. Faced with an imminent financial meltdown, policymakers by and large did what needed to be done to limit the damage. Their actions included bank bailouts, which should have been fairer \u2014 too many bankers got bailed out along with their banks \u2014 but were effective. There were also many emergency provisions of credit, including little-known but crucial things like maintaining dollar credit lines to non-U.S. central banks.The result was that the acute phase of the financial crisis \u2014 what I still think of as the \u201cOh God we\u2019re all gonna die\u201d phase \u2014 was relatively brief. It was scary and did immense damage \u2014 America lost 6 \u00bd million jobs in the year after Lehman fell. But as you can see in Figure 1, measures of financial stress fell off rapidly in 2009, and were more or less back to normal by the summer.Rapid financial recovery did not, however, produce rapid recovery for the economy as a whole. As the same figure shows, unemployment stayed high for many years; we didn\u2019t return to anything that felt remotely like full employment (leaving aside the question of whether we\u2019re there even now) until late in Obama\u2019s second term.Why didn\u2019t financial stability bring a rapid bounceback? Because financial disruption wasn\u2019t at the heart of the slump. The really big factor was the bursting of the housing bubble \u2014 of which the banking crisis was a symptom. As Figure 2 shows, the housing bust led directly to a dramatic drop in residential investment, enough in itself to produce a deep recession, and recovery was both slow and incomplete.The plunge in home prices also destroyed a lot of household wealth, depressing consumer spending in general.So what should we have done to produce a faster recovery? Private spending was depressed; monetary policy was ineffective because we were at the zero lower bound on interest rates. So we needed fiscal expansion, some combination of spending and tax cuts.And we did, of course, get the ARRA \u2014 the Obama stimulus. But it was too small and, even more important, faded out much too quickly; see Figure 3.Why, then, didn\u2019t we get the fiscal policy we should have had? There were, I\u2019d say, multiple villains in the story.Second, Very Serious People pivoted very early from concern about the unemployed \u2014 hey, they probably lacked the necessary skills \u2014 to hysteria over deficits. By 2011, unemployment was still over 9 percent, but all the Beltway crowd wanted to talk about was the menace of the debt.Finally, Republicans blocked attempts to rescue the economy and tried to strangle government spending every step of the way. They claimed that this was because they cared about fiscal responsibility \u2014 but it was obvious to anyone paying attention (which unfortunately didn\u2019t include almost anyone in the news media) that this was an insincere, bad-faith argument. As we\u2019ve now seen, they don\u2019t care at all about deficits as long as a Republican is in the White House and the deficits are the counterpart of tax cuts for the rich.The end result was that policy moved quickly and fairly effectively to rescue banks, then turned its back on mass unemployment. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s both sad and nasty. And there\u2019s every reason to believe that if we have another crisis, it will happen all over again.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA bone-marrow transplant treated a patient\u2019s leukemia \u2014 and his delusions, too. Some doctors think they know why. Mr. Velasquez-Manoff is a science writer. Years later, \u201che is completely off all medication and shows no psychiatric symptoms,\u201d Dr. Miyaoka told me in an email. Somehow the transplant cured the man\u2019s schizophrenia.A bone-marrow transplant essentially reboots the immune system. Chemotherapy kills off your old white blood cells, and new ones sprout from the donor\u2019s transplanted blood stem cells. It\u2019s unwise to extrapolate too much from a single case study, and it\u2019s possible it was the drugs the man took as part of the transplant procedure that helped him. But his recovery suggests that his immune system was somehow driving his psychiatric symptoms.At first glance, the idea seems bizarre \u2014 what does the immune system have to do with the brain? \u2014 but it jibes with a growing body of literature suggesting that the immune system is involved in psychiatric disorders from depression to bipolar disorder.Inspired by these observations, the Austrian physician Julius Wagner-Jauregg developed a method of deliberate infection of psychiatric patients with malaria to induce fever. Some of his patients died from the treatment, but many others recovered. He won a Nobel Prize in 1927.Modern doctors have also observed that people who suffer from certain autoimmune diseases, like lupus, can develop what looks like psychiatric illness. These symptoms probably result from the immune system attacking the central nervous system or from a more generalized inflammation that affects how the brain works.Some psychiatrists long ago posited that many \u201cschizophrenias\u201d existed \u2014 different paths that led to what looked like one disorder. Perhaps one of those paths is autoinflammatory or autoimmune.If this idea pans out, what can we do about it? Bone marrow transplant is an extreme and risky intervention, and even if the theoretical basis were completely sound \u2014 which it\u2019s not yet \u2014 it\u2019s unlikely to become a widespread treatment for psychiatric disorders. Dr. Yolken says that for now, doctors treating leukemia patients who also have psychiatric illnesses should monitor their psychiatric progress after transplantation, so that we can learn more.Minocycline has since been studied by others. Larger trials suggest that it\u2019s an effective add-on treatment for schizophrenia. Some have argued that it works because it tamps down inflammation in the brain. But it\u2019s also possible that it affects the microbiome \u2014 the community of microbes in the human body \u2014 and thus changes how the immune system works.The study is preliminary, but it suggests that targeting immune function may improve mental health outcomes and that tinkering with the microbiome might be a practical, cost-effective way to do this.Watershed moments occasionally come along in medical history when previously intractable or even deadly conditions suddenly become treatable or preventable. They are sometimes accompanied by a shift in how scientists understand the disorders in question. We now seem to have reached such a threshold with certain rare autoimmune diseases of the brain. Not long ago, they could be a death sentence or warrant institutionalization. Now, with aggressive treatment directed at the immune system, patients can recover. Does this group encompass a larger chunk of psychiatric disorders? No one knows the answer yet, but it\u2019s an exciting time to watch the question play out.Advertisement"}

What is the right way to manage family migration? Or evaluate asylum claims? Or weigh American labor needs against the skills of prospective visa holders?

{"Headline": "The Economic Future Isn\u2019t What It Used to Be (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLong run economic prospects fell sharply after the Great RecessionOpinion ColumnistLehman failed ten years and two weeks ago; this coming Wednesday will be the 10th anniversary of the enactment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, aka the bailout. In honor of the anniversary, there have been approximately 1,000,000,000 pieces reflecting on the 2008 financial crisis and its effects. Many have suggested, rightly, that the political fallout continues to shape our world today. But as far as I can tell, surprisingly few have focused on the long-run economic effects.What\u2019s odd about this relative neglect is that even a cursory look at the data suggests that these effects were huge. It\u2019s true that U.S. unemployment is back below what it was before the crisis; although it\u2019s not widely realized, euro area unemployment is also way down, not quite to eve-of-crisis levels but well below its pre-crisis average. But in both cases we\u2019ve returned to sort-of full employment at a much lower level of real GDP than informed people projected we\u2019d reach before the crisis struck.Economists use the term \u201cpotential output\u201d to refer to the maximum amount an economy can produce without inflationary overheating. This concept plays a central role in monetary policy, and some role in fiscal policy too. As I\u2019ll explain in a bit, the theoretical underpinnings of the concept look weaker now, in the light of post-crisis experience, than they used to. But for now, let\u2019s just note that a number of agencies, from the U.S. Congressional Budget Office to the International Monetary Fund, routinely produce estimates of current potential output and projections of future potential output.To be clear, these are model-based estimates, not actual data. And one possible story is that the models are all wrong, that we\u2019re looking at a construct that has nothing to do with reality. But as I said, these models matter for policy. So what do we find if we compare pre-crisis projections of potential output over the decade ahead to current estimates? The answer is, a huge downgrading of estimates of economic capacity on both sides of the Atlantic.This massive decline in GDP from what we used to expect, a full decade after the financial crisis, is a huge story \u2013 call it the Great Shortfall \u2014 that gets overlooked in the usual focus on short-term growth rates. What might explain it?This story is in effect, though not explicitly, the narrative underlying actual economic policy: the Fed and other central banks, which are the real actors in macroeconomic policy under current conditions, don\u2019t act as if they\u2019re very worried that a future recession might depress the economy not just in the short run but permanently. Fiscal authorities, to the extent that they think coherently about these issues at all \u2013 i.e., outside the current U.S. administration \u2013 also take the path of future economic potential mostly as a given.To be fair, CBO\u2019s projections try to take the incentive effects of tax policy and the effects of deficits on investment into account, but these are small change compared with what you would need to link the Great Recession to the massive downgrading of long-run growth projections.What\u2019s the evidence against this view? The most compelling evidence, cited by both Fat\u00e1s/Summers and Ball, is that the size of the Great Shortfall varies a lot between countries \u2013 and the countries whose estimated economic potential has taken the biggest hit are precisely the countries that had the biggest slumps in the economic crisis. Indeed, the relationship between output decline in the crisis and the fall in long-run potential GDP is pretty much one-for-one.Figure 3 shows the most extreme case, Greece, comparing actual and potential GDP as estimated by the IMF. As everyone knows, Greece has suffered a huge, Depression-level slump. According to the IMF, however, around half that slump is a decline in capacity rather than reduced utilization of capacity.What\u2019s going on? The IMF\u2019s method for calculating potential GDP basically reads any sustained slump as a decline in potential output relative to previous expectations, and this interpretation of decline affects both its projections of the future and its interpretation of the past: if it concludes that potential output in 2010 was really low, the IMF marks down its estimates of potential in previous years too.Which brings me to a second possible explanation of the Great Shortfall: maybe it exists only in the minds and models of policymakers (or, actually, their technical experts), and isn\u2019t a real thing at all. That is, the belief that our economic potential has fallen far below previous expectations doesn\u2019t represent an actual economic ailment, but instead reflects policymakers\u2019 hypochondria.After all, how is potential output calculated? The details are complex, but basically such calculations rely on one or both of two theories: that slumps and booms are always short-lived, and/or that inflation is an \u201caccelerationist\u201d process.Suppose, first, that you start from the assumption that deviations of actual GDP from potential GDP tend to be eliminated over the course of a few years at most, with the economy surging after slumps and stagnating or shrinking after booms. In that case, you believe that the average difference between actual and potential GDP will be roughly zero over any extended period, which means that you can get an estimate of potential GDP by taking actual GDP and applying some kind of statistical method that smooths out the fluctuations.Suppose, alternatively, that you believe \u2013 as most mainstream economists did not long ago \u2013 in some version of Milton Friedman\u2019s \u201cnatural rate\u201d hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, an economy running above potential output will experience not just inflation but accelerating inflation, while an economy with persistent slack will experience ongoing disinflation, with the inflation rate falling continuously and eventually turning into accelerating deflation. If this hypothesis is true, you can in effect infer where we are relative to potential by asking what\u2019s happening to inflation: if it\u2019s stable, the economy is producing roughly at potential.In the light of post-2008 experience, however, it\u2019s clear that both of these theories are wrong. When interest rates hit zero, it\u2019s far from clear why or how the economy will quickly recover, since the usual way we bounce back from a slump \u2013 the central bank cuts interest rates, boosting spending \u2013 can\u2019t happen. Meanwhile, thanks in part to the reluctance of employers to cut wages even in the face of high unemployment, even obviously depressed economies seem at worst to experience low inflation, not an ongoing slide into accelerating deflation.Given these realities, consider how estimates of potential output will respond if an economy suffers a big decline in overall demand that persists for a number of years. Because the economy remains depressed for a long time, statistical methods that don\u2019t allow for this possibility will falsely interpret a sustained slump as a fall in potential GDP. Because inflation, while it may decline a bit at first in a slump, typically remains stable thereafter, models that try to infer potential output from changes in inflation will also conclude wrongly that the economy is operating near potential.So is the Great Shortfall something that exists only in policymakers\u2019 minds, when the real story is that there\u2019s still a huge amount of excess capacity? It\u2019s certainly a possibility worth considering. And I\u2019m reasonably sure that when it comes to Greece in particular, the huge decline in estimated potential output is exaggerated. I simply don\u2019t believe that after a 25 percent decline in real GDP, almost none of it made up by recent growth, and with 20 percent unemployment even now, Greece is only 2 percent below potential \u2013 which is the IMF\u2019s estimate.But this is a harder story to tell for the U.S. or the euro area as a whole. The simple version of the hypochondria hypothesis would be that officials misinterpret high unemployment as a structural problem when it\u2019s actually a demand problem. But at this point neither the U.S. nor the euro area has high unemployment by historical standards. Everyone knows the U.S. story; Figure 4 shows the euro area unemployment rate, which while higher than the U.S. rate is also now low compared with pre-crisis norms.It\u2019s true that many people argue that the unemployment rate has become a misleading measure of labor market slack, that the job market isn\u2019t as good as the standard measure indicates. But as Figure 5 shows, even broader measures like labor-force participation of prime-age adults aren\u2019t down all that much, and they were on a declining trend even before the crisis. So even a \u201chidden unemployment\u201d story won\u2019t explain the hugeness of the Great Shortfall \u2013 that is, it\u2019s not enough to make what we see consistent with a story that claims that it\u2019s all, still, about massively inadequate demand.Which brings us to the third story, which is that the Great Recession itself damaged potential output, largely by reducing productivity.If that sounds a little vague, that\u2019s because it is. Fat\u00e1s, Summers, and others argue that there has been a lot of hysteresis, and my instinct is to agree with them; but I\u2019m not aware of work that pins down the channels through which this is supposed to have happened with any precision. We really need people to do this work, because if hysteresis is the real story, if the Great Recession caused the Great Shortfall, it has huge implications for the future.Nobody wants to go through a repeat of the Great Recession, which is a reason to pursue policies that both reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis and increase our ability to respond if one happens. Hence financial regulation, expanded ability to seize troubled financial institutions (so as to be able prop them up without bailing out stockholders and executives), and so on. Some of us have also argued for a higher inflation target, which would leave more room to cut real interest rates when the next slump comes.If the Great Recession really did cause the Great Shortfall, the urgency of such measures is much greater. Using conventional measures, the Great Recession and the depressed economy that lingered for years thereafter cost the U.S. something like 15 percent of a year\u2019s GDP. If the decline in long-term economic prospects was also caused by the slump, this cost rises to something much bigger \u2013 possibly more than 70 percent of a year\u2019s GDP so far, and much more to come.In fact, as Fat\u00e1s says, an austerity mindset risks creating a \u201cdoom loop,\u201d in which fiscal contraction leads to a decline in economic prospects, worsening the budget outlook, leading to even more contraction. Greece has slashed spending, at huge social cost, but been rewarded \u2013 at least according to the official estimates \u2013 with a drastic decline in future prospects, so that its debt outlook looks barely better than it did before the cuts.So the Great Shortfall \u2013 the long-term shadow on the economy apparently cast by the Great Recession \u2013 is a huge issue. It deserves more attention, with maybe less focus on the few months of credit crunch after Lehman fell.Advertisement"}

But when I\u2019m decompressing and starting to make dinner, I do want something almost as simple as that.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s the Point of the Supreme Court?", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you know beforehand how justices will vote based on which president appointed them, then what\u2019s the point of having a court that, in theory, operates above politics?Mr. Kaplan is a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek.When Justice Antonin Scalia died in early 2016, liberals and conservatives alike agreed that the next justice could transform American life for a generation or more. Donald Trump warned that if Hillary Clinton got to make the appointment \u201cour country is going to be Venezuela.\u201d Mrs. Clinton responded that a Trump justice \u201cwould threaten the future of our planet.\u201d The partisan forecasts are even more ominous as Senate hearings begin next week on Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court.We may pride ourselves that we have self-government, but for decades we\u2019ve turned to the court to settle our most difficult social and political issues: abortion and gay marriage, campaign finance and gun control, even a disputed presidential election. When the justices rule the way we like, we laud them for \u201cinterpreting\u201d the Constitution. When they don\u2019t, we complain they\u2019re \u201cmaking the law\u201d based on their own predilections. A good justice is an umpire; a bad justice is a player. No real principle seems to be involved in our assessments of the court, only whether we endorse the outcome of this case or that one. The court has become just another political prize to be won by the party in power, not the neutral arbiter this country\u2019s founders envisioned.\u201cWe need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!\u201d President Trump tweeted this past spring. That kind of cynicism corrodes any legitimacy the court has left.The court\u2019s arrogance enfeebles Congress. Lawmakers recognize there\u2019s little benefit in doing their jobs if, in the end, the court is going to resolve the hard questions anyway. This is why many reformers and activists focus on the court. Witness the money and energy expended on litigating, say, abortion. When demonstrators convene outside the Supreme Court, they surely miss the irony that they\u2019re marching right past the Capitol across the street.Under Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., we have a court of blue chambers and red chambers. It wasn\u2019t always that way. In the past, presidents weren\u2019t driven solely by hyperpartisan agendas for the court, in part because the court wasn\u2019t in the maelstrom of so many divisive issues as it is today. Yes, justices sometimes disappointed the presidents who appointed them \u2014 like Earl Warren, selected by Dwight D. Eisenhower to be chief in 1953, and David H. Souter, picked by George H.W. Bush in 1990. But now, thanks to more cynical vetting, nominees act on the bench the way the presidents who chose them expected. Barack Obama got what he wanted with Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. So, too, in most votes, did George W. Bush with John Roberts and Samuel A. Alito Jr., and Bill Clinton with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. When the votes in contentious cases can be predicted at the outset, constitutional law simply becomes partisan politics by another name. If you typically know beforehand how justices will vote based on which president appointed them, then what\u2019s the point of having a court that, in theory, operates above politics?Of course, the court sometimes must act decisively to protect rights. By design, the unelected, largely unaccountable Supreme Court serves as a bulwark against tyrannical majorities. The First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free expression envisions the protection of repugnant views. And few legislators are apt to defend the rights of criminal suspects. That\u2019s why there are constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and against self-incrimination. The court\u2019s role is to vindicate these unpopular protections. In one of its finest moments, in Brown v. Board of Education, the court gave force to the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection for all.Once upon a time, liberals looked to the Supreme Court to secure social justice, while conservatives abhorred what they called judicial activism. Now that conservatives are on the verge of locking down control of the court, they can\u2019t wait for the court to enshrine new legal doctrine to achieve victories that have eluded them in the political branches, or, if need be, to validate successes won now that the White House and Congress are in Republican hands. Rollbacks of federal regulation of the environment, the workplace, health care and the voting booth are the constitutional grail for conservatives. Suddenly, liberals are the ones preaching judicial restraint. In the fight for the court, hypocrisy is king.A month before the Constitution was ratified in 1788, Alexander Hamilton explained what he saw as the source of power for the new Supreme Court. The other branches, as well as the populace, would obey the justices because of their prestige. Their rulings would be based \u201cneither on force nor will, but merely judgment.\u201d By Hamilton\u2019s reckoning, while the president \u201cholds the sword\u201d and Congress \u201ccommands the purse,\u201d the court would be \u201cthe least dangerous branch.\u201dThat\u2019s no longer so. Yes, the president can initiate war. And Congress, beholden to special interests, can pass foolish laws or do nothing at all. But the court\u2019s self-aggrandizement in recent decades is more insidious and destructive of American values in the long term. With deep distrust in our elected representatives, we have come to believe democracy is broken. Too often we\u2019ve hoped that the justices will be our saviors. With so much dysfunction in government, the justices see themselves that way, too. But even in the current age, we need to demand more from the political branches of our government. We do not need, nor should we want, the court to save us from ourselves. Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a promotion of diversity and inclusiveness in all forms.Why is that important?Thanks to social media, progress is being made toward more inclusive representation. Things have changed in the fashion industry as far as what is considered beautiful, and usually when changes are made in fashion, and big brands change their image, that strongly affects culture and the society. This changes the way people see things, and people gain from those changes.On the other hand, we are witnessing the reassertion of nationalism and extremist sentiments in Italy, Europe and the U.S. I feel that, more and more, we need to talk about the importance of diversity and of not judging someone else\u2019s physical appearance, or their culture, or thinking that because someone is different from us it means that they are inferior. So we are living in a very, very particular time, because it feels like we have much more freedom in one way, but in another way everything is closing down.So, why an exhibition on masculinity?Because in the past few years women have questioned what it means to be a woman and the roles they were supposed to fulfill. But women question themselves much more than men do. For too long, to be a man you had to be strong, you had to be in control, you had to be responsible and straight. And otherwise you were gay, and if you were gay you had to be what was referred to then as effeminate. Now there is much more fluidity.There can be sensitivity. There can be tenderness.It\u2019s a much wider spectrum compared to the representation that we typically see. I feel that things are starting to change. This idea that if you\u2019re a man you cannot be who you actually are creates a huge problem for young boys growing up. It\u2019s about time people start to question it.Are these photos from Vogue\u2019s men\u2019s magazine?What should you be talking about? And how is that different from 30 years ago?Stereotypes?Yes. There are a multitude of ways of being gay \u2014 there are gay soldiers. This is not just for masculinity, but in every part of our lives, I think we\u2019re trying for more realistic representations \u2014 particularly around gender identity. I feel that our representation today is richer, but for men a lot more needs to be done. Particularly around fluidity of expression and more freedom to be who you are.I feel that men and people with disabilities are the last frontier. We somehow have managed to overcome some of the prejudice in fashion from the past, but these two things need to be worked on.The prejudice against disabled people is very profound. And it\u2019s still difficult for disabled people to participate fully in our society.Absolutely. This is an issue that I really care about and I\u2019m dedicating a lot of space in the magazine for that kind of representation. There was this article the other day on Teen Vogue about this incredible model, Jillian Mercado, a wheelchair user who signed with an agency and is starting to work. I think this is important.Disabled people never seen themselves in a fashion magazine or in a fashion show. Why? They care about what they wear and about their sexuality. They want to look hot, too.Advertisement"}

Supported byMr. Samaha is the author of \u201cNever Ran, Never Will: Boyhood and Football in a Changing American Inner City.\u201dBy the time they were in middle school, Andrew Hart and Isaiah Anthony were already thinking about college. Andrew \u2014 whose grandparents moved during the Great Migration from the South to New York City, where his parents built working-class lives in Queens \u2014 thought he might one day study engineering. Isaiah \u2014 whose mother had arrived in the United States from Guyana as a teenager, settling into Brooklyn and working at a day care center \u2014 imagined himself in business school. Both boys knew that when it came to their futures, they had something that seemed to hold even more promise than their good grades and the praise they earned from their teachers: Isaiah and Andrew were exceptionally good football players. In a country where the margin for error is especially thin for black and brown boys in poor and working-class communities, they and their families also had plans: First, the boys would trade their football talent for financial aid packages from local private high schools. Next would come athletic scholarships to college. Football, to these boys, was not the end but the means. I met Andrew and Isaiah in 2013, when Andrew was 10, Isaiah was 11, and I was beginning work on a book about their youth football team, the Mo Better Jaguars. As I learned about their lives, it occurred to me that the contemporary debate about the role of football in American society often overlooks kids like them. They\u2019re members of the first generation of football players to truly know the physical risks they face, taking the field even as a growing number of adults call for a prohibition of the sport, because their futures depend upon it. But that\u2019s not always the case. The truth is, while some will decide the game\u2019s risks aren\u2019t worth it, others \u2014 mostly lower-income black and brown kids \u2014 continue to depend on it as a chance to climb the educational and economic ladder. Yes, football is dangerous, but so is leaving one\u2019s future in the hands of an unequal educational system. It\u2019s no wonder the sport still feels like a winning ticket. [Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]This is not unusual. Many of their opponents were losing kids too. Pop Warner participation declined by around 10 percent from 2010 to 2012, after what the organization had deemed 80-plus years of steady growth. Although a spokesperson for Pop Warner has said that participation nationwide has remained stable since, some youth football coaches have reported losing one or two teams in most towns in their area. In my five years following Mo Better, at least three Brooklyn-based programs stopped fielding teams or merged with other teams.But even as football\u2019s decline begins to seems inevitable, the moral reckoning is only in its early stages. The sport remains on the throne it\u2019s occupied in America for the past half-century, a multibillion-dollar business that dominates television ratings and is fed by a pipeline of high schools and colleges that have eagerly invested in state-of-the-art stadiums, high-salaried coaches and blue-chip prospects who draw crowds. The 130 or so college programs in the highest athletic division can hand out 85 football scholarships each, which is more than those for basketball, baseball, softball and soccer combined, not to mention any other extracurricular endeavor. To many of the boys and their parents who chase that opportunity, turning away from the sport is a luxury they don\u2019t think they can afford, a mind-set that became clear in conversations and interviews. From what I saw at practices and games in New York City and northern New Jersey, football\u2019s harm is being increasingly concentrated on those who grow up with few other options. Education in America is widely seen as a path to success, but all kids don\u2019t have access to the same paths. The system is girded by property taxes, leaving residents of poorer neighborhoods with underfunded schools. School district policies confine most kids to the schools closest to them, often to the detriment of black and brown children born into communities blighted by racist housing policies that for decades choked off resources and financial opportunities. Children\u2019s academic successes or setbacks may be determined by factors outside their control, but can snowball quickly. While Isaiah wasn\u2019t recruited by any coaches from private high schools, coaches from several public high schools pitched their programs to him. He chose Erasmus Hall, which has one of the city\u2019s top football teams. When it comes to plans for the future, Andrew is now split between going into law or medicine. Isaiah is still thinking business. But that crossroad comes later. For now, their minds are on earning free entry into a university, avoiding the quicksand of student debt. In their eyes, a football scholarship is the clearest road to that next checkpoint. Football reflects this country\u2019s racial caste system: mostly black players sacrificing their bodies for the entertainment of a mostly white audience. That dynamic is likely to become even more pronounced. Surely we\u2019d feel better as a society if promising kids like Andrew and Isaiah weren\u2019t bashing their heads together hundreds of times a week. But until they see other lanes of opportunity reliably opened for them, they will continue to do so. On a rainy Sunday morning last October, Isaiah took the field with his Erasmus Hall junior varsity teammates for a game against South Shore High School. He\u2019d done well the previous season as a speedy running back on the freshman team. But in the year since he looked like he hadn\u2019t grown as much as some of his classmates, and he now seemed to be the smallest boy on the field. Early in the game, the ball came his way and a wave of defenders converged. He sidestepped the first, ran around the second, juked the third. When I\u2019d last seen him play three years earlier, his extraordinary speed had made him seem unstoppable. But on this morning, as the escape routes closed and the wave crashed in, it looked as if he was just trying to survive out there.Advertisement"}

Samidh Chakrabarti, who leads Facebook\u2019s elections and civic engagement team, says that safeguarding elections from interference is \u201cprobably the biggest companywide reorientation since our shift from desktops to mobile phones.\u201dOnce a problem reaches the War Room, the dashboards will be set to spot and track unusual activity, while data scientists and security experts take a closer look. Mr. Chakrabarti said the team was particularly on guard for posts that manifested \u201creal-world harm,\u201d and planned to remove posts that tried to disenfranchise voters by giving incorrect polling data or spreading hoaxes like encouraging people to vote by text message. \u201cThe best outcome for us is that nothing happens in the War Room,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything else we are doing is defenses we are putting down to stop this in the first place.\u201dThe Federal Reserve is slowly raising interest rates to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating \u2014 a plan President Trump has publicly criticized. The danger of such interference is clear, but Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, has a plan.He grew up and earned his law degree there and made a fortune while working at D.C.-based private equity powerhouse Carlyle Group. He has deep connections to Washington\u2019s Republican establishment. He served in the U.S. Department of the Treasury under President George H.W.

You might ask why multiple issues should strike at the same time. The answer, in two words, is Hyman Minsky: after a long period of stable growth, lenders and investors get complacent, and the private sector overreaches. If that is what happens, we should expect another sluggish, jobless recovery like that after the 1990-1 and 2001 recessions, except probably worse.DealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

It is also a story about the muddled sludge of colonial history.Ms. Adichie is a novelist. The carnage is not so much about language as it is about yet another African nation\u2019s fatal disregard of its minority population. It is also about the muddled sludge of Europe\u2019s colonial legacy. Cameroon was a German colony until the First World War, when British and French forces captured and divided it. The French took the much larger slice, and the British a small sliver that bordered their colony in Nigeria. (Some Nigerians moved there; my Nigerian mother was born in 1942 to parents who had recently started a business in the British Cameroons.)So was born a single bilingual country, the Federal Republic of Cameroon, with two autonomous regions. On the national flag were two stars, symbolizing this union of the Anglophone and Francophone. It was, constitutionally, an equal union. It was, in reality, an unequal union, as the Francophone region was much larger in size and population. And it quickly became, by political intent, an unjust union. In secondary school, Theo hated chemistry because his Francophone teacher barely spoke English, and when the confused students asked questions, the teacher flogged them, while swearing at them in French. Once, Francophone police officers stopped a bus that Theo was traveling on and singled out English-speakers, harassing them, calling them \u201cAnglo-fools.\u201d Theo\u2019s uncle learned French and tried to pass as Francophone to get a job in Yaound\u00e9, the capital.There, he taught English. He learned Mandarin. He fell in love with Libby, her elegance, her intelligence, her quiet confidence. They bonded over their shared Christianity. They had a daughter. When Libby got pregnant again, they worried about the price they would have to pay for violating the one-child policy. They desperately wanted the baby. And so they came to America as asylum seekers.While Theo navigated the labyrinth of America\u2019s asylum process, his home in Anglophone Cameroon was splintering. Teachers were on strike, protesting the imposition of French-speaking teachers on Anglophone schools. Anglophone lawyers wearing their white curly wigs poured into the streets to demand change. Cameroon has two often-conflicting legal systems, English common law in the Anglophone region and the French civil code in the Francophone. Francophone judges had long been employed in Anglophone courts, and the lawyers who had to argue cases before befuddled judges had had enough. Ordinary citizens joined the protests. They wanted autonomy. They wanted teachers who spoke English and judges who were trained in the law of the land. Most Anglophones had only demanded autonomy, but against the glare of state violence, the movement for independence, which had been considered fringe and insignificant, suddenly seemed legitimate.Recently, Theo\u2019s son was playing with our toddler daughter and pulled out a blue flashcard from a toy basket. \u201cThat\u2019s indigo!\u201d he said.I teased Theo. \u201cYou overachieving African immigrant! The poor boy is barely 3 years old and he doesn\u2019t just know blue, he knows indigo?\u201d\u201cWe do drills,\u201d Theo said solemnly. \u201cI want to prepare him for kindergarten. At least in this country you succeed on merit.\u201dThen he looked away, sounding a little unsure.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Kavanaugh\u2019s Midterm Effect", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.There was one name that kept coming up at a fund-raiser for Betsy Dirksen Londrigan, a Democratic congressional candidate, in Springfield, Ill., on Monday night.It wasn\u2019t hers. It was Anita Hill\u2019s.As donors spilled onto the sidewalk outside the event, they kept returning to a moment that was all-but-ancient history: the congressional testimony of Ms. Hill, who accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearing.A group of older women told Ms. Londrigan how worried they were that Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault, would be treated with the same disrespect they believed Ms. Hill once faced. Others expressed frustration with how little control voters had over the confirmation process, asking what, if anything, they could do.Controversies that spark huge outrage in the halls of Congress usually take some time to filter down into elections. Sometimes they don\u2019t register much with voters at all.In July, just a few days after President Trump\u2019s summit in Helsinki with Vladimir V. Putin, I drove down to the suburbs of Richmond, Va., to ask voters what they thought about the president\u2019s comments \u2014 a performance that prompted withering bipartisan criticism in Washington. They largely responded with shrugs.That seems unlikely to be the case with the accusations against Mr. Kavanaugh.\u201cSo much happens in D.C. that doesn\u2019t really reach people,\u201d said Emma Brown, Ms. Londrigan\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cSomething about this has really struck a chord, especially with women.\u201dBut her campaign says they\u2019ve already seen an uptick in volunteers, with people wandering into their offices asking for yard signs and signing up to help. About three times as many people as expected showed up to her Monday night fund-raiser, a group that included not only Democrats but some independents and Republicans as well.Ms. Londrigan is challenging Representative Rodney Davis, a three-term congressman who leads the centrist Republican caucus in the House. Mr. Davis is still the favorite in the district \u2014 he won it by 19 points in 2016 \u2014 but with the national landscape tilting against Republicans, even he is vulnerable.Of course, the confirmation hearing could also benefit Republicans. Traditionally, G.O.P. voters have been more motivated by Supreme Court politics, particularly the socially conservative wing of the party. If Mr. Kavanaugh doesn\u2019t get confirmed, it would certainly mobilize the right.But Democrats have never seen a fight quite like this, combining the kinetic energy of the #MeToo movement with a battle over the balance of the court.For candidates like Ms. Londrigan, running in a district held by Republicans for over a century, how well she translates that kind of national momentum into local action could make all the difference.____________________President Trump promised as a candidate to bring the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d back in style.But the latest round of his trade war with China could make him out to be a Scrooge.Mr. Trump, frustrated that negotiations are going nowhere, is moving ahead with tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China, taking effect on Sept. 24. That comes on top of the $50 billion of tariffs that have already been imposed. The president has promised to essentially tax all Chinese imports if China continues to retaliate.While the two governments do the tit-for-tat thing, American consumers are about to feel the pain in their wallets.And it looks like things will only get worse. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump accused China of meddling in the midterm elections by targeting its tariffs to hurt his supporters. He suggested that such a move would be met with fire and fury.\u201cThere will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.Happy holidays.____________________When was the last time you had a productive conversation about politics on Facebook?The group is a \u201ccommunity of open-minded women (and like-minded allies) looking for common ground in politics.\u201d People of all political perspectives are welcome.There will be daily discussion questions, often suggested by members, and a team of moderators will make sure that the conversation stays constructive and free from things like personal attacks and hate speech.Click here to read more, and to apply._____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "Suffering Knows No Bounds, Which Is Why Mets Fans Are Everywhere", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn BaseballMeet Les McCaughan, who became a casual Mets fan in 1985 and was hooked for good the following year when the team won the World Series. He stuck with the Mets through the many lean years that have followed. He stays up late to watch or listen to games. He has visited both Shea Stadium and Citi Field. He shares his love of the team with other fans on social media.McCaughan, 44, however, does not live in New York or anywhere near it. Instead, he is from and lives in Ballymoney, a small countryside town of over 10,000 people near the coast in Northern Ireland \u2014 and over 3,000 miles from the Mets\u2019 home in Flushing, Queens.\u201cYou heard of the Giant\u2019s Causeway, ya?\u201d McCaughan said in a telephone interview from across the Atlantic Ocean. \u201cI\u2019m about 10 miles from that.\u201dNor is McCaughan alone. Although the Mets have spent a good deal of their existence sandwiching spurts of success in between much disappointment, the team has somehow picked up faraway fans from Australia to the Philippines to the United Kingdom.There is Corn\u00e9 Hogeveen, 27, in Smilde, a town in the Netherlands, who stayed up until 5:30 a.m. to watch the Mets play in the 2016 National League wild-card game. (They lost.)There is Leif Granlind, 41, in Stockholm, who keeps tabs on Mets news on line and dedicates his weekends to watching games.And there is Jo Lenton, 37, in Cheltenham, England, who has seen more Mets games than those of her favorite soccer team, Newcastle United.\u201cI\u2019m crazy,\u201d she said, laughing, when asked how she became a fan of a baseball team on another continent.Fandom is a crazy phenomenon. The Mets have a sizable and expressive fan base that wears their team\u2019s maddening history like a badge of honor. And over the past two and a half years of covering the Mets, I noticed a few fans on Twitter from unexpected places. So I started a list and asked them: How did you become a Mets fan, and why?\u201cI see myself as a die-hard fan who happens to live somewhere else,\u201d Hogeveen wrote in a WhatsApp message. \u201cIt does feel unreal at times that I became a fan of a team that\u2019s so far away.\u201dTraditionally, baseball has its strongest roots in the United States, Latin America, the Caribbean and East Asia. But thanks in part to technology, it is not hard for people in other parts of the globe to become as fluent in the Mets as those who live in Queens.\u201cIt\u2019s so much easier now,\u201d Lenton said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to live there to be a fan.\u201dGrowing up in Northern Ireland, McCaughan was surrounded by soccer and rugby. But one day, he came across television highlights of the 1985 World Series between St. Louis and Kansas City. From there, sprang an interest in baseball, and then the Mets. And the next season, a famously talented and somewhat rowdy Mets club won the World Series. The deal was clinched.\u201cBeing a teenager at the time and being a bit rebellious, you sort of related to them,\u201d he said.McCaughan has sported a blue-and-orange Mets cap, which required an explanation to people in Northern Ireland, some of whom do recognize the more-familiar Yankee cap, in navy blue and white. McCaughan also read the few baseball books he could find at the local library and learned rules and strategy by playing video games. He listened to baseball games, and especially those played by the Mets, on Armed Forces Network radio.\u201cI remember running down to my mum and saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve got a baseball game here,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cShe probably thought I was nuts.\u201dFast forward to now: McCaughan pays for a MLB.TV subscription to watch Mets games. Because of the time difference, he usually watches the beginning of night games and catches the highlights the next morning. McCaughan, who works as a retail manager, normally watches the day games live.\u201cUp until five years ago, I was pretty much the only Mets fan I knew,\u201d he said.\u201cYour team chooses you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t choose your team.\u201dLenton, who works for an insurance company, fell in love with baseball through \u201cA League of Their Own,\u201d the 1992 movie about a women\u2019s professional baseball league that was created during World War II. She has attended eight Mets games in person and turned her partner, Natalie, into a Mets fan, too.\u201cWhen I don\u2019t see the game, I get the excitement of waking up the next morning to see the score,\u201d Lenton said. \u201cI always watch their highlights.\u201dHogeveen, who works at a medical center, started following the Mets when his uncle, who used to live near New York, took him to a game at Shea in 2006. He has been to other games since and if he cannot watch a game live on line, he avoids the final score until he can see a replay. Even this year.\u201cThe rough season, of course, is tough for every fan,\u201d Hogeveen said. \u201cEspecially with the expectations, it has been a difficult season.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a hobby for me,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the Mets, you never know. That\u2019s why the interest never dies. It\u2019s something new every year and every month.\u201dEven from afar.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Myanmar\u2019s Assault on a Truthful Press", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Myanmar\u2019s government defends the harsh sentence given to two courageous reporters who exposed mass murder, it breaks a fundamental promise of democracy: the rule of law based on facts. Mr. Adler, the president and editor in chief of Reuters, sits on the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists.Here are the facts:The Rohingya are a Muslim minority based in Rakhine State, in western Myanmar, a majority-Buddhist country. Last year, a military crackdown sent more than 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to refugee camps in Bangladesh. The United Nations has accused the Myanmar government of ethnic cleansing; Myanmar says its operations in Rakhine were in response to attacks on security forces by Rohingya insurgents.The shocking evidence they found was indisputable. This is the virtue of on-the-ground journalism practiced by reporters who speak the local language, follow strict rules of independence and objectivity, and know their beats. This type of reporting, which is at the heart of Reuters\u2019s work in the 166 countries where we operate, can provide proof of facts in ways that punditry or secondhand accounts simply cannot. Indeed, the Myanmar authorities were forced to admit that the massacre had occurred, even as they prosecuted our journalists for uncovering it.For eight months, with our reporters still behind bars, a court in Yangon heard what passed for a prosecution case. The arresting officer testified that he had burned his records. Another witness read notes he had scribbled on his hand so that he could, by his own admission, remember how to testify. Then came the unexpected, heroic moment when one police officer testified that a brigadier general had ordered an inferior officer to plant papers on Wa Lone and arrest him. Despite that testimony, the prosecution continued; the officer was himself arrested and sentenced to a year in prison.International observers have seen the farcical trial for what it was: an attempt to punish our journalists and dissuade other reporters from covering events in Rakhine State. Diplomats from many nations, including the United States, Britain, Canada, Norway and Australia, have spoken out against the lack of due process and the rule of law, and the stifling of a free press in a country that has been promised democracy. But so far, global outrage hasn\u2019t changed anything. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi claimed that the trial had nothing to do with press freedom and that the convictions were legitimate under the Official Secrets Act, a colonial-era law that bars the collection of secret documents to aid an enemy. The overwhelming evidence is , rather, that the police planted the documents in question on our journalists, whose only intent was to report truthfully.So, now what?With the world\u2019s nations preparing for the opening this week of the United Nations General Assembly, it is time to affirm not only the facts of this case but the value of facts themselves \u2014 to declare our certainty that some things are true and others are not. We must reject the cynical and dangerous idea that everyone is entitled to their own facts. We can see where this has gotten us in Myanmar and elsewhere. And we need to reaffirm the essential role of a free press in uncovering facts.Journalists, being people, are imperfect. But journalism, done right, serves a high public purpose. It produces transparency in markets, holds governments and businesses to account, gives people tools to make well-informed decisions, uncovers wrongdoing, inspires reforms, and tells true and remarkable stories that move and inspire. The United Nations must insist that the suppression of a free press contradicts the very nature of democracy and cannot be tolerated. And other multinational institutions, alongside governments, should make it forcefully clear to Myanmar\u2019s leaders that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo must be freed.Stephen J. Adler is the president and editor in chief of Reuters.Advertisement"}

Last year, the digital home-goods and renovation platform Houzz added 3-D capability to its View in My Room augmented reality tool in its iOS and Android apps, and Ikea debuted an iOS app called Ikea Place. (An Android version of Ikea Place became available this year.)Williams-Sonoma, the parent company of the Pottery Barn and West Elm brands, announced plans last year to buy Outward, a 3-D imaging and augmented reality software company, for $112 million.\u201cWe see augmented reality as a transformative tool in improving the customer experience because it\u2019s going to be able to help people better visualize,\u201d said Laura Alber, the chief executive of Williams-Sonoma.The company is testing a 3-D room planner that will let shoppers mix and match Pottery Barn and West Elm products, said Felix Carbullido, Williams-Sonoma\u2019s chief marketing officer. It is also working with Facebook on a number of augmented reality News Feed campaigns.In July, Facebook announced that it would start offering the ability to place augmented ads into News Feed. Accessories companies like Michael Kors and Warby Parker are already using the tool, which prompts users to open their camera so they can see how, say, a necklace or a pair of eyeglasses would look on them.\u201cThink about traditional marketing and how powerful sampling is,\u201d said Karin Tracy, Facebook\u2019s sales leader for the fashion and retail industries. \u201cNow we have this virtual sampling happening in the palm of your hand.\u201dThe online retail category that includes furniture, appliances and equipment grew by more than 20 percent on an annualized basis for eight of nine quarters through 2017, a pace that outstripped the overall increase in e-commerce, according to comScore.Ms. Tracy said furniture retailers\u2019 early adoption of 3-D imaging and \u201cview in room\u201d tools had created a customer base that was comfortable with this technology. \u201cTheir consumer is very used to engaging this way,\u201d she said.The advantage of putting the ads in Facebook feeds, Ms. Tracy said, is that it doesn\u2019t require users to download a retailer\u2019s app.\u201cNow we can find the right consumer in the right place at the right time,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead of waiting for a consumer to show up at your site, we can actually find consumers who are actively in the market for those kinds of products and create this purchase-intent experience right in News Feed.\u201dA big part of the task for companies using augmented reality is the proprietary process of creating 3-D visual representations \u2014 different from simply taking a photo \u2014 that can be scaled up or down to look proportionate when \u201cinstalled\u201d through a smartphone camera\u2019s viewfinder.People\u2019s tendency to shares photos on social media could give the technology broader exposure, said Joe Derochowski, a home industry analyst and the executive director of the NPD Group, a market research firm.\u201cIt can start to create conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is probably one of the bigger impact opportunities.\u201dFurniture retailers have known for some time that people are more comfortable buying a big-ticket or bulky item, like a dining set or a custom sectional, if they can virtually see it in their own space first, said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst and e-commerce expert at Forrester Research.Still, Ms. Kodali cautioned that this kind of salesmanship was still in its early days, adding that augmented reality is one of many data points that online shoppers consider before making a purchase.\u201cAs a best-case scenario, they are a supplement to other research a consumer does digitally,\u201d she said.Yet Jess Jacobs, marketing director for the online furniture store Wayfair, confirmed how the social effect can ripple outward. \u201cWhen we\u2019ve tested these models onto Facebook and other platforms, it gets a bunch of engagement,\u201d she said, because people tag their friends to show off or ask for opinions about a potential new look.Wayfair has had 3-D in-room imaging on its iOS app since last year and on the Android version since this spring, and Ms. Jacobs said the technology helped turn browsers into buyers.\u201cWe find that people who engage with our 3-D view-in-room technology in our app are more likely to add an item to their cart. Some of our best customers are the ones engaging with this feature,\u201d she said.\u201cThere are many products where customers might have a question like, \u2018How does this fit?\u2019 or \u2018How does this size of couch look?\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cIt allows us to answer that in a visual way.\u201dWayfair\u2019s new augmented reality campaign is to begin on Facebook later this year, and Ms. Jacobs said she expected the company\u2019s push into immersive augmented reality ads to help differentiate Wayfair from competitors.\u201cThat\u2019s going to stand apart from the fray compared to your average photograph,\u201d she said.Facebook\u2019s Ms. Tracy said, \u201cIt\u2019s comparison shopping made much, much easier.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Underneath I was wearing a thin tank top.\u201cCan I take this off, too?\u201d he said.I laughed. \u201cOf course!\u201dOff it went.He kissed my collarbone. I breathed into his neck and pulled off his shirt. He fingered the clasp of my bra.\u201cIs it O.K. if I take this off?\u201d he said.I think I snorted. \u201cWhen you asked about the sweater, that was my yes from the waist up.\u201dHe looked scared. Somewhere in our five-year age gap, a dramatic shift must have taken place in sexual training. I sensed this would be a different kind of hookup than I was used to, but I couldn\u2019t predict how.I lay down on my bed, and he lay beside me.\u201cIs this O.K.?\u201d he said.\u201cI invited a guy from Tinder to my empty apartment on a snow day,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s just assume you have blanket consent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with that.\u201dI looked at his earnest eyes, hair flopping into his face, stubble that was already reddening my skin (I had already decided I didn\u2019t mind). Hadn\u2019t I already said yes several times? Wasn\u2019t I lying there with him, my leg tossed over his, my whole body arcing toward him?Then he raised my arm above my head, put his lips to the soft skin of my inner arm, and licked me from armpit to elbow.I pulled my arm away.\u201cIs that O.K.?\u201d he said. \u201cAre you O.K.?\u201dI had been single and sexually active for more than a decade and considered myself to be sexually liberated, but I could not remember anyone having done that to me. \u201cIt\u2019s just really intimate,\u201d I said.Now he was the one who laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s intimate?\u201d he said.\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is.\u201dHe and I seemed to have such different understandings of which acts were assumed to be acceptable and which required voiced consent.At one point, he put his hand on my throat and asked if the pressure was O.K.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if I die,\u201d I joked.At the end of the night, he said, \u201cSee you soon,\u201d and took an Uber back to his apartment through the snow.Afterward I sat in bed, thinking about the encounter. I knew I had been a little dismissive of all of his asking, but in fact I had liked it as a form of caretaking. I just wasn\u2019t used to being taken care of in that way.Sex makes me feel unsafe, not because of the act itself but because my partners so often disappear afterward, whether I waited hours or months before the first time. So it\u2019s after sex when I feel truly vulnerable. Yet something else about his asking also made me uneasy. It seemed legalistic and self-protective, imported more from the courtroom than from a true sense of caretaking. And each time he asked, it was as if he assumed I lacked the agency to say no on my own \u2014 as if he expected me to say no, not believing that a woman would have the desire to keep saying yes.Still, I liked that he was trying to keep from hurting me unawares. He texted that night, reassuringly. I decided I would call his asking lovely. I decided I would try to learn.The second time he was in my bedroom, he paused with his hand at the zipper of my dress. \u201cIs this O.K.?\u201d he said.I looked him in the eye. I didn\u2019t laugh. I said, \u201cYes.\u201dHe was taken aback. \u201cI ask you that,\u201d he said.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the one who could make you do something you don\u2019t want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cNot vice versa.\u201dBut that wasn\u2019t what he was trying to do. He and I were enjoying a mutually desired sexual experience, and by making that distinction he was importing the language of coercion and assault into sex that was healthy.Given our wholly consensual interaction, did it matter who was stronger? Couldn\u2019t we treat each other as two equal human beings, each of whom had invited and agreed to intimate acts? Wasn\u2019t that the beautiful thing he was teaching me, that we could be fully human to each other, checking in, honoring yes and respecting no?My hand hovered above his belt. Finally he smiled and said yes, and the evening continued.If I could go back in time, I would have urged him in that moment to really think about why asking for consent even matters. Because the answer, I think, is basic: We want people we\u2019re intimate with to feel good, not bad.While he was waiting for his Uber to arrive, he said he would cook me dinner next time: steak with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a fig-balsamic reduction.\u201cI mostly make scrambled eggs,\u201d I said.He laughed, kissed me and said, \u201cSee you soon.\u201dI did not see him soon. I texted him a few times in the days that followed, playfully at first, then more pressing. He ignored me.At first I couldn\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t answer, and then I was devastated. My roommates didn\u2019t understand why I was so much more hurt than usual.\u201cBecause he kissed the soft part of my arm,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd then he disappeared.\u201dThey looked at me blankly. \u201cBecause he asked for my consent, over and over. So sex felt like a sacred act, and then he disappeared.\u201d\u201cA sacred act?\u201d one roommate said, laughing. \u201cGirl, you sure don\u2019t treat it like one.\u201dBut I do. We perform sacred acts for, with and among strangers all the time. We give charitably to people we don\u2019t know. We pray in churches with people we don\u2019t know. \u201cWhich is fine,\u201d my roommate said.And she was right, in a way. Asking about my feelings during sex didn\u2019t extend to caring about them after sex. Consent is not a contract of continuation.But in the days and weeks after, I was left thinking that our culture\u2019s current approach to consent is too narrow. A culture of consent should be a culture of care for the other person, of seeing and honoring another\u2019s humanity and finding ways to engage in sex while keeping our humanity intact. It should be a culture of making each other feel good, not bad.And if that\u2019s the goal, then consent doesn\u2019t work if we relegate it exclusively to the sexual realm. Our bodies are only one part of the complex constellation of who we are. To base our culture of consent on the body alone is to expect that caretaking involves only the physical.I wish we could view consent as something that\u2019s less about caution and more about care for the other person, the entire person, both during an encounter and after, when we\u2019re often at our most vulnerable. Because I don\u2019t think many of us would say yes to the question \u201cIs it O.K. if I act like I care about you and then disappear?\u201dAdvertisement"}

At least eight million Yemenis are at risk of starvation from an approaching famine caused not by crop failures but by our actions and those of our allies. The United Nations has called it the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis, and we own it.An American bomb made by Lockheed Martin struck a Yemen school bus last month, killing 51 people. Earlier, American bombs killed 155 mourners at a funeral and 97 people at a market.Many global security issues involve complex trade-offs, but this is different: Our behavior is just unconscionable.\u201cYemen\u2019s current crisis is man-made,\u201d said David Miliband, the former British foreign secretary and current president of the International Rescue Committee, who recently returned from Yemen. \u201cThis is not a case where humanitarian suffering is the price of winning a war. No one is winning, except the extremist groups who thrive on chaos.\u201d\u201cThe Trump administration has made itself complicit in systematic war crimes,\u201d said Kenneth Roth of Human Rights Watch.Let\u2019s be clear, too: This is a bipartisan moral catastrophe. The policy started under President Barack Obama, with safeguards, and then Trump doubled down and removed the safeguards.The carnage in Yemen hasn\u2019t stirred more outrage because the Saudis use their blockade to keep out journalists. I\u2019ve been trying for two years to go, but the Saudis bar aid groups from taking me on relief flights.Both sides in this civil war have at times behaved brutally, and the only way out is diplomacy. But Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince seems to prefer famine and a failed state in Yemen to compromise, and the more we provide him weapons the longer we extend the suffering. We should be using our influence to rein the Saudis in, not cheer them on.World leaders are gathered for the United Nations General Assembly, making pious statements about global goals for a better world, but the Assembly is infused with hypocrisy. Russia is up to its elbows in crimes against humanity in Syria, China is detaining perhaps one million Uighurs while also shielding Myanmar from accountability for probable genocide, and the United States and Britain are helping Saudi Arabia commit war crimes in Yemen.That\u2019s pathetic: Four of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are complicit in crimes against humanity.Many Americans erupt in fury every time Trump lies, or tweets some inexcusable comment.

{"Headline": "Who Gets a Second Chance?", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLouis C.K. decided it was time for his.Ms. Nancherla is a comedian.Stand-up comedy is inherently based on second chances. That\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from more than a decade of doing it.You try a joke again and again until it\u2019s presentable, but various audiences hear it in all its flawed and misbegotten amoeba-like early attempts.I guess we, the public, are to assume he has been listening since then? As if the #MeToo movement is just one long podcast with the occasional Squarespace ad? And \u201ca long time\u201d is now less than one calendar year?A week ago, Louis C. K. did an unannounced set in New York at the Comedy Cellar. He did not address the allegations against him, but rather, people said, made observations on racism and waitresses\u2019 tips, and, brazenly enough, a joke about rape whistles. Apparently, he\u2019s moved on.For Louis C. K. not to address his fall from grace feels like the equivalent of someone who has been listening only to wait for the rest of us to stop talking, so he can talk again.He is someone who built his brand on being the flawed Everyman (perverted warts and all), and he\u2019d primed his die-hard fans perfectly for a fall from grace and quiet comeback. It was the all-new season of his public life.Before I stopped reading replies to my tweet, four garden-variety Horsedudes of the Bropocalypse had galloped on through with responses of this variety:Apology: \u201cWhat he did wasn\u2019t even that bad.\u201dVictim-Blaming: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just leave the room?\u201d (Subtext: maybe these women should leave the planet.)Hate: \u201cIf those women were actually funny, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to get attention this way.\u201dSelf-Loathing (via Fellow Women): \u201cIf you can\u2019t stand the culture, get out of the yogurt!\u201dAnd I saw this question pop up like a particularly pernicious specimen, not just in my personal Whack-a-Troll game but all over the internet: Doesn\u2019t he deserve a second chance? Is he just supposed to disappear?The term \u201cI am only human\u201d implies we\u2019re fallible. The very concept of humanity is based on second chances.It\u2019s that concept of humanity that makes comedy \u2014 telling jokes in person to people night after night \u2014 work. The people in the audience know they might see you fall on your face. It\u2019s part of the process. But they want you to win. Because if you win, they win. They laugh. The tension is released.The world of stand-up fiercely guards the status quo, which is ironic for an art form that prides itself on \u201ctelling it like it is.\u201d It\u2019s why a Netflix special like Hannah Gadsby\u2019s \u201cNanette\u201d was criticized by straight male colleagues of mine for \u201cnot being stand-up\u201d because it wasn\u2019t all easily digestible setups and punch lines. It was an hour investigating and questioning what stand-up comedy is and how the power structures underlying it work.In that sense, the #MeToo movement has demonstrated that, as a money-driven society, we have been asleep to the continued marketing and monetization of known abusers for years.What about the victims\u2019 second chances? To argue that their talent must not match that of Louis C. K. or they would have gotten farther at this point in their careers, is missing the point. His actions affected their careers.To think the entertainment industry is fair or just or chiefly merit-based is assuming it operates by different rules from the rest of world. The burden placed on victims will always far outweigh those placed on predators. Yes, there is probably no measure by which he can undo the pain he has caused these women, but he can try.In an entertainment career, timing is everything. In a public relations move, timing is everything. In stand-up comedy, timing is everything.As a woman in stand-up comedy, I often spend more time addressing what it\u2019s like to be a woman or defending why disturbing behavior is upsetting than just getting a seat at the table. The general way through discomfort for comedians is most often a joke. It\u2019s used as a gateway into more taboo topics, or an escape route out of an awkward situation \u2014 whether that is a drink spilling or an overly chatty table of audience members, any potential competing force for the crowd\u2019s attention must be addressed.Perhaps that\u2019s why it felt so glaring that Louis C. K. chose not to mention his public exile or the reasons behind it in his return to the stage. His choice to completely avoid it spoke louder than any heckler saying as much would have.The way to take a comedian\u2019s power away is not to laugh. But as women from time immemorial in both social situations and audiences can attest, it\u2019s usually easier to laugh something off than to be singled out as humorless or a buzzkill.Imagine trying to voice your dissent when it\u2019s your entire career on the line. The women who came forward as victims of Louis C. K. had nothing to gain except to be bullied, ridiculed and insulted. Do they get a second chance?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Takeover of Shazam Is Cleared by European Regulators", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 European authorities on Thursday cleared Apple\u2019s acquisition of the popular song-recognition app Shazam, after months of study into whether the deal would give the iPhone maker an unfair advantage over rival streaming music services like Spotify.Apple said in December that it had agreed to buy Shazam, prompting European regulators to scrutinize the proposed takeover as part of a broader effort to examine the value of data when evaluating mergers.In the case of Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam, regulators questioned whether the app held important information on Apple competitors. The focus on data transfer is a departure from typical antitrust enforcement, which tends to zero in on how a deal may affect customers in terms of a product\u2019s cost.The Apple deal, Ms. Vestager said, would not impede competition.The case was a rare instance in which European antitrust authorities have passed on an opportunity to act against an American technology giant. The region has gained a reputation as the world\u2019s strictest overseer of the technology industry.When starting their investigation of the Apple-Shazam deal in February, regulators said they were concerned that Apple would block Shazam from referring customers to rival services, or that it would use the app to poach customers.On Thursday, the European Commission said that after a six-month review, it had concluded that the app did not give Apple an unfair advantage that merited government intervention.\u201cAccess to Shazam\u2019s data would not materially increase Apple\u2019s ability to target music enthusiasts and any conduct aimed at making customers switch would only have a negligible impact,\u201d the commission said in a statement.Spotify, a major rival to Apple\u2019s own music-streaming service, declined to comment.Shazam was an early hit in Apple\u2019s App Store thanks to its novel ability to quickly identify a track after using a smartphone\u2019s microphone to \u201clisten\u201d for only a few seconds. The two companies established closer ties in 2014, when Shazam was integrated into Apple\u2019s voice-powered digital assistant Siri, allowing users to ask, \u201cHey Siri, what song is playing?\u201dThe app mainly makes money by selling advertisements and collecting fees when it refers users to a music service like Apple and Spotify. Shazam is also a valuable source of data, giving music companies insight into what songs and artists are performing well, and in which regions.Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam has been seen as a possible test case for Ms. Vestager, who has said antitrust enforcement must evolve to consider the value of data.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers effectively pay with their data, and that they are not always getting a fair deal.Broadening the interpretation of antitrust law would have consequences for future acquisitions. But whether such an argument would hold up in a courtroom has not yet been well established, making it harder for authorities to step in.Working in Apple\u2019s favor was the fact the European Commission had previously approved acquisitions between several data-rich companies, including Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of LinkedIn.Advertisement"}

The fliers promoted parties organized by local party crews. For Ms. Rosales\u2019s initiation into hers, a friend picked her up in a van and they rode with about 13 kids to a party \u2014 it was the first of probably 10 they went to that night. They sat on the floor of the van, as it had no seats, and shouted their moniker, \u201cAztek Nation,\u201d along the way.The site soon had so many followers that its content \u2014 largely by and about women \u2014 became almost entirely crowdsourced. Ms. Rosales had found that male-centric narratives about Latino culture were coarser, less well-balanced and intent on exuding a certain toughness. The platform\u2019s age-faded images show ladies standing in front of low rider cars, or in choreographed poses with their friends, sporting their favorite Jordana lip liner or oversized 501 jeans.Boyle Heights was indeed her entire world. At 20, Ms. Rosales had never traveled outside of Los Angeles. Then she bought a one-way ticket to New York City and spent more than a decade there dabbling with the idea of becoming an artist. She began Veteranas and Rucas while attending art school in Chicago, at a time when she felt she was neglecting a huge part of her life \u2014 her home in Los Angeles. Gentrification had changed her neighborhood while she was away. As an artist returning to East Los Angeles, she was in the crosshairs of an anti-gentrification campaign that singled out art galleries as unwelcome interlopers.At the outset of this project, Ms. Rosales visited U.C.L.A.\u2019s Chicano Studies Research Center, toting the resource material she had at the time: a few issues of Street Beat, a magazine she described as \u201cTeen Vogue, but for Latinos.\u201d She couldn\u2019t find much relating to her experience growing up. It may seem as if there is nothing particularly damaging about this \u2014 parts of all of our childhoods have been lost, scrubbed, forgotten. But Ms. Rosales\u2019s had been all but erased.At the time, she was deeply involved in investigating her cousin\u2019s gruesome, gang-related murder: He had been stabbed repeatedly at a party, then dragged out and left for dead in a local playground. Her sister saw the whole thing.His death traumatized them both, and contributed to Ms. Rosales\u2019s decision to relocate to New York. Researching his murder years later provided the impetus to reconnect with the culture and the home that she\u2019d left.Eventually, she unearthed his death certificate.\u201cAt that time, I truly felt how physical material is so important,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s actually what pushed me to start the archive. I wanted people to start looking at their images and materials differently, to value their collections \u2014 that material tells a story.\u201dMs. Rosales also realized how much strangers\u2019 materials could feel almost as familiar to people as their own. A digital repository like Instagram lends tremendous weight to a project like hers, encouraging cross-community sharing in which one person\u2019s memory can act as a stand-in for another\u2019s.That\u2019s the thing about L.A. back then: Yes, there were gangs, but the party scene was just as important to its youth. And Ms. Rosales doesn\u2019t shy away from sharing memorabilia of both. If she was ever torn about depicting gang life \u2014 people have accused her of glorifying \u201ccholas\u201d and \u201cgangsters\u201d \u2014 she thinks to herself: \u201cDoes that mean I have to censor my life story?\u201dStories about gang culture in Los Angeles have been told and studied over so many years that it\u2019s hard to fault people for assuming that only bad things came from its Latino enclaves. \u201cThe archive is not just photographs,\u201d Ms. Rosales has said, \u201cit\u2019s archiving language and the way we relate to a photograph.\u201d She felt other narratives demonized not only gang activity, but also those living among it. And the shame radiates from the inside out. People were hesitant to share material with Ms. Rosales that could betray an association with gangs. Especially considering that for a while, the party scene was somewhat insulated from much gang activity.But by the late \u201990s, gangs had bullied their way in.\u201cI had a party at my house,\u201d she remembered. \u201cThis gang showed up and they said, \u2018Well, this is my neighborhood, I can do whatever I want. So if you guys don\u2019t let us in we\u2019re just going to steal your sound system.\u2019\u201dThe archive was featured in Aperture #232 \u201cLos Angeles\u201d Fall 2018.Advertisement"}

They point to its embrace of nationalist and populist positions and a push by several prominent members to abandon Germany\u2019s culture of remembrance and atonement for its Nazi past.A spokesman for Alternative for Germany said Wednesday that an initial meeting of the new Jewish group might convene on Oct. 7. That would be just weeks before elections are held in Bavaria and Hesse, states where the party is hoping to break into the regional legislatures.Mr. Schulz is seeking a seat in Hesse, where the party hopes to make inroads in one of the traditional strongholds of Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats party. Together with Wolfgang Fuhl, a Jewish party member from the southwestern state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, he is hoping to attract 20 founding members to the group.Like a majority of the nearly 100,000 Jews who make up the German Jewish community, Mr. Schulz was born in the former Soviet Union. He moved to Germany as a child.Mr. Schulz called into question the German government\u2019s pledge to uphold Israel\u2019s right to exist and described the AfD as the only party in Germany that still believes in traditional family values.On his Facebook page, Mr. Schulz argues for fighting anti-Semitism in sports, and circulates reports of local Jewish clubs reporting an increase anti-Semitic remarks and attacks, especially from recently arrived Muslims seeking asylum in Germany.The head of Germany\u2019s Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, has said that the AfD has been actively seeking to recruit Russian-speaking Jews. Member of the council fear that their warnings about the dangers of far-right populism are having little effect.\u201cUnfortunately, I have the impression that the AfD\u2019s simple answers are attractive to some people from the former Soviet Union, including Jews,\u201d Mr. Schuster told The J\u00fcdische Allgemeine, a German-language Jewish newspaper.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Asian-American Age", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt the movies and in court, a rising minority claims the spotlight.Opinion ColumnistThe convergence illustrates an underrated reality about Trump-era America. Our polarizing immigration debate revolves around the Wall and the border because we\u2019ve just experienced a long wave of immigration from our southern neighbors. But that surge is diminishing, and for almost a decade the United States has taken more Asian than Hispanic immigration. So after the Trumpian moment passes, our ethno-political fights will be gradually reshaped by how Asians relate to American culture, how American politics relates to them, and how they (because \"Asian\" contains multitudes) relate to one another. In my lifetime there have been two stories about where Asian-Americans fit in our domestic coalitions. In the Reagan \u201980s they were seen as the most Republican-friendly immigrant group \u2014 more educated and prosperous than other immigrants, often anti-Communist (in the case of the Vietnamese and Taiwanese especially), bearing Confucian or Christian values that aligned with a traditional-values G.O.P.This, in turn, led to a new story that cast Asian-Americans as a natural constituency in an emerging Democratic majority \u2014 one tributary among many in the multicultural river washing white hegemony away.This idea informs a lot of liberal arguments about the Harvard lawsuit, which tend to portray conservative critics of affirmative action as tempters invading the multicultural Eden, and urge Asian-Americans to maintain their model-minority purity and resist the lure of mere meritocratic self-interest.For liberals these are the Bad Asians, putting their tribal resentments ahead of the racial-progressive cause. Which makes it striking that they are also the demographic being celebrated in \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d a movie that begins with a sequence in which Chinese-expat gossip spreads from New York to Singapore via, you guessed it, WeChat.The only certain takeaway from this complexity is that the new liberal model-minority image, like the old conservative one, is likely to break down with increasing Asian numbers, influence, diversity and power. Where strong Asian support for affirmative action endures in this new landscape, it will probably be as part of a more consciously ideological progressivism \u2014 one adopted by some second-generation Asian-Americans, as Reihan Salam suggested recently in The Atlantic, as a distinctive means of assimilation to the American cultural elite.Where Asian support for racial progressivism breaks down, meanwhile, there are two possibilities. There could be a real swing back rightward among some Asian voters \u2014 a possibility that the Trump White House obviously entertains, but which can only happen if the Republican Party finds a way to lose its Trumpian aura of white identity politics and bigotry. Perhaps more plausibly, Asian-Americans who reject affirmative action could begin to form their own centrist bloc within the Democratic Party, one that pulls the party back toward a kind of 1990s-style Clintonism, in the opposite direction from Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Or both things could happen, within different parts of the Asian-American community \u2014 with Chinese-Americans tilting more Republican and Indian-Americans staying firmly on the center-left.But no matter what, this week\u2019s multiplex-courthouse convergence isn\u2019t an anomaly. It\u2019s a hint of both Asian-American influence and Asian-American divisions yet to come.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kavanaugh Hearings Are Over. Now What?", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats did the best they could. Pressuring red-state senators to vote no will backfire.Contributing Opinion WriterSo the Kavanaugh hearings are over. How did the Democrats do?They accomplished the latter about as well as could be expected. They raised salient objections from the moment of the opening gavel. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal\u2019s repeated requests for a vote to delay the proceedings were a bold intervention. The Democrats let America know that thousands of documents pertaining to Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s White House years had been withheld from them or dumped on them at the last minute. Tough questioning from a range of Democratic senators showed the country a nominee whose responses on topics from abortion rights to executive power were relentlessly evasive.And yet, unless lightning strikes, Mr. Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the court sometime in the next few weeks and will take his seat before the court\u2019s next session starts in October.Attention will turn now to that upcoming confirmation vote. The strongest focus of Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s opponents will be on Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, in the probably vain hope that these two supporters of Roe v. Wade can be pressured to vote against the nominee. Both have signaled that that is unlikely.Next, activists\u2019 attentions will turn to the Democrats who might end up voting to confirm Mr. Kavanaugh. These include most notably a handful of incumbents who are up for re-election in states Donald Trump carried: Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Joe Manchin in West Virginia, Claire McCaskill in Missouri, Jon Tester in Montana and possibly Bill Nelson in Florida.There are other red-state Democratic senators seeking re-election this fall \u2014 Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Debbie Stabenow in Michigan, for example. But for reasons peculiar to them, their races and their states, they\u2019re generally considered to be able to cast safe \u201cno\u201d votes.So liberal activists and groups are presumably going to spend time and precious money this month lobbying the above senators to vote no. I say to them: Don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a waste of said time and money, for two reasons.First of all, if Ms. Murkowski and Ms. Collins vote \u201caye,\u201d Mr. Kavanaugh has his 51 votes. It\u2019s over. It doesn\u2019t matter at that point if he has 51 votes or 56.You have to look at the situations these people find themselves in, consider their re-election prospects \u2014 and consider the alternative. Take Mr. Manchin, whose circumstance is the one I know best.But if Mr. Manchin were to cast a (numerically meaningless!) vote against Mr. Kavanaugh \u2014 presto. The rest of the race would be about that, and nothing but that. Millions of dark money dollars would pour in for TV ads blasting Mr. Manchin for going against the wishes of their president.But here\u2019s the second and more important reason to give the red-state Democrats a pass here. This battle wasn\u2019t lost last week, and it sure won\u2019t be lost by these red-state Democrats if they vote to confirm. It was lost in 2016.It was lost by the Democratic Party, the Hillary Clinton campaign, and the courts-oriented grass roots and public-interest groups that didn\u2019t do nearly enough to explain to the Democratic rank and file in 2016 that a Clinton victory would mean a liberal court majority for the first time in 30 years.I kept waiting and waiting that fall for Ms. Clinton to emphasize this point, or for other prominent figures to say, \u201cLook. You\u2019re not wild about Hillary Clinton? Fine. Are you wild about Roe v. Wade, same-sex marriage, protections for immigrant children, campaign finance contribution limits? Then you\u2019d damn well better vote.\u201dIt never happened. So that\u2019s on them. But honestly, regular voters should have been mature enough to have figured this out on their own. They\u2019re to blame, too.If you live in Wisconsin and thought it would be neat to vote for pot-friendly Gary Johnson, then Brett Kavanaugh is partly your fault. If you are a Michigander who thought you were sticking it to the man by voting for Putin buddy Jill Stein, Brett Kavanaugh is partly your fault, too.So now, Roe will be struck down; corporations will remain people for the foreseeable future; the Trump administration can attempt any immigration restriction it wants, confident the Court will have its back; all remaining limits on campaign contributions may die; and, not least, a solid court majority will presumably rule in favor of Mr. Trump on executive power questions.Say what you will about religious conservatives who voted en masse for a moral reprobate for president. They grasped the stakes. Liberals did not. Progressive donors and pressure groups, rather than wasting money these next few weeks, had better direct it toward making sure the same mistake isn\u2019t made in 2020.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why We Need an F.B.I. Investigation", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA hearing without evidence would be little more than theater.Ms. Gertner is a retired federal judge.In other words, we gave her a hearing, now we\u2019re ready to vote. With no other witnesses or evidence, we\u2019ll end up with a high-status, high-profile male judge squaring off against an unknown female research psychologist from Northern California. This \u201che said, she said\u201d standoff is unlikely to change any minds and might merely reinforce the preconceptions of the senators who will vote on Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the United States Supreme Court. And we know how that is likely to turn out. The investigation begins with an application that could not be more intrusive. You\u2019re asked to list the name of everyone you ever lived with, every address you ever inhabited, every detail of your finances. Did you ever experiment with illegal drugs and, if so, which and when? If you had, your nomination might be nixed, depending on the drug. It didn\u2019t matter if you had \u201cexperimented\u201d in college and were now in your 50s. It didn\u2019t matter if you had led an otherwise exemplary life in the intervening 30 years. But that\u2019s simply not the case. Yes, the F.B.I. did look into Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s background before this accusation was made, though we don\u2019t know whether behavior of this sort was explored. But now, this new information bears examining by the agency, just as Ms. Hill\u2019s complaints of sexual harassment did.Witnesses in a court proceeding rarely just \u201cappear\u201d without exchanging documents in discovery, without depositions or private investigations. The only setting that comes to mind in which this is not the rule is Judge Judy\u2019s TV \u201ccourtroom.\u201d Indeed, an F.B.I. investigation could be especially important for Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s supporters on the committee. They are obliged to challenge Dr. Blasey\u2019s credibility. To do so without facts, with only the usual tropes about what women do or don\u2019t do, comes with extraordinary political risks.What would such an investigation entail? The F.B.I. could investigate the facts surrounding the accusation itself. And there are facts. Was there a party? Where? Who was there? What do the attendees recall about that night? Did anyone see or hear anything that bears on the accusation? Did Dr. Blasey tell anyone what happened in the hours or days afterward? Did Judge Kavanaugh? The F.B.I.\u2019s goal would be to corroborate what can be corroborated and refute what can be refuted. What about the timing of Dr. Blasey\u2019s accusations? Was this a recent contrivance? Is she is now misremembering? The #MeToo movement has made clear why some women did not come forward about sexual assault. Women\u2019s accusations were dismissed; the culture legitimized a \u201cboys will be boys\u201d atmosphere. There seemed to be nowhere to turn, whether it was the police or school officials.Judge Kavanaugh has denied the accusation, vehemently. And it is significant that no other accusers have stepped forward. Many of the #MeToo accusations have involved \u201che said, she said, she said, she said.\u201d In this case, dozens of women apparently have vouched for his character. The F.B.I. should interview them. For instance, they might ask whether he ever talked about his sexual exploits to peers at the time? What else can the F.B.I. find out about the judge that bears on his credibility? Democrats have claimed he misrepresented his work while he was in the George W. Bush White House in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. Or, significantly, what other information did earlier background checks turn up about the judge that the F.B.I. did not pursue? An appointment to the Supreme Court is not an entitlement. The background investigation I underwent for a District Court judgeship was probing. Shouldn\u2019t the inquiry for a potential Supreme Court justice be more so? After all, this a position of life tenure that demands moral leadership as the court shapes American law for what is likely to be decades to come. It is in everyone\u2019s interest that this nomination not proceed under a cloud.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Are the Biggest Problems Facing Us in the 21st Century?", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.The human mind wants to worry. This is not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 after all, if a bear is stalking you, worrying about it may well save your life. Although most of us don\u2019t need to lose too much sleep over bears these days, modern life does present plenty of other reasons for concern: terrorism, climate change, the rise of A.I., encroachments on our privacy, even the apparent decline of international cooperation.In his fascinating new book, \u201c21 Lessons for the 21st Century,\u201d the historian Yuval Noah Harari creates a useful framework for confronting these fears. While his previous best sellers, \u201cSapiens\u201d and \u201cHomo Deus,\u201d covered the past and future respectively, his new book is all about the present. The trick for putting an end to our anxieties, he suggests, is not to stop worrying. It\u2019s to know which things to worry about, and how much to worry about them. As he writes in his introduction: \u201cWhat are today\u2019s greatest challenges and most important changes? What should we pay attention to? What should we teach our kids?\u201dThese are admittedly big questions, and this is a sweeping book. There are chapters on work, war, nationalism, religion, immigration, education and 15 other weighty matters. But its title is a misnomer. Although you will find a few concrete lessons scattered throughout, Harari mostly resists handy prescriptions. He\u2019s more interested in defining the terms of the discussion and giving you historical and philosophical perspective.He deploys, for example, a clever thought experiment to underscore how far humans have come in creating a global civilization. Imagine, he says, trying to organize an Olympic Games in 1016. It\u2019s clearly impossible. Asians, Africans and Europeans don\u2019t know that the Americas exist. The Chinese Song Empire doesn\u2019t think any other political entity in the world is even close to being its equal. No one even has a flag to fly or anthem to play at the awards ceremony.The point is that today\u2019s competition among nations \u2014 whether on an athletic field or the trading floor \u2014 \u201cactually represents an astonishing global agreement.\u201d And that global agreement makes it easier to cooperate as well as compete. Keep this in mind the next time you start to doubt whether we can solve a global problem like climate change. Our global cooperation may have taken a couple of steps back in the past two years, but before that we took a thousand steps forward.So why does it seem as if the world is in decline? Largely because we are much less willing to tolerate misfortune and misery. Even though the amount of violence in the world has greatly decreased, we focus on the number of people who die each year in wars because our outrage at injustice has grown. As it should.Here\u2019s another worry that Harari deals with: In an increasingly complex world, how can any of us have enough information to make educated decisions? It\u2019s tempting to turn to experts, but how do you know they\u2019re not just following the herd? \u201cThe problem of groupthink and individual ignorance besets not just ordinary voters and customers,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut also presidents and C.E.O.s.\u201d That rang true to me from my experience at both Microsoft and the Gates Foundation. I have to be careful not to fool myself into thinking things are better \u2014 or worse \u2014 than they actually are.As much as I admire Harari and enjoyed \u201c21 Lessons,\u201d I didn\u2019t agree with everything in the book. I was glad to see the chapter on inequality, but I\u2019m skeptical about his prediction that in the 21st century \u201cdata will eclipse both land and machinery as the most important asset\u201d separating rich people from everyone else. Land will always be hugely important, especially as the global population nears 10 billion. Meanwhile, data on key human endeavors \u2014 how to grow food or produce energy, for example \u2014 will become even more widely available. Simply having information won\u2019t offer a competitive edge; knowing what to do with it will.Similarly, I wanted to see more nuance in Harari\u2019s discussion of data and privacy. He rightly notes that more information is being gathered on individuals than ever before. But he doesn\u2019t distinguish among the types of data being collected \u2014 the kind of shoes you like to buy versus which diseases you\u2019re genetically predisposed to \u2014 or who is gathering it, or how they\u2019re using it. Your shopping history and your medical history aren\u2019t collected by the same people, protected by the same safeguards or used for the same purposes. Recognizing this distinction would have made his discussion more enlightening.I was also dissatisfied with the chapter on community. Harari argues that social media including Facebook have contributed to political polarization by allowing users to cocoon themselves, interacting only with those who share their views. It\u2019s a fair point, but he undersells the benefits of connecting family and friends around the world. He also creates a straw man by asking whether Facebook alone can solve the problem of polarization. On its own, of course it can\u2019t \u2014 but that\u2019s not surprising, considering how deep the problem cuts. Governments, civil society and the private sector all have a role to play, and I wish Harari had said more about them.But Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. All three of his books wrestle with some version of the same question: What will give our lives meaning in the decades and centuries ahead? So far, human history has been driven by a desire to live longer, healthier, happier lives. If science is eventually able to give that dream to most people, and large numbers of people no longer need to work in order to feed and clothe everyone, what reason will we have to get up in the morning?It\u2019s no criticism to say that Harari hasn\u2019t produced a satisfying answer yet. Neither has anyone else. So I hope he turns more fully to this question in the future. In the meantime, he has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century.Bill Gates is the co-founder of Microsoft and co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Advertisement"}

Then Teachers Got Angry.", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "Red shirts and blouses had emerged as the official uniform of teacher uprisings against low pay that were spreading from West Virginia to Oklahoma and Kentucky under the rallying cry \u201cRed for Ed.\u201d Just one week earlier, a Facebook post by Noah Karvelis, a 23-year-old teacher in Phoenix, lit the spark in Arizona, asking teachers to wear red on March 7 to demand more money for the state\u2019s chronically underfunded public schools. Within days, 6,000 people clicked that they were on board. Berg, a high school math teacher for 23 years with a master\u2019s degree who was taking home $1,620 a month, was one of them. On the designated day, a Wednesday, thousands of Arizona teachers turned campuses red from the New Mexico line to California. Karvelis and other young teachers then took it upon themselves to keep the activism going, declaring every Wednesday Red for Ed day \u2014 but Berg decided to wear it daily. \u201cI wanted people to come up and say: \u2018Kelly, today isn\u2019t Wednesday. Why are you wearing red?\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so I could tell them, This is how important it is. We need to make our voices heard.\u201dIn the past, the idea of participating in anything that resembled a political movement had repelled Berg. \u201cI would say, \u2018Don\u2019t talk to me about politics,\u2019\u2009\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2009\u2018I think it\u2019s a waste of time.\u2019\u2009\u201d A 46-year-old lifelong Republican, she called herself a \u201csleepy voter,\u201d as if she sleepwalked through the voting booth every four years. \u201cI was just voting for the person with an R by their name or not voting.\u201dThis was true even though the Legislature and governor \u2014 unified under Republican control since 2009 \u2014 cut education spending more than any other state in the wake of the Great Recession. Berg suffered doubly because her husband, a web developer, lost his state job, and now the entire family of six \u2014 they have four sons, ages 7 to 13 \u2014 was on her health plan, with the premiums cutting her previous take-home pay almost in half. She was working three extra jobs to keep the family afloat, arriving home most nights barely in time to check her kids\u2019 homework and kiss them good night. Across the state, teachers were taking in roommates, working second and third jobs and leaving the profession in such waves that substitutes without standard certifications were leading more than 3,400 classrooms statewide. Two thousand more couldn\u2019t be staffed at all.In December 2016, the day before Christmas break, Berg heard that her son Mark\u2019s sixth-grade teacher had quit to take a private-sector job for more money, and suddenly she felt that she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She needed to understand why Arizona\u2019s schools were so poorly funded and who was responsible. She turned for help to her best friend, Tiffany Bunstein, who followed state politics closely and, like Berg, had been teaching for more than 20 years at Dobson High School in Mesa, a sprawling, demographically diverse suburb east of Phoenix. \u201cI went to Tiffany and said, \u2018I want to know what you know,\u2019\u2009\u201d Berg said.It was on this Facebook page that Berg learned of the March 14 hearing in the House Ways and Means Committee on a bill related to Arizona\u2019s tuition tax credit program, which awards dollar-for-dollar state tax credits to individuals and corporations for donations for private school scholarships. In the previous school year, donors had given more than $157 million, and over the last 20 years $1 billion, avoiding the same amount in taxes \u2014 money that never reached the state general fund or public schools. The bill would increase the size of individual scholarships, at a predicted annual cost of $2 million in 2020, a pittance in a more than $10 billion overall state budget. But for Berg and many other teachers emboldened by the March 7 show of solidarity, that was $2 million too much. \u201cOnce again we\u2019re undercutting public education, and it needs to stop,\u201d she recalled thinking. It was spring break, and teachers urged one another on Facebook to attend the hearing.Berg drove downtown, her heart pounding. \u201cThis is totally so uncharacteristic of anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she kept telling herself. Arriving at the Capitol, she found hundreds of other teachers, all wearing red, and was surprised by how comfortable she felt. Before she could stop herself, she volunteered to testify about the bill. She stood at the microphone with rows of red-shirted teachers behind her and read from notes, her head down, nervously smoothing her brown hair and adjusting her glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about politics, but I do know about math,\u201d she began, introducing a lesson on how teachers\u2019 salaries had stagnated. Other teachers told stories of financial crises in their schools, pleading for every available dollar to go to public, not private, education. When one teacher\u2019s voice broke as she described a colleague covering two kindergarten classes at once because of a shortage of substitutes, the others applauded in encouragement. When a Democratic lawmaker called the private scholarships inequitable \u2014 exceeding the state\u2019s spending per public school student by $9,000 in some cases \u2014 the teachers stood up in silent assent. The committee chairwoman, Michelle Ugenti-Rita, instructed them to sit. \u201cAnd when they sit, you can answer,\u201d she said to the bill\u2019s sponsor, the Senate president Steve Yarbrough, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to all show each other respect.\u201d Despite the entreaties of the teachers, the bill passed the committee on a party-line vote \u2014 six Republicans to three Democrats.Berg went home, signed onto the Facebook page, which by now had tens of thousands of followers, and poured out her rage. \u201cWe were told to sit down when we stood in agreement. ... We were told to remain quiet when applauding when a teacher, who was in tears, was pleading for support for our classes and our students,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe were disrespected. We were mocked. We were listened to, but not heard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what radicalized me,\u201d Berg said later. \u201cAs the kids would say, \u2018I\u2019m woke.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Great Recession devastated education funding in every region of the country. With tax revenues plummeting, legislators and governors desperate to slash spending turned inexorably to public schools. Anticipating sweeping teacher layoffs, the Obama administration in 2009 sent states a federal stimulus package of $100 billion specifically for education, but the recession outlasted it. In half the states, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, teacher pay adjusted for inflation was lower in 2016 than in 2000.Few states were hit as hard as Arizona, where the sun, low taxes and wide-open spaces had drawn transplants from around the country, fueling an economy heavily based on real estate development. All that came to a painful halt when the housing bubble burst in 2008. State revenue had grown so feverishly in the years before the crash that in 2006, Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, and the Republican Legislature were able to cut income taxes 10 percent even as they significantly increased education spending, including an expansion of kindergarten from half a day to a full day statewide.The recession, coupled with the tax cuts, wiped out billions of dollars in state revenues. Napolitano left to join the Obama administration as secretary of homeland security in January 2009, and her Republican successor, Jan Brewer, and the Republican Legislature cut funds that districts relied on to pay teachers, maintain buildings, update curriculum and technology and much more. Salaries were frozen, funding for all-day kindergarten was eliminated and class sizes climbed year by year as teachers left for higher-paying jobs and principals were forced to combine orphaned classes. By last year, Shannon Connors, a sixth-grade teacher at a high-poverty, 98 percent Latino school in Phoenix, ended up teaching two classes at once \u2014 50 students \u2014 when a succession of long-term substitutes failed to teach one of the classes effectively.Similar situations had unfolded in every state where teachers walked off the job last spring. A 2017 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona \u2014 scenes of the largest teacher walkouts \u2014 were among the six states that cut the most aid to local school districts in the last decade. All are solidly Republican and have embraced small government and income-tax cuts. They are also right-to-work states where union membership is optional and unions are weak. Fewer than half of Arizona teachers belong to the union.In Arizona, state funding per pupil has been below the national average since 1975, falling particularly after the mid-1990s, when lawmakers embarked on an almost unbroken streak of annual cuts in personal and corporate income taxes. Tom Rex, an Arizona State University researcher, calculated that if not for the cumulative effect of those tax cuts, the state general fund in 2016 would have totaled $13.6 billion instead of $9.5 billion, or more than 40 percent higher. Even in the depths of the recession, Brewer and the Legislature cut corporate income taxes 30 percent \u2014 roughly $550 million a year \u2014 in hopes of stimulating the economy, but without success. Voters approved a temporary 1-cent sales-tax hike in a 2010 referendum, with proceeds designated primarily for education, then decisively voted down a permanent extension in 2012.The leader of the 2012 opposition to the sales tax was Doug Ducey, now the governor of Arizona, who was then the state treasurer. A former C.E.O. of Cold Stone Creamery and a Republican, he championed small government and free-market solutions to education like charter schools and Arizona\u2019s version of private school vouchers. Attacking public school districts as wasteful bureaucracies, he argued that more money would solve nothing. \u201cWe need to spend those dollars more effectively,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to raise taxes on hard-working citizens.\u201dCutting taxes and privatizing schools had long been popular in Arizona, but there were signs that the worsening teacher shortage was changing that. Beginning in 2015, the year Ducey took office, political polls showed education was the No. 1 concern for the Arizona electorate, even ahead of immigration and health care.While keeping his no-new-taxes pledge, Ducey found some ways to increase school aid. In 2016, he won legislative and voter approval to give districts $3.5 billion over 10 years, mostly from a state land trust created at the time of Arizona\u2019s founding and dedicated in part to funding public education. The move came after the Arizona Supreme Court found the state liable for failing to keep school funding even with inflation during the recession. Education leaders said the $3.5 billion came to less than was owed but embraced it as a way to funnel much-needed money to schools.As the economy improved, Ducey restored some other funds eliminated during the recession, and districts began raising salaries modestly for the first time in eight years. But this barely dented the legacy of decades of cutbacks in both wealthy and low-income districts.In January, Ducey unveiled his budget for 2018, specifying a raise of only 1 percent for teachers, along with some other aid that districts could apply to raises. On Feb. 22, news arrived of West Virginia teachers walking off the job to demand better pay and benefits. \u201cMy first thought was, They must be a union state,\u201d Berg said. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t, and I wondered what that meant for us.\u201dOne Saturday, Berg and Bunstein rallied with hundreds of other teachers along Baseline Road, a major thoroughfare, wearing red and waving Red for Ed posters. Traffic snarled as drivers slowed to honk and shout encouragement. Supporters dropped off pizzas and cases of water. From the back seat of a minivan, children waved homemade signs saying, \u201cWe support our teachers.\u201dOn March 28, another Wednesday, 2,500 teachers converged at a nighttime rally at the Capitol, which had been called by Arizona Educators United to announce the new movement\u2019s demands. They included a 20 percent salary increase, raises for support staff, no new tax cuts until Arizona increased per-pupil spending to the national average, a pay scale guaranteeing salaries would continue to rise and a return to prerecession school-funding levels. That would require an increase of $632 per student \u2014 the current level was $5,105 \u2014 or about $700 million in additional spending, based on legislative budget data.On April 2, teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky walked off the job over pay and pension issues. Amid a clamor for action in Arizona, A.E.U. leaders invited community supporters to join them on April 11 for \u201cwalk-ins,\u201d lining up outside schools before the opening bell and striding arm in arm to the entrance. More than 100,000 teachers, students, principals, parents and business owners participated at 1,100 schools.The next day, Governor Ducey, who is up for re-election in November, called a news conference and announced that he had found room in his budget for a 20 percent pay increase for teachers over three years that he called \u201c20 by 2020.\u201d There would be a 10 percent raise this year, and \u2014 if future Legislatures approved the funds \u2014 5 percent in 2019 and again in 2020.A.E.U. leaders called the raises unsustainable without new taxes and again demanded a return to funding levels from before the recession \u2014 a decade earlier. They held a vote to decide whether to walk out, and 78 percent of more than 50,000 participating teachers and support staff voted yes. The date was set for April 26, near the end of the legislative session; the walkout would continue until lawmakers voted on the education budget.The first morning of the walkout, Berg and Bunstein rode together into downtown Phoenix in Berg\u2019s Honda Odyssey, past miles of flat, exurban expanses with mountains looming in the distance, wondering how many teachers would actually show up. At the designated meeting spot outside Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, they found so many people in red \u2014 teachers from affluent suburbs and the highest-poverty schools around Phoenix \u2014 they couldn\u2019t see where the crowd stopped. Bunstein received an aerial photograph on her phone of a red sea surging 19 blocks down Washington Street from the ball field to the Capitol. It exceeded the scope of the camera, appearing to reach beyond the horizon. At about the same time, a deafening, celebratory roar went up from the crowd. Berg and Bunstein found themselves crying. So did many others.Also in the crowd was Lupita Almanza, a Mesa teacher who had gotten only one minimal raise in eight years. Weighed down by student debt and her obligations as a single mother of a daughter in kindergarten, she had been agonizing about whether to leave her job. She thought often of how much she would be paid in the private sector. \u201cI\u2019m bilingual,\u201d she said. \u201cI could make good money as a translator.\u201dBut something profound happened to her when she told her students she was walking out and wouldn\u2019t be there the next day. \u201cSaying goodbye to them was the hardest thing I ever did,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized, if this hurts my heart so much, I should be doing this. I went to the Capitol every day of the walkout, and I fought, not just for my daughter or my nieces and nephews and students, but for myself too, because this is my passion \u2014 to be a teacher \u2014 and I just can\u2019t close the door yet. I have found my voice.\u201dFar-right social-media sites including Breitbart and The Daily Caller searched Noah Karvelis\u2019s online history and revealed shortly before the walkout that he had volunteered as a college student for Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign and had tweeted about teaching students such topics as gender, race and \u201ctoxic/violent masculinity.\u201d Republican lawmakers quickly tarred Red for Ed as a socialist plot \u2014 \u201ccue Karvelis\u2019 former boss Bernie Sanders,\u201d Republican State Representative Maria Syms of Paradise Valley wrote in an op-ed in The Arizona Republic. When a high school music teacher in Tempe texted State Representative Kelly Townsend, a conservative Republican, asking to explore common ground, she replied, \u201cWhen the teachers denounce the socialists in charge of your Red for Ed movement, and parenthetically I wondered why they chose the color red, then we can sit down and talk.\u201d The teacher posted the exchange on Facebook.\u201cLet us band together, \u2018conservative\u2019 and \u2018liberal,\u2019 and WIN this war,\u201d Jonathan Massey, an English teacher of 14 years and a Republican who said he often votes like an independent, wrote on Facebook. \u201cAfter we have achieved sweet victory, we can resume attacking each other on other issues! Haha! WE are the kind of uprising which politicians of both major parties dread. They have lost control of us, and that means TROUBLE.\u201dFor six days, teachers lobbied their lawmakers amid debate over the education budget. In the end, the salary increase survived intact, but the other teacher demands went nowhere. Democrats presented most of them as amendments; all were defeated by Republicans banding together. On the last day, the vote on the overall state budget dragged on into the morning. It was common for Arizona budgets to pass in the middle of the night with only a handful of spectators watching. But this time, when the final vote was taken at 5 a.m., the gallery was still packed and solid red with teachers.Aidan Balt, 31, a high school English teacher and a Republican, had watched all night, growing increasingly distressed. She had been teaching for eight years at a school south of Phoenix where half the students are low income. She took home $2,200 a month, too little to afford to live on her own. She routinely worked 12-hour days and longer, trying to make up for what her students didn\u2019t get from their underfunded school. During the budget negotiations, she met with one of her representatives, a Republican, to tell him in detail why the system needed more revenue. She said he was cordial but told her she didn\u2019t understand the budget.\u201cYou go meet a Republican lawmaker, and they say you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she recalled later, sipping passion-tea lemonade in a Starbucks. \u201cBut I do know what I\u2019m talking about. This is something I\u2019m an expert in, something I love and live every day.\u201dShe said she identified strongly with the Republican Party. \u201cI was raised to believe in personal freedom. I was raised around people with guns. I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut over time my perception has changed. Politics shouldn\u2019t be polarized. I\u2019m not so black-and-white that I can\u2019t see that sometimes I might have to vote differently because of other issues. For me, all I can do is focus on something I know, and that\u2019s education.\u201dShe was just one teacher in a red shirt, sitting among many others in the Senate gallery in the wee hours of a morning in May. But watching the party-line votes against the teachers\u2019 demands, she felt compelled to take a stand. Pulling out her phone, she went to the online portal for the Arizona state government and changed her voter registration \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to Democratic.On May 4, teachers returned to school with a new slogan: \u201cRemember in November.\u201dChristine Marsh, Arizona\u2019s 2016 Teacher of the Year, decided last year to run for the State Senate in a district straddling Phoenix and the affluent suburb Paradise Valley, against its moderate Republican incumbent, Kate Brophy McGee. On a sweltering day this past June, having just completed her 26th year in the classroom, Marsh was traversing several Phoenix housing developments, riding in a fellow teacher\u2019s Prius, hopping out every minute or two to knock on voters\u2019 doors to ask them for support.\u201cTeachers live by the mantra \u2018Just close your door and teach,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Marsh, 52, who teaches high school English and calculated that she has taught more than 3,500 students. \u201cIf there were things we didn\u2019t like, we shut out the outside world and did our job to the best of our ability. We\u2019ve been systematically cut for 20 years, but the last 10 years, I came to the point I could not \u2018Close my door and teach\u2019 anymore. I\u2019m running to get to the point where teachers can focus on our students and not be testifying before the House Education Committee.\u201dThe G.O.P. holds a four-seat margin in the State Senate; Marsh\u2019s district, a mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents, is one of a handful that Democrats have targeted as winnable in hopes of flipping Senate control. Republicans have controlled both houses of the Legislature for 25 years, except in 2001 and 2002, when the Senate was tied.\u201cWe balance or flip the Senate, and there are no more budgets passed in the dark of night,\u201d Marsh told a crowd of former students and parents gathered at a Scottsdale home in June. \u201cWith a 15-15 split, Republicans have to come to the table. It\u2019s a game changer for the whole state.\u201dOn Facebook, teachers encouraged one another to work for candidates who are dedicated to more funding for education \u2014 mostly Democrats but in some cases Republicans. Hoping to circumvent the governor and Legislature, they also embraced Arizona\u2019s robust tradition of direct democracy, backing ballot initiatives to support public schools.One of those referendums was already on the ballot for November, thanks to a statewide coalition of mothers and teachers who came together in the summer of 2017 in a precursor to this year\u2019s grass-roots uprising. Calling their movement Save Our Schools Arizona, the cadre of women became overnight activists when Governor Ducey and the Legislature in April 2017 vastly expanded the state\u2019s then-limited program of private school vouchers \u2014 known as Empowerment Scholarship Accounts \u2014 by making all 1.1 million Arizona schoolchildren eligible for them. Under the voucher program, the state loads an average of $5,700 onto debit cards and issues them to parents to use for private schools, home instruction and other alternatives to public school. Ducey described the measure as necessary for children who struggle to succeed in traditional settings. \u201cPublic education is about educating our public,\u201d he said. Lawmakers limited the expansion to 5,500 new participants a year through 2022 to allay fiscal concerns. But the S.O.S. leaders argued that the Legislature could eventually lift the cap, triggering an exodus of students and revenue from public to private schools. With an all-volunteer force, in temperatures of 110 and higher, they gathered more than 100,000 signatures \u2014 well beyond the 75,000 needed \u2014 for what became known as Proposition 305, which blocked enactment of the voucher-expansion law until voters rule on it this November.In the middle of the walkout, inspired by Prop 305, Karvelis and other Red for Ed leaders endorsed another ballot initiative called Invest in Ed, developed by the national and state teachers\u2019 unions and liberal public-policy groups, that would raise $690 million a year through increased marginal tax rates on the state\u2019s top earners. It would create a dedicated funding stream to restore all-day kindergarten, reduce class sizes, hire more counselors and continue to raise teachers\u2019 pay.Karvelis said he and the other leaders informally polled teachers amid the frenzy of the walkout, finding widespread support for the initiative. But the endorsement created fissures in the movement. \u201cI thought this was a bipartisan fight for education,\u201d Kris Leffler, a Mesa teacher and a Republican, wrote on Facebook. \u201cOnce the chant for higher taxes for the wealthy started, you lost this teacher\u2019s support!!!!\u201d The proposed ballot measure would almost double the marginal tax rate on the richest residents \u2014 individuals making over $500,000, couples making over a million dollars \u2014 from 4.54 to 9 percent, making it the fifth-highest rate in any state. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that liberal thought,\u201d Leffler said. Other Republican teachers renounced Red for Ed on the same grounds. Jonathan Massey, who cautioned against partisanship from the start, lamented what he called \u201cthe loss of our trademark\u201d but didn\u2019t leave the movement.Those backing the measure argued that it would make the system more fair because the state budget now relies heavily on sales taxes, which disproportionately burden low-income residents. Berg said she would have preferred a broader-based tax but was moved by the bottom line of having more money for schools. So was Jenna Kaderlik, a Republican teacher from Surprise, a Phoenix suburb, who took a $15,000 pay cut when her family moved from Texas. \u201cThe ballot initiative really called to me \u2014 a dedicated, sustainable revenue stream every year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be voter-approved and voter-protected. The Legislature and the governor can\u2019t touch it.\u201dThey and thousands of other teachers across Arizona spent evenings and weekends collecting signatures; Berg took charge of distributing petitions to other teachers every Saturday morning across the Mesa school district. On one Saturday in June, she and Bunstein spent three hours collecting signatures at a coffee shop called Xtreme Bean in a busy shopping strip. Later that day, they moved to a bar and grill in Tempe, where they ran into S.O.S. activists from the previous year\u2019s battle for Prop 305. With their cause already on the ballot, S.O.S. was helping out supporters of Invest in Ed and a third referendum called Outlaw Dirty Money. It would require so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups that funnel millions of hard-to-trace dollars into Arizona political campaigns \u2014 mostly Republican but also Democratic \u2014 to reveal their individual donors. The parents and teachers who took on the voucher law had become intimately familiar with these groups.\u201cIf you cared last year about vouchers, and this year about the walkout, you need to ask the next question: Where did this issue come from?\u201d said Dawn Penich-Thacker, a communications professor at Arizona State University and an S.O.S. founder who was coordinating volunteers at the bar and grill. \u201cAnd that takes you to dark money.\u201dDucey had become a presence at conferences organized by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and donors to their political-finance network when he was state treasurer. An organization called Americans for Responsible Leadership, whose funding was traced by California authorities to the Koch network, contributed almost $1 million in support of Ducey\u2019s successful campaign against the 1-cent sales-tax hike in 2012.In his 2014 gubernatorial campaign, Ducey ran on a pledge to cut taxes every year and drive income tax rates in Arizona \u201cas close to zero as possible.\u201d That year, six dark-money groups spent almost $3.5 million supporting him or attacking his opponents, according to an investigation by The Arizona Capitol Times. Citing tax records, the paper found that five of the groups were financed by the sixth, American Encore, run by the Arizona political consultant Sean Noble, who was known to have funneled more than $100 million from anonymous Koch-network donors into political causes in 2012. \u201cOur network will work with anyone to help remove barriers that are preventing students from reaching their potential,\u201d Meredith Olson, an education spokeswoman for the Koch network, wrote to The Times in an email.In 2017, the Koch brothers\u2019 political advocacy arm, Americans for Prosperity, named the Arizona voucher-expansion bill its No. 1 education-reform priority in the country. The American Federation for Children, another bundler of anonymous contributions, founded by the family of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and focused on expanding school choice through charter schools, vouchers and private school scholarships, made it their top priority in the state.Charles Koch and five members of the DeVos family have each given the maximum $5,100 to Ducey\u2019s gubernatorial campaign this year, according to filings with the secretary of state.When the expansion of vouchers passed in 2017, DeVos tweeted congratulations from her official account: \u201cA big win for students & parents in Arizona tonight.... I applaud Gov. @DougDucey for putting kids first.\u201dFor weeks after leaders of Save Our Schools delivered their petitions to the secretary of state, a phalanx of activists from Americans for Prosperity and the American Federation for Children submitted multiple daily objections to individual signatures, according to Roopali Hardin Desai, an attorney who represented S.O.S. When the state nonetheless certified more than enough signatures as valid, lawyers representing the Koch network filed legal challenges that went all the way to the State Supreme Court but ultimately failed. Desai estimated that the voucher proponents spent as much as $500,000 on legal fees. But since Arizona law does not require such groups, known as social-welfare organizations, to disclose expenditures or individual donors in campaigns over ballot access, she said, \u201cI have no idea where it came from, who was paying or how much it was.\u201dThe school-choice movement in Arizona has fought to keep charter and private schools lightly regulated, arguing that too much state oversight would stifle innovation. In 2017, the Grand Canyon Institute, a nonprofit research organization, found that more than 77 percent of charter schools in Arizona use state funds to do business with for-profit companies owned by the charter holder, a member of the charter board or their relatives. With 18 percent of Arizona public school students in charters, the highest percentage of any state, David Wells, the institute\u2019s research director, reported that charters spent half a billion dollars in 2013-14 on these \u201crelated-party\u201d transactions, which are illegal in public school districts.One charter engaging in related-party transactions is Benjamin Franklin Charter School, owned by State Representative Eddie Farnsworth, a Republican, who has received regular infusions of campaign support from the American Federation for Children \u2014 more than $8,000 in his recent primary campaign, according to filings with the Arizona secretary of state. Farnsworth, who votes on charter school legislation despite his direct interest in one, owns a real estate firm from which B.F.C.S. leases its four campuses, according to records assembled by a watchdog group, Arizonans for Charter School Accountability. When the group complained that B.F.C.S. does not hold board meetings, the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office found that the state\u2019s open-meetings law does not apply because Farnsworth is the board\u2019s only member.Steve Yarbrough, the president of the Arizona Senate, a Republican who is retiring this year, was for years the prime legislative champion of the state program that provides tax credits for donations to private school scholarships. He also benefited personally from it. By law, donations go directly to so-called School Tuition Organizations, which then award the scholarships, and Yarbrough was until January the executive director of the state\u2019s biggest S.T.O., the Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization. (He was succeeded by his son Scott.) Under Arizona law, S.T.O.s can keep 10 percent of all donations. A.C.S.T.O. paid Yarbrough $129,649 in fiscal year 2017. A.C.S.T.O., a nonprofit, outsourced services like data entry and information processing to a for-profit company that Yarbrough co-owned with his wife and another couple. That company charged the nonprofit $672,453 in 2017 and millions of dollars combined over the previous decade. The Arizona Republic reported in 2015 that Yarbrough, in addition, was A.C.S.T.O.\u2019s landlord, receiving $52,000 a year in rent.He also served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee.\u201cIt\u2019s blatant that a number of lawmakers have something to make off of charters and private schools,\u201d said an infuriated Aidan Balt, the formerly Republican teacher who changed her registration. \u201cWho puts up with that? We do! Arizonans put up with that!\u201dAs a result of the increase approved by the Legislature \u2014 with a huge shove from Red for Ed \u2014 Berg got a $6,000 annual raise, the biggest of her career. Her husband recently got a new job with generous health benefits. Beginning Oct. 1, for the first time in years, she\u2019ll no longer be carrying the whole family of six on her health plan, adding $1,600 a month to her take-home pay. That, with her raise, allowed her to quit the community college job that had taken her away from her children three nights a week.Out on the campaign trail, Ducey was touting the pay raise as a signal accomplishment, along with other increases in state support to school districts. In November, he faces the Democrat David Garcia, an education professor at Arizona State University who won the Aug. 28 primary with a ringing call for more education funding.Ducey emphasized in one appearance after another that he made these changes while standing firm against a tax increase. He criticized the Invest in Ed initiative to hike taxes on the rich, along with its underlying argument that Arizona needs to raise more revenue to fund public education adequately. He pointed out that surging economic growth in the last year helped finance the raises. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019d raise a tax when we have such overwhelming revenues coming into our general fund,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThat would be the equivalent of hanging out a sign in Arizona that we\u2019re no longer open for business.\u201dBut as soon as school reopened, teachers began filling Facebook with evidence of all that remained unaddressed.

It now had a name: Proposition 207. \u201cI cried, I got goose bumps, I shared it on Facebook, I felt grateful for everyone who helped,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I got right to work\u201d on plans to mobilize support.In a stunning development, however, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled on Aug. 29 that Proposition 207 could not appear on the November ballot. The justices\u2019 finding was that the wording of the initiative inadvertently repealed the indexing of Arizona tax brackets to inflation and would eventually raise taxes on all Arizonans, not just the rich. Sponsors of Invest in Ed had successfully contested this interpretation in a lower court, but the justices found \u201ca significant danger of confusion or unfairness,\u201d invalidating the petitions signed by more than 270,000 Arizonans to put the tax increase on the November ballot. The order cannot be appealed.In a separate decision the same day, the justices upheld a lower-court ruling that invalidated petitions for the Outlaw Dirty Money initiative, disqualifying it from the ballot as well. The state director of the Kochs\u2019 A.F.P. was a plaintiff in the Outlaw Dirty Money case, and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry filed the challenge to Proposition 207. \u201cThis has been a great day for taxpayers,\u201d said Tom Jenney, an executive of the Arizona branch of A.F.P. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great day for everyone looking out for freedom.\u201dTeachers reacted with fury on the Arizona Educators United Facebook page, accusing \u201cDucey\u2019s stacked supreme court\u201d of subverting democracy. Ducey expanded the high court in 2016 from five to seven justices, of whom he has appointed three. Teachers of every political stripe called on one another to work in November to defeat all politicians opposed to more funding for education. \u201cThe ONLY way out of this . . . is to collectively \u2014 Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal \u2014 unite and vote for the same candidates,\u201d wrote Heather Gookin, a fourth-grade teacher and registered independent. \u201cIf politicians insist on inserting themselves into our classrooms, we need to insist that we let the right ones in.\u201dTeachers who last year couldn\u2019t identify their legislative district were crowdsourcing information on their state senators\u2019 and representatives\u2019 education records, their dark-money donors, their comments at meet-and-greet sessions. Whether Democrats, Republicans or independents, they said they were being deluged with requests for advice \u2014 from neighbors, friends, relatives, day care providers, kids\u2019 soccer coaches, gym buddies, even people at dog parks \u2014 on whom to support for governor and the Legislature.Berg said no one had ever asked her before how to vote in an election, nor could she have answered intelligently. But now she can, and she does. \u201cWe are educators who learn for a living and try to make a better world through our classrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we gather, focus, research and teach others what we have learned about Arizona politics?\u201d/\u2022/Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Balkans, Russia and the West Fight a Disinformation-Age Battle", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySKOPJE, Macedonia \u2014 As Macedonians prepare for the most important vote in their nation\u2019s history, scores of Facebook posts are urging voters to burn their ballots. Hundreds of new websites are calling for a boycott. And one news article, widely shared online, warns that Google may eliminate Macedonian from its list of recognized languages, depending on the vote.In a disinformation age, Macedonian and Western officials say the flurry of social media activity is just that \u2014 disinformation directed by Russian-backed groups trying to stoke fears and depress turnout in a vote that could put this Balkan nation on a path to join NATO.All have a simple message: It\u2019s now or never.On his way here on Monday, Mr. Mattis told reporters that Russia was financing \u201cinfluence campaigns\u201d to undermine the referendum. Appearing later with Mr. Zaev, Mr. Mattis did not mention Russia specifically, but spoke of the need to fight \u201cmalicious cyber activity that threatens our democracies.\u201dRussian officials have broadly denied that they are trying to affect the outcome of European elections. But Russian diplomats have made no secret of their opposition to further NATO expansion, arguing that it would destabilize the Balkans.\u201cOne of Russia\u2019s top foreign policy and security goals is to oppose NATO at every step,\u201d said James H. Mackey, who leads the Euro-Atlantic and global partnership office at NATO. \u201cAs long as they think they can make trouble, they will try to make trouble.\u201dCongress allocated money in January 2017 to fight Russian disinformation campaigns, including $8 million specifically for Macedonia. But the money did not arrive for more than a year, and it has yet to be effectively deployed, according to a Western official who agreed to speak about the subject only on the condition of anonymity. An additional $2 million, meant to promote the rule of law in Macedonia, which is still struggling with endemic corruption, had not arrived as of August, the official said.American officials also note that millions in security assistance flow to the country.NATO officials, for their part, say they provided information to help Macedonia counter the Russian campaign. \u201cWe see Russia is trying to meddle, to spread disinformation,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said in an interview. \u201cBut Russia is not winning.\u201dHe added that opinion polls continued to show majority support for the country\u2019s name change, despite the Russian campaign. The challenge, he said, was that Moscow \u201coperates on many different levels with many different tools.\u201dWhen he arrives in Skopje on Monday, Mr. Mattis will urge Macedonians to vote in the referendum. He will also emphasize the $5 million in annual security support the United States provides, Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, said.\u201cRussia seeks to convince the Macedonians that the West is going to abandon them, that Russia is the stable influence in the region,\u201d Mr. Pahon said. \u201cThat is just not true.\u201dChanging Macedonia\u2019s name and bringing the country into the alliance, Mr. Pahon said, would reduce Moscow\u2019s influence. \u201cMacedonian accession to NATO is one of Russia\u2019s worst nightmares,\u201d he added.In Macedonia, officials blame Russian-backed online groups for proliferating false articles and Facebook posts as a way to heighten social divisions, drive down participation and amplify public anger. This spring, football hooligans opposed to the name change clashed with police officers outside Parliament in Skopje \u2014 an episode quickly seized on by people who produced false stories claiming government brutality.\u201cThere is a famous Balkan singer, and they took an old picture of her beaten and bruised in a domestic violence incident, and tried to claim she was beaten by police at the protest,\u201d said Marko Troshanovski, who works for Societas Civilis, a research institute focused on promoting democracy. \u201cThe misinformation was later countered, but it was in the blood stream.\u201dAfter the clash, Mr. Zaev, the prime minister, blamed Moscow and expelled a Russian diplomat. In response, Oleg Shcherbak, the Russian ambassador to Macedonia, offered a stark warning.\u201cIf it came to a conflict between Russia and NATO,\u201d he warned ominously, \u201cyou will have the role of a legitimate target.\u201dAccording to Western officials, Moscow\u2019s primary goal is to depress turnout. If less than half of registered voters participate in the referendum, the issue is forced back to Parliament, undermining the popular mandate for a solution.To an outsider, the dispute can seem puzzling, but it has proved diplomatically explosive and intractable. Like so much in the Balkans, it is a conflict complicated by history and war.Western diplomats say that 40 new websites are popping up each day on Facebook to encourage people to boycott the referendum. These websites, originating outside the country, fit a pattern of Russian interference in other elections, diplomats say.In a country largely divided along ethnic lines, some websites deliberately stoke tensions with the country\u2019s ethnic Albanian minority, evoking memories of a yearlong armed conflict in 2001 between the government and a faction of Albanians.\u201cAre you going to let Albanians change your name?\u201d is a common theme.American intelligence officials say Russia has also co-opted local football fan clubs and motorcycle gangs opposed to the name change.\u201cThe Russians are pumping money into the opposition to the name agreement and supporting nationalistic politicians opposed to the deal,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, a former Obama administration official now at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.Assuming Macedonian voters agree to the name change, and Macedonia\u2019s Constitution is amended to reflect it, the deal would then be subject to approval by the Greek Parliament. Greek officials have also accused Moscow of interference and have responded by expelling two diplomats.\u201cThey are spending money in Greece, trying to add to the resistance to the Macedonia name issue,\u201d said Ben Hodges, a former United States Army commander in Europe, who is now at the Center for European Policy Analysis. \u201cWherever there is a seam or a crack, that is what they will exploit.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Mattis\u2019s visit on Monday is meant to signal American resolve \u2014 even as some Republicans in Washington are increasingly resistant to expanding NATO. Montenegro\u2019s membership was opposed by the Republican senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, and conservative publications have produced articles in recent weeks questioning the wisdom of further NATO expansion, specifically citing the case of Macedonia.\u201cThey may get aggressive, and, congratulations, you\u2019re in World War III,\u201d he said.Officials in Skopje nervously took note of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments but said that they believed the United States stood firmly behind their bid to join NATO.And the prime minister said his government had placed its \u201centire political capital to solve the dispute with Greece.\u201d\u201cThis is our big chance,\u201d Mr. Zaev said. \u201cCitizens know that the moment has to be seized. This is how they will shape their future and the future of our country.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect title for Jens Stoltenberg of NATO. He is the organization\u2019s secretary general, not its general secretary.Marc Santora reported from Skopje, Macedonia, and Julian E. Barnes from Washington.

{"Headline": "Women Move From Samba\u2019s Sidelines to the Center of the Circle ", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOver time, the Brazilian samba circle turned into a predominantly male realm. Now female musicians are pushing back.Step up to a traditional samba circle in Brazil and you\u2019ll find this: a group of 5 to 15 men, each playing an instrument \u2014 a tambourine, a cavaquinho, a drum. Then you\u2019ll typically see women, not playing music, but rather shimmying in the front row of the crowd, dancing to the pounding syncopations.The samba circle, or roda de samba, is a Unesco-recognized part of Brazil\u2019s cultural heritage. These communal releases of weekday worries crop up across the city regularly. The samba circles are free, they\u2019re rowdy and, increasingly, they\u2019re changing.With astonishing speed, female musicians in Brazil have begun breaking into the male realm of samba circles, taking a seat at the table both literally and figuratively. Just a few years ago, the musicians playing in a samba circle jam session used to be almost all male. In 2018, though, a clutch of all-female samba groups have set out to change that, and in doing so, they have generated what could be a sea change for this beloved Brazilian musical genre.Another part of the movement is spurred by a newfound sense of revolt among female musicians against the lyrics of some of the traditional samba circle anthems, which make light of serious crimes such as domestic violence and sexual assault. What has changed today is that social media plays a meaningful role in empowering female samba musicians. Women join together in secret Facebook groups or in private WhatsApp message groups to share news: A singer is releasing her first album, a guitarist was pushed out of a samba circle by a man, a new feminist politician is running for office.The lead singer of Mo\u00e7a Prosa, Fabiola Machado, says the situation boils down to a question of visibility and musical talent. \u201cAll we want is for people to hear our music and think, \u2018Hey, that sounds good, what\u2019s their name?\u2019\u201d she said.But samba circles weren\u2019t always male dominated. In 1930s post-slavery Brazil, Ms. de Oliveira notes, women were the orchestrators of what are now known as samba circles. Afro-Brazilian religions like Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9, which have been historically persecuted for their perceived connection to \u201cblack magic,\u201d burnished the cultural role of the powerful female \u201cauntie\u201d \u2014 nicknamed a Baiana in reference to the state of Bahia, the geographical center of Afro-Brazilian religions in Brazil. The women inhabiting these leadership roles, which are somewhere between a mother figure and a wise queen, became the de facto hostesses of the very first samba circles. Early in the 20th century, Brazilian laws aimed ostensibly at \u201cvagrancy,\" but drenched in racial antipathy resulted in a crackdown on Afro-Brazilian religious practices. Musicians \u2014 especially black men \u2014 could be arrested for simply walking around town with a tambourine in their hand. In response, Baianas opened up their backyards for clandestine religious gatherings that included music \u2014 the first iteration of the modern samba circle. These women \u2014 Tia Ciata, Madrinha Eunice and Clementina de Jesus, to name a few \u2014 formed the first generation of women in samba, initiating an art form that over time gave rise to the crowded Samba Que Elas Querem shows. Female musicians today credit that generation for putting women in the center of samba, and the groups exalt them by including the sambas those women composed in their regular repertoires.But that first generation did not lead to easy entry for women in samba circles. Rather, women were pushed back out of Brazilian samba starting in the 1940s and \u201950s as vagrancy rules relaxed and sambas started popping up in public spaces. Women were suddenly deemed too fragile to be out and about in the streets playing music. Before long, women had almost entirely disappeared from the samba circles, being cast back into accessory roles: the muse or the dancer.Although the lyrics of many samba songs focus on universal feelings of heartbreak or good times, and many of those composed by women like Dona Ivone Lara are embraced by the all-female groups, some of the older, most egregiously sexist lyrics of samba can be shocking to modern ears. One classic song laughingly describes a man\u2019s partner as an ugly \u201clittle monkey\u201d whom he \u201cpunches\u201d and \u201cthrows in the sink.\u201d Another portrays a man chastising another man for beating the first man\u2019s wife, lecturing that doing so is \u201cwrong\u201d because he is the only one who can beat his woman. Yet another describes \u201ca real woman\u201d as someone who is willing to starve for a man. The songs became so embedded in the increasingly revered institution of the samba circle that few thought to challenge them.Nevertheless, with the place of women in samba shrinking in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s, a few women managed to break through, usually thanks to an undeniably captivating singing voice. The names of this second generation of female sambistas are known by all Brazilians \u2014 Dona Ivone Lara, Beth Carvalho, Clara Nunes, Alcione \u2014 and their pioneering efforts over the past generation are widely regarded as paving the way for the all-female samba circles of today. Her voice, at once husky and effervescent, accompanies some of the most beloved and popular songs in the samba songbook. For years, she pushed her way into being the girl in the boys\u2019 circle, spending her nights wedging herself into folding chairs at loud tables littered with ashtrays and beer cans, fighting for a chance to sing. \u201cThe scene was very full of machismo,\u201d she said of the 1960s, when she got her start. She learned to play the cavaquinho, and she thinks that differentiated her. \u201cSince I could already play, I was armed, and I wasn\u2019t intimidated,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cIn any case, I have samba in my veins. What else could I do?\u201d Even though she was the only woman, she held her own. Her first album cover features a photo of her with her cavaquinho among male musicians, a design she says was intentional. \u201cI grabbed it as a symbol of \u2018let\u2019s end this story of being a muse.\u2019 Let\u2019s be musicians instead.\u201d She smiles sweetly, \u201cIt\u2019s my feminist side.\u201dToday Ms. Carvalho is not necessarily optimistic about women\u2019s permanence in the samba circle. \u201cSamba is still a circle of men,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I am sad to know that women still don\u2019t feel comfortable sitting down in a samba circle. This is terrible. I hope my contribution helped.\u201dThe Brazilian musician Zeh Gustavo is one of the men leading a push against what he deems the intrusion of political correctness into samba. A fixture of the samba scene in Rio\u2019s port area, Mr. Gustavo says that even though he is empathetic to these women\u2019s point of view, he thinks \u201cthese works of music deserve respect,\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be excluded or tampered with. He says it is patently wrong for musicians to either prohibit some samba songs from being sung, or to change the lyrics to something more palatable. \u201cYou\u2019re intervening in a process that started before you,\u201d he says with passion over beers one afternoon. \u201cYou\u2019re interrupting history.\u201dMs. Furtado, the documentarian, believes the opposite: \u201cIn reality, samba is a living culture, and it must adapt to new realities,\u201d she said. Mr. Gustavo recently sat in as a guest at one of the new samba circles made up mostly of women. When he started playing one of the more offensive old songs \u2014 about beating women (without thinking twice, he claims) \u2014 the female musicians one by one stopped playing. Advertisement"}

Trump has denied the account from Bob Woodward\u2019s new book, \u201cFear.\u201dIt\u2019s in Trump\u2019s character to deride those without gold-plated bathroom fixtures as inferior. His people, as he said in a North Dakota non sequitur, have the best apartments and the nicest boats. But you don\u2019t need what comes out of his mouth as proof of his class disdain. Look at the two biggest policy initiatives of his presidency.He has tried mightily to destroy Obamacare and all the lives dependent on it. He\u2019s still pushing a repeal plan that would leave upward of 18 million people without health care. And who are those people? His supporters, mostly.Working-class whites, particularly in the old Rust Belt, were the main beneficiaries of the expansion of health care under President Barack Obama. In Midwestern states that flipped from Obama to Trump, far more non-college-educated whites gained health coverage than did whites with degrees or members of ethnic minorities, according to an Urban Institute study. And if the president\u2019s party succeeds in choking the last life out of Obamacare, these Trump voters stand to lose the most.In West Virginia, where Trump could shoot the Mountaineer mascot and still walk at the head of a parade, attacks on Obamacare are killing Republican chances of taking down Senator Joe Manchin.The other signature issue is the tax cut. Remember how Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, another plutocrat who has trouble hiding his contempt for flyover country, described it last year? \u201cNot only will this tax cut pay for itself,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will pay down the debt.\u201dThe collapse in revenue will hurt Trump supporters in other ways. One is the paucity of federal dollars for investment \u2014 in community colleges, roads, opioid treatment, Pell grants for students, ultimately even Social Security or Medicare. Another is that, by forcing borrowing costs up, the Trump deficit contributes to rising interest rates. That makes it much harder for working families to buy homes.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.This is part of a series on what is at stake in New York\u2019s primary elections on Thursday, and in the general election on Nov. 6.As gentrification and a bloated real estate market intensify New Yorkers\u2019 frantic search for affordable housing, and escalate the threat of homelessness, voters can fight back by electing lawmakers willing to break the real estate industry\u2019s grip on Albany.New York\u2019s system of rent regulation, limiting how much landlords can charge tenants, began in the 1940s to help a growing middle class. There are about one million apartments covered under rent-restricting regulations now, about a quarter fewer than there were in the early 1990s. The stage was set for this loss in affordable housing in 1971, when the Legislature took control of rent regulation away from New York City by passing the Urstadt Law, which barred the city from enacting rent laws more restrictive than those of the state.Even when rents are down and market conditions ought to benefit tenants, legislators made sure the law worked to the benefit of landlords. Rent guidelines set the rent a landlord can legally charge for an apartment. Sometimes that\u2019s higher than its market rate, so landlords charge a lower \u201cpreferential rent.\u201d Landlords once had to wait for the tenant being charged a preferential rent to move before they could raise the rent to the legal limit. But in 2003, as gentrification was sending real estate values surging across the city, the Legislature passed a law letting landlords raise rents when current tenants renewed their leases, leading to steep, sudden rent hikes for many tenants.Then, here are some actions lawmakers can take:Landlords should only be allowed to raise rents to the legal limit after a tenant who had been paying a lower rent moves out. This is the state agency that enforces rent laws, and it needs more funding to bring much-needed accountability to a system that is widely abused by landlords. One way would be for the agency to require landlords to submit receipts for improvements to individual apartments to the agency and the tenant. Rent increases justified by such improvements, as well as capital improvements to the entire building, should be made temporary, lasting only until the costs are paid off. New Yorkers\u2019 votes on Thursday and on Nov. 6 can craft a Legislature devoted to the needs of city residents, not the demands of their donors. That\u2019s how to keep more New Yorkers in their homes. Advertisement"}

Contributing opinion writerNASHVILLE \u2014 I was a graduate student in Philadelphia when James Watt, the former Secretary of the Interior of the United States, came to campus in 1984. Mr. Watt\u2019s brief tenure in federal office was characterized by an almost cartoonish villainy. Rolling Stone magazine called his attitude toward the environment a \u201crip-and-ruin view of our natural resources, land, water, parks and wilderness.\u201d That night Watt argued for letting each state set its own air- and water-safety standards, a position that makes no sense if you\u2019re aware that rivers and winds don\u2019t respect state borders.During the Q. and A., I took my turn at the microphone to make this point. \u201cSir,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m from Alabama.\u201d Instantly that giant audience of Pennsylvanians broke into laughter. Who was this cracker daring to voice an opinion about federal environmental policy?Well, that was 1984, you\u2019re probably thinking. Today we don\u2019t judge people by their accents any more than we judge them by their skin color. People know better now.As stereotypes go, this one surely doesn\u2019t rank among the top 10 most objectionable human prejudices, but it stings even so. Fortunately there is plenty of on-the-ground proof to counter it. Among the most important is a raft of publications, many so new they\u2019re still on shaky financial footing, that aim to convey the genuine complexities of the modern American South. They are planted in the South and created by Southerners, people who love this place but who nevertheless see it all too truly.The latest issue includes a nonfiction report by Kelsey Norris on a Nashville oral-history project focusing on the descendants of slaves; Beth Macy\u2019s profile of the Appalachian playwright and novelist Robert Gipe; \u201cBikers,\u201d a poem by the Virginia native Kate Daniels about her brothers (\u201cWhat foreign lives they lived / With their deer hunts, and their / Love of speed, and their boring jobs / In factories\u201d) and a short story by David Wesley Williams about a hitchhiker stuck in West Memphis, Ark. The story is called \u201cStay Away From Places With Directions in Their Names.\u201dSoutherly\u2019s mission statement sets out some uncompromising goals: \u201cThis region stands to bear the brunt and lose the most from the effects of climate change. It is experiencing massive economic shifts from a changing energy industry. The South is the fastest urbanizing area of the United States, but it is also the most economically distressed. Southerners deserve a publication that covers the nuances of their environment, history and communities without being condescending or stereotypical, without parachuting in from large metropolitan areas. The rest of the world deserves to know about the creative ways communities here are adapting to these changes, and the challenges that come with that.\u201dYou could almost call it a mission statement for celebrating \u2014 and transforming \u2014 the South itself.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Fall, Everything Old Is TV Again", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLooking at the 2018-19 TV schedule is like flipping the dials on a time machine. The season includes \u201cMagnum P.I.\u201d (whose predecessor debuted in 1980),\u201cMurphy Brown\u201d (1988), \u201cCharmed\u201d (1998), \u201cRoswell, New Mexico\u201d (from \u201cRoswell,\u201d 1999) and \u201cThe Conners,\u201d spun off after Roseanne Barr\u2019s self-immolation by Twitter, from the revival of \u201cRoseanne\u201d (1988).It\u2019s enough temporal hopscotching to fill an entire new series of \u201cQuantum Leap.\u201d (Which somehow has not been greenlighted yet, but give it a month or two.)So if we\u2019re destined to be borne back ceaselessly into TV\u2019s past, we may as well look at what makes a good remake and what doesn\u2019t.First, some definitions are in order. This broad genre \u2014 Re TV, let\u2019s call it \u2014 falls mainly into two categories.First you\u2019ve got your reboots: old titles being remade for another era, with new casts, and possibly new settings and characters. This includes the new \u201cMagnum,\u201d \u201cRoswell\u201d and \u201cCharmed.\u201dThen you have revivals: series, exhumed as if from the grave, with the same characters played by the same actors, picking up years or decades later. These include the new \u201cMurphy Brown,\u201d \u201cRoseanne\u201d/\u201dThe Conners\u201d and the reconstituted \u201cWill & Grace.\u201dIt is true that TV has been ransacking its past almost as long as it\u2019s had one; there is a history of \u201cBrady Bunch\u201d and \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d reunion movies to attest to that. Critics like me have been griping about TV\u2019s recycling of ideas for just as long. So yes: even the complaints are remakes.But the sheer tonnage of Re TV today reflects a culture that\u2019s increasingly like a Netflix home page, full of \u201cIf You Liked \u2026\u201d and \u201cWatch It Again.\u201d And in many ways the glut of these shows, even when they appear on the old legacy networks, is a product of the streaming-TV era.New media have made TV\u2019s past ever-present and ever more accessible. \u201cGilmore Girls,\u201d for instance, developed a brand-new audience in reruns and on Netflix, which was primed for its 2016 revival. (Netflix in particular \u2014 which also gave us \u201cArrested Development\u201d and \u201cFuller House\u201d \u2014 is able to both manufacture nostalgic cravings and satisfy them.)What\u2019s more, between streaming and cable, there\u2019s simply so much TV now (there will probably be more than 500 original scripted series in 2018) that it\u2019s a battle for anything new to get attention. A familiar title, like \u201cS.W.A.T.,\u201d offers a boost that \u201cAnother CBS Cop Show\u201d doesn\u2019t.But these business considerations intersect with a broader hunger to relive the past and sometimes to relitigate it.Take the movies, where the new, more diverse \u201cStar Wars\u201d films and the 2016 female-led remake of \u201cGhostbusters\u201d became culture-war battles over representation and who owns the past and the future. It\u2019s not just coincidence that \u201cerasure\u201d has been a theme in both the arguments over these movies and the removal of Confederate monuments, or that the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d fight drew in alt-right figures like Milo Yiannopoulos.The revived \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d hasn\u2019t been screened for critics (CBS picked it up without shooting a pilot), but it stands to be a counterpoint to \u201cRoseanne\u201d just as it was when it began three decades ago.Where \u201cRoseanne\u201d modeled a populist blue-collar feminism, the hard-edge TV-anchor protagonist of \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d (Candice Bergen) spoke to power from a position of power. The original series was relentlessly of-the-moment, both within its scripts and without. (Vice President Dan Quayle famously went to war with the show when Murphy had a baby while single.) The revival, from its description, aims to be just as topical, with Murphy hosting a cable-news morning show, while her grown son (Jake McDorman) hosts a conservative competitor.In her recent book, \u201cStealing the Show,\u201d Joy Press notes that while Diane English, the creator of \u201cMurphy Brown,\u201d admired \u201cRoseanne,\u201d Ms. Barr \u201cfelt alienated by the kind of middle-class liberal feminism Murphy Brown represented.\u201d This may have foreshadowed the two shows\u2019 divergence in 2018, with Roseanne having gone MAGA into the sunset, while Murphy hangs in with the post-Hillary left.But revivals are also conservative by nature \u2014 artistically, if not necessarily politically. By definition, they\u2019re trying to re-create the past in the present, simulating the appeal of the original even as they show how the world has changed around the characters. For the typical revival, the best-case scenario is getting the viewer to say, \u201cThis feels like the same show I used to watch back then.\u201dThere are exceptions; one reason \u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\u201d worked so well was that, visually and in tone, it felt like a different work from the series that aired in the early \u201890s. When it overtly called back to the past \u2014 as when Audrey reprised her dance from the original series \u2014 it was with the nightmarish sense that something had died and come back changed.But more often, the point of a revival is to deny change, at least creatively. \u201cWill & Grace\u201d acknowledged the new era with a heavy-handed premiere episode about the Trump administration. But the new season was so eerily like the original in its rhythms and tone that you could convince yourself it had never gone off the air (as long as you forgot about the original series ending that the revival Etch-a-Sketched).At its heart, the appeal of a revival is the appeal of a high school reunion, or a visit to Facebook: What are they doing now? But it can be as unsettling to find your old prime-time favorites unnaturally preserved as to find them changed.Most sitcoms could theoretically go on for decades. But there\u2019s usually an unspoken expiration date: the point beyond which the characters\u2019 lives would change \u2014 making it a different show \u2014 or, in remaining the same, they would be less funny than sad. (This is one reason I pray no one ever loads up a big enough Brink\u2019s truck to reunite the cast of \u201cFriends.\u201d)A reboot, on the other hand, may be successful or disastrous, but it at least offers the possibility, and the requirement, for rethinking and transformation. \u201cBattlestar Galactica,\u201d after 9/11, turned a breezy 1970s space opera into an ambitious story about politics, religion and the ethics of survival in the face of an existential threat.More recently, when Netflix imagined \u201cOne Day at a Time\u201d with a Cuban-American family, it was able to speak to modern questions about immigration and representation, about who defines America and the working class.All this points to another distinction of reboots: Revivals, which reproduce TV\u2019s past down to the original casting, have tended to be very white, as TV\u2019s history is. But the planned reboot of \u201cParty of Five\u201d will focus on Mexican-American siblings after their parents are deported, and the \u201cRoswell\u201d reboot (also not yet screened for review) will reportedly have an immigration twist alongside its space-alien plot.CW\u2019s reboot of the witchcraft drama \u201cCharmed\u201d aims for another kind of update. The original was an artifact of the late-\u201890s \u201cBuffy\u201d era of empowered female heroines. The new version, produced by Jennie Snyder Urman (\u201cJane the Virgin\u201d), recalibrates it for the #MeToo era with a story of sexual harassment and vengeance.The pilot hammers hard for timeliness from its opening lines, \u201cThis is not a witch hunt; it\u2019s a reckoning.\u201d But there\u2019s potential in using its metaphor-heavy subject matter to look at what has and hasn\u2019t changed in 20 years.Not all reboots are so ambitious. CBS\u2019s new \u201cMagnum,\u201d judging from the rough pilot sent to critics, is the sort of charming-rogue-solving-crimes-in-paradise show that could as easily have aired in 1988 as 2018. Its chief innovation, seemingly, is that Tom Selleck\u2019s successor, Jay Hernandez, is clean-shaven. (The original \u2018stache can still be found on display with its owner on CBS\u2019s \u201cBlue Bloods.\u201d)The popularity of Re TV may partly be a sign of TV\u2019s maturing. After some 70 years as a commercial medium, it has a body of texts that can be revisited, reattempted, remixed or responded to.But history can be both a spur and a burden. CBS All Access, for instance, is rebooting \u201cThe Twilight Zone,\u201d which has already had two unmemorable relaunches.And you could argue that we have another \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d already; it\u2019s just called \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Would Charlie Brooker\u2019s travelogue of social-media hell be just as powerful had it launched with the title \u201cThe Twilight Zone: Cyber\u201d? Or would it have been constrained by the obligation to call back and pay homage to the original?Then again, I\u2019m not going to bet sight unseen against Jordan Peele, one of the new \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d producers, whose \u201cGet Out\u201d had its own Serlingesque allegorical creepiness. If Mr. Peele and company can use the \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d mantle as a cover to smuggle onto TV something just as stunning and full of voice, I won\u2019t complain about being fed leftovers.In the end, nostalgia is like any other genre. You can only judge so much from a title and a premise, because it comes down to ideas and execution. Not all Re TV is (re)created equal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where a Sore Throat Becomes a Death Sentence", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "Once a year, doctors travel to Rwanda to perform lifesaving surgery on people with damaged heart valves \u2014 a disease caused by untreated strep throat.Supported byKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 Neighbors whisper that she is pregnant, a disgrace for a young, unmarried woman. The rumors mortify her. She hates her swollen belly.But Florence Ndimubakunzi is not pregnant. Her heart is failing. It pumps so poorly that blood backs up in her veins, bloating her liver and spleen, and filling her abdomen with fluid. She is only 18.For millions like her in poorer parts of Africa, Asia and other regions, this devastating heart disease began insidiously. During childhood, they contracted strep throat \u2014 an infection caused by streptococcal bacteria.In the United States and other rich countries, children with sore throats are routinely tested for strep and quickly cured with penicillin or other cheap antibiotics.As the valves deteriorate, the heart struggles and gradually wears out. Patients become weak, short of breath and unable to attend school or work. Many die before they reach 30. Women with the illness who become pregnant can suffer severe and sometimes fatal complications.About 100 people showed up to be screened for the lifesaving operation. The team could operate on only 16.Lying on an examining table, eyes huge in her gaunt face, Florence looked impossibly fragile, her arms thin as broomsticks, her shoulders jutting up like a skeleton\u2019s. She had wasted away to 78 pounds; five were fluid.Dr. Pat Come, a Harvard cardiologist, pressed a stethoscope to Florence\u2019s chest, back and neck, and palpated her belly. A sonographer, Marilyn Riley, from Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Boston, ran an ultrasound probe over Florence\u2019s chest, showing her heart valves in motion and measuring the pressure gradients across them, the blood flow through her heart and the size of its chambers.\u201cShe has significant disease of two valves,\u201d Dr. Come finally said. \u201cBut the operative mortality is likely too high. Medical therapy is the best option.\u201dAs Florence sat up, buttoning her dress, Ms. Riley said, \u201cShe\u2019s so tiny I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll fracture getting off the table.\u201dA nurse helped her down.Outside the examining room, Florence said she\u2019d had to stop attending school because she was too weak to get there. She was eager to go back. She hoped to be a pediatrician.She has been ill since she was about 8. Doctors warned that only surgery could cure her. Now, they were saying it was impossible.\u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment,\u201d Florence said.Experts say programs to educate people about sore throats and strep, and to distribute penicillin widely to local clinics, could help greatly to prevent rheumatic heart disease in poor regions. But even those efforts probably would not wipe it out completely, because not everyone with strep seeks medical attention.In 2013, the federation set a goal of decreasing deaths from the condition by 25 percent in people under 25 by 2025. The group also called for a strep vaccine.If rheumatic fever is detected early, long-term treatment with penicillin can prevent valve damage. But many cases are already advanced.He estimated that there might be as many as 20,000 people with advanced disease who need surgery.Though prevention would be ideal, the rapid tests widely used in the United States to diagnose strep are too expensive in Rwanda, and throat cultures are not widely available.The genocide that killed a million people in Rwanda in 1994 also destroyed its health care system, and the country has had to rebuild it. H.I.V., malaria, tuberculosis and rotavirus have been major priorities \u2014 not heart disease.Rwanda has only five cardiologists and no heart surgeons or hospitals equipped to perform heart surgery \u2014 for a population of 12 million.Since 2008, Team Heart has been traveling to Rwanda. The group was founded by Cecilia Patton-Bolman, an intensive-care nurse, who had seen a ward full of teenagers dying from rheumatic heart disease when she visited the country in 2006, and her husband, Dr. R. Morton Bolman III, who was the chief of cardiac surgery at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston. (He later moved to the University of Vermont, and recently retired.)Once a year, 40 to 60 volunteers fly to Kigali: heart surgeons, cardiologists, nurses, anesthesiologists, experts in cardiac ultrasound, biomedical technicians, pharmacists, support staff and perfusionists who run the heart-lung machine that keeps patients alive during surgery. They come from the University of Vermont, Harvard-affiliated hospitals and other medical centers. They pay their own airfare, and Rwanda\u2019s Ministry of Health covers some hotel rooms and meals. Most use their vacation time, and this year Team Heart asked each volunteer also to raise $500 in donations to help cover costs. The doctors and nurses became so close to the patients that they routinely referred to them by first names in their private interactions and group deliberations, a practice reflected in the first-name references to the patients in this article.A week before the operations were to begin, at the King Faisal Hospital in Kigali, Team Heart members visited other medical centers to screen patients.Ms. Riley, the sonographer, said, \u201cThe first year I came, it felt like \u2018Who gets the life jacket in a sinking boat?\u2019\u201dThe ideal candidates are sick enough to die in a year without replacement valves \u2014 but well enough to survive the operation. The screeners also rule out those who seem strong enough to wait another year.\u201cLast year, we deferred someone who was too early,\u201d Dr. Come said. \u201cThen this year, he was too late.\u201dOne year, a patient was turned down because she was pregnant, Dr. Come said. She returned a few days later \u2014 after an abortion. She underwent the surgery and did well.Elina Mukagasigwa, 26, a tiny woman who gasped for air if she tried to walk uphill, and who coughed up blood in her sleep, was among the many hoping for help.Dr. Samvit Tandan, a cardiologist from the University of Vermont, told Elina through a translator that she had a diseased mitral valve, which controls blood flow between the chambers on the left side of the heart.\u201cWe can fix the mitral valve,\u201d Dr. Tandan said. Elina gave him a wry grin and clapped softly.But then he explained that the surgery would make it dangerous for her to become pregnant, so she should plan on never having children.Pregnancy is discouraged because people with mechanical valves need lifelong treatment with the drug warfarin to prevent clots from forming on the valves. The drug can cause hemorrhaging in the mother, and birth defects.\u201cDo I have to have the surgery?\u201d Elina asked.\u201cThat\u2019s your decision, but the valve will not get better on its own,\u201d Dr. Tandan said.\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to have a baby?\u201d she asked.\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but there is very high risk,\u201d Dr. Tandan said, and explained it again.She thought it over, and said, \u201cThe good decision is to not think about babies, so I can save my life a little bit longer.\u201d\u201cIt is more than a little bit longer,\u201d Dr. Tandan said.Replacement valves made from cow tissue do not require warfarin, but Team Heart rarely uses them, because they wear out quickly in young people. Mechanical valves can last for decades.The prospect of not having children has led some patients to decline surgery. In other cases, women have said they would not conceive and then had babies anyway. How they survived is not clear \u2014 some combination of luck and good care by their local doctors seems to be the best guess.After Dr. Tandan left, Elina said she had hoped to have a child and, \u201cuntil a few minutes ago,\u201d to marry her boyfriend. But he would leave her, she said, if she could not have children.At another screening site, Dr. Patrick Hohl, a cardiologist from Portland, Me., examined Innocent Nsabimana, 16, a quiet boy with a shy smile. His face, legs and chest had swelled, his eyes had turned yellow, he had developed a cough and could no longer ride his bike. Sick for a year, Innocent was taking five heart medications. He tried to hide his illness from friends, fearing they would reject him.Two of his heart valves turned out to be severely damaged. And his liver was slightly enlarged \u2014 a warning sign, because the liver helps control blood-clotting, and liver trouble increases the risk of hemorrhage during surgery. Rwanda does not have an extensive supply of blood for transfusions.Even so, Dr. Hohl thought Innocent was a good candidate.\u201cI\u2019ll advocate heavily for him,\u201d he told Innocent\u2019s uncle, Tuyisenge Chan Kamoso, 30, a graphic designer.Turning to Innocent, Dr. Hohl said: \u201cIt\u2019s a big surgery, but our hope would be that you\u2019d get much better. Your breathing would improve, you\u2019d get your appetite back. We have to review your case with our head surgeons. What do you think about all this?\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Innocent said.Later, Dr. Hohl told the team: \u201cThis is the window. It\u2019s closing. If he lives till next year, it might be too late.\u201dOnce the screening was completed, the team of about 60 people gathered in a hospital classroom to select those who would get the surgery. They had 39 good candidates \u2014 for 16 spots.In the first row were the cardiologists, nurses and sonographers who had examined the patients and drawn up a spreadsheet, with the best cases first.In the second row were Dr. Bolman, three other heart surgeons, and several cardiologists and anesthesiologists. The surgeons would ultimately say yes or no, after viewing PowerPoint data on each patient and clips from the echocardiogram. The setup resembled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d \u2014 except that these choices would mean life or death.The group agonized over some patients, particularly Gaudence, a 14-year-old girl who weighed just 66 pounds \u2014 barely big enough for the available valves. She was high-risk, but Dr. Come, Ms. Riley and Julie Carragher, a cardiology nurse practitioner, made a special appeal.Eyeing her test results, Dr. Bruce Leavitt, a surgeon from the University of Vermont, said, \u201cShe seems very on the verge of being too ill for what we do here.\u201dThey moved on to others. Innocent was chosen. Dr. Tandan urged his colleagues to consider Elina, whose name was much farther down the list.By the time they got to her, all 16 slots were filled. \u201cI think she needs to be on the list,\u201d Dr. Bolman said. \u201cI think she\u2019s sicker than we thought.\u201dCoughing up blood indicated advanced disease; Elina might not be able to wait a year, he cautioned.Another patient was made an alternate, giving Elina one of the last slots.The meeting ended on a mix of emotions: relief and happiness for patients who made the list; anguish and frustration for the rest.\u201cI\u2019m sad,\u201d Dr. Mucumbitsi said about a patient who was rejected.\u201cLast year he wasn\u2019t sick enough,\u201d Dr. Mucumbitsi said. \u201cThis year he\u2019s too sick. That\u2019s not fair. I always say that when they come, they should start with the patients they left behind. You cannot operate only on simple cases.\u201dUltimately, the surgeons said no. She was too ill.Later that day, she sat with a young girl who was accepted for surgery, reading a booklet about the operation.Gaudence would be one of the patients sent home with some medicines.Months earlier, Elina\u2019s sister Charlotte, a security guard in Kigali, had moved her from the countryside to the city to get her medical help.They shared Charlotte\u2019s home \u2014 one room, eight feet by eight feet, with rough concrete walls, a tin roof and a dirt floor. It was crammed into a warren of dwellings on the side of a hill, down a steep flight of uneven stone steps from the road. The sisters slept together in a bed that took up most of the room. They cooked outside, and shared an outdoor water faucet and toilets with neighbors.Three days after Elina\u2019s screening, as I was interviewing them at home, Charlotte\u2019s phone rang. Elina\u2019s operation was being moved up, because another patient had become too ill for surgery. Elina threw some things into a bag, and she, Charlotte, the photographer, our driver, translator and I all squeezed into the car hired by The New York Times and sped off to the hospital.There, Elina waded through a seemingly endless admission process. Doctors had gone home. The X-ray department was closed. A clerk forgot to order a test. A form was missing. The admitting nurses were busy. Go here, go there, go back again. Wait.After almost four hours of dragging herself around the hospital \u2014 barely able to catch her breath \u2014 Elina joined three other Team Heart patients in a room. She changed into a pair of blue hospital pajamas and sank into bed.The next day, Elina was worse \u2014 feverish and teary, her heart racing. During the night, she\u2019d had trouble breathing and began coughing up blood. At the same time she\u2019d begun gasping for air, the patient whose place she took, Emmanuel, 22, was dying in the ward next door. The nurses were spread thin. The mother of another patient, seeing Elina\u2019s distress, had summoned them and called Charlotte back to the hospital.Dr. Tandan said Elina might now be too sick for surgery. The fever could signal an infection. Worse, she had missed a week\u2019s worth of her heart medications, which had run out ahead of her scheduled hospital appointment.For someone with heart failure, skipping just a pill or two can bring on a crisis. Elina had gained six pounds of fluid, which was backing up into her lungs. The team poured medications into her, but knew they might have to scratch her off the list.One surgeon who joined Team Heart for the first time, Dr. Thoralf M. Sundt III, the chief of cardiac surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, had concerns about the program. \u201cIt raises more questions than it answers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can create problems for governments. We create a pool of patients with big needs. Is this sustainable?\u201dBut Dr. Sundt also acknowledged that with Team Heart\u2019s program, \u201cLives are saved.\u201dAfter three days of treatment with drugs to stabilize her heart and dry out her lungs, Elina was wheeled into the operating room.She had requested Christian music, so \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d played softly on one of the doctor\u2019s phones.Dr. Bolman, not scheduled to operate, had scrubbed in anyway, to help speed the surgery and minimize her time under anesthesia.\u201cThe key on this lady is a short operation,\u201d Dr. Leavitt said.Once Elina was unconscious, Dr. Muehlschlegel said: \u201cShe\u2019s teetering. She\u2019s not in a good state. There\u2019s a fine line between too risky and nick of time.\u201dHe and the surgeons watched her heartbeat on an echocardiogram monitor. Her diseased mitral valve was limiting the flow of blood to her left ventricle, which is normally the heart\u2019s biggest, strongest pumping chamber. As a result, it had shrunk, and the chamber above it \u2014 the left atrium \u2014 had become massive. The right side of her heart was also abnormally large. But her left ventricle was pumping well \u2014 a good sign.The surgeons cut open her chest, sawed through her breastbone and cranked open her rib cage with a retractor.\u201cHer heart is huge,\u201d one said.The next step required diverting Elina\u2019s circulation through a heart-lung machine, which would pump and oxygenate her blood, so that the surgeons could stop her heart, slice it open, cut out the diseased mitral valve and sew in a mechanical one.Minutes later, Dr. Leavitt had sewn in a new, mechanical valve. On the echocardiogram, it opened and closed briskly, letting the blood flow freely.\u201cWe love to see that,\u201d Dr. Bolman said.The doctors predicted a rocky recovery. Elina regained strength slowly, needed oxygen for nearly a week, longer than most patients, and appeared pained and discouraged. Two weeks after surgery, she went home with Charlotte.But the real test of the surgery, and of the very idea of providing it in a place like Rwanda, comes months down the road. Are patients better than they were before the operation? Can they live independently, work, go to school, enjoy life?Five months after her surgery, Elina said in an interview: \u201cI\u2019m happier and healthier. I\u2019m now enjoying the life that I almost missed.\u201d A few months ago, she and Charlotte returned to their home village for a feast with family and friends, to celebrate Elina\u2019s \u201cregaining of life,\u201d Charlotte said. And they\u2019ve moved to a larger home in Kigali, with two rooms.Elina now has a job in Kigali from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., at the company where Charlotte works. She cleans the office and makes tea and coffee for the staff. She hopes to gain experience and move on to better jobs, to help Charlotte and their mother.Innocent has been less fortunate. He returned to school shortly after the surgery, earned high grades and even resumed playing soccer. But he spent much of August in the hospital, with fever and chest pains \u2014 and no clear diagnosis. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d his uncle said.Florence\u2019s health has continued to decline.The Bolmans said it was always their intention not just to fly in once a year, but also to train Rwandan doctors and nurses, and ultimately to build a cardiac hospital.\u201cWe envision putting ourselves out of business,\u201d Ms. Patton-Bolman said.\u201cWe thought that in seven to 10 years, we\u2019d have a hospital staffed by Rwandans, and we\u2019d turn the keys over,\u201d Dr. Bolman said. \u201cWe thought we could start a prevention project in a few years. But it\u2019s more like a generation.\u201dHe estimated that it would cost $10 million to build a hospital and $10 million a year to run it.Rwanda\u2019s minister of health, Dr. Diane Gashumba, said in an interview that rheumatic heart disease was a real concern of the government and that programs to treat strep throat and rheumatic fever were essential.But for advanced cases, \u201csurgery is the solution,\u201d she said. \u201cWe definitely need this center.\u201dThe team has lined up prospective donors. But despite years of discussion, the government has not been able to commit to paying for patient care.In recent months, the Bolmans have reined in their ambitions. Instead of building a new hospital, they now hope to create a cardiac center at the King Faisal Hospital, which is owned by an Angola-based company, Oshen.The center could perform all types of heart surgery, not just valve replacement, on about 100 adults and 30 to 50 children a year, Dr. Bolman said. The government would cover the poorest patients, and the profit from insured or paying patients would subsidize those who did not quality for government help but still could not pay, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re scaling back, but not giving up,\u201d Dr. Bolman said. \u201cWe\u2019re very excited.\u201dThe team expects to make its annual surgery trip next year.Hyppolite Ntigurirwa contributed reporting from Kigali, Rwanda to this article.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Great Recession Knocked Them Down. Only Some Got Up Again.", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrisis and ConsequencesRecession stories tend to begin the same way: lost job, lost home, lost savings. How they end varies much more widely.New York Times reporters interviewed hundreds of people during the Great Recession, many of them in the midst of their darkest days. We spoke with five of them again.In recent weeks, we returned to them to find out what happened next. A few have thrived, overcoming the recession or even using it as a springboard to success. Some were able to find their footing, but could not make up all the ground they had lost.For others, the recession was the moment when it all fell apart. Many seemed to disappear entirely, leaving a trail of disconnected phones, outdated addresses and abandoned Facebook profiles.The individuals we spoke with come from different backgrounds, industries and parts of the country. But for all of them, there were specific moments \u2014 right or wrong decisions, bits of good luck or misfortune \u2014 that determined where they are today.Here are five of their stories.Dante Whitfield has come a long way in nine years.\u201cI remember some nights being so hungry that you\u2019re eating ketchup or mustard out of the containers,\u201d Mr. Whitfield, 44, said today. Now he is a real estate agent in Tacoma, Wash., developing clients, building up his savings and, for the first time in more than a decade, planning for the future.\u201cI\u2019m feeling more financially secure than I have in probably 20 years,\u201d he said.Mr. Whitfield took a winding path to his newfound security. He moved to California in 1999, just in time to ride the dot-com roller coaster. He was single and in his mid-20s, and soon he was working at a communications company in Silicon Valley, earning $60,000 as an executive assistant.Even the bursting of the tech bubble proved only a minor setback. Mr. Whitfield quickly found a job in San Diego, then eventually found his way back to San Francisco when the economy recovered. Saving, he said, was never on his mind.\u201cI just took it for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cI was once again making big-time money, and I thought it was going to stay that way.\u201dIt didn\u2019t. Mr. Whitfield was laid off again in 2007, and this time there was no quick recovery. For the next two years, he was mostly unemployed, and even when he eventually found work, he was barely scraping by. At one point he worked three jobs that together paid just $500 a week. He battled depression.Eventually, however, Mr. Whitfield found his way to Tacoma, where his girlfriend encouraged him to follow a longtime dream of getting into the real estate business. He got his broker\u2019s license in January and quickly built a client base. Mr. Whitfield said he is about to close his seventh deal since March, for a total of $1.6 million in sales.\u201cThese other Realtors don\u2019t know what being starving is, what being homeless is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives me an advantage.\u201dOn his feet again, Mr. Whitfield is sticking to a budget and making backup plans in case the real estate market softens.\u201cI\u2019ve learned my lesson,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have our dry spells.\u201dPlan B turned out well for Jason Martin.\u201cMy original intention was to get a job,\u201d Mr. Martin said when The Times interviewed him in 2009. \u201cBut with the economy, there\u2019s so many people who just graduated who can\u2019t even get a cup of coffee with a prospective employer.\u201d He added, \u201cGraduate school is definitely Plan B.\u201dMr. Martin enrolled in a master\u2019s program in sport leadership at Virginia Commonwealth University. His parents paid most of his in-state tuition, and a small scholarship covered the rest. Grad school, he said, became a critical steppingstone to getting into a one-year professional development program at Disney\u2019s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex in Orlando, Fla.Mr. Martin is glad about the one-year detour he took in 2009. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I needed to get some more seasoning. Four years of college wasn\u2019t really enough to prepare myself for the job market.\u201d\u201cHad I not gone, I\u2019m not sure where I\u2019d be,\u201d he added. \u201cI still think I\u2019d be successful, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have responsibilities I have today.\u201cTerri Sadler could have been retired by now.Back in the 1990s, Ms. Sadler worked on the factory floor at a 3M plant in Indiana. It was a good job with benefits and a pension plan that would have let her retire at 55. But Ms. Sadler, then in her early 30s, quit the job on a whim, convinced she could find something better. She never could.\u201cI got really mad and walked out, and I think that was the beginning of the downturn,\u201d she said. \u201cI never had that feeling of security that I had at that job.\u201dStill, Ms. Sadler muddled through. She found other factory jobs, including one in the auto industry in the mid-2000s that paid her as much as $18 an hour.Ms. Sadler, of Richmond, Ky., has worked on and off the past eight years, but none of the jobs have paid much or lasted long. Her current job, as a receptionist at a car dealership, pays far less than her old factory jobs and requires a 50-mile commute. Even so, she worries it will disappear when her probationary period ends in September. She dreads trying to find another job at age 60.Ms. Sadler said she tries to remain upbeat, but it has gotten harder. Her car seems to break down every time she manages to save some money, she said. She once dreamed of traveling the country in retirement; now she doubts she will be able to retire at all.\u201cI would like to go on that vacation, I would like to have this Jeep paid off, I would like to do something for my grandkids, but I just can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not get to live the American dream, and it\u2019s too late.\u201dWhen Meg Fisher lost her job in early 2009, it didn\u2019t feel like a turning point, at least not at first.Ms. Fisher, a legal secretary, had been laid off before and had always found work quickly. Even in the middle of the recession, she thought her college degree, two decades of experience and strong professional network would help her rebound again.\u201cI probably will never be officially full-time employed ever again,\u201d said Ms. Fisher, now 56.The layoff eliminated more than half her family\u2019s income, which once topped $80,000 per year. Ms. Fisher\u2019s husband had a job as a manager of a local pharmacy, but by the end of 2009, the family was forced to file for bankruptcy. Three years later, the Fishers lost their suburban Atlanta home to foreclosure.In their worst months, they turned to a food pantry for groceries. They took on boarders \u2014 one of whom, they later learned, did heroin while their daughter slept in the next room. Ms. Fisher\u2019s greatest regret, she said, is the effect the family\u2019s hardship has had on her two children, who were in elementary school when she lost her job.\u201cThey don\u2019t remember life when we used to go out to eat whenever we wanted to, or buy stuff that they wanted,\u201d Ms. Fisher said.Eventually, the Fishers found a measure of stability. Ms. Fisher started a business making custom Jewish prayer shawls, and a mortgage broker she met through a networking group hired her to do administrative work on the side. The family has caught a few breaks, too. A friend helped them buy a house after their foreclosure, and they received a small inheritance from an aunt this year, which helped them pay down medical debt.But the scars of the recession have never fully healed. Ms. Fisher earns a fraction of her former salary, and the couple, who live in Marietta, Ga., have practically no retirement savings. Once the Fishers\u2019 son graduates from high school, they are considering moving to a cabin in the mountains to save money.Government statisticians consider any work for pay \u2014 even informal, part-time work like Ms. Fisher\u2019s \u2014 as \u201cemployment.\u201d But she said she doesn\u2019t feel like a part of the traditional work force.\u201cI believe the reports that unemployment is at a record low, but people like me are not included in that,\u201d Ms. Fisher said. \u201cWe\u2019ll never be back to where we were.\u201dIt took nearly a decade, but Guillermo Gonzalez is a homeowner again.In June 2017, Mr. Gonzalez and his wife closed on a $129,000 two-bedroom house in Spring Hill, Fla., north of Tampa. It has a pool and a yard where their grandchildren can play. Most important, they can afford it.\u201cIt\u2019s not a brand, brand-spanking new house, but it\u2019s very comfortable,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good house.\u201dMr. Gonzalez\u2019s recession story is a typical one: In 2004, he and his wife bought a house outside Miami with little money down, counting on the ability to refinance to help them make their payments. They borrowed money to fund a lifestyle that, while never lavish, was more than they could afford on his salary working in sales for a liquor distributor.But when Florida\u2019s housing market collapsed, the Gonzalezes couldn\u2019t refinance. The cooling economy ate into liquor sales, cutting Mr. Gonzalez\u2019s commissions and leaving him unable to make his monthly payments.Mr. Gonzalez bristled at being a renter, paying $1,800 a month to live in a complex \u201cwhere you couldn\u2019t barbecue, where you couldn\u2019t wash your car, where you couldn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d His sister, who had lost her job selling real estate, moved in for a while.But gradually, things began to improve. Mr. Gonzalez got a job selling auto parts. He worked to rebuild his credit. By last year, he and his wife were ready to buy again \u2014 this time in the Tampa area, where homes are cheaper and they can be closer to their children.They are being cautious. Once, he said, he would have paid someone to rip out the run-down front lawn. This time, he did the work himself.\u201cMy grass is the greenest in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always taken a lot of pride.\u201dBut Mr. Gonzalez, 54, has little in the way of savings and no plans for retirement. His wife stopped working when they moved to Tampa so she could help with the grandchildren, but she is now looking for work to help cover some medical expenses that are coming up.\u201cWe\u2019re doing it one step at a time,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Balloon of London Mayor in a Bikini Flies Near Parliament", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 In the annals of British political protest, the giant balloon is the current weapon of choice.On Saturday morning, a Briton who says the mayor, Sadiq Khan, is not doing enough to fight crime returned the favor and launched a giant balloon of Mr. Khan near Westminster.A small crowd cheered and shouted, \u201cHigher! Higher!\u201d as the balloon took to the sky, wobbling as if buffeted by a breeze. It depicted a scowling Mr. Khan lying on his side, one hand behind his head, wearing a yellow bikini.The mayor brushed aside the planned balloon launch in a segment on ITV London on Thursday, saying: \u201cIf people want to spend their Saturday looking at me in a yellow bikini, they\u2019re welcome to do so. I don\u2019t really think yellow\u2019s my color though.\u201dBy Saturday, the crowdfunding page had raised more than 59,000 pounds, over $76,000, for Mr. Bruere\u2019s \u201cMake London Safe Again\u201d campaign. The slogan echoes the Trump presidential campaign slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201dThose behind the balloon campaign seem to be tickled by the fact that any inflatable depicting Mr. Khan would have to be approved by the mayor\u2019s office to fly near Parliament. On the crowdfunding page, it reads: \u201cIn light of the Donald Trump \u2018Baby Trump\u2019 balloon being allowed to fly over London during his visit to the U.K., let\u2019s get a \u2018baby Khan\u2019 one and see if FREE SPEECH applies to all and whether or not Mr. Khan and the London Assembly will also approve this.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Brett Kavanaugh Withdraw? ", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conversationThe political interest of the country might be better served with a nominee who didn\u2019t have to be confirmed under a cloud of suspicion. Mr. Bruni and Mr. Douthat are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.We were mostly right about the hearings, but surely we should have anticipated that the Author of our crazy national melodrama had another narrative trick to play. And now we have it: Brett Kavanaugh, just a few days before what was to be his confirmation vote, stands accused of committing sexual assault as a drunken teenager. How are you processing this?Minutes later, a hugely respected, supersmart male political strategist I know \u2014 a Republican, white \u2014 shared his suspicions about the \u201c11th-hour\u201d timing of this latest development, telling me: \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s impossible to prove and impossible to defend against, so this invariably devolves into a tribal death match with the accused having a permanently damaged reputation even if confirmed by the Senate.\u201dRegarding women: The context for the way this plays out is fascinating. Women voters will probably decide who has the House and Senate majorities after Nov. 6, and both parties are acutely cognizant of that right now. Also, women voters are not so hot on one Donald J. Trump. (I can hear him bellowing \u201cFake news!\u201d already.)Ross, do you know how many women are in the Senate and will get to vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation \u2014 if it comes to a vote \u2014 versus how many got to vote on Clarence Thomas\u2019s more than a quarter century ago?Also, could this be when Jeff Flake or Bob Corker or both take the revenge against Trump that they go to bed each night so richly and rightly fantasizing about?But back to the confrontation ahead of us. Frank, you mentioned Thomas and Hill. Is this just the #MeToo replay?(Even though there is, yes, the possibility that something happened and he was drunk enough that he doesn\u2019t remember it at all.)I wish I could say the same about Donald Trump Jr., who has proved over time that he is wholly worthy of the name he inherited. We can integrate his weekend Instagram post about this into our Conversation, can\u2019t we? Let\u2019s. Here it is. Please react. But the other question, alongside what Collins and Murkowski decide to do, is how this plays in public opinion \u2014 which, after months of stability, was turning more against Trump even before this story broke, knocking his approval downward from its mid-40s ceiling. Do you have a theory of that pre-existing slide?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Female Athletes Face Crazy Expectations. They Can Be Overcome. ", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "OpinionWe still hear that to win or be worthy, we must be thin \u2014 and don\u2019t dare bring up your period. But trying to fit this projected image has serious consequences. Supported byMs. Carey is a freelance writer and running coach based in Seattle. I clung tightly to a cultural narrative \u2014 be thin, be fast \u2014 because it seemed simple. It clear-cut an apparent path to success through the messy thicket of my life.But Fairchild questioned it. She addressed high school girls and camp staff and asked, \u201cWhat makes you happy?\u201dThe answer, I\u2019ve discovered, is Fairchild\u2019s secret sauce. It is neither how an athlete\u2019s body looks nor sky-high expectations, but what she calls the fire in the athlete\u2019s belly. With that, she and others redefine success.At 17, Fairchild was called the best female high school runner in United States history. She\u2019d won back-to-back national cross-country championships, setting a course record that still stands. The first American girl to break 10 minutes for the two-mile race, she ran 9:55 on a flat indoor track. In 1991, she earned a bronze medal at the World Cross Country Championships in Belgium.But as she stood on the podium at the world championships, a feeling of failure sank into a pit in her stomach. She wanted to live up to the pressure, to be the best. Fairchild was reportedly on a perfect trajectory without pause from youth domination to Olympic medals. With a singular focus on her prepubescent body, stories emphasized her weight and height, calling her a nymph and waiflike.We still hear that to win or be worthy, we must be thin. In this niche, society writ large reverberates, too, telling us: Be perfect, be beautiful, be feminine.And don\u2019t dare bring up your period.Trying to fit this projected image has serious consequences. Girls, in particular, face undue stress around puberty, when body size, hormones and muscle strength change. An estimated 13 percent to 41 percent of adolescent female athletes exhibit disordered eating. Such inadequate fueling unleashes RED-S, a web of metabolic, endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and additional complications.Scientific research focused on female athletes lags behind that of men. Many studies fail to provide a thorough understanding of female physiology. Yet pivotal research emerges.Dr. Stacy Sims, fellow at the University of Waikato in New Zealand and author of \u201cRoar,\u201d said that understanding a female athlete\u2019s hormone cycles and tailoring training accordingly can actually make training more effective. \u201cWe need to look at women and girls as women and girls, working with their unique physiological changes to harness the performance potential,\u201d Dr. Sims said. \u201cHow awesome would it be if every coach and every support person could talk to a girl about having a period without causing red flags?\u201dDespite the persistence of an archaic paradigm, a new narrative is brewing. It says puberty is no cruel twist.Yes, you can compete and compete well while on your period. No, uteruses don\u2019t fall out after a hard race. Yes, it\u2019s normal for girls (and advantageous for athletes) to change and grow during puberty. Yes, women with more internal body fat than men are exceptional athletes who set records, break barriers and persist through peaks and valleys.Take, for example, Jordan Hasay, who won the Foot Locker national cross-country championship as a high school freshman and logged the second-fastest marathon time by an American woman with a 2:20.57 last year. And Joan Benoit Samuelson, the gold medalist of the first women\u2019s marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics, who continues to set age-based world records in the marathon. (She ran 2:47 at 53.) \u201cI had a vision for myself,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cI wanted to come full circle. I had to come to grips with people saying, \u2018Sorry you didn\u2019t make it.\u2019 I had this perspective \u2014 every step I took was to teach me.

{"Headline": "Get in Bed With Skynet", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobot furniture is happening. This is the single greatest thing to happen to humanity ever, the robots told us to say.Yes. The answer, of course, is robots.Inside a model studio apartment at the Eugene, an 844-unit building on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, sits a blocky, Swiss Army-knife-like unit that looks a little like two-sided armoire with lots of compartments. It\u2019s called Ori. Ori runs on a track and can be activated by voice command (\u201cAlexa, have Ori make my bed!\u201d) or by the touch of a square black button or a smartphone app. The furniture glides in and out of the living space. In a marketing video, jaunty indie pop plays in the background as a desk retracts into the Ori to create enough space for a woman to unfurl a yoga mat. Later, a man lies on a couch as a table with a glass of white wine moves to his meet his hand. Earlier this summer, he gave me a tour of his engineering lab in San Francisco\u2019s Dogpatch neighborhood. Drawing on a white board with a purple marker, he showed me what he hopes the future of home floor plans will look like, with a two-sided map of both the floor and the ceiling. In his version, most of the furniture was laid out on the ceiling side. \u201cThe floor is now free,\u201d he said. (Bumblebee\u2019s promotional videos also highlight the clear-floor-space potential for home yoga.)He and his engineers had set up a model room, a cube-like space with green screen walls. A queen-size Tuft & Needle mattress was suspended from the ceiling by four white seatbelt-like hoists. Mr. Murthy pulled out an iPad and showed me how to move it up and down. The bed moved fairly slowly, lights blinking around it as it rose and dropped. The white storage boxes dropped down more rapidly. The whole thing had the feel of a futuristic garage, with tracks, sleek white hoists and sensors that would pause the system if anyone ran underneath.After running the bed up and down a couple times, I asked if I could test out the optional inventory feature, which uses tiny cameras pointed downward into the storage boxes. (Having so many cameras right next to one\u2019s bed might make any reasonably skeptical person wary; Mr. Murthy insisted that they couldn\u2019t capture sound or anything outside their field of view.) The only items I had with me were a phone, reporter\u2019s notebook and a pen, so I dropped the notebook into the box. A few seconds later, on Mr. Murthy\u2019s iPad, it registered as pad of lined paper. Of course, people have long been looking for ways to save space and money on furniture. Nearly 120 years ago, William Murphy, a San Francisco man living in a one-room apartment, patented the Murphy bed, which remains a small-space staple today. It\u2019s basically a bed on a hinge that you can fold into a wall cabinet \u2014 and the setup for countless silent-film physical comedy bits.Founded in the 1940s, Ikea soon made trendy, modern furniture cheap, by flat packing it and telling customers to put it together it themselves. The Swedish company made major U.S. inroads starting in the 90s, when its hallmark pictorial directions and tiny assembly tools were the setup for countless couple and roommate arguments.More recently, it\u2019s possible to get a nice, relatively inexpensive mattress rolled up, boxed and shipped to you in two to five business days after ordering it online, thanks to companies like Casper and Tuft & Needle. Appliances like ovens and refrigerators now come with Wi-Fi-enabled options that allow you to start roasting a turkey while you\u2019re still at the office or, if you\u2019re so inclined, check Facebook from your fridge door.But household furniture is one of the few categories that has yet to be meaningfully upended by technology. Many people live with the same basic forms of chairs, tables or beds that our parents and grandparents did. If modern life means we can summon a car or a meal via smartphone at any time of day, shouldn\u2019t we be able to rearrange our homes in kind of the same way?Hasier Larrea, the founder and C.E.O. of Ori, said he wondered what would happen \u201cif you could bring the power of robotics into interior spaces,\u201d and move furniture around a room \u201clike apps on an iPhone.\u201d Along with his co-founders at M.I.T. and designer Yves Behar, Mr. Larrea came up with Ori, short for Origami. He said the company will soon launch movable walls that can open and close off rooms, as well as furniture that will deploy from the ceiling.\u201cOn the one hand you have mass urbanization and the challenges that brings, to affordability of housing,\u201d said Mr. Larrea. \u201cAnd then on the other hand, you have all these trends toward the internet of the things. These two trends are going to converge.\u201dChris Gerrick, a Seattle-based architect with Olson Kundig, said he\u2019s been talking to a few clients about how to design homes that keep the possibility of robotic furniture in mind. \u201cI think spatially, it\u2019s a really interesting idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBack in the day it was mechanical tech driving the technology, like with Murphy beds. Now it\u2019s digital.\u201dMr. Murthy\u2019s Bumblebee is one of the systems Mr. Gerrick has been working with. \u201cHousing is at such a premium and yet everyone is doing it the same,\u201d said Mr. Murthy.Neither Bumblebee nor Ori\u2019s robotic furnishings are available to consumers directly, though developers and landlords can buy them and renters in certain cities can try them out. Bumblebee Spaces have been set up in a handful of apartment buildings in Seattle and San Francisco, including a new Starcity co-living space in San Francisco\u2019s South Beach neighborhood. (Typically, renters will pay a monthly premium that\u2019s slightly more than what they\u2019d pay for a non robotically-furnished apartment.)\u201cIt\u2019s very clear to me we\u2019re stuck in a centuries-old model for building a major consumer product,\u201d said Jon Dishotsky, the C.E.O. of Starcity. Founded in 2016, the company operates co-living spaces in Los Angeles and San Francisco targeted at young professionals who rent bedrooms, grown-up dorm-style, with weekly house dinners and other group events. \u201cWe\u2019d love to see if this can really scale to hundreds of thousands of units.\u201dOf course, there\u2019s probably a reason we haven\u2019t yet let robots take over our home furnishings. What if there\u2019s a power outage? Do you have to sleep on your yoga mat? Mr. Larrea said Ori furniture is light enough to move manually if necessary. Mr. Murthy said Bumblebee recommends a backup power generator or offers an optional upgrade with enough built-in power to run the system a handful of times in the case of an outage.Bumblebee\u2019s premise that much of your daily life will unfold beneath at least 260 pounds of furniture suspended overhead also prompts some questions about its safety. Mr. Murthy said he\u2019s spent years testing the product, first in his own home and then in the lab, and that it is designed with numerous safety sensors. The units comply with existing building codes that allow for overhead plumbing, lighting fixtures and electrical wiring, according to Mr. Murthy. (Bumblebee won\u2019t work in every building \u2014 ceilings need to be at least eight feet high, ideally nine or ten.)Even the most gung-ho developers say they are approaching robotic furniture with caution. Ms. Masi said Brookfield is retrofitting existing units to work with Ori, testing it in various layouts. But they might start building with it in mind in the near future. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of curiosity like, \u2018wow, this would be a game changer,\u2019\u201d she said.Andrew Freedman recently moved to San Francisco for a job as a government consultant on implementing legalized marijuana. He\u2019s paying $2,600 a month to live in Starcity\u2019s Bumblebee apartment, a spacious white bedroom in a renovated Victorian with high ceilings, a bay window and a bed that deploys from the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to explain it to people and it takes awhile, so I show them the YouTube video,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have tons of questions.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nietzsche Made Me Do It", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEWhat was I trying to escape by making this dangerous trek? For a very long time, I considered myself a Hyperborean.In Greek mythology, the Hyperboreans are giants who live \u201cbeyond the north wind,\u201d high in unforgiving mountains, perfectly happy in seemingly unbearable conditions. The Greek poet Pindar said that \u201cneither disease nor bitter old age is mixed in their sacred blood.\u201dI thought of this as I found myself perched on a granite escarpment at 8,000 feet, overlooking the Val Fex on the border between Switzerland and Italy. A Hyperborean wouldn\u2019t be scared senseless up here, or worried about getting down. But I was. At the mouth of the valley lay Sils Maria, the one-time summer home of Friedrich Nietzsche. I had spent days trailing the spirit of the philosopher through these mountains. Clearly, he was responsible for this imminent disaster. I looked down at my beat-up New Balance 990s. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to wear something a little more \u2018technical\u2019 on your hike?\u201d my wife had suggested before I\u2019d left. No, of course not. Running shoes would be fine. I would be fine. I was a Hyperborean.This conviction was surely what led me off the trail four hours earlier, when I went scrambling up the monochromatic green slab that the Swiss call a foothill. Eventually the greenery gave way to granite and led me to the overlook, which was undoubtedly going to be the most beautiful place I\u2019d ever see. I dug around in my daypack and found the pr\u00e9cis to Nietzsche\u2019s mature philosophy, \u201cThe Antichrist,\u201d published in 1898, years after he supposedly went insane.My family was down there somewhere \u2014 maybe five miles away. It felt much farther. This is an advantage of hiking, of walking away more generally: It can create what Nietzsche called the \u201cpathos of distance.\u201d This sense of being higher, of looking down, gives rise to the \u201ccraving for ever new widening of distances within the soul itself \u2026 the development of ever higher, rarer, more remote, further stretching, more comprehensive states.\u201d This impulse to strive was at the core of Nietzsche\u2019s perfectionism. \u201cWe are Hyperboreans,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe know well enough how remote our place is.\u201dI pitched a small stone over the edge. One. Two. Three. Almost four seconds before it exploded on the rocks below. About 300 feet. I often tell my 6-year-old daughter that having courage doesn\u2019t mean that you aren\u2019t scared. It means that you do it anyway. What I don\u2019t tell her is that courage can eventually get you stuck.I\u2019ve hiked the backcountry many times in my 38 years, but I\u2019m still not any good at it. I\u2019m frightened every time I set out. When I was 19, on my first trip to the Val Fex, I tried to walk from Spl\u00fcgen to St. Moritz, over the Piz Platta at 13,000 feet, in running shoes not unlike these. I thought that if I went in a straight line, skipping all those seemingly unnecessary switchbacks, it would be only 25 miles. I could do this. I left the trail in the early morning. Fifteen hours later, I stopped; I had traveled roughly eight miles, quite far enough to be terrified. The next morning, after a frost-nipped night on an unmarked ledge, I turned back. I got lost and it took me two more days to return to Spl\u00fcgen.The backcountry is an ideal place for Nietzsche\u2019s hard questions: What am I trying to escape by making this dangerous trek? What is the point of this risk? Am I really, precisely, this alone? I\u2019ve found that the disruptions of going \u201coff-road\u201d brings them into sharper focus. Am I going to die? It\u2019s only a matter of time. The valley below me lit up with late-afternoon light. It began to rain. I know there are far more treacherous and heroic climbs: Everest, Mont Blanc, Kilimanjaro. I also know there are writers who spend not hours but months or years on the trail of self-realization: Cheryl Strayed\u2019s \u201cWild\u201d and Peter Matthiessen\u2019s \u201cThe Snow Leopard\u201d spring from such journeys. When I first read these books, I thought the point of arduous walking was to find yourself. And in a certain sense, it is. As Nietzsche says in \u201cThe Gay Science\u201d: \u201cWhat does your conscience say? You should become who you are!\u201dWhat I discovered in the mountains, however, is that becoming who you are usually involves getting over who you think you are. In fact the \u201cwho\u201d\u2014 the idea of oneself \u2014 is probably an impediment to growth and honesty. Matthiessen never finds his snow leopard. Nietzsche wants us to be wanderers, \u201cthough not as a traveler to a final destination: for this destination does not exist.\u201d This is not to say that we can\u2019t set goals \u2014 quite the opposite. \u201cSet for yourself goals, high and noble goals,\u201d a young Nietzsche instructs, \u201cand perish in pursuit of them.\u201d If you arrive at a final destination, it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019ve set your sights too low, that your goal isn\u2019t high or noble enough. Hyperborea is not a place to come to rest.I\u2019d slither home if I had to, but I wanted to get home. I guess that was it. Maybe that was the whole point of this idiotic trip: I finally knew what I wanted, what I loved. Even the most objectionable parts of life seemed preferable, even lovely, compared with this. Nietzsche\u2019s most famous character, Zarathustra, shuttles up and down a mountain, between solitude at the top and companionship at the bottom. Maybe this is what he discovers on the way. Or maybe, in the mountains, he simply confronts what he essentially is \u2014 an animal that can be reduced to crawling on all fours, that is in the rapid process of dying. I got back in one piece. Slightly scraped, but no worse for wear. The next morning, I didn\u2019t hurry through breakfast. And I did not make a mad dash for the mountains.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sloan Kettering\u2019s Cozy Deal With Start-Up Ignites a New Uproar", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization.An artificial intelligence start-up founded by three insiders at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center debuted with great fanfare in February, with $25 million in venture capital and the promise that it might one day transform how cancer is diagnosed.Memorial Sloan Kettering holds an equity stake in Paige.AI, as does a member of the cancer center\u2019s executive board, the chairman of its pathology department and the head of one of its research laboratories. Three other board members are investors.At a staff meeting Thursday morning, Dr. Thompson and others, including Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, the acting physician-in-chief who replaced Dr. Baselga, described the recent events as a disruption and acknowledged that the hospital was under a microscope, according to several people who attended. Doctors said they were concerned about a lack of communication from hospital leadership, and one said patients were nervous that their health data was being commercialized by the institution.Hospital pathologists have strongly objected to the Paige.AI deal, saying it is unfair that the founders received equity stakes in a company that relies on the pathologists\u2019 expertise and work amassed over 60 years. They also questioned the use of patients\u2019 data \u2014 even if it is anonymous \u2014 without their knowledge in a profit-driven venture.In addition, experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance have questioned whether Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation\u2019s leading cancer centers, complied with federal and state law governing nonprofits when it set up the deal. The experts pointed out that charitable institutions like Memorial Sloan Kettering must show that they didn\u2019t provide assets to insiders for less than the fair market value.Cancer center officials said that they acted properly in approving the deal with Paige.AI and that if successful, the venture could change the future of cancer diagnosis. \u201cThis is an incredibly expensive undertaking \u2014 it needs a lot of money,\u201d Dr. Gregory Raskin, the hospital\u2019s vice president of technology development, said in an interview. \u201cWe feel this is a really valuable and important technology to get developed.\u201dOfficials said that some board members invested only after early efforts to generate interest from outside companies and investors had failed. But they acknowledged that they did not seek an independent valuation of the tissue archive, nor did they put the proposal out for competitive bidding before licensing it to a single company. In exchange for sharing its voluminous database, Memorial Sloan Kettering received ownership shares amounting to about nine percent in the company.\u201cIt just seems awfully coincidental that the individuals involved happen to be people in control and influence of that asset, and they ended up with an exclusive use of it,\u201d said Marcus S. Owens, a Washington lawyer who ran the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt organizations. \u201cIt seems to create a cascading series of conflicts for the operation of Sloan Kettering.\u201dThe decision to license images of the patients\u2019 tissue slides to a for-profit company also highlights the broader debate over the use of personal medical data, ranging from genetic information to, in this case, images of a person\u2019s cells, for research and commercial purposes.After ProPublica and The Times began asking questions about the arrangement, one of the founders \u2014 Dr. David Klimstra, the chairman of the pathology department \u2014 said he would divest his ownership stake.The Paige.AI project finally took off after enlisting the help of Norman Selby, a member of the hospital board\u2019s executive committee and a longtime health care consultant, manager and investor. He is listed as a founder and executive chairman of Paige.AI and holds an equity stake.The three other hospital board members who became investors are Stanley Druckenmiller, Alexander T. Robertson and Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis, according to Richard Beattie, honorary chairman of the cancer center\u2019s board and a member of its executive committee. \u201cWe were desperate,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis is more risky than most transactions, and we couldn\u2019t find investors.\u201dThe board investors in Paige.AI, and Mr. Breyer, either declined to comment or did not return calls and emails. Mr. Selby has pledged to donate some of his profits to the hospital, Mr. Beattie said.Experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance questioned whether Memorial Sloan Kettering, which is a charity, acted properly in what is known as a related party transaction with the founders of Paige.AI.While federal law does not specifically require seeking bids from competitors or independent appraisals of the assets in such a transaction, nonprofit groups that make deals with companies associated with board members or employees must demonstrate that they have taken steps to ensure that insiders don\u2019t get preferential treatment. If nonprofits are found not to have complied, they or the individuals involved could face tax repercussions.Mr. Beattie said the hospital relied on some investors to set a value for licensing the slides, with guidance from hedge fund leaders on its board. A law firm, which he did not identify, evaluated the documents and said it was a good deal.Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors who has written books about corporate governance, said the center\u2019s process was \u201cinadequate.\u201d\u201cThey could be throwing a dart at the wall to figure out what the valuation is,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re accepting somebody\u2019s word for it and that\u2019s very, very risky.\u201dMr. Beattie said the cancer center would follow I.R.S. rules requiring it to list the transaction on financial forms, which won\u2019t be public until next year. He also said the hospital had set up plans to manage conflicts for the three company founders. All four members who are invested, including Mr. Selby, must recuse themselves from any board actions about the company, Mr. Beattie said. A review of the hospital\u2019s I.R.S. filings does not show any similar transactions in recent years.In two meetings this month, staff pathologists confronted hospital leaders over the cancer center\u2019s relationship with Paige.AI, some of them angered by the deal that would allow others to profit from their work.At a tense meeting Sept. 12, some pathologists said they only learned about the deal online after it was announced, two people in attendance said.As for how the deal came about, Dr. Klimstra told colleagues that Google had twice approached the hospital about securing access to the pathology slides and was turned down. Mr. Beattie said there were never serious conversations with Google. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.Doctors also expressed concerns about whether patients had consented to have images of their tissue used in this way.Dr. Klimstra told them the project had been approved by an institutional review board, which considers ethical issues involving patients. Patients who had not given their consent to having their readings shared would have all personal health information stripped from the images and notes, he said. Dr. Raskin said that between 30 to 40 percent of patients typically do not consent.And Paige.AI will not have exclusive access to slides that resulted from federally funded research, he added.It then says, \u201c(contemplate consulting fees, repeat with feeling.)\u201dIn an interview last week, Dr. Rosenblum said he wasn\u2019t seeking financial compensation, but felt \u201cthe leadership had not been particularly transparent with us about the founding of this company, and I feel that we were not sufficiently credited with what had been our intellectual input in this.\u201dKathryn Martin, the hospital\u2019s chief operating officer, said the cancer center did not anticipate the pathologists\u2019 objections. \u201cI think we could have done a better job communicating it,\u201d she said in an interview.Dr. Klimstra said in a statement that the project represented a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in the pathology field.\u201cOther than my family, there is nothing more important to me than running my department,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cI sincerely regret the fact that my equity ownership in Paige has served as a distraction to my primary leadership role at M.S.K.\u201dDr. Fuchs, the head of the computational pathology lab, defended his role in a separate statement. \u201cComputer scientists like myself very seldom get the chance to really help patients,\u201d he said.Details for distributing any profits or proceeds from Paige.AI have not been worked out, officials said. Ms. Martin suggested that if the deal is successful, some funds could be set aside for the pathology department to finance research projects.For now, much of the talk is theoretical \u2014 the company is years away from selling a finished product, with a staff of fewer than 20 employees.The roster of other key advisers also appears to be in flux. Until recently, Dr. Baselga was listed as the chairman of Paige\u2019s scientific advisory board. But his name disappeared from the company\u2019s website last week, the day after he resigned from Memorial Sloan Kettering. He also recently resigned from board positions at the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a radiation equipment manufacturer.Charles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.

Racism Today Is as Bad as Ever.", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen we firefighters step into a life-threatening situation, we need to work as a team. Hate and discrimination within our ranks make that impossible. Mr. Stewart is a retired St. Louis firefighter. I\u2019ve served 35 years as a firefighter, and the racism today is as bad as I can remember. My organization, the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters, is monitoring or pursuing legal or administrative action on a dozen major cases of discrimination.I believe incidents like those I\u2019ve described here are underreported. In my experience, repercussions for reporting discrimination or harassment can be as career-damaging as the despicable actions that prompted an appeal for justice. Black firefighters who have taken a stand against unfair treatment report having been punished with increased harassment, social exclusion, reduced pay, transfers and demotions.Despite a rich history of black firefighting heroes that goes back to the beginnings of a professionalized service in the early 19th century, firefighting in this country is stained by a tradition of exclusion. Post-segregation, discrimination was reinforced through deep-rooted nepotism and cronyism. For those whose great-grandfather, grandfather and father weren\u2019t firefighters \u2014 and especially for applicants with the wrong color, gender or sexuality \u2014 training and testing became an impermeable barrier. Notoriously, white male recruits received special mentoring and reduced scrutiny by those in charge of hiring. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer than 8 percent of our nation\u2019s firefighters are African-Americans, and an even smaller percentage hold leadership positions. In that way, our nation\u2019s fire service is like many other industries that are still battling hate and bias, both subtle and in-your-face.What makes firefighting unusual is that as we\u2019re rolling out of the firehouse with sirens on \u2014 whether responding to a fire, drug overdose or car crash \u2014 we know that what we encounter may be the worst moment in someone\u2019s life. Our hearts are pounding, and we\u2019re aware that any call could be a one-way trip for us. Smoke inhalation, building collapse and backdraft are known risks and we accept them. But the hazards of bigotry within our ranks are an unacceptable burden. When we step into a life-threatening situation, we need to work as a team and know each one of us has the others\u2019 back.Unchecked hate and discrimination obliterate that essential trust.

{"Headline": "To Restore Civil Society, Start With the Library", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis crucial institution is being neglected just when we need it the most.Is the public library obsolete? A lot of powerful forces in society seem to think so. In recent years, declines in the circulation of bound books in some parts of the country have led prominent critics to argue that libraries are no longer serving their historical function. Countless elected officials insist that in the 21st century \u2014 when so many books are digitized, so much public culture exists online and so often people interact virtually \u2014 libraries no longer need the support they once commanded.Libraries are being disparaged and neglected at precisely the moment when they are most valued and necessary. Why the disconnect? In part it\u2019s because the founding principle of the public library \u2014 that all people deserve free, open access to our shared culture and heritage \u2014 is out of sync with the market logic that dominates our world. But it\u2019s also because so few influential people understand the expansive role that libraries play in modern communities. Libraries are an example of what I call \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d: the physical spaces and organizations that shape the way people interact. Libraries don\u2019t just provide free access to books and other cultural materials, they also offer things like companionship for older adults, de facto child care for busy parents, language instruction for immigrants and welcoming public spaces for the poor, the homeless and young people.I recently spent a year doing ethnographic research in libraries in New York City. Again and again, I was reminded how essential libraries are, not only for a neighborhood\u2019s vitality but also for helping to address all manner of personal problems.For older people, especially widows, widowers and those who live alone, libraries are places for culture and company, through book clubs, movie nights, sewing circles and classes in art, current events and computing. For many, the library is the main place they interact with people from other generations.For children and teenagers, libraries help instill an ethic of responsibility, to themselves and to their neighbors, by teaching them what it means to borrow and take care of something public, and to return it so others can have it too. For new parents, grandparents and caretakers who feel overwhelmed when watching an infant or a toddler by themselves, libraries are a godsend.In many neighborhoods, particularly those where young people aren\u2019t hyper-scheduled in formal after-school programs, libraries are highly popular among adolescents and teenagers who want to spend time with other people their age. One reason is that they\u2019re open, accessible and free. Another is that the library staff members welcome them; in many branches, they even assign areas for teenagers to be with one another.To appreciate why this matters, compare the social space of the library with the social space of commercial establishments like Starbucks or McDonald\u2019s. These are valuable parts of the social infrastructure, but not everyone can afford to frequent them, and not all paying customers are welcome to stay for long.This is not to say that libraries are always peaceful and serene. During the time I spent doing research, I witnessed a handful of heated disputes, physical altercations and other uncomfortable situations, sometimes involving people who appeared to be mentally ill or under the influence of drugs. But such problems are inevitable in a public institution that\u2019s dedicated to open access, especially when drug clinics, homeless shelters and food banks routinely turn away \u2014 and often refer to the library! \u2014 those who most need help. What\u2019s remarkable is how rarely these disruptions happen, how civilly they are managed and how quickly a library regains its rhythm afterward.The openness and diversity that flourish in neighborhood libraries were once a hallmark of urban culture. But that has changed. Though American cities are growing more ethnically, racially and culturally diverse, they too often remain divided and unequal, with some neighborhoods cutting themselves off from difference \u2014 sometimes intentionally, sometimes just by dint of rising costs \u2014 particularly when it comes to race and social class.Libraries are the kinds of places where people with different backgrounds, passions and interests can take part in a living democratic culture. They are the kinds of places where the public, private and philanthropic sectors can work together to reach for something higher than the bottom line. If we have any chance of rebuilding a better society, social infrastructure like the library is precisely what we need.

Patrons are prohibited from borrowing books and using computers once their overdue fees surpass $20, not $10.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Photographed What Hurricane Maria \u2018Couldn\u2019t Take Away\u2019 From His Family", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLensLike a good Puerto Rican grandmother, Amparo Negron had a warning for her grandson on his first trip back to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria devastated the island.Abuela was wrong. It could have been 1900. Gone was his great-grandfather\u2019s zinc and wood homestead in Villalba, it walls flattened like a hastily opened gift box. Gone, too, was his grandmother\u2019s house on the same parcel of land, where fronds from her favorite palm tree dangled through the shorn roof. No water. No power.But there was hope. In that melancholy landscape of long-ago childhood summers spent chasing roosters and exploring the hillsides, Mr. Alvarado realized he had a duty to his family, if not to the island and its diaspora, too.\u201cI felt it was my place for my family to document this for future generations, like my kids, so they can see the places I had the privilege of seeing, like the house my grandfather built in 1907,\u201d Mr. Alvarado, 29, said. \u201cBut I also wanted to photograph the things the storm couldn\u2019t take away, little things like making coffee in the morning or people taking their horses and farming. It was important to show that that was Puerto Rico, too.\u201dRecovery in the year since the storm has been slow. Federal officials were faulted for an inadequate response in providing food, roof tarps and other emergency needs. Local officials were excoriated for lowballing the death toll, insisting for months that it was in the low double-digits, until a study showed the toll just under 3,000. Yet despite the very real suffering that has touched most Puerto Rican families, President Trump praises the \u201cunsung success\u201d that was the response to the storm.\u201cThat was so uncalled-for,\u201d Mr. Alvarado said. \u201cHere is the commander in chief, with the world\u2019s biggest stage, disparaging a bunch of American citizens in the Caribbean. He\u2019s basically telling the island they\u2019re liars.\u201dIn images taken over the course of several trips, Mr. Alvarado \u2014 who was born in New York to Puerto Rican parents \u2014 set out to capture quiet moments that are rooted in his family\u2019s experiences yet speak to those of countless others. There are, of course, the scenes of jumbled debris, fallen walls, soggy mattresses and hillsides stripped bare of once-thick vegetation. In one image, a framed First Holy Communion photo of Mr. Alvarado sits amid the soggy remains of a relative\u2019s home.\u201cOnce I got the negatives back, I took it all in,\u201d said Mr. Alvarado, who shot on 120 film to slow down his process. \u201cIt was missing a lot of me. I needed to put myself in there. So when I returned in late February, I went out to take pictures of what the storm couldn\u2019t take away. This is what this place means to me.\u201dThat meaning is rooted in the lives of the j\u00edbaros \u2014 traditional mountain people \u2014 from which his family descends. His relatives may have lost their homes, but not their resolve, as their faces reveal a stoic determination that has helped them endure through decades of challenges. His grandfather, Horacio Alvarado, projects strength in a portrait, his sinewy frame topped by his perfectly trimmed silver hair. His uncle Coco, bare-chested, takes in the cool, damp air in his tiled porch. His grandmother rests on her bed in a pensive mood after calling a relative in Florida\u2019s rapidly growing diaspora.Just as important to him were the scenes of everyday life. A piglet wriggles in the mud in one image, while in another a full-grown pig impaled on a skewer awaits to be slow-roasted for a feast. More recent images from the summer shows young people diving into a river. He also began to learn how his relatives \u2014 without power, water or any significant outside help \u2014 made it through relying on their neighbors.\u201cYou know how old people are,\u201d Mr. Alvarado said. \u201cMy grandfather stayed in his home, and he\u2019s diabetic. But he was fine. People in the area helped each other out. People knew he was diabetic and they helped keep his medicine cold.\u201dMr. Alvarado returned in June, going with his father to visit his relatives in Coamo. There, he found people trying to move forward after a year of heartbreak. \u201cSome people in the barrio say they\u2019re tired talking about the hurricane,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have mixed emotions. It was summer, school was about to start, and everybody was going to the waterfalls and rivers, just hanging out. It\u2019s an optimistic island.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Parts of a \u2018Virtual\u2019 Border Wall, Built With the Tech Behind Driverless Cars", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "In a rural Texas county, lidar sensor technology is being tested as a way to spot illegal intruders from Mexico. That use could divide workers in Silicon Valley.Supported byDEL RIO, Tex. \u2014 In this tiny town at the edge of South Texas brush country, a black steel fence runs along the Mexican border. About 15 feet high and topped by small metal spires that bend toward Mexico, it stretches west from a Border Patrol checkpoint for about a mile and a half. Then it stops.The sensor belongs to a Silicon Valley start-up called Quanergy, one of a number of companies trying to land business along the Mexican border. While President Trump still vows to build a physical border wall, these companies hope to help build a \u201cvirtual wall\u201d that some policymakers believe would be more effective than miles of concrete and metal. A virtual wall would not offer a physical deterrence, but some people believe it would be cheaper to build and maintain.\u201cThe only way to have operational control of the border is to look at all 2,000 miles of it at the same time,\u201d said Representative Will Hurd, a Republican who represents Val Verde County, west of San Antonio. \u201cAnd the only way to do that is through technology.\u201dFounded in 2012 and backed by more than $160 million in funding, Quanergy was one of the many lidar makers created amid a rush to develop driverless cars. Over the last year, that investment boom started to feel like a glut as autonomous vehicle technology improved more slowly than some had hoped. Border control is another potential market for lidar, which can spot objects and people in all sorts of conditions, day or night.Working with the Val Verde County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Quanergy has spent the last year testing its lidar sensors on the ranch in Del Rio, angling for a contract with United States Customs and Border Protection.Still, where some see a moral quandary, others see a business opportunity. More than 20 companies have worked on the Pentagon project that Google pulled out of.Mr. Luckey left Facebook two years later after it was revealed that he supported a political action group that spread anti-Hillary Clinton memes. Not long after, he started working on his new company. Trae Stephens, the investor who founded Anduril with Mr. Luckey, tried to distance the company from Mr. Luckey\u2019s history of political provocation when asked about it in an interview.\u201cIt is a national security company,\u201d he said.Quanergy\u2019s executives also hope to keep politics at arm\u2019s length. In a recent interview, Louay Eldada, a founder and the chief executive of Quanergy, said the company always planned to expand beyond driverless cars. Border control, he said, was an obvious candidate.Cogniac, another Silicon Valley start-up that offers technology for identifying people and objects in camera images, is exploring similar work.Mr. Hurd, the congressman, is advocating for a wider technological system. \u201cThe question is, how do you cut for sign in the digital age?\u201d he said. \u201cWe should get to a point where we see absolutely everything coming across our border.\u201dThat could include the kinds of sensors tested by Quanergy in Del Rio, which can capture activity across 360 degrees and a distance of about 100 meters. Using this three-dimensional view of an area, software can automatically pinpoint people moving past and alert border agents.If lined up in large numbers and paired with cameras that snap images when movement is detected, these sensors could provide a more detailed picture of border activity and help agents organize their response.But the devices are limited. If left unprotected, they are easily vandalized. And they require both electrical power and a network connection. Quanergy has tested its sensors with solar panels, which eliminate the need for power lines. Still, along most parts of the border, the authorities would have to install new fiber lines or cell towers.Joe Martinez, Val Verde County\u2019s sheriff, has helped test the Quanergy sensors. He said he believed they could be a big help along some parts of the border. But if these sensors were used in the vast, rocky, undulating spaces in the western part of his county, he said, border and other law enforcement agents would have difficulty responding to alerts within any reasonable amount of time.\u201cThe needs to the west are different,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cAnd the needs to the south are different.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, lidar sensors are expensive. Quanergy charges a few thousand dollars per unit. Old tires are considerably cheaper.Such sensors, Mr. Martinez and others said, are best used in tandem with a wide variety of other methods under development. \u201cThis is about a layering of technologies,\u201d said David Aguilar, a former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and a principal at Global Security and Innovative Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington. Current officials with the agency said it was testing many technologies with companies in Silicon Valley, with the goal of deploying new artificial intelligence techniques in the field.Some question whether these technologies will eat away at the privacy of residents. Much of the land at the border is private.Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University who specializes in border protection issues, said authorities should concentrate on border checkpoints, where a large portion of illegal crossings occur.\u201cNone of these things make sense to me,\u201d said Ms. Correa-Cabrera, who is also a fellow at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington. \u201cWhy would we continue to spend on technology that is not solving the problem?\u201dBut Mr. Aguilar said he believed that demands on the border for new sensors and new artificial intelligence would grow.\u201cWe started talking about this many years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the technology wasn\u2019t as mature as it is now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the university where Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera is currently a professor. It is George Mason University, not the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, where she was previously a member of the faculty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Big Tech, a Comeuppance We\u2019ve Seen Before: On Wall St.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When I moved to the Bay Area two years ago, it was with a sense of relief.Relief from New York winters and deteriorating subways, yes. But also relief after six years of covering Wall Street, an industry that had moved from one crisis to another after the financial crash of 2008, drawing the unending wrath of the public.In California I was joining a growing team of reporters covering Silicon Valley, which had quickly become the new engine of the economy. Just like Wall Street before it lost its luster, the tech industry had become the destination of choice for the top college graduates. I would be writing about a place where everyone was focused more on the future than on the past.Now, just two years after getting here, and a decade after the start of the financial crisis, I have a creeping sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I go about my job.Admiration of the tech world has, in the wake of a growing list of scandals, quickly soured into an intense suspicion that manages to cross partisan lines, similar to what Wall Street faced after 2008.As was true after the financial crisis, the backlash against tech rises out of a public awakening to the integral role that these huge companies occupy in our society \u2014 with Facebook, Uber and Twitter playing the part that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase did a decade ago.\u201cPeople talk about bankers being amoral,\u201d said Charlie Beckett, the director of the Truth, Trust and Technology Commission at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey are starting to talk about tech people in similar language. Where before they were kind of heroes \u2014 they were people who brought us these wonderful products \u2014 they are now starting to be blamed for the ills of the world.\u201dIt often feels as though these companies took on their pivotal positions so quickly that no one \u2014 not even their employees \u2014 had a chance to understand how they really worked or how much influence they had.Ana Bot\u00edn, a longtime executive at the giant Spanish bank Santander, recently wrote on LinkedIn that the tech companies were losing the same basic thing that banks lost in 2008: the public\u2019s trust.\u201cSome in big tech are beginning to accept what we in banking learned some years ago: We don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d Ms. Bot\u00edn told me last week.The storm that Ms. Bot\u00edn and other bank executives faced after 2008 and the one we are witnessing now are obviously different.The crisis precipitated by the banks was a financial one that caused markets to crash, and threatened to bring down the global economy.The crisis involving the internet giants is not hitting our pocketbooks \u2014 it is straining our confidence in what we know about the world. If Russian hackers can create and amplify fake news stories across the many sites we have come to rely on, where can we go for reliable information?In public surveys, like the Harris Poll Reputation Quotient, the tech giants are still polling well ahead of Goldman and Wells Fargo, and some, like Amazon and Apple, seem to be mostly flying above the fray.The exact ills that people assign to the industry tend to differ based on their politics. While people on the right, including President Trump, have expressed the most concern about political bias and censorship, the left has worried more about the way the companies opened the door to election interference and have exacerbated income inequality. But nearly everyone is voicing unease about the way our children have been turned into digital addicts.The broad shift in perception is inevitably piling more blame onto the shoulders of one industry than it should bear. Like the mortgage meltdown, our current crisis of confidence is the result of factors that go beyond any one player in the drama \u2014 from the polarization of the media landscape to the growing economic inequality that has led to distrust of elites of all sorts.Whatever the reality, political momentum is building behind some sort of broader regulatory response, similar to what came together in the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The current push has begun with talk of legislation that would protect our privacy \u2014 but much bolder steps are being considered.What I wonder now is whether any regulatory response will follow a similar path to what came after the financial crisis.A long list of new laws in the United States and Europe did seem to make the banks safer and another crisis less likely.But the regulations also appear to have cemented the status of the biggest banks in our economy. The largest financial institutions now control a bigger proportion of the industry\u2019s assets than they did before the crisis. These big banks are regulated as if they were more like utilities, but the high regulatory costs provide a kind of barrier against most competitors.It is easy to imagine something similar happening in the technology industry, and European authorities have already taken some steps in that direction.If tech companies are forced to be more responsible for the content on their platforms, they will most likely need to build a significant apparatus for compliance. That would cut into profitability. It would also make it very hard for upstarts to challenge them.\u201cThere\u2019s an increasingly loud call for the platforms to get involved in content moderation,\u201d said Cory Doctorow, a special adviser with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s well intentioned, but the outcome of that is very likely to be pretty disastrous.\u201dMr. Doctorow has been part of a growing chorus of people calling for antitrust actions to break up the biggest companies, rather than tweaking their operations.Whatever steps the government takes, they are unlikely to help recover the trust that has already been lost. As I know from those years of covering the banks, confidence, once gone, is not easily regained.As for me, the familiar problems have not allowed for the change of pace I was expecting. And in truth, the subways out here are no better. But the weather is still very nice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "CBS Board Tries to Move Past Moonves Crisis With New Directors", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat the revamped 13-member board has planned for CBS depends on how it views the importance of consolidations, as Silicon Valley continues to steal ad dollars and eyeballs away from traditional TV players. It will also depend on what kind of relationship it has with its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, who has been agitating for a merger with Viacom, the once-lofty cable company behind MTV and Nickelodeon that she also controls.Ms. Redstone and Richard D. Parsons, the former Time Warner chief executive, picked the new board members, according to three people familiar with the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters. Mr. Parsons, an ally of Ms. Redstone, had been nominated to become a director earlier this year, and he officially joined on Sunday along with five others. With the exception of Mr. Parsons, the new directors have no significant ties to Ms. Redstone, these people said.After the nominees were interviewed by two independent directors, Bruce S. Gordon and Martha L. Minow, the larger board endorsed the new appointments, the people said. Mr. Gordon was an instrumental figure in negotiating the larger settlement that included Mr. Moonves\u2019s removal following allegations of sexual harassment against him, two of the people said. A former head of the N.A.A.C.P., he worked through Saturday night and into Sunday to complete the deal, they said.Ms. Redstone said in the statement that she was \u201cdelighted to welcome our new directors, who bring valuable and diverse expertise and a strong commitment to corporate governance.\u201dThe directors include two executives who have specialized in merger and acquisitions and a corporate consultant. Candace K. Beinecke, a partner at the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, has handled corporate governance issues and helped broker mergers for corporate clients. Barbara M. Byrne has deep ties to the banking industry as a former vice chairman of Barclays and a former employee of Lehman Brothers. She is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Susan Schuman, the chief executive of the corporate consultancy group SYPartners, has done work for Blackstone, Facebook, Viacom and sits on the advisory council for the MIT Media Lab.The departure of Mr. Moonves leaves the board without a chairman. That appointment will be made fairly soon, the people familiar with the process said. Ms. Redstone, who is vice chairwoman, is a likely candidate.Seven directors remained on the board, including two who are affiliated with National Amusements, the Redstone family company that controls CBS and Viacom. They are Ms. Redstone and Robert N. Klieger, who has worked as a lawyer for National Amusements. Mr. Gordon, Ms. Minow and three other CBS directors also remain on the board.The newly configured group will have to move beyond past skirmishes. In May, CBS, along with Mr. Gordon and four other directors, sued Ms. Redstone, claiming she had breached her fiduciary duty to the company\u2019s shareholders by pushing for a merger with Viacom.The lawsuit exposed deep factions within the board, with one group apparently loyal to Ms. Redstone, another to Mr. Moonves and others debating which direction the company should take.The Sunday settlement was intended to resolve not only Mr. Moonves\u2019s exit but also the showdown over the potential merger.

At least eight of the independent directors not affiliated with Ms. Redstone\u2019s family company would have to agree on such a deal.If they do, that would align with Ms. Redstone\u2019s grand scheme, which is to merge CBS and Viacom and sell the combined company.

Should legislators give consumers control over the data companies have on them?Ms. Singer is a technology reporter at The New York Times.There\u2019s just one flaw with this setup.In a surveillance economy where companies track, analyze and capitalize on our clicks, the issue at hand isn\u2019t privacy. The problem is unfettered data exploitation and its potential deleterious consequences \u2014 among them, unequal consumer treatment, financial fraud, identity theft, manipulative marketing and discrimination.In other words, asking companies whose business models revolve around exploiting data-based consumer-influence techniques to explain their privacy policies seems about as useful as asking sharks to hold forth on veganism.The Senate Commerce hearing, however, doesn\u2019t seem designed to investigate commercial surveillance and influence practices that might merit government oversight.For one thing, only industry executives are currently set to testify. And most of them are lawyers and policy experts, not engineers versed in the mechanics of data-mining algorithms.That may be because Congress is under industry pressure.Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the Senate Commerce Committee, said the group planned future hearings that would include other voices, such as consumer groups. But \u201cfor the first hearing,\u201d Mr. Hill said, \u201cthe committee is bringing in companies most consumers recognize to make the discussion about privacy more relatable.\u201dMany consumers know that digital services and ad tech companies track and analyze their activities. And they accept, or are at least resigned to, data-mining in exchange for conveniences like customized newsfeeds and ads.And that leads to a larger question: Do we want a future in which companies can freely parse the photos we posted last year, or the location data from the fitness apps we used last week, to infer whether we are stressed or depressed or financially strapped or emotionally vulnerable \u2014 and take advantage of that?(Amazon said it does not use Alexa data for product recommendations or marketing.)It\u2019s tough to answer those questions right now when there are often gulfs between the innocuous ways companies explain their data practices to consumers and the details they divulge about their targeting techniques to advertisers.Here\u2019s what it means in practice: AT&T can find out which subscribers have indigestion \u2014 or at least which ones bought over-the-counter drugs to treat it.Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for AT&T, said the company\u2019s privacy policy was \u201ctransparent and precise, and describes in plain language how we use information and the choices we give customers.\u201dBut consumer advocates hope senators will press AT&T, Amazon and other companies this week to provide more details on their consumer-profiling practices. \u201cWe want an inside look on the analytics and how they\u2019re categorizing, ranking, rating and scoring us,\u201d Professor Citron said.Given the increased public scrutiny, some companies are tweaking their tactics.AT&T recently said it would stop sharing users\u2019 location details with data brokers. Facebook said it had stopped allowing advertisers to use sensitive categories, like race or religion, to exclude people from seeing ads. Google created a feature for users to download masses of their data, including a list of all the sites Google has tracked them on.Government officials in Europe are not waiting for companies to police themselves. In May, the European Union introduced a tough new data protection law that curbs some data-mining. It requires companies to obtain explicit permission from European users before collecting personal details on sensitive subjects like their religion, health or sex life. It gives European users the right to see all of the information companies hold about them \u2014 including any algorithmic scores or inferences. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Omnivorous Sharks That Eat Grass", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesSharks are not known for their taste for greenery. But at least one species of shark enjoys a salad of sea grass as well as the prey it hunts.In 2007, researchers first reported that the digestive tracts of bonnethead sharks caught in the Gulf of Mexico were full of sea grass, up to 62 percent of the contents by weight. At the time, some reasoned that the grass might have been ingested incidentally, as the sharks dove for scurrying prey in the meadows. But Samantha Leigh, a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine, and lead author of the paper, and her colleagues wondered whether there was more to it.They caught bonnethead sharks just off the Florida Keys and transported them to an outdoor lab facility. There, the sharks lived in a large tank and received a meal every day consisting of a wad of seagrass wrapped in a piece of squid, resembling a large inside-out sushi roll. The sea grass, which made up 90 percent of the roll, had been loaded with a tracker isotope that could be detected later in their blood if the grass was truly being digested, not just passing through. The researchers also filtered the sharks\u2019 feces from the water using a fine mesh, allowing them to test how much of what went in came out.The sharks thrived on this diet, all of them gaining weight during the experiment. When the researchers checked their blood, they found very high levels of the tracker, indicating the grass was being digested and used for nutrients. Checking enzymes in their guts revealed that the sharks do possess enzymes needed for breaking down the carbohydrates in plants, much like other omnivores; carnivores, on the other hand, have primarily enzymes for dealing with proteins. The researchers calculated that the sharks were digesting the grass with about 50 percent efficiency, much greater than carnivorous lizards, for instance, whose efficiency at digesting plant matter is about 30 percent. In fact, the sharks had roughly the same digestive efficiency as juvenile sea-grass-eating sea turtles, which start out as omnivores and become more like herbivores as they mature. \u201cThey are at least as good as those guys. That was pretty surprising to see,\u201d said Ms. Leigh. How do humans compare? \u201cWe\u2019re actually in the same realm as the bonnethead shark,\u201d she said, good omnivores that we are. Could it be that other sharks have been grazing on grass all this time? \u201cThis is the first one that we know for sure is, but it definitely makes me at least want to take a closer look at some other coastal shark species,\u201d said Ms. Leigh, citing their small sizes and tendency to feed on smaller creatures, as the bonnethead does. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely possible that there are others that could be doing something similar.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Antarctica is the most desolate and inhospitable place on Earth and its remoteness makes monitoring changes in the fluctuations of ice and water levels difficult. Because of the warming climate, seasonal changes at Antarctica are becoming more severe, making the need to understand the loss of ice even more important.Ian Howat, the project\u2019s principal investigator and a professor of earth sciences at Ohio State University, and Paul Morin, of the University of Minnesota, used data from a constellation of polar orbiting satellites to image the frozen wastes. The satellite data was licensed by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which is part of the Department of Defense. Previous maps of the continent had a resolution similar to seeing the whole of Central Park from a satellite. With this new data, it is now possible to see down to the size of a car, and even smaller in some areas. The data is so complete that scientists now know the height of every feature on the continent down to a few feet. \u201cIf you\u2019re someone that needs glasses to see, it\u2019s a bit like being almost blind and putting on glasses for the first time and seeing 20/20,\u201d said Dr. Howat. The team used 187,585 images collected over six years to create the map. \u201cUntil now, we\u2019ve had a better map of Mars than we\u2019ve had of Antarctica,\u201d said Dr. Howat. The pictures are so detailed they had to use one of the most powerful supercomputers on Earth to ingest the data. Having access to this amount of information will allow researchers to better monitor the effects of climate change on the ice. Previous images of Antarctic terrain left much to be desired. The difference between two images from previous surface imaging on the left and the new map on the right demonstrates the difference. The upturned shovel feature in the bottom right is called Siple Dome. Hills like these are found all over Antarctica, their smooth surface made by accumulations of ice. The large mounds act like obstructions in this stream of glacial ice that is flowing out to the Ross ice shelf, Antarctica\u2019s largest. Observing snowfall, ice-growth and the rate of melt and fissures will allow scientists to monitor sea-level rise and glacial melt with more accuracy. Ice shelves bear the brunt of pressure from flowing rivers pushing against them. The faster the ice melts on the land, the more weight the ice shelf has to contain, resulting in breaks of glaciers into the sea. Scientists who keep a close watch on large ice shelves like Larsen C, above, will now be able to study the streams of ice and stress fractures that occur between the mountains. Because of the location of Antarctica and because the rest of the year there isn\u2019t enough sunlight at the poles for the satellites to see the land, images can only be taken from December through March, the summer season. Since the last set of data was collected, a large section of this glacier has broken off into an iceberg named A-68. This is a large river of ice flowing between two mountains called the Glacier South of Dry Valley. Images like these will be free and accessible to scientists for their research.Explorers and scientists stationed at Antarctica will also find the new map useful. By having such a detailed topographical map, new routes to science stations can be planned around the continent\u2019s dangerous terrain. At the center of this image above are two locations called Halley V & VI. Both were British research bases. They have since had to move because the ice shelf began to break off. \u201cSomething that\u2019s always been a problem is knowing where the ice is and knowing how thick it is,\u201d Dr. Howat said. The 150 terabyte data set is the first that will allow researchers to watch the fracturing of ice shells within a three week time span, nearly tracking changes on the ice in real time. These streams are flowing into Filchner ice shelf where stress fractures can be seen forming between hills. Such fractures are often the early signs of a full break from the glacier. Dr. Howat and Mr. Morin hope to update the map every year. With REMA it will be possible to watch icebergs forming and glaciers moving like this flow of ice at Byrd Glacier, which is the largest ice stream on Antarctica. Using information provided by university researchers, an earlier version of this article misstated who owned satellites that recorded images of Antarctica. They are owned by DigitalGlobe, not the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (the agency licensed the data that the satellites recorded).Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Has Put the U.S. and China on the Cusp of a New Cold War", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is confident that the United States is winning its trade war with China. But on both sides of the Pacific, a bleaker recognition is taking hold: The world\u2019s two largest economies are in the opening stages of a new economic Cold War, one that could persist well after Mr. Trump is out of office.\u201cThis thing will last long,\u201d Jack Ma, the billionaire chairman of Alibaba Group, warned a meeting of investors on Tuesday in Hangzhou, China. \u201cIf you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.\u201dThe diplomatic stalemate has many in the business and policy communities considering the possibility that the United States may be in a protracted and economically damaging trade fight for years to come and wondering what, if anything, America will gain.Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia and an expert on China, said in an interview that 2018 signaled \u201cthe beginnings of a war of a different type: a trade war, an investment war and a technology war between the two great powers of the 21st century, with an uncertain landing point.\u201dThe latest tit-for-tat leaves little room for concessions, at least in the interim, as both countries dig in their heels and China tries to remain strong, despite an economic softening that Mr. Trump clearly sees as an opening to force Beijing\u2019s hand.Chinese growth in investment, factory production and consumer spending have all slowed this year, and its economic growth has slowed alongside. The situation is expected to worsen as effects of the escalating American tariffs ramp up.While the United States made overtures toward China in recent days to talk trade in Washington this month, some officials said they now doubted Beijing would engage again at a high level until after the midterm elections in November, when President Xi Jinping may meet Mr. Trump on the sidelines of an economic summit meeting in Buenos Aires.Mr. Trump himself seemed to dangle the prospect that he, and he alone, could broker a resolution that threatened to cause economic pain to companies and consumers on both sides of the Pacific.\u201cHopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his statement announcing the tariffs.The Chinese side has its own political reasons to avoid capitulation. Acceding to Mr. Trump would be considered a sign of weakness for Mr. Xi, according to analysts.And they see no sign that China is willing to give up on Made in China 2025, an industrial program that aims for dominance in robotics, artificial intelligence, and other high tech industries that have been the domain of the United States and Europe and that Mr. Trump has identified as a policy initiative that must be stopped.While Chinese officials have expressed a willingness to get rid of the name Made in China 2025, they have been much more cautious about accepting limits on some of the crucial features of the country\u2019s industrial policy, like big loans from state-owned banks at very low interest rates to favored industries.Inside the White House, there remains a pitched battle between those who want to make a deal with Beijing and those who are determined to keep piling on pressure to force a more radical change in its trade practices. At the moment, the hard liners have Mr. Trump\u2019s ear.\u201cYou would expect the administration to have tabled a negotiating text with a clear set of commitments, but that has apparently not been done,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThere are some in the administration who see tariffs as an end in themselves.\u201dMr. Price said the Trump administration had done a good job of cataloging China\u2019s abuses: theft of intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from foreign companies, predatory joint venture agreements. But it has failed to marshal a coalition to confront China, instead provoking separate trade fights with the European Union, Japan, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatening additional taxes on imported cars.\u201cDoing this without the E.U. and Japan fully on board as though Chinese unfair trade practices were only a bilateral problem is wrongheaded and certainly less effective,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to galvanize your allies when you impose steel and aluminum tariffs on them and threaten auto tariffs.\u201dFor China, a complicating factor is figuring out who has influence in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been leading the negotiations, invited China\u2019s top trade negotiator, Liu He, to Washington for a meeting next week, even though his last visit ended badly when Mr. Trump spurned a deal that would have cut the American trade deficit with China.Mr. Mnuchin believes the United States must be open to talks as long as China is willing to address structural issues, including the trade gap between what America exports and what it imports, pressure on American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition for doing business in China and intellectual property theft.Other senior officials, notably Peter Navarro, who oversees the office of trade and manufacturing policy, have told colleagues that inviting the Chinese now was a sign of weakness. Mr. Navarro, an economist who made his name with book titles like \u201cDeath by China,\u201d is among those who favor putting more pressure on China to force a change in its behavior.It is not clear whether Mr. Liu will visit Washington next week. But even if he does, people who have spoken to Chinese officials said the unraveling of the agreement Mr. Liu believed he had struck on his last visit would make him reluctant to make any deal this time.\u201cThe Chinese deep learning from that is, \u2018We should not substantively re-engage until the administration has its internal house in order,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Rudd, who is now the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.After months of bruising encounters with Mr. Trump, Mr. Rudd said Chinese officials recognized that they would need to change their policies on trade and market access. But he said Mr. Xi was no less likely than Mr. Trump to risk losing face by giving in to American pressure.\u201cChina has politics too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole notion of \u2018back down\u2019 and \u2018face\u2019 is as live a consideration within internal Chinese politics as it is within U.S. politics.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s aggressive moves drew intense criticism from some quarters at home. Fred Smith, the chief executive of FedEx and an enthusiastic supporter of the president\u2019s tax cuts, called his trade policy a form of mercantilism that was \u201cworrisome to everyone.\u201dBut Mr. Trump has shown little sign of changing course.

{"Headline": "What Trump Doesn\u2019t Get About Disasters", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow we define a calamity determines how we plan for and respond to them. Or not.Professor Knowles studies public policy concerning risk and disaster.PHILADELPHIA \u2014 On Thursday morning, as the Carolinas braced for the winds and water of Hurricane Florence, President Trump was busy responding to the storm that devastated Puerto Rico last year.I\u2019m glad he gave an honest account of his thinking about the boundaries of disaster, because how we count these deaths and measure the economic impact of calamities shapes the way we budget for future ones. It also determines how credit or blame is assigned to elected officials charged with preparing for and managing disasters. Defining a disaster as an \u201cevent\u201d has a history extending to the 1960s, when federal funds were spent to model the social impact of a nuclear attack. To do this, Civil Defense officials commissioned studies of proxies of an attack, like earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes, all disasters that affect multiple systems with limited warning. They wanted to understand the immediate post-attack consequences \u2014 would society survive, or would people panic and society quickly descend into chaos? The focus was on the event itself, the nuclear blast. What led up to it and what its long-term effects would be were irrelevant.Social science disaster research was born from this funding. Over the decades, it evolved into a multidisciplinary endeavor that has told us a lot about human behavior in disasters. (And it\u2019s not what those Civil Defense officials in the 1960s expected. People don\u2019t panic. They are resilient. They help one another.)By the 1990s there was an emerging consensus that the historical background and long-term aftereffects of disasters were just as important, if not more so, than the event itself, because a disaster is really an interconnected chain of occurrences.We will never understand why some people are vulnerable and others aren\u2019t if the focus is only on a disaster as an event. Nor will we comprehend why some communities recover quickly while others languish, nor grasp the debilitating consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder. So, too, we will be unable to comprehend the burden of care for future generations, or past victims. Event thinking is amnesiac; worse, it inhibits planning for the disasters to come.But if one\u2019s interest is in playing down the impact of disaster, then event thinking is the ticket. You may avoid learning anything significant about the causes and consequences of what happened, but you can get back to the business of building, even if it is in dangerous places.The president\u2019s disaster logic tells us that firefighters who are now sick after responding to the World Trade Center after the Sept. 11 attacks are not victims, and that soldiers suffering PTSD should not to be counted among the casualties of war. Nothing matters unless it happened in the event. If you didn\u2019t die then and there, you don\u2019t count.Event thinking is cheaper, and it relieves us of the moral burdens of protecting the commons. But it is counterproductive. What we should be doing is building a culture of long-term preparedness, based in scientific reality. The clear counterpoint is to acknowledge that a disaster is a process that reveals our values as a society. A disaster\u2019s beginning and end might be obscure, but that doesn\u2019t excuse us from figuring out the causes and true costs.Surely our thinking about disaster should be as complex as the societies they disrupt. We need to understand that disaster is slow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watching Her Speak for Us All", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, Christine Blasey Ford was the voice for those of us who are still haunted by decades-old assaults \u2014 including me. Ms. Yellin is a journalist in Memphis.One of the most telling moments of Thursday\u2019s Senate hearing for me \u2014 a survivor of rape at a drunken high school party when I was 16 \u2014 came during a reply to one of Senator Patrick Leahy\u2019s questions for Christine Blasey Ford. He asked her to describe her strongest memory of the sexual assault she experienced at age 15.\u201cIndelible in the hippocampus,\u201d she said without hesitation, \u201cis the laughter and their having fun at my expense.\u201dHer agile answer made me cheer, and wince, and seethe with anger all at once.I cheered as Dr. Blasey displayed both the detachment of a scholar who has spent a career trying to understand the science of trauma and its effects, and the hard-won self-possession of an adult woman who has spent decades confronting her demons. As a commentator on cable TV said during a break in her testimony, Dr. Blasey was both the survivor and the expert witness at the hearing.I winced because Dr. Blasey conveyed so clearly how the searing pain of that one indelible moment in her childhood had followed her, no matter how hard she tried to outrun it, for the last 36 years.And my seething anger was about the expense \u2014 the cost to her, the cost to every one of us who has ever been on the receiving end of male sexual violence.In my case, the rapist was a star football player at my Memphis school. His girlfriend and another boy were also in the room at the time. I never reported it. It took me four years to understand \u2014 with the help of a college boyfriend \u2014 that it was even rape. I reluctantly told my parents when I was 27, and my three older brothers in my 30s.Like so many others in the past two weeks, I have been thinking back to 1991. I was 30, and living in Los Angeles when I watched Anita Hill testify before that all-male, Senate Judiciary Committee. Two months later, I also watched the rape trial of William Kennedy Smith, Senator Ted Kennedy\u2019s nephew. One day, the defense passed around the accuser\u2019s underwear for jurors to examine, saying that although Mr. Smith\u2019s semen had been found on them, they weren\u2019t ripped, so it could not have been rape. He was acquitted.In response, I was happy to vote for both Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein in 1992, the so-called \u201cYear of the Woman.\u201d But that brutal autumn of 1991, I realized more clearly than ever before that we women really are regarded as second-class citizens in this world, which kept me from speaking publicly, beyond my family and close friends, about what had happened to me for another two decades.I have heard that for every person who talks about an experience of sexual violence, there are at least 100 others who never will. On Thursday, I think Dr. Blasey\u2019s voice was amplified to represent millions.Five years ago, right after my story was published, I got about 100 emails from people I didn\u2019t know, telling me their all-too-similar stories. They ranged from teenage girls to a woman in her 70s, who was still grappling with what a boy had done to her in high school. I also got another 50 or so similar messages from friends and acquaintances. And one man told me how he almost attacked a vulnerable girl at a drunken high school party, but he found that he simply couldn\u2019t do it, and then felt bad for years, like maybe he wasn\u2019t a real man, because everything in our culture told him he had missed a great opportunity.This year, I received a letter from the other guy in the room when I was raped. He was writing to ask me for absolution. He told me he was a good man despite what he had done back then. I didn\u2019t write him back because I could not give him what he wanted, and felt no need to explain. I haven\u2019t heard from anyone else in that room that night.As the Kavanaugh story has unfolded, people have said that something a guy did at a drunken party in high school shouldn\u2019t follow him around for the rest of his life. Maybe. But what if that thing he did hurt someone else, and has followed that person around for her whole life?I stopped watching Thursday\u2019s hearing after Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimony. I recorded the rest and will look at it some other time. But whatever happens, I hope enough senators get it into their own hippocampi that Dr. Blasey has given us all a chance to break a vicious cycle in our country.Many young people who have experienced sexual assault watched the hearing. And what happens next will influence them far beyond this Supreme Court, this midterm election, even this president. Please, senators, do not vote a man into a lifetime of ultimate authority over us all who could possibly be, like Clarence Thomas, a constant, indelible reminder that this country will favor a man\u2019s power and entitlement at the expense of a woman\u2019s voice and body every time.Please, in the name of those of us who have been reliving recent or decades-old trauma this month, do not empower another man who could lead yet another generation of young people to forget their own value and strength, and remain silent and afraid, as I once did.A previous version of this article misidentified the location of the city in which two high school football players were convicted of rape in 2013. The city, Steubenville, is in Ohio, not Pennsylvania.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Has It Backward: Many Migrants Are Victims of Crime ", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRamped-up enforcement by the United States and Mexico has pushed migrants onto more invisible, risky paths and put them at greater danger. Ms. Leutert is the director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin. In June, Josue, a 21-year-old Honduran, reached a safe house in the Mexican border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. He was there with 11 other Central American migrants. His family had spent the previous year scraping together the $3,800 necessary for this last part of his journey to the United States.But the \u201csafe\u201d house was not so safe. Only miles from the border, his migration was interrupted as armed men burst into the house, kidnapping the migrants and demanding an additional $1,800 for their release. If their families couldn\u2019t raise the money, the armed men warned, the migrants would be killed.Every day, dramas and tragedies like this play out for the Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan migrants traveling through Mexico. The Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric has repeatedly linked migrants to gangs, violence and crime, and cast undocumented immigrants as a threat to public safety. But in fact, a majority of the Central Americans arriving at the United States-Mexico border are not perpetrators but rather victims of violence, both in their home countries and during their fraught transit through Mexico.Over the past three decades, the risks and dangers on the journey from Central America to the United States border have increased \u2014 ramped-up United States and Mexican migratory enforcement has pushed migrants onto more invisible, risky paths, and impunity in Mexico for criminal perpetrators has kept them on the streets.Yet however daunting the risks and challenging the policies, they have not significantly put a dent in the number of Central Americans traveling north. What has changed is that hundreds of thousands of migrants make the journey to the United States along more clandestine and treacherous routes.For Central American migrants, there is no single transportation method or route to travel through Mexico to reach the United States. Travel experiences are influenced by a migrant\u2019s nationality, gender, age and income. If a Central American migrant hires a smuggler for transiting through Mexico \u2014 and 60 percent report hiring these guides in surveys conducted by the Colegio de la Frontera Norte \u2014 then the routes will also be determined by the smugglers\u2019 contacts and methods. But they all have at least one thing in common: Not one is safe, and each comes with a series of risks.As soon as migrants near Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala, the dangers begin. To reach Mexico\u2019s southernmost cities, migrants with a bit of money can take local buses or hire taxis. Those with empty wallets must walk. This may include hiking for days on the sides of highways, often at night to avoid detection and the strong tropical sun. Mexican officials have focused their enforcement attention less at the physical border and more at highway checkpoints set up around 30 or 100 miles into Mexican territory, where migration authorities attempt to identify individuals transiting through the country without the appropriate documents.Migrants fleeing violence in Central America may travel distances equivalent to that between Chicago and Miami (about 1,400 miles) or Chicago and the West Coast (more than 2,000 miles). Many are subject to crime along the way. The map shows some of the most-traveled routes.Mexicali400 milesTijuanaSonoytaUnited statesCiudad Ju\u00e1rezCaborcaNogalesChihuahuaMexicoReynosaMonterreyMore than 1,000 migrants have beenkidnapped in this state since 2011.Torre\u00f3ntamaulipasMazatl\u00e1nCiudad VictoriaApproximate distances to Mexico City from:TabascoGuadalajaraMexico CityVillahermosaSan Pedro SulaSan Salvador793 miles836 to 873HondurasFloresOaxaca CityIxtepecSan Pedro SulaLa MesillaSanta Mar\u00eda HuatulcoFrom Mexico City to:Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1nChiapasReynosaCiudad Ju\u00e1rezTijuana606 to 676 miles1,0111,645TapachulaGuaTemalaSan SalvadorEl SalvadorMexicali400 milesTijuanaSonoytaUnited statesCiudad Ju\u00e1rezCaborcaNogalesChihuahuaReynosaMexicoMore than 1,000 migrants have been kidnapped in this state since 2011.MonterreyTorre\u00f3ntamaulipasCiudad VictoriaMazatl\u00e1nApproximate distances to Mexico City from:TabascoGuadalajaraVillahermosaMexico CitySan Pedro SulaSan Salvador793 miles836 to 873HondurasFloresOaxaca CitySan Pedro SulaSanta Mar\u00eda HuatulcoFrom Mexico City to:ChiapasReynosaCiudad Ju\u00e1rezTijuana606 to 676 miles1,0111,645San SalvadorGuatemalaEl SalvadorUnited statesCiudad Ju\u00e1rezTijuanaNogalesMexicoReynosaNuevo Le\u00f3nCiudad VictoriaVillahermosaGuadalajaraSan Pedro SulaMexico CityHondurasGuatemalaSan SalvadorEl Salvador400 milesBy The New York TimesIn these desolate areas in the south of Mexico, migrants may be set upon by criminals like corrupt authorities, opportunistic local groups and members of the gangs MS-13 or Barrio 18 \u2014 the very groups that migrants may be fleeing and who have a presence in this part of Mexico. Migrants with a little more money use private cars, buses or trailers and move along Mexico\u2019s major north-south highways; they pass through the Mexican migration checkpoints by passing as locals or paying off corrupt officials. Some avoid the checkpoints altogether and hike around them. Traveling in vehicles is generally safer for migrants, but there may still be hardships from the varying quality of food, abysmal sleeping arrangements or mistreatment from their guides or fellow migrants.On the Mexico side of the border near Reynosa, drug trafficking organizations, particularly the Gulf Cartel and the splinter groups of the Zetas, control the territory and the smuggling routes and act as unofficial tax agents. These groups offer the Central American migrants\u2019 final security challenge and engage in their signature crime, kidnapping. Their presence gives this area the nefarious distinction of having the highest number of migrant kidnappings. Since 2011, data from Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute has documented 1,034 kidnapping victims in Tamaulipas \u2014 75 percent of all migrant kidnapping victims in the country. Women and minors each account for more than a quarter of the victims.But official numbers barely scratch the surface of the crimes committed against migrants in Mexico. Central Americans rarely report the crimes to Mexican authorities because of a lack of trust, fear of repercussions or limited knowledge of the country\u2019s justice system. Josue is a good example. He was able to escape his captors after the Federal Police intercepted a car that was taking him to a second safe house, but he decided not to report the kidnapping given concerns over his safety.What could push people to knowingly face these conditions or, worse, to bring their children along? For Central Americans, there is a deep chasm between migrants\u2019 desires for safety, work and family reunification and their ability to fulfill these dreams within their own countries or legally in the United States.In Reynosa, Josue was gearing up to try to make the hike from the border to Houston. Along with hundreds of thousands of other Central American migrants taking these same routes and escaping violence at home or in transit, he was confident that the journey would be worth it. The hope of a better and safer life in the United States was stronger than the fear of any dangers along the way.Stephanie Leutert is the director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the Robert S.

{"Headline": "Manhunt Intensifies for Fugitive Who Authorities Say Threatened President Trump", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt least 100 state and federal law enforcement officers are scouring an Ohio city, searching for a fugitive who has eluded them across multiple states for months after threatening to \u201cput a bullet\u201d in President Trump\u2019s head, the authorities said.The search became increasingly intense and focused on Sunday, after the authorities found a truck that they believe the fugitive, Shawn Richard Christy, 26, of McAdoo, Pa., had stolen. It was found in Mansfield, Ohio, a city of about 46,000, Robert Clark, a supervisory deputy United States marshal and one of the lead investigators, said in an interview on Tuesday.On June 19, a federal warrant was issued for Mr. Christy\u2019s arrest after he wrote a post on Facebook that threatened John M. Morganelli, the district attorney of Northampton County, Pa., and President Trump.\u201cKeep it up Morganelli, I promise I\u2019ll put a bullet in your head as soon as I put one in the head of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d he wrote, according to the authorities.But Mr. Christy, a self-described survivalist, was already a wanted man. There were already state warrants for his arrest, after he failed to appear in court for an aggravated assault trial, Deputy Clark said. That prompted a warrant charging him with violating probation, and the involvement of the United States Marshals Service.The F.B.I. and Secret Service became involved after the post about the president, the authorities said, adding that Mr. Christy had also threatened to use \u201cfull lethal force on any law enforcement officer that tries to detain me.\u201dBut tracking him has proved difficult, Deputy Clark said.Mr. Christy, a \u201cbushcrafter,\u201d or someone skilled in wilderness survival, has evaded the authorities by stealing supplies and living in wooded areas, Deputy Clark said. He has also traveled by stealing at least six vehicles and driving until he runs out of gas or until a vehicle gives out, he said.He\u2019s traveled as far north as Canada and has bounced across several states, including Kentucky, Maryland, New York and West Virginia, Deputy Clark said. He added that they even searched the wooded area near his backyard in Pennsylvania.He said Mr. Christy had also stolen four firearms: three handguns and ammunition from his uncle\u2019s home, and a shotgun and shells from a trip he made into Hazle Township, Pa.\u201cWith the threats and the theft of firearms, there\u2019s certainly potential for a confrontational conclusion, which is what we do not want,\u201d Deputy Clark said. \u201cWe\u2019re just hoping that this investigation can come to a safe conclusion.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s layer after layer of places we\u2019ve been, areas we\u2019ve searched,\u201d Deputy Clark said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know what his endgame or intentions are.\u201dThe authorities have offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to Mr. Christy\u2019s arrest.His father, Craig Christy, said he believed his son wrote the post about President Trump during a period of frustration with the legal system. He said his son\u2019s actions in evading the authorities stemmed from a confrontation he had in March 2017 with a former public official in McAdoo, Pa., which his son wanted to bring attention to.\u201cHe was so frustrated and so scared and so angry and he was just at a point where he felt like he was trapped,\u201d Craig Christy said. \u201cIn those instances, sometimes people say things they don\u2019t really mean.\u201dIn 2012, the father and son pleaded guilty to making harassing phone calls to a lawyer of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska, and both were sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, according to The Associated Press. Mr. Christy said his son was sent to a halfway house for six months.On Tuesday, Craig Christy said that he last saw his son on June 30.\u201cWe\u2019re just praying for him to turn himself in,\u201d he said.Doris Burke contributed research.Follow Melissa Gomez on Twitter: @MelissaGomez004.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump\u2019s scandal-plagued presidency has benefited from a deliberate pattern of diversion and the deep executive dysfunction he has created in the federal government. Under his tenure, the president has given the impression it is not the White House\u2019s job to coordinate with federal agencies and that by extension, he does not own his agencies\u2019 failures. This shouldn\u2019t stand. All of this makes it easy for Mr. Trump to escape blame for his agencies\u2019 missteps. But this isn\u2019t normal. In an unwieldy bureaucracy, pressure and high-level oversight from the White House ensure that disaster response does not fall by the wayside. Where agencies are ill-equipped to handle the on-the-ground devastation and local authorities cannot fill the void, presidential leadership assumes greater import.Going forward, Mr. Trump must ensure that his agencies focus attention and resources on the resilient, sustainable rebuilding of the outdated power grid and on restoration of the water infrastructure and health care system in Puerto Rico to buttress the island against future disasters. If not, it\u2019s up to us, as fellow Americans, to hold him to task. The image of Mr. Trump lobbing rolls of paper towels to a crowd last October in Puerto Rico, arms arched, mimicking a basketball player, should rank high in the pantheon of presidential slip-ups. It brings to mind another iconic image \u2014 Mr. Bush surveilling Hurricane Katrina\u2019s wreckage in New Orleans, from Air Force One. Mr. Trump has defied many dogmas in politics.

This led my charcuterie salesman to believe that I myself was dead. Alarmed by my continued absence, and aware of my daily dining route, he hurried across the street to my wine guy to see if he had any news of me. I\u2019m the human equivalent of a stray dog who wanders from shop to shop in search of whoever will give me a snack.The ham shop is barely larger than a coffin and stacked floor to ceiling with pig parts. I come for the Snowballs, baseballs of sausage stuffed with black truffles and coated in Parmesan cheese. I stay for the company.The ham man is the biggest ham of all. He knows about every bad date I have. He even gave my phone number to a stranger he thought I would like. (I didn\u2019t.) Ours is not exactly the normal relationship between a shopkeeper and patron, but then again, not one of my food-based friendships is what you\u2019d call normal.I Snapchat with my cheesemonger. My barista lets me sneak in last night\u2019s open bottle of Champagne to wash down my morning doughnut. My chocolatier\u2019s daughter studying in New York has my sister\u2019s number in case of emergencies. I have cried into my wine guy\u2019s sweater more times than I can count, most recently when he moved away and I felt as if someone had cut off my limb. Where would I drink and weep now? At home, like a normal person?My cousin was shocked last fall when we walked into my other wine shop and my wine seller, Patty, who is also an astrologer and tarot reader, said that she had been debating whether to call me about something she had seen in my astrology chart.\u201cYour wine seller has your phone number?\u201d my cousin asked.Of course she has my number, I thought. How would I be able to confidently make terrible life choices if my wine-selling astrologer couldn\u2019t reach me?How have I made all of these food friends in Paris? I compulsively seek out people who are trapped behind counters and forced to listen to my tales of woe. I show up at the same places and overshare to people who are paid to be pleasant to me until they develop a form of Stockholm syndrome that makes us friends.It was startling to realize that my ham purveyor is a more consistent presence in my life than any friend, family member or romantic interest. Sometimes, I think I need to make some lifestyle changes so that the first person who would realize that I was missing or dead is not the man supporting my ham habit. Other days, when we\u2019ve had a good gossip and I\u2019m stuffed full of charcuterie and he has given me a pocket sausage for the road, I think I\u2019m doing it right after all.I used to be able to count on my mother to be the one to track me down in the event of my untimely murder; lord knows she has imagined plenty of gruesome ends for me. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times that public safety officers showed up on my doorstep in college because I hadn\u2019t returned her calls swiftly enough.Now, she doesn\u2019t know how to call my phone number in France. She struggles to put on her seatbelt. Her brain and body (and seatbelt) just don\u2019t click in the right way anymore.Two months after I moved to France, she learned she had Parkinson\u2019s disease, a degenerative brain disorder. My parents told us on Mother\u2019s Day. By us, I mean they told my two sisters in person and then, as a family, called me on Skype. Throughout that conversation, my mother\u2019s concern was not for herself or her future but for me, because they were together to process the news while I was alone.It\u2019s her greatest fear: one of her children, alone. A fear I have exacerbated by moving overseas. I didn\u2019t come here for a relationship; I came for a job. And when that job ended, I stayed, much to my mother\u2019s chagrin.To others, my life in Paris must seem fairly perfect, all croissants and long walks along the Seine. What people don\u2019t see: my chronically ill mother sobbing into my neck and begging me not to go. Me getting on that plane anyway, convinced I am some kind of monster.\u201cI only have a few more good years left,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s poignant because it\u2019s true. My friend Katie\u2019s father found out he had Parkinson\u2019s roughly seven years before my mother, so her family serves as a bellwether. Katie constantly reminds me to appreciate these moments because these are the good years, while the medication still works.Or mostly works. Last year, during three months of tonsillitis, I stayed with my parents in Massachusetts for medical care. I had a prescription nasal irrigator that required mineral water. When I requested that my mother purchase some, she proudly returned with a case of carbonated water. I had said \u201cmineral,\u201d hadn\u2019t I? She failed to see why sparkling mineral water was a problem.Yes, these are the good years, I had joked to myself as I waterboarded my sinuses with San Pellegrino so my mother wouldn\u2019t feel bad about her brain\u2019s inability to put all the pieces together.It\u2019s dangerous to define a person by disease. She is a person with Parkinson\u2019s, not Parkinson\u2019s itself. And by all evaluations, she\u2019s doing fairly well. She was able to dance at my younger sister\u2019s wedding last October. She got to be at the wedding in the first place. Not everyone is so lucky.And yet, the pain of watching a parent unravel, the grief, amorphous and real, of missing someone even as they stand beside you, takes its toll. I am losing my mother by inches. She\u2019s not here. She\u2019s still here.However hard it is for us to watch this new reality, it\u2019s even more difficult for her to experience it. Despite this, we have been able to maintain a gallows sense of humor in an attempt to productively deal with our pain. For the biennial Parkinson\u2019s Walk done in her honor, my sister named our team \u201cThe Movers and Shakers,\u201d because if you can\u2019t laugh at your mother\u2019s neurodegenerative disease, then what can you laugh at?When I was back in Boston recently, I stopped at her dry cleaner. Seeing that I was alone, the dry cleaner quietly asked if there was something wrong with my mother.\u201cShe\u2019s been coming here for the past 16 years and has always been so bubbly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now she asks me the same question over and over. She\u2019s slow and careful when she takes out her wallet to pay.\u201dI explained about Parkinson\u2019s and how there can be a dementia component for many people.She nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about your mother here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will always take care of her and help her get home.\u201dHer offer was so kind, I later cried in my car. It\u2019s a constant concern of mine: Who will help her when I am not here? The same concern, I imagine, that she feels for me. Who will help me when she is not here?My ham man, I want to reassure her, although I doubt that charcuterie holds much solace. You don\u2019t need to worry about me, I want to whisper. I have created something from nothing here. I have willed a way of life into being. I have found kinship networks in France that nourish me.\u201cMy mother was my first country, the first place I ever lived,\u201d the poet Nayyirah Waheed once wrote. My mother will always be my first home. But I have learned a second language, a second culture. I have learned how to build a home for myself in the world, and I have learned to be at home within myself.It is not an easy choice to build a life apart from the people I love. The only explanation I can offer is that maybe this is what I have been doing all along, looking for the people who will help me find my way back home, wherever that may be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Was Kavanaugh Obsessed With Vince Foster?", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe needs to explain why he followed right-wing conspiracy theories about the White House aide\u2019s suicide.Mr. Wilentz is a professor of history at Princeton.Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, has testified to the Senate that \u201ca good judge must be an umpire \u2014 a neutral and impartial arbiter.\u201d He and his supporters want us to believe that he would be such an umpire on the Supreme Court. But does his record support him? The refusal of the Senate Judiciary Committee majority to share thousands of highly pertinent documents naturally raises skepticism. But there is plenty already in the public record about which Judge Kavanaugh has yet to be held accountable. Anticipating the imminent publication of Kenneth Starr\u2019s memoir of the Clinton impeachment, I looked into Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s files in the Office of Independent Counsel records, housed in the National Archives. What I discovered sheds light on how Mr. Kavanaugh made his way in his early career, and how he flagrantly breached his role as a neutral public servant and followed the imperatives of a political operative.Mr. Kavanaugh served under Mr. Starr as associate independent counsel between 1994 and 1997, and then again in 1998. Although not yet a judge, he was charged with investigating impartially what Attorney General Janet Reno deemed substantial accusations of misconduct arising from a failed real estate investment known as Whitewater. Judge Starr\u2019s predecessor as independent counsel, Robert Fiske, had looked into unfounded claims that the White House counsel Vincent Foster, who committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park in 1993, had in fact been murdered as part of an alleged White House cover-up related to Whitewater. After a thorough investigation, Mr. Fiske concluded in 1994 that there was nothing to the conspiracy theories and that Mr. Foster, who suffered from depression, had indeed killed himself. Official accounts by the National Park Service in 1993 and by a Republican congressman, William Clinger, the ranking member of the House Government Affairs Committee in 1994, came to an identical conclusion, as did a bipartisan report of the Senate Banking Committee early in 1995. But shortly after the Senate report was released, Mr. Kavanaugh convinced Mr. Starr to reopen what he called a \u201cfull-fledged\u201d investigation of the Foster matter, telling his colleagues, as justification, that \u201cwe have received allegations that Mr. Foster\u2019s death related to President and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s involvement\u201d in Whitewater and other alleged scandals. Who were these unnamed, presumably reliable sources on whose word the case should be reopened? Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s files in the National Archives make clear that they were some of the most ludicrous hard-right conspiracy-mongers of the time.One was Reed Irvine, a self-appointed debunker of the \u201cfake news\u201d of mainstream media. Another was Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, an English author of a book entitled \u201cThe Secret Life of Bill Clinton\u201d that posited that the Oklahoma City bombing was an F.B.I. plot gone awry. A third was Christopher Ruddy, today the chief executive of Newsmax and confidant of President Trump, but at the time on the payroll of the right-wing tycoon Richard Mellon Scaife to promote conspiracies. As inventive as they were vindictive, these partisans concocted all sorts of wild theories to explain why Mr. Foster could not have killed himself. According to one of Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s sources, Mr. Foster had been working for the National Security Agency and was being blackmailed by the Israelis over a secret Swiss bank account. Carpet fibers had been found on Mr. Foster\u2019s clothing, which was proof positive that he was murdered, his body wrapped in a carpet and then dumped. Another charged that \u201clong blond hairs\u201d on Mr. Foster\u2019s clothing pointed to a cover-up.Mr. Kavanaugh noted in various memos that he personally believed that Mr. Foster had indeed committed suicide \u2014 \u201cmy thoughts, not the Office\u2019s position,\u201d he clarified at one point. But he did not file away the harebrained theories; instead, he apparently felt obligated to address the conspiracy-mongers\u2019 already disproved fantasies. And for nearly three years at a cost of $2 million he aggressively followed up. He investigated the Swiss bank account connection, down to examining Mr. Foster\u2019s American Express bills for flights to Switzerland. He meticulously examined the White House carpets, old and new. (By now, Mr. Foster had been dead four years.) He sent investigators in search of follicle specimens from Mr. Foster\u2019s bereft, blond, teenage daughter. (\u201cWe have Foster\u2019s hair,\u201d one agent working for Mr. Kavanaugh reported in triumph.) Mr. Kavanaugh apparently took a special interest in Hillary Clinton\u2019s bruited affair with Mr. Foster, a popular rumor in the fever swamps of the right. As he reported, his investigators \u201casked numerous people about it,\u201d before he decided to ask Mrs. Clinton herself. Of course, Mr. Kavanaugh proved nothing new, as there was nothing new to prove except in conspiratorial illusion. But there was nothing funny about his Inspector Clouseau performance. For months, his inquiries callously harassed a grieving family and Mr. Foster\u2019s friends. His office spread malicious sexual innuendo about Hillary Clinton, whom he seems to have regarded as prey. By reopening a closed investigation, he irresponsibly gave the Foster conspiracy freaks credibility to continue smearing the Clintons and poison public debate for another three years, all at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.Perhaps Brett Kavanaugh has changed his ways, just as he has changed his position on subjecting presidents to investigation. But he owes the Senate and the American public an explanation of what happened when he worked under Ken Starr\u2019s cover and how and whether he has become a different man than he was 20 years ago.

{"Headline": "Piano Lessons in the Panopticon", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Muhanna teaches literature at Brown University.PROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 A few years ago, I began taking jazz piano lessons on the internet.It had been almost a decade since my last lesson, the old-fashioned kind that involved driving to my teacher\u2019s house, sitting down at the piano in his cluttered living room and playing for an hour.This was different. Instead of meeting with a person, I stayed home and watched YouTube tutorials. I did this guiltily at first while searching for a real teacher but soon became absorbed by the wealth of instruction on every style of jazz that I found online. Some nights, I\u2019d take notes on a lesson about angular bebop patterns. Other nights, I\u2019d practice neo-soul grooves over a trap beat, trying to pick out a teenager\u2019s spontaneous jam on Instagram.Jazz is difficult to learn, both because of its complexity and because of its improvisational nature. Many players amass an encyclopedic knowledge of the music\u2019s structures, but learning to improvise is as much a bodily skill as a mental one.After a couple of years of diligent practice, I flew to St. Louis to meet the teacher I had spent hundreds of hours listening to. As an educator myself, I wanted to understand why my playing had improved so dramatically under his tutelage. I\u2019d been taking piano lessons since the age of 7, but no teacher had ever had such an effect on me. Was that his doing? Or is there something about the peculiar intimacy of the online lesson \u2014 the way it permits a student to scrutinize a teacher\u2019s subtlest movements \u2014 that has transformed the learning process?\u201cIt used to be that you could never find a cab in St. Louis, and then Uber came along. That\u2019s kind of how I think about the online lessons,\u201d he told me.\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what I was doing, but Wynton was so encouraging,\u201d he said. \u201cHe told me to transcribe Thelonious Monk\u2019s solos, and so I started dropping the needle on those records and trying to hear what Monk was playing.\u201d\u201cYeah, maybe we\u2019re making it too easy,\u201d Mr. Martin said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I wrestle with. You don\u2019t want it to be too easy, because you miss out on that grit that you get from having to learn it on your own.\u201dI nodded and began to respond before he interrupted, brightly, \u201cHey, want to have a piano lesson later?\u201dThe rest of the day passed in a fog.I heard my name being called. He was motioning me over to the piano.\u201cI thought it would be nice to tape a master class,\u201d he said as someone clipped a microphone to my shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sure the members will get a lot out of it.\u201dTwo worlds had collided, and I was stuck between them. The pressure of an old-fashioned piano lesson was poised to be magnified by the panopticon of the internet.\u201cSo, what did you have in mind to play today?\u201d he asked.I played the first thing that popped into my head: His own arrangement of the Gershwin standard \u201cLove Is Here to Stay.\u201d When the time came for a solo, I played the one that Mr. Martin had improvised spontaneously in the lesson, which I\u2019d transcribed and learned like a bedtime prayer. \u201cWow,\u201d he said when I came to a clattering halt. \u201cI played all that?\u201dI don\u2019t remember much of what happened over the next hour. I felt like I was wandering through a musical hall of mirrors: Here was the teacher commenting on the student\u2019s performance of the teacher\u2019s own solo. It was uncanny, yet it made sense. Hadn\u2019t I spent the last two years inspired by Martin\u2019s beautiful performances, studying his tics and flourishes and trying to make them my own?The technological aspects of our encounter suddenly seemed irrelevant. Inspiration and imitation were the true teachers, as they\u2019d always been.Elias Muhanna is the Manning Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at Brown University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Is Trump Tacitly Supporting Corruption in Guatemala?", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe administration\u2019s silence empowers President Jimmy Morales to continue ruling with impunity. Mr. Goldman is a novelist and journalist who has covered Latin America for decades.Last week, Mr. Morales went on to bar Mr. Velazquez, who was in Washington for meetings, from re-entering the country. On Sunday, Guatemala\u2019s Constitutional Court ruled that Mr. Morales had to readmit Mr. Velazquez. The Morales government responded by demanding that the United Nations nominate a new commissioner. The United States supplies 40 percent of Cicig\u2019s funding, and historically Cicig has received firm support from American presidents, both Republican and Democratic. But as tensions have risen between Mr. Morales and the commission, the Trump administration has been too quiet. The administration\u2019s tough-talking foreign policy chiefs \u2014 including President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton \u2014 are not standing up to a leader who faces credible accusations of corruption and is aggressively defying a United States ambassador. The administration\u2019s silence helps pave the way for a possible coup, and chaos and violence that would most likely result. One firm step by the Trump administration could be enough to stop Mr. Morales\u2019s dangerous gambit. Mr. Trump or his lieutenants could join the United States Congress in threatening to cut off economic assistance to Guatemala. They could slash military aid. They could reiterate their support for Cicig\u2019s anticorruption work, including its investigation of Mr. Morales.Some commentators say that the Trump administration wants to reward Mr. Morales for moving the Guatemalan Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Others speculate that Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers fear provoking Mr. Morales into swapping American patronage for that of China.But it\u2019s important to remember why Cicig was founded. In the post-civil war period, elite Guatemalan military officers, politicians and other powerful groups and individuals, recognizing that the era of Cold War American largess and unconditional support was over, found a new master: organized crime.An international solution is needed to fight transnational crime. This insight led to the establishment of Cicig. Those are important words. But when it comes to Guatemala, the Trump administration appears to have a different standard. Instead, in his silence, Mr. Trump is embracing corruption and organized crime.Francisco Goldman, a novelist and journalist, is a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frustration and Finger-Pointing as G.O.P. Pulls Out of Deal Talks on Hacked Materials", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans withdrew on Thursday from negotiations with Democrats over a pact that would have effectively barred both parties from using hacked or stolen material on the campaign trail this fall.Leaders of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, and their counterparts at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had labored for much of the summer over rules that would have governed the way the congressionally run committees and their candidates treated material like the thousands of pages of damaging Democratic documents stolen and leaked by Russian hackers in 2016.Instead, the two parties were left on Thursday exchanging shots just two months before Election Day; Republicans claimed that Democrats had negotiated in bad faith and violated an agreement not to speak about the negotiations publicly, and Democrats said that Republicans were merely searching for an excuse to pull out. It only fed the complaint by Democrats that Republican lawmakers have resisted bridging partisan divisions in the two years since Russia began its brazen attack on the American political system.\u201cNegotiations are about trust. Once that trust is breached, there is simply no way to reach an agreement,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the Republican committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a pledge to do what we planned to do already. And we\u2019re certainly not going to be a pawn in someone\u2019s publicity stunt.\u201dHouse Republicans \u201care not seeking hacked materials,\u201d Mr. Gorman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want hacked materials. We have no intention of using hacked materials.\u201dDemocrats strongly rebutted that claim, accusing Republicans of slow-walking negotiations before pulling the plug based on a benign press interview.\u201cWe have been clear from Day 1 that the D.C.C.C. will not use stolen hacked materials for political gain, and have been negotiating in good faith for three months to get the N.R.C.C. on the same page,\u201d said Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, the chairman of the Democratic committee. \u201cThe N.R.C.C. has needlessly delayed and made one excuse after another, and I\u2019m incredibly disappointed that they have backed out of this commitment not to use stolen hacked materials. This is a sad day for our democracy.\u201dThe two sides had been close to reaching an agreement as recently as the past week or so, according to officials involved in the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the talks. But a key difference of opinion remained over how to deal with hacked or stolen material that entered the public domain through news or other sources. Republicans argued that such material had to be fair game and that to ask candidates not to seize on news reports was unnecessarily prohibitive. Democrats countered that any agreement would be toothless without such a provision.As recently as Tuesday evening, Democrats proposed a draft of the agreement that would have required the two committees to pledge that they would not \u201cuse known stolen or hacked information, or promote or disseminate hacked materials to the press, regardless of the source,\u201d according to an official familiar with the latest version.The draft\u2019s other provisions included a pledge not to aid hacking efforts, not to seek out hacked or stolen materials, and to report any contacts with foreign actors to law enforcement authorities. The Democratic committee and its candidates plan to honor the draft\u2019s provisions.Without a deal, the parties will be left to more or less set their own standards, as they have in past election cycles. Outside political advocacy groups, which are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars on House races this fall, would not have been subject to the pledge.The hackers also released the home addresses, phone numbers and personal email addresses of Democratic House members.News outlets widely reported on the hacked campaign material, amplifying the impact of the Russian intrusion, in the run-up to the 2016 election. And after a Republican political advertisement aired that appeared to use hacked materials, Mr. Luj\u00e1n wrote a letter that August warning the Republican congressional committee that it would be complicit in Russia\u2019s influence campaign if it continued to use hacked or stolen material.American intelligence officials and technology titans like Facebook and Microsoft said they have seen evidence that Russia continues to actively interfere in the American political process. But there has not been evidence made public to suggest that Russia or any other state actor has penetrated the networks of candidates or either campaign committee.Advertisement"}

Mr. Greenidge was then working in the office of the New York mayor as an assistant director for external affairs, and Ms. Davidson was a regional political director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.A mutual friend introduced them moments after another friend had finished telling Mr. Greenidge that he needed to open himself up to the possibility of meeting someone. \u201cShe left to have a drink and I turned around and Linara was there,\u201d he said.Ms. Davidson said that Mr. Greenidge made an immediate impression on her, too. \u201cTo be honest, when I saw him \u2014 and it\u2019s a wonky thing to say \u2014 the moment that I saw him, something said to me in my head, that is my husband right there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it.\u201d\u201cIt took me 35 years to meet him, but we\u2019ve been in the same room the whole time and didn\u2019t even know it,\u201d she said.The next day, Mr. Greenidge asked Ms. Davidson if she would have lunch with him two days later, when they were back in New York City, and they agreed to meet at his favorite Thai place, which was just around the corner from the Clinton campaign office in Brooklyn.She arrived at the date wearing Converse sneakers, he remembers, which were his personal favorite footwear.

{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Is Coming Apart", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not just the Kavanaugh mess. Over the long term, the court risks a crisis of legitimacy.Opinion ColumnistThe Supreme Court is an unusual institution, because it somehow manages to be both majestic and intimate.The court is housed in a marble temple with soaring columns, and it has made some of the most consequential decisions in American history. But it feels like a simpler institution than either the presidency or Congress. Its arguments are not televised but are open to the public. Spectators are often surprised by the courtroom\u2019s modest size. Outside the court, the nine justices tend to lead more normal day-to-day lives than senators, governors or other grandees.This combination has long allowed the court to embody the American ideal of democratic government \u2014 powerful yet humble \u2014 and many people have revered it as a result.But today the Supreme Court is in trouble. And the issues are much larger than the mess of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Absent some kind of course correction, the court risks a crisis of legitimacy.[Receive the day's most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]And the biggest damage from the court\u2019s partisanship doesn\u2019t even come from the nasty confirmation battles. It comes from the fact that a major American institution defines itself in an evidently false way. Hypocrisy isn\u2019t good for credibility.The second major threat to the court comes from the radicalness of Republican-appointed justices.Already, the Roberts court has often shown itself to be zealously activist. It has thrown out bipartisan legislation on voting rights and campaign finance. It has overruled decades-old precedents on labor unions, antitrust and criminal justice.So what can be done about the court? There are no easy solutions.A less palatable option is for Democrats to expand the court when they next control Washington. Given the outrage of the Garland nomination, Democrats are right to be thinking about this. But I hope they don\u2019t have to resort to it, because it would risk a tit-for-tat battle that could do even more damage.Roberts is never going to turn into a liberal. But it is reasonable to hope that he will show more of the small-c conservatism that the Supreme Court needs. If he allows it to become an all-powerful version of Congress where the legislators happen to wear robes, both his legacy and the country will suffer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Smorgasbord Recession? (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next slump may have multiple causes.Opinion ColumnistThe thing is, there\u2019s nothing out there as obvious as the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, or even the tech bubble of the late 1990s. So here\u2019s my thought: maybe the next recession won\u2019t be caused by one big shock but instead by the combined impact of several smaller shocks. There are arguably several mid-sized bubbles out there, from private equity debt to emerging markets. Stocks are priced as if there\u2019s no risk despite omens of trade war, consumer confidence similarly seems to discount dangers. There\u2019s probably other stuff I\u2019m missing.The point, anyway, is that we might be looking at a smorgasbord recession, one that involves a mix of smallish things rather than a single dominant item. And there\u2019s a model for that kind of recession: the slump of the early 1990s.Most modern recessions have had clear narratives, at least after the fact. The 79-82 double dip was about the Fed tightening to bring inflation down; 2001 was about the tech bubble; 2007-2009 about the housing bust and the financial crisis it triggered. But I\u2019ve been reading various accounts of 1990-91, and they\u2019re kind of amorphous.One piece was a boom and bust in commercial real estate, partly connected with the savings-and-loan crisis and aftermath, which led to a sharp drop in nonresidential construction:Another piece was a drop in consumer confidence, brought on by oil price hikes and Gulf War jitters:Yet another piece was the post-Cold War drawdown in defense spending:So, no one overarching narrative, but the combination was enough to cause a recession. It was a fairly brief, shallow recession compared with the big slumps of 79-82 and 2007-9:But recovery was sluggish and for a long time jobless, with unemployment continuing to rise long after the official end of the recession:So here\u2019s my hypothesis: the next slump won\u2019t be a big bang like 2008, it will be a smorgasbord recession like 1990-1, the cumulation of a bunch of medium-sized issues.You might ask why multiple issues should strike at the same time. The answer, in two words, is Hyman Minsky: after a long period of stable growth, lenders and investors get complacent, and the private sector overreaches.And we\u2019re likely to have a big problem with the zero lower bound. The Fed cut rates by around 5 percentage points in the face of the 1990 recession, and still got a jobless recovery:This time around the Fed doesn\u2019t have 5 percentage points to cut \u2014 it only has 2. And no, that\u2019s not a reason to raise rates faster, to make room for later cuts; it\u2019s a reason to not raise rates until inflation is significantly higher, and hope that we\u2019ve gotten to 3 or 4 percent before the smorgasbord attacks.So those are my current thoughts on the next recession. When will it happen? (Looks at watch.) Actually, I have no idea. But it would be really strange if it doesn\u2019t happen within a few years at most.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What to Do When Your Phone or Tablet Won\u2019t Charge", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf your phone just stops charging, even when it\u2019s plugged in, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s time to shop for a new one. Here are a few simple steps you can take before calling the pros or opening your wallet.You go to plug in your phone, and \u2026 you\u2019re not getting any power. Maybe it says \u201cNot Charging\u201d in the corner. Maybe it says it\u2019s charging, but the battery doesn\u2019t seem to be going up at all. Or maybe your phone isn\u2019t even recognizing that it\u2019s plugged in. Whatever the case, here are a few troubleshooting tips to get your phone juiced back up.Let\u2019s start with the obvious: your cable or wall adapter could be damaged, resulting in a bad connection that leaves your phone deprived of power. If you have another charger lying around, try a different cable, adapter, and even a different wall outlet. If your phone charges fine after swapping those out, you know one of them is probably the culprit, and can start doing some detective work to narrow it down.In some cases, you may just be using the wrong charger \u2014 not all adapters are rated for the same power delivery. (The wall adapter that came with your old e-reader probably won\u2019t charge your new iPad Pro, for example.) In that case, you just need to make sure you use the right one for the right device.While we\u2019re at it, make sure you plug your device directly into a wall outlet. Plugging your device into a computer (or a USB hub meant for computers) may not provide enough juice for your device to charge. Even if your USB hub has a dedicated AC cable plugged into the wall, the ports themselves may not be rated for the level of power delivery your device requires.This is more common with tablets (which require more power to charge at a decent rate), but it can happen with phones too on certain USB hubs. If you\u2019re plugged into a power strip, take the charger out and try plugging it into a wall too, since you never know when a power strip\u2019s port might die. The fewer links in the chain between your phone and the wall, the better.It sounds silly, but charging problems can often be something as simple as a dirty charging port. When your phone lives in your pocket, it\u2019s bound to pick up a little dust and lint, and every time you plug in your cable, you pack that lint in a little tighter. Eventually it may prevent the cable from connecting securely in the charging port. If you have a USB-C device, the \u201ctab\u201d in the center of the port may also be a little bent, causing similar problems.Thankfully, both issues can be solved with a simple toothpick. Stick it into the port (lightly, lest you risk breaking the tip inside your phone) and try to grab any dust or debris that has accumulated inside. If you have a bent tab, gently bend it back toward the center and try plugging your phone in again. You may be shocked to find that a little toothpick surgery was all you needed to bring back its full charging capabilities.If your phone says it\u2019s charging but the battery indicator barely seems to move, it could be because you\u2019re using your phone too much while charging it. You won\u2019t likely notice this if you\u2019re just browsing Facebook, but if you\u2019re playing games, using turn-by-turn navigation, or running some other power-hungry app while plugged in, your phone can discharge as quickly as it charges. So if you\u2019re having problems, try plugging in your phone and letting it sit for a while. If the battery percentage increases normally, it\u2019s likely that nothing\u2019s wrong with your device \u2014 you just need to charge it during low-usage periods. And don\u2019t worry about putting it in Airplane Mode or turning it off \u2014 that will only shave a few minutes off the charging time. Just try to charge it when you aren\u2019t actively using it.If none of the above options helps you diagnose the problem, you\u2019ll need to consider the possibility that your phone is damaged or defective. When that happens, your only course of action \u2014 short of opening up your phone yourself \u2014 is to take it to the manufacturer. If you have an iPhone or iPad, that means a (relatively) easy trip to the Apple store, but for other phones, you\u2019ll likely have to contact the manufacturer\u2019s customer support line and send your phone in for repair. Depending on the problem and whether your phone is still under warranty, you may have to pay for the fix \u2014 and go without your phone while it gets repaired \u2014 but either way, it\u2019s bound to be cheaper than buying a new phone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Finally Makes a Friend", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president may be shunned nearly everywhere but at the bottom of the world he has finally found a loyal mate.Opinion ColumnistCANBERRA, Australia \u2014 President Trump has admitted he feels \u201camazingly alone\u201d in the midst of all his scraps with allies and snarls with undermining advisers.But there is someone \u2014 at the very bottom of the world in the land of Mad Max \u2014 who wants to play ball with the Mad King. In the Trump era, we can rewrite the maxim to be: If you want a friend in politics, get an Aussie.\u201cI think we both get it,\u201d Australia\u2019s new prime minister, Scott Morrison, cheerily told me in his office in Parliament House. Even though Australia did not get rocked by a recession like the U.S. did, Morrison says some people feel forgotten, left off the globalism gravy train. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we get. The president gets that. I get it.\u201dIn 2002, ice skater Steven Bradbury became the first Australian to win a Winter Olympic gold medal when his three top rivals crashed in a last-minute pileup. The right-wing Peter Dutton kicked off the coup that felled Malcolm Turnbull, but then the slimy Dutton and the soign\u00e9e Julie Bishop crashed in a pileup that allowed the unprepossessing Morrison to glide across the finish line.ScoMo, as the Antipodean prime minister is nicknamed, was not particularly well known but had clearly had his skates laced up for some time. He got off to a fast start, flying to Indonesia to negotiate a trade deal; visiting the outback to spotlight his focus on the drought (even though he absurdly told me about climate change that \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant to the discussion about how we\u2019re helping farmers\u201d and urged drought victims to \u201cpray for that rain\u201d); and vowing to pass a religious freedom bill in determinedly secular Australia, where Pentecostals are commonly referred to as \u201chappy clappers.\u201dI wonder if, like Karen Pence, the devout Morrison was bothered by Trump\u2019s flouting of the Commandments. (Thou Shalt Not Covet All the Playmates and Porn Stars at a Lake Tahoe Golf Tournament.)\u201cWell,\u201d he demurred, \u201cI just take people as I know them.\u2019\u2019It\u2019s apparent that he doesn\u2019t know Trump yet, describing him as \u201cvery practical\u201d and someone \u201cwho\u2019s not going to waste a day.\u201d\u201cI like that about him,\u201d enthused Morrison, who is obviously ready to do the Aussie equivalent of the Saudi sword dance. \u201cI like that about him a lot, actually.\u2019\u2019The president called the new prime minister the day after he took office. \u201cI told the president I was a rubbish golfer,\u201d Morrison said, with a wide smile, describing the 12-minute call. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that phrase is well known and I think he thought I meant I was a good golfer because he started going \u2018Oh, what\u2019s your handicap?\u2019 And I said \u2018No, no, no, it means I\u2019m not very good at it.\u2019 He\u2019s passionate about it. He knows all the Australian players.\u201dThe 50-year-old father of two is the son of a police officer, not a scion of wealth. But the two share similarities: Both expediently lurched to the right on social issues. Both throw red meat to the base. Both craft their political identities with dog whistles around the issue of protecting their countries from hordes of migrants.Before now, Morrison was best known for his campaign as immigration minister to \u201cStop the Boats,\u201d turning back vessels of migrants trying to reach the shores of Fortress Australia.His office features a model migrant boat bearing the proud declaration \u201cI Stopped These,\u201d and a cabinet adorned with a Jesus shrine and a biblical proverb to \u201cTrust in the Lord.\u201d Morrison, who did not condemn Trump\u2019s infamous travel ban, is never able to convincingly explain how he reconciles his Christian values and the role he plays in dooming children to offshore detention centers.Morrison said he is also excited to deepen his relationship with fellow evangelical Mike Pence, who was dispatched for cleanup duty after Trump shredded one of our closest relationships. Pence and Morrison were not in favor of same-sex marriage. When a popular Australian rugby player stated his belief on Instagram last spring that gays who don\u2019t \u201crepent of their sins and turn to God\u201d are going to hell, Morrison chimed in, saying, \u201cGood for him for standing up for his faith.\u2019\u2019We were meeting as Washington was in full Munch \u201cScream\u201d mode after the double blow of Bob Woodward\u2019s book and The Times\u2019s anonymous op-ed piece, both depicting the president as a danger to America. Woodward\u2019s book revealed that Trump had planned to lie to Turnbull about steel tariffs.So does all this volatility and immorality make Morrison nervous?\u201cWe look through the dust,\u2019\u2019 he replied, breezily.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Teaching in the Age of School Shootings", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "Teachers were the first responders. Before police officers and medics arrived, they gathered sobbing, vomiting, bleeding kids into the safest rooms they could find, then locked the doors and kept vigil with them through the stunned and terrified wait. They shepherded the injured to hospitals in their own cars. And they knelt on the ground with the ones who were too wounded to move, stanching blood flow with their own hands and providing whatever comfort and assurance they could muster.Superintendent Trent Lovett was just walking into his office, a short distance from the high school, when Principal Patricia Greer called to tell him that at least one student was down. He jumped back in his truck and raced up the access road that connected the two buildings, calling his own freshman daughter along the way to make sure she was safe. When he arrived, he saw that several students had been shot and that each of them was being attended to by at least one faculty or staff member. They had no clue where the shooter was, or if he was coming back, Lovett thought. And they didn\u2019t know if there were other shooters \u2014 or bombs or other weapons \u2014 in the offing. Hadn\u2019t some mass shooters rigged their targets in advance with explosives? Police and ambulance were on their way, his own daughter was safe and the students who weren\u2019t wounded had either fled or were hiding with other educators. So Lovett did the next thing he could think to do: He grabbed an aluminum bat from an abandoned bag of sports equipment and went looking for the teenage boy with the gun.Lovett returned to the commons and took stock. The floor was slicked with blood and spilled beverages and littered with abandoned backpacks. Dozens of cellphones rang without pause. One staff member was tending to Preston Cope, a sophomore whose family Lovett knew well and who appeared to have been shot in the head. Cope\u2019s phone was ringing, too, and for a split second Lovett considered ignoring it. The screen read \u201cDad,\u201d and Lovett was not practiced in delivering such news. But he quickly thought better of that impulse, remembering how desperate he had been for information after one of his own children was in an ultimately fatal car accident. He answered the phone, told Cope\u2019s father that his son was not O.K., then issued a quick string of instructions: Hurry. Be safe. Pray.Teachers are at the quiet center of this recurring national horror. They are victims and ad hoc emergency workers, often with close ties to both shooter and slain and with decades-long connections to the school itself. But they are also, almost by definition, anonymous public servants accustomed to placing their students\u2019 needs above their own. And as a result, our picture of their suffering is incomplete.We know that the trauma that teachers experience after a school shooting can be both severe and enduring. \u201cTheir PTSD can be as serious as what you see in soldiers,\u201d says Robert Pynoos, co-director of the federally funded National Center for Child Traumatic Stress, which helps schools coordinate their responses to traumatic events. \u201cBut unlike soldiers, none of them signed up for this, and none of them have been trained to cope with it.\u201d We know that teachers who were least able to protect their students in the moment tend to be especially traumatized. \u201cFor teachers, the duty to educate students is primary,\u201d Pynoos says. \u201cBut the urge to protect those students is deeper than that.\u201d And we know that their symptoms can include major sleep disturbance, hair-trigger startle responses and trouble regulating emotions.But we don\u2019t know much else. Researchers have calculated the rates of PTSD for a host of other traumatic experiences, estimating that it affects up to 20 percent of combat soldiers and 40 percent of rape survivors. But we have no analogous statistics for educators who survive school shootings, nor any sense of how such an experience \u2014 not to mention its hyperpoliticized, media-frenzied aftermath \u2014 might affect their ability to teach or their long-term career trajectories. \u201cThose are important questions that really need further study,\u201d Pynoos says.In the meantime, teachers who survived shootings are doing what they can to fill in the blanks themselves. Paula Reed, an English teacher who once taught Dylan Klebold and who retired from Columbine this spring, says that she and her colleagues reach out to schools after every incident \u2014 \u201cColumbine always calls,\u201d she says \u2014 to offer support and answer whatever questions they can. The questions, she says, are always the same: How long until I feel better? Will I ever be able to teach again? When will I get my old self back? Reed tries to tell the teachers the things she wishes someone had told her, starting with the fact that it takes years \u2014 not weeks \u2014 to recover. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many people don\u2019t get that,\u201d she says. \u201cSix weeks after Sandy Hook, some parents and spouses were already asking why the teachers weren\u2019t better yet.\u201dFor years, she and a few others had these conversations through an informal network. A shooting would make headlines, and they would contact the school directly, or teachers would come to them independently, seeking perspective and guidance. This year, Reed created a private Facebook page specifically for fellow educator-survivors. It has 62 members so far. \u201cThis was my last year teaching,\u201d Reed says. \u201cAnd it was, sadly, filled with school shootings.\u201d Four weeks after the Marshall County shooting, a former student killed three educators and 14 students and wounded 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. And three months after that, another school shooter, in Santa Fe, Tex., killed eight students and two teachers and injured 13 others.In the aftermath of those events, politicians, policymakers, health officials and entrepreneurs have proffered a litany of solutions to what is now commonly thought of as the school-shooting problem. Among other things, schools have been advised to teach teachers to use tourniquets; ramp up active-shooter drills; get rid of active-shooter drills; ban backpacks; make backpacks bulletproof; teach teachers to teach compassion. Forget compassion, teach them to use guns. Forget compassion and guns and teach them how to identify budding psychopaths before they blossom into murderers. For the teachers themselves, each demand brings its own implicit expectations and its own fresh roster of uncertainties. Should they be prepared to take a bullet for their charges? To shoot one student for the sake of protecting others? Is it their job to prevent these things from happening in the first place?Cory Westerfield, a teacher of algebra and German and the girls\u2019 track coach, was adamant that his students not live in fear forever. When the starting pistol sent one of his star athletes into a panic, right as she was preparing to do the triple jump, he coaxed her onto the field, gently but firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to walk down there really, really slowly,\u201d he said, pointing to the other side of the field. \u201cAnd then walk back really, really slowly.\u201d Living in fear was not really living, he told her. It was just existing. And he wanted them to do more than just exist.The teachers were harder on themselves, though. They, too, had meltdowns: in rushing crowds, at airports, when they were momentarily separated from their own children. They sometimes berated themselves for these reactions, aware that others around them had been through much worse. Westerfield thought of Mathis\u2019s getting literal blood on her hands and felt ashamed of his own tears. Mathis thought of other teachers \u2014 who, after the E.M.T.s took the most severely injured away, followed the trails of blood to other students who needed help \u2014 and despaired that she had not gone with them. Kelly Weaver thought of her own children and how, at the end of the day, she could still go home and hug them.What troubled Westerfield most was that none of them had seen it coming. After two decades of teaching, he considered himself a skilled reader of teenagers. He liked to think he could tell when something was bothering one of them just by how they walked into his classroom. But with this boy \u2014 this shooter \u2014 he had detected nothing. Parker sat in Westerfield\u2019s German class for two school years in a row. He could hold an adult conversation. He had friends. He was making decent grades. And, as far as anyone could tell, he was not being bullied. (Parker\u2019s trial date is pending, and in the absence of a plea from his lawyer, the judge in the case has entered an automatic plea of not guilty.) If a boy like that could suddenly turn murderous, then in theory, any one of their students could do anything. Whom could they trust \u2014 how could they trust \u2014 after something like this? And if the answer was that they couldn\u2019t, what then?Jenny Darnall decided to re-evaluate her understanding of what it meant to be a teacher in the first place. She had never been particularly compassionate with the students. The way she saw it, her job was to educate them, not give them advice they should be getting from their parents. But now, she felt as if God were telling her to step up and do more: Call parents more and tell them the hard truths she might normally expect them to discover on their own. Talk to the kids more too. Tell them that they are loved, even when they\u2019re being terrible. Those things did not feel like part of her job. But maybe now they would have to be.The school\u2019s culinary instructor, Amy Cathey, was uncertain about these shifting boundaries. A few students had called her seeking practical advice about how to navigate their trauma outside school \u2014 for instance, how to tell their own parents that the prospect of lighting fireworks terrified them. Cathey didn\u2019t mind the calls, or the questions. But she wondered what would happen when she wasn\u2019t there. She worried about the graduating seniors. And she dreaded returning to anything resembling those eight or so weeks after the shooting, when it felt as if she took care of everyone except herself. She loved her kids. But she also knew herself, and she knew she couldn\u2019t sustain that anymore.In May, Marshall Strong signs were still everywhere; they wobbled in people\u2019s front yards, hung from doors in floral wreaths, peeked out the back windows of cars. There were even some billboards still up along the highway. Some of the teachers had grown weary of these signs. They weren\u2019t over what had happened, of course. But they were ready to will themselves into the next phase of recovery, whatever that might be. This was a tricky place to be, in part because not everyone reached it at the same time. Westerfield waited until the school year officially ended, and not a second longer, to take the Marshall Strong sign out of his own yard.But Mathis couldn\u2019t bring herself to take the Marshall Strong bracelet off, and her husband was worried. They lost a pregnancy early in their marriage, and he remembered how afterward she refused to remove the hospital bracelet; doing so, he suspected, would somehow make the miscarriage real to her. He worried that the Marshall bracelet was having the same effect \u2014 facilitating a denial that would ultimately keep her from moving on. She managed to tuck the bracelet away in a drawer by summer, but even then, a part of her wanted to put it back on, as if by doing so she could unmake the entire nightmare.From the inside, a mass shooting can feel distinctly unchartable. But Reed \u2014 and Pynoos, and Melissa Brymer, his colleague at the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress \u2014 say that while each school shooting is different in its particulars, several features are common to all. For example, Brymer says, it can be the secondary trauma that undoes a school\u2019s recovery. \u201cAfter a shooting, everyone wants to talk about how to find the next shooter so that this doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Brymer says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what the school itself needs to focus on. We\u2019ve had suicides, car accidents, overdoses.\u201d For a school that\u2019s already traumatized, she says, these follow-up events can be incredibly devastating.Brymer advises schools to conduct mental-health screenings before anniversaries, to find the people who are struggling most and help them. The hierarchy of hurt can split in surprising ways. For the most part, people closest to the carnage are the most traumatized, and people farther away are less so. But any teacher might be plagued by any number of things, including what they saw and how they responded in the moment. One educator might flee the building in a panic, leaving his students behind, only to be devastated by guilt afterward. Another might behave heroically, then seethe with resentment over not getting enough recognition. Each will need counseling and support to fully recover.A common lament among educator-survivors is the way that personal boundaries shift within the school community. Abbey Clements, who taught second grade at Sandy Hook, says that after the shooting, she would take her entire class to the bathroom at the same time, so that no one would have to leave her sight. But as they drew their students close, she says, she and her colleagues distanced themselves from one another. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid that if you start talking about your own trauma, you might trigger someone else\u2019s,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re also afraid of looking weak or unstable, afraid you\u2019ll be asked to leave or take leave if you admit how much you\u2019re struggling.\u201dAs a result, many teachers bury their fear and anger and guilt, until it changes into something else entirely. The question of where to erect a memorial, or when to take one down, can create fierce divisions. So might similar questions about how long to allow comfort dogs on campus, or what to do with the mountain of gifts and condolences that pile up. Students may come close to blows over whether to discuss the shooting during class time. Teachers may feel close to doing the same. \u201cIt\u2019s not all \u2018Kumbaya,\u2019\u2009\u201d Clements says. \u201cWhen the system is cracked by a trauma of this magnitude, a lot of stuff leaks out. It gets messy. And it can change relationships.\u201dThe job itself also changes. Reed spent the rest of her career vaguely wary of all her students. \u201cYou still love them,\u201d she says, \u201cand you still bond with them. But you never again feel certain that none of them would ever kill you.\u201d Even teachers who love what they do may think about doing something else. \u201cIf your bank got robbed while you were in it, you would never go to that bank again,\u201d Clements says. \u201cBut with this, you have to go back every single day.\u201d And leaving is not as easy as it sounds. Relocating can cost hard-won seniority and the salary that goes with it. And separating yourself from the people you just survived a shooting with can be excruciating. \u201cThey\u2019re the people that trigger you most,\u201d Clements says. \u201cBut they\u2019re also the only ones who understand what you\u2019re going through. Because how can anyone understand this that hasn\u2019t been through it?\u201dMatthew Mayer, a professor of educational psychology at Rutgers\u2019 Graduate School of Education, says that among experts the best solutions to school shootings are not really in dispute: basic gun control, more and better mental-health services and a robust national threat-assessment program. We also need to help educators create an atmosphere where students who hear about a potential threat feel comfortable sharing that information with adults. (Many student shooters, including Gabe Parker at Marshall County, hint about their plans to at least one other person or tell them outright. Getting those others to inform teachers is one of our best options for preventing shootings from happening in the first place.)In February, Mayer and his colleagues circulated an eight-point document titled \u201cA Call for Action to Prevent Gun Violence in the United States of America,\u201d which summarized these and other key actions needed to reduce the risk of school shootings. So far, 4,400 educators and public-health experts have signed it. But political will is still missing. \u201cWe keep revisiting the same conversations every five or six years without learning or changing much of anything,\u201d Mayer says. \u201cArmed guards and metal detectors make it look like you\u2019re doing something. You get far fewer points for talking about school climate and mental health.\u201dThe Marshall County school district banned book bags, installed metal detectors at the high school and hired four additional resource officers (armed deputy sheriffs). But Superintendent Lovett agrees that much more is needed. \u201cWe\u2019ve made ourselves a fairly hard target,\u201d he says. \u201cBut truthfully, can I sit here and guarantee you that it\u2019s never going to happen again? No, I can\u2019t.\u201dBefore the shooting, Westerfield always said he would quit or retire early if something like this happened. \u201cI\u2019m not dying on the job,\u201d he would quip. But returning felt like a sacred duty. How could any teacher who might replace him possibly understand what his students had been through? For that matter, how would any other school district understand what he had been through? At the same time, though, he was weary with grief. \u201cThere\u2019s this thing inside each of us now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost something that we can never get back.\u201dFor Superintendent Lovett, who graduated from Marshall some 35 years ago, it came down to the simple fact that times had changed. Back then, as many kids as not had hunting rifles in their trucks, and no one ever brought a gun into the building. But, he thought, it was the lot of educators to serve as a constant, for both their students and the wider community. In four short years, every kid who survived the shooting would be gone from the school. For the most part, faculty and staff members would remain. They helped their students through the shooting and its excruciating aftermath. And they would be there this fall to see them through the year that followed. \u201cStudents eventually move on,\u201d he said. \u201cEducators really don\u2019t.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misquoted Robert Pynoos. He said: \u201cFor teachers, the duty to educate students is primary. But the urge to protect those students is deeper than that.\u201d He did not say, \u201cIt\u2019s primal.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Funerals, Skirmishes and Protests: Photographing Ireland in the Time of Bobby Sands", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSThe French photojournalist Yan Morvan covered Northern Ireland in 1981 when Bobby Sands, a member of the I.R.A., died of a hunger strike. Mr. Morvan\u2019s images are on exhibit at the Visa Pour l\u2019Image festival in Perpignan, France, this week.The French photojournalist Yan Morvan was covering Northern Ireland during the hunger strike, photographing protests, skirmishes with British soldiers and the police, funerals, and the daily life of Catholics. Though Mr. Morvan, who was also 27 that year, never met Mr. Sands, the battle between a few hunger strikers and the government of Margaret Thatcher dominated Northern Ireland. \u201cIt was like the biblical story of David and Goliath,\u201d he said. While he was attracted to the story of Mr. Sands, who he thought was \u201clike a Christian martyr of old sacrificing his life to a greater cause,\u201d Mr. Morvan said he had no illusions about some of the activities of the I.R.A.\u2019s military wing, which included bombing civilian targets. With it being a highly secretive organization existing in the shadows of life in Belfast, Mr. Morvan was rarely able to cover its members outside of funerals. But because the I.R.A. \u201csent the kids to fight on the front line to impress the reporters and photographers,\u201d he said it was easy to work the streets. \u201cI would spend all day photographing in the streets and every night in the pubs photographing the Irish people, who were so friendly \u2014 but at times I needed a translator because their accents could be so thick, \u201d he said.Still, there were risks. While he was photographing a skirmish between the kids and the police, a plastic bullet fired by the police hit his Leica M5 camera and rendered it useless. The Good Friday peace accords of 1998 were signed by Ireland and Britain with the agreement of most of Northern Ireland\u2019s political parties. The pact has at times been tenuous, but the sectarian violence has mostly subsided. Since then, the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland has essentially disappeared with the removal of checkpoints between the countries.But the impending departure of Britain from the European Union has raised questions about the treaty\u2019s future, since Ireland would remain in the European Union while Northern Ireland, as part of Britain, would not, potentially reinstating a controlled border between the two Irelands. This is the latest twist in the long struggle for Irish independence from the British, which has included violence and the denial of civil rights for Irish Catholics.Mr. Morvan has covered many conflicts around the world in his long career, including a four-year stint in Lebanon, and believes that it is his duty as a photographer to \u201cshow what happened for the memory of people who died there, \u201d he said. \u201cWe are now living in a society with such a short attention span that there are no more memories, no more history. This book is the story of what happened before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Then you start to feel like a monolingual loser.These journeys to English-language theater or the wordless comfort of symphony music and dance have helped devoid my cultural void. But more deeply, my nearly two years here have made me realize what culture means on a purely emotional level. It is a connection, if nothing else, to one\u2019s native language, even if you\u2019re reading subtitles in English but connecting to Italian (read: Latin) words from a language class from your youth.

{"Headline": "\u2018Impostor\u2019 Sent Texts to Beto O\u2019Rourke Supporters, Campaign Says", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new type of dirty trick has entered one of the most closely watched Senate races in the country. On Wednesday, an unidentified volunteer for Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Texas Democrat who is running against Senator Ted Cruz, gained access to the campaign\u2019s mass-texting system and sent a series of unauthorized messages to Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s supporters.\u201cWe are in search of volunteers to help transport undocumented immigrants to polling booths so that they will be able to vote,\u201d read one of the messages, which claimed to be from an O\u2019Rourke volunteer named Patsy. \u201cWould you be able to support this grass-roots effort?\u201dA second message, also sent by a purported volunteer named Patsy, claimed that the campaign was conducting an internal poll, and asked recipients for their opinions on \u201cthe dangers of socialism.\u201d\u201cThat was not an approved message by the campaign,\u201d Mr. Evans said.The messages were sent by a first-time volunteer who had signed up for a shift on the campaign\u2019s \u201ctexting team\u201d under a fake name and whose real identity was still being investigated, according to a campaign staffer. The campaign believes the messages reached fewer than 1,000 people, the staffer said, adding that they were the only examples of unauthorized messages the campaign had found.Mr. Cruz and other Republicans have criticized Mr. O\u2019Rourke, who stands within spitting distance of Mr. Cruz in recent statewide polls, as being weak on immigration and supporting socialist policies.Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign said it was not aware of the messages and denied any involvement.An O\u2019Rourke campaign staffer said the texting team\u2019s policies were being reviewed to see if more careful vetting of volunteers was needed. Currently, volunteers who are approved are given training on using Relay to send text messages, and are able to request lists of dozens of voters to text on Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s behalf. Similar to a phone bank, volunteers do not get access to the campaign\u2019s entire voter database.A typical message from the O\u2019Rourke campaign begins about the same as Wednesday\u2019s message, with an introduction from the campaign volunteer. It then usually asks who the voter will be choosing in November\u2019s election.\u201cWe\u2019re texting Texas voters today about the upcoming November election,\u201d a recent text read. \u201cWill you be voting for Beto O\u2019Rourke or Ted Cruz for Senate?\u201dRelay shut down its O\u2019Rourke-related operations for hours on Wednesday after the campaign realized what had happened, and was continuing an internal investigation.Frank Freeman, a Houston-based espresso machine repairman who supports Mr. O\u2019Rourke, received the fishy text message on Wednesday, and posted a screenshot to Facebook.\u201cIt felt off immediately,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was going to be someone who infiltrated the campaign.\u201dDan Lundeen, a Houston-based attorney who has volunteered for Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign, received the message about the \u201cdangers of socialism\u201d poll on Wednesday afternoon. He quickly reported the message to the campaign.\u201cI hate to see someone contaminate our positive message,\u201d said Mr. Lundeen\u2019s wife, Marcee Lundeen, who is also a volunteer for Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign.Katrien Vanstaen, the head of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s texting team, sent a follow-up message to people who had received the two messages, apologizing for the breach and saying that the campaign had \u201ctaken the necessary steps to make sure that they do not continue sending text messages with our campaign.\u201dMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s texting operation has been robust enough that it has even reached Mr. Cruz and his father, Rafael, on more than one occasion. Several members of Mr. Cruz\u2019s staff, and some of their family members, have also received texts from the O\u2019Rourke campaign.The texts have even annoyed some of Mr. Cruz\u2019s supporters at recent campaign events.\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Mr. Cruz responded. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten three of them myself.

But they\u2019re not as a clever as you are. At least not yet.My name is Cade Metz, and here at The New York Times I cover emerging technologies, which is a fancy term for cool stuff that is probably not as cool as you think it is. My stock example: driverless cars.Driverless cars are very cool. They\u2019re a little less cool when they\u2019re trying to make an unprotected left-hand turn against oncoming traffic and they just sit there because, unlike human drivers, they don\u2019t realize that there comes a time when you just have to go. Much the same applies to robots in general.At times, you can\u2019t help but think of these mechanical creations as living things. The company will start selling one of them, a doglike robot called SpotMini, in the coming year. But even Boston Dynamics is not quite sure what these robots are actually good for.Robots play tricks on the mind. We tend to think they are more advanced than they really are, perhaps because of science fiction movies or because our brains are wired to believe in bots. This is particularly true when it comes to the biomimetic machines inside a lab like Boston Dynamics.\u201cWhen we see a biped that looks like a person or a quadruped that looks like a dog, we project our previous experiences with people and dogs onto these machines. But, in fact, there is nothing inside,\u201d said Gill Pratt, who worked with Boston Dynamics as an official at Darpa, a research arm of the Defense Department, and is now exploring new forms of robotics as the chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute. \u201cIt is like a hollow doll.\u201dKeep that in mind as you think about any other robot.The week I visited Boston Dynamics, I spent time with about 25 other roboticists \u2014 which was not hard in the Boston area. Cambridge breeds them as if they were really smart rabbits. As countless start-ups have emerged from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard over the past two decades, they have spread across Boston, into Somerville and on to Waltham.One company at the leading edge of the real world is RightHand Robotics, which is fashioning \u201cpicking\u201d robots inside an old post office building in Somerville. Presented with a bin full of stuff, they can grab and pick up individual objects, even if they haven\u2019t seen them before. This is just what a company like Amazon need inside its massive distribution centers.But companies like RightHand are still perfecting the art of picking.

{"Headline": "New York Today: Closing Rikers and Marijuana Enforcement", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayGood morning on this steamy and stormy Tuesday.Here in New York, a range of changes in the criminal justice system will touch every corner of the city \u2014 from those caught smoking marijuana on the street to neighborhoods that may soon host new jails.Ashley Southall, a reporter who covers policing and criminal justice, caught us up on key developments.Here\u2019s what she\u2019ll be watching in the coming months.Closing Rikers IslandBut the plan to close Rikers Island hinges on the city\u2019s trimming its jail population to about 5,000 inmates, down from about 9,000, Ms. Southall said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be hearing a lot about how the city is going about doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s making bail easier to pay, or getting judges comfortable with assigning different forms of bail, or encouraging them to use alternatives to bail, like supervised release.\u201dMarijuana enforcementCriminal justice reformIf Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo triumphs in Thursday\u2019s Democratic primary against Cynthia Nixon, and in the November election, Ms. Southall said, \u201cYou\u2019ll likely see him push for criminal justice reforms that are aimed at making the system fairer for poor and indigent defendants.\u201dThose reforms include measures to speed up trials, require prosecutors to more quickly turn over evidence that might help the defense and reduce the state\u2019s reliance on cash bail.Police discipline\u201cPolice discipline has been a hot topic for years,\u201d Ms. Southall said. In June, the Police Department appointed a panel to examine its disciplinary policies. Its findings are expected later this year.There\u2019s also a push for greater transparency of police disciplinary trials. Likely in October, the State Court of Appeals will hear a challenge to 50-A, the statute that shields police disciplinary records from the public. The challenge by the New York Civil Liberties Union is an attempt to make public the decisions and recommendations from the judges who preside over police disciplinary trials.Raise the ageThe new law raises the age of criminal responsibility to 18. Nonviolent cases involving 16- and 17-year-olds will soon be processed in family court instead of criminal court.A big challenge for the city will be to move all 16- and 17-year-olds from Rikers Island to facilities specifically for youth by Oct. 1.\u201cThe city has been late to start, and they\u2019ve had some opposition from the correction union,\u201d Ms. Southall said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watching to see whether the city will make the Oct. 1 deadline in an honest way, or if they\u2019ll kind of fudge it or ask for more time. We might see the situation where they miss the deadline, and then there\u2019s some finger pointing between the de Blasio administration and the Cuomo administration.\u201dComing casesHere\u2019s what else is happening:The heat is back. It could feel as warm as 86 today.The rain hasn\u2019t left. Showers and thunderstorms may pummel your umbrella at times.Tomorrow looks equally muggy and wet.Not Cold StorageDear Diary:I was with some friends in Greenwich Village and we stopped in to visit their niece, who had recently graduated from New York University.A Florida native, she was excited to show us her first New York City apartment, a place that could best be described as tiny.While mentioning the apartment\u2019s lack of decent closet space, she opened the oven door. Inside were a half-dozen pairs of jeans, neatly folded and stacked.\u2014 Larry MartinAs we move through the second full week of September, fall foliage is coming into focus.During a recent stroll through Central Park \u2014 home to more than 20,000 trees \u2014 we wondered, how are all these fallen leaves cleaned up?It takes a team of volunteers and a full park staff who collect the leaves and make numerous trips to the park\u2019s compost pile over the course of the season and into the winter.The leaves are mulched exactly where they fall, said John Dillon, the Central Park Conservancy\u2019s vice president for park operations.Park employees will mow over fallen leaves \u2014 a convenient and beneficial way to clean up, Mr. Dillon said, because the shredded leaves enrich the soil and don\u2019t need to be moved.About 90 percent of the leaves are taken care of this way, he told us, while leaves in the park\u2019s harder-to-reach nooks, crannies and pathways are tended to by volunteers and workers armed with rakes and tarps.The leaves that are raked up are taken to the park\u2019s wind rows, or compost piles, where they are left to decompose into the rich soil, which is then used in the park\u2019s gardens and landscape.\u201cWe bring in corporate partners and their groups, and school groups with cute little kids and their cute little rakes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Now visitors come from around the world to learn, remember and grieve. Ms. Newens is an independent filmmaker.Police barricades and National Guard members would allow us within only three blocks of ground zero, just close enough to glimpse scraps of metal dangling next to the gaping hole in our skyline. The only thing we could do at that point was bear witness, even if that meant holding shattered glass in our hands or writing \u201cGod Bless America\u201d through the thick layer of ash coating every surface.Admittedly, I was a bit perplexed by the commotion, as I\u2019d imagined an environment with more reverence and reflection. But as I settled into the surroundings, my judgment dissipated. I was immersed in a symphony of experiences that unified the space, a tourist destination and graveyard at once. For many years I\u2019ve wanted to make a purely observational film like this one. It\u2019s an approach that often lacks a central character to guide the narrative, and it requires the viewer to actively participate and interpret the meaning as it relates to their own experience. So I set out to document this commemorative shared space, echoing its function as a place for both observation and reflection. To me, what we captured encapsulates a moment in our shared history that is both far from and still painfully close to this tragedy that forever changed our world. As we approach another anniversary, I will think about all the ways we choose to commemorate tragedy both publicly and privately, and how tuning in and tuning out of our surroundings is a choice we must make over and over in our daily lives. I will also think deeply about those who perished and all the lives they touched, hoping for more healing all around, as the sun sets on another day.

A few months ago, she got an Instagram account, and we began to follow each other. Now, she\u2019s sending me loads of private messages: \u201cI\u2019m in Vermont!!!\u201d Or: \u201cWant to have an emoji battle??\u201d I have no idea what the protocol is here. It feels weird to chat with her by private messenger. Should I reach out to her parents? What would I say to them?ANONYMOUSDefinitely contact the parents. By its own flimsy membership rules, Instagram prohibits accounts to children under 13. (But how clever must a child be, really, to calculate the birth year of a 13-year-old when signing up?) Send a friendly note to the parents telling them that their daughter has an account and is private messaging you.If they\u2019re not aware of the age restriction, the mature content of many Instagram Stories or the risks to children of posting pictures of themselves online, clue them in. Ask: \u201cShall I respond to her messages? I don\u2019t want to encourage underage use, but maybe you\u2019re logging in alongside her?\u201d Kids can be crafty (and enterprising), but unaccompanied roaming on social media can lead to danger in real life.My father passed away this week. I am the executor of his estate and in charge of his funeral arrangements. My sister offered to pay for the service and reception; I accepted. She then invited my brother to give the eulogy. But he\u2019s only visited my father three times in the past 13 years. I asked the minister to prepare a service without a eulogy. Still, I\u2019m afraid that my brother will insist on speaking. I told him there will be no eulogy, and now I\u2019m being called nasty names. Any advice?M.H.I\u2019m sorry for your loss, M.H. But I am also sorry for your brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s loss, whether they saw your father three times or 3,000 times over the past 13 years. You are all suffering. And if I am reading between the lines correctly, I disagree with your implication that attentive children mourn their parents with greater entitlement (or more deeply) than prodigal ones do.Now is a time for coming together with your siblings (or trying to, at least). Be generous in planning the service and mindful that each of you had a different, but probably still formative, relationship with your dad. Funerals can be powerful rites in helping us begin to process loss. Don\u2019t shortchange anyone simply because you can.What\u2019s the harm in letting your brother (or sister, or all of you) say a few words at the service? There may even be others who wish to speak. Simply ask them to be brief so the funeral isn\u2019t Wagnerian in length. But it\u2019s not necessary for you, as executor, to judge whether your brother was a good enough son to merit a speaking berth. These are rough days. Take care of yourself and each other.I am a divorced woman, 44, who took up tennis this summer. The instructor of our beginner group was a young man of 23. In August, he asked me out for a drink. I was shocked! (But I said yes.) One thing led to another, and now we are sleeping together. I\u2019m fond of him, but I have no idea how this will turn out. I met his mother, once, during the summer. We were in different tennis groups. But she\u2019s closer to my age than I am to her son\u2019s. Should I tell her what\u2019s going on?L.The best novel I read this summer, \u201cThe Only Story,\u201d by Julian Barnes, bears an uncanny similarity to your question, though it is narrated by the much younger man and turns out to be a heartbreaking story of love and memory. Read it!And don\u2019t say a word to the tennis pro\u2019s mother. If the young man is of age and is sufficiently adult to engage you, you don\u2019t need his mother\u2019s permission to date him. It is his call when to tell her. Only keep in mind another piece of fiction (that occasionally proves true in relationships): Age is just a number.I invited a friend to our club for lunch and a swim. She was once a member but is not any longer. During the afternoon, she said, several times, \u201cThey\u2019ve changed things here \u2014 for the worse.\u201d I found this ungracious.

You replied perfectly, Carol.Your statement was positive and would have caused a normal person to refrain from disparaging the club further. The fact that it didn\u2019t stop your friend says more about her ingratitude than your comeback. No need to take this further \u2014 or invite her again.Advertisement"}

The allegations against Kavanaugh are too grave, and his denial is categorical. One side will be left feeling embittered.But the way that the Senate conducted the hearing \u2014 and the way Kavanaugh responded \u2014 created something close to a worst-case scenario for the Supreme Court.The second piece of potential damage to the court came from Kavanaugh himself. If he did not do any of the things that his accusers claim, his anger is completely understandable. To react any other way, in fact, would be surprising. But he did not merely display anger yesterday; he launched an extraordinary attack on Democratic senators and claimed they were behind the allegations in a nefarious plot.There is no evidence for this. Yes, they have made mistakes during the process, allowing the allegations to become public only at the end. They deserve criticism for these mistakes.

{"Headline": "Facebook Accused of Allowing Bias Against Women in Job Ads", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe job seekers, in collaboration with the Communications Workers of America and the American Civil Liberties Union, filed charges with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday against Facebook and nine employers.The employers appear to have used Facebook\u2019s targeting technology to exclude women from the users who received their advertisements, which highlighted openings for jobs like truck driver and window installer. The charges were filed on behalf of any women who searched for a job on Facebook during roughly the past year.Debra Katz, a Washington-based employment lawyer not involved in the case, said the advertising campaigns appeared to violate federal law, which forbids employers and employment agencies like recruiting firms to discriminate on the basis of gender, among other categories. Some state laws also forbid aiding and abetting discrimination.\u201cThat seems pretty egregious,\u201d said Ms. Katz, who specializes in bringing discrimination cases. She said Facebook\u2019s technology made it akin to an employment agency. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re using this tool to facilitate discrimination absolves neither the hiring business nor Facebook.\u201d\u201cThere is no place for discrimination on Facebook; it\u2019s strictly prohibited in our policies,\u201d said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe are reviewing the complaint and look forward to defending our practices.\u201dThe lawyers involved in the case said they discovered the targeting by supervising a group of workers who performed job searches through their Facebook accounts and clicked on a variety of employment ads. For each ad, the job seekers opened a standard Facebook disclosure explaining why they received it. The disclosure for the problematic ads said the users received them because they were men, often between a certain age and in a certain location.For example, the Facebook disclosure for an ad by Nebraska Furniture Mart of Texas seeking staff members to \u201cassemble and prepare merchandise for delivery\u201d said the company wanted to reach men 18 to 50 who lived in or were recently near Fort Worth. The lawyers and their team collected the ads between October 2017 and August 2018.The New York Times contacted three of the employers to inquire about the allegations. Two of them, Renewal by Andersen, which sells and installs windows and doors, and Defenders, which sells and installs home security systems, declined to comment. Nebraska Furniture Mart did not respond.In principle, the companies could have simultaneously aimed similar ads at women, but they do not appear to have done so, according to the lawyers involved. Some conceded that they had directed the ads only at men, and some promised to stop doing so, according to Peter Romer-Friedman, counsel at Outten & Golden, one of the lawyers in the case.LinkedIn and Google also generally allow advertisers to exclude men or women from receiving ads. LinkedIn said in a statement that it would take down job ads that exclude a gender; Google said it would remove ads that discriminated against a protected class but declined to say if it would take down ads like those in the Facebook case. Facebook said that it was still reviewing the ads but that it generally did not take down job ads that exclude a gender.In practice, Facebook, with its more than two billion monthly active users, can be the most important tool for reaching certain types of workers, such as hourly workers, who often do not use other platforms like LinkedIn and sometimes do not even have r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Bobbi Spees, a 35-year-old mother of three from Smethport, Pa., who is one of those bringing the charges, said that she was a part-time job coach for special-education students and that she had sought a better-paying position.Ms. Spees spent several years in her 20s working at a container factory where, she said, the pay was roughly two to three times what she currently makes and her health coverage was impeccable. She said she would like to find a similar job and had used Facebook actively for her search but had difficulty finding leads.By contrast, Ms. Spees said, her husband saw numerous ads for high-paying manual jobs when he was searching online for a job two to three years ago.\u201cIt really came to my attention that I was seeing hardly any jobs offered other than home health and stuff like that,\u201d Ms. Spees said in an interview.In a sense, Ms. Spees was lucky to receive such intelligence from her husband. More often, said Galen Sherwin of the A.C.L.U., her lawyer, \u201cpeople don\u2019t know they\u2019re not seeing an ad.\u201dLawyers for the workers in the case argue that Facebook is an employment agency and therefore liable for the discriminatory targeting because it is an active participant in the recruiting campaign rather than a passive publisher of content like a traditional newspaper with a classified section.Pauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the question was more ambiguous, hinging on the extent to which Facebook uses its algorithms to match an ad with a particular subgroup.\u201cThe more it gets into the use of these algorithms to really start narrowing down the matching, the more it moves toward looking like an employment agency,\u201d Ms. Kim said. But she said that how far a platform like Facebook must move down that path before it is considered an employment agency remains \u201can open question.\u201dTo show culpability, the lawyers in the case point out that Facebook requires advertisers to indicate which gender they want their ads to reach, and that two of the three choices for this category \u2014 male only and female only \u2014 are illegal for employment ads. (Only the third choice, \u201call,\u201d would past muster under federal anti-discrimination law.)Even if Facebook argues successfully that it is not an employment agency, future plaintiffs could bring complaints under state laws, such as California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act, that bar aiding and abetting employment discrimination \u2014 a more liberal standard.Traditionally, Facebook\u2019s strongest defense has been the Communications Decency Act, a federal law that includes a provision shielding internet companies from liability for content generated by third parties.Advertisement"}

What sticks with me most, though, is the pervasive sense of hospitality and human kindness I found there. If you\u2019re going to lose a laptop on the streets of a European city in the middle of a downpour, let it be in Lucerne, Switzerland.Rain was coming down in sheets. I retraced my steps, frantic and drenched, but came up empty. I could go to the police in the morning, my hotel receptionist told me, but more likely, I\u2019d be lucky. Swiss people were very honest, she said. If they find something, they usually give it back.I was skeptical. But sure enough, I woke to an early-morning message in my Twitter inbox. Had I lost something? Within 10 minutes, a Lucerne resident named Anton Meier had shown up at my hotel by bike, bag in hand. \u201cI saved it from the rain and from thieves,\u201d he said. While I gave him a reward, he seemed far more interested in hearing how my travels had been going and in recommending his favorite spots in his picturesque, alpine hometown.Lake Lucerne, or Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee, as it\u2019s known in German, looks like a four-legged starfish on a map: sharp tendrils of water twisting through narrow valleys in every direction. In person, the effect is even more unreal, as if a Hollywood effects studio made a diorama of a perfect, tree-covered mountain range and then spilled a Blue Hawaiian cocktail all over it.And I hadn\u2019t even gotten to the mountains.It took me another two days to get to Mount Titlis, the area\u2019s only publicly accessible glacier, at an altitude of 9,900 feet. And while the views were as spectacular as promised, the experience felt like going through a tourism obstacle course. You step off a rotating cable car into a blue-lit ice cave, walk across the suspension bridge, go up and down \u201cthe Ice Flyer\u201d (a ski lift) and go home \u2014 more engineering than nature. As a snowboarder, the winter wonderland of mild sledding slopes didn\u2019t appeal. But for families, it\u2019s perfect. I nearly cried watching two young boys from Goa touch snow for the very first time.Because of the resort, B\u00fcrgenstock is the only mountain with boat service until 11:45 p.m. I used my Tell-Pass for a spontaneous second visit on my last night. Having a wine at sunset with unobstructed views 2,900 feet above the lake definitely felt worth it. (Note: almost all the restaurants have dress codes.)In the parking lot, we had met a couple in their mid-50s \u2014 Britta Hagemann, originally from Germany, and J\u00fcrg Zwiefel, from a nearby Swiss town \u2014 who knew Mr. Konstandikas. They were also, I soon found out, newly reunited and in love after having spent half of their lives apart.Six months ago, after ending her marriage, Ms. Hagemann said, her 25-year-old daughter had asked her about her first love. Ms. Hagemann started talking about Mr. Zwiefel, whom she had met at a French-language workshop one summer near Monaco when she was 19 and he was 21. \u201cAt that time there was no WhatsApp, no Facebook,\u201d she said, \u201cso even living between Germany and Switzerland was like a long-distance relationship.\u201d They wrote letters, which they recently found in a basement, but couldn\u2019t keep it up.At her daughter\u2019s encouragement, Ms. Hagemann reached out to Mr. Zwiefel on Facebook. He happened to be divorced, too. \u201cIt was by accident we were both free,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we met, and it was like there were two weeks in between.\u201dIn their lifetime apart, he had become a paraglider. But since he and Ms. Hagemann have reunited, he always takes her with him. She\u2019s a nature photographer and is planning an exhibition of photos she has taken while high above Lucerne. \u201cSince then, I am not flying alone anymore,\u201d Mr. Zwiefel said.We said goodbye on a mountaintop, though only after Ms. Hagemann offered to let me stay with her any time I come to Zurich. I didn\u2019t see them paraglide, but I think about them often, and the monumental leap they took.Previous dispatches:Next dispatch: S\u00fcdtirol, ItalyAn earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that Vierwaldst\u00e4ttersee is the German name for the city of Lucerne, Switzerland.

Nor does it offer Fios, its high-speed internet service. But Verizon does advertise on Amazon.On Black Friday last year, when millions of online shoppers took to Amazon in search of deals, a Verizon ad for a Google Pixel 2 phone \u2014 buy one and get a second one half off \u2014 could be seen blazing across Amazon\u2019s home page. And on July 16, what Amazon calls Prime Day, an event with special deals for its Prime customers, Verizon again ran a variety of ads and special offers for Amazon shoppers, like a mix-and-match unlimited service plan.Amazon, which has already reshaped and dominated the online retail landscape, is quickly gathering momentum in a new, highly profitable arena: online advertising, where it is rapidly emerging as a major competitor to Google and Facebook.The push by the giant online retailer means consumers \u2014 even Prime customers, who pay $119 a year for access to free shipping as well as streaming music, video and discounts \u2014 are likely to be confronted by ads in places where they didn\u2019t exist before.In late August, some gamers were angered when Twitch, a video game streaming service acquired by Amazon in 2014, said it would soon no longer be ad-free for Prime members unless consumers paid an additional $8.99 a month for a premium service called Twitch Turbo.Amazon derives the bulk of its annual revenue, forecast to be $235 billion this year, from its e-commerce business, selling everything from books to lawn furniture. Amazon is also a leader in the cloud computing business, with Amazon Web Services, which accounts for around 11 percent of its revenue but more than half of its operating income. But in the company\u2019s most recent financial results, it was a category labeled \u201cother\u201d that caught the attention of many analysts. It mostly consists of revenue from selling banner, display and keyword search-driven ads known as \u201csponsored products.\u201d That category surged by about 130 percent to $2.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2017.Much of online advertising relies on imprecise algorithms that govern where marketing messages appear, and what impact they have on actual sales. Here, Amazon has a big advantage over its competitors. Thanks to its wealth of data and analytics on consumer shopping habits, it can put ads in front of people when they are more likely to be hunting for specific products and to welcome them as suggestions rather than see them as intrusions.\u201cGoogle and Facebook have been slow to create the standards that advertisers want to see,\u201d said Collin Colburn, an analyst at the research and advisory firm Forrester. \u201cThey are concerned about what sort of content their ads are going to be placed next to.\u201dHe added, \u201cAmazon is different because it has a much more controlled environment on its e-commerce site where the products are being sold, and Amazon\u2019s reach into the rest of the World Wide Web is pretty small.\u201dAmazon has sold some forms of advertising for years, including sponsored product listings tied to search keywords on its site, and ads on properties it owns like IMDb and Zappos. The company will also sell advertising spots on the Thursday-night National Football League games it live-streams to Prime customers this fall.But some analysts who follow the company closely say Amazon is now focusing more on advertising, rapidly hiring and building out its capabilities in a business with high profit margins for Google and Facebook.In turn, brands are increasingly recognizing Amazon\u2019s vast customer reach, particularly to its more than 100 million Prime subscribers. In a study conducted last summer by Catalyst, the search and social media marketing company, only 15 percent of the 250 brands marketers polled felt they were making the most out of advertising on Amazon\u2019s platform, and 63 percent of the companies already advertising there said they planned to increase their budget in the coming year.Many big brands that sell products on Amazon have increased their advertising on the site this year, including General Mills, Hershey and Unilever, according to an analysis of display ads by the research firm Gartner L2.But the bigger surprise is the increase in advertising on Amazon by companies, like Verizon, AT&T and the insurer Geico, that don\u2019t directly sell any product or service on the site. In the first half of 2018, Geico ran six times as many display ads as it did during the same period last year, according to Oweise Khazi, associate director of Amazon IQ research at Gartner L2. (Geico declined to comment.)Verizon said the reason for its increased advertising spending on Amazon was simple: It\u2019s where the shoppers are.\u201cThey have people who are in a shopping mind-set, so that\u2019s valuable for Verizon to be seen as a resource within that mind-set,\u201d said John Nitti, the chief media officer at Verizon.Thanks to the vast amount of data Amazon collects from its customers, it can target ads not only to basic demographics \u2014 say, women over the age of 35 \u2014 but to a more precise segment of customers who are likely to be shopping for cellphones or barbecue grills.Amazon is not just selling ads online. For Verizon, the opportunities to advertise over Amazon may increase as the e-commerce giant continues to build its internal media group and opens new advertising spots on various platforms or devices. Verizon, for instance, will soon be running a test: It will put Fios advertisements on Amazon packages being delivered to ZIP codes where Verizon offers the service.In many cases, the advertising dollars that are moving to Amazon are being diverted from other digital players.In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Levi\u2019s said the company had increased its marketing investment across all channels, including television, traditional digital and newer digital platforms, including Amazon.For some brands, the increased spending is most likely directly linked to increased competition on Amazon\u2019s platform from Amazon itself. As Amazon introduces more of its own private-label goods, many companies are expanding their advertising spending to raise the visibility of their products.On a recent afternoon, a consumer who typed \u201ccereal\u201d into the search bar of Amazon\u2019s browser would first see an ad for JoyBol, followed by similar ads for General Mills\u2019 Corn Chex and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But just below those ads, in a box labeled \u201cTop Rated From Our Brands,\u201d a number of cereals from 365 Everyday Value were featured. That is the private label of the grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in 2017.General Mills declined to comment.Kellogg Company, which faces much of the same competition, said it had been generally shifting advertising dollars toward digital platforms.\u201cWith Amazon\u2019s platform now being a leader in many elements of advertising \u2014 including, for many categories, search \u2014 it makes sense for part of those ad dollars to be allocated there,\u201d said Monica McGurk, Kellogg\u2019s chief revenue and e-commerce officer, in an emailed response to questions.But for Kellogg\u2019s, what sets advertising on Amazon\u2019s platform apart from others, like Google or Twitter, is the online retailer\u2019s data.\u201cWe can reach the right consumer at the right time using their wealth of data to target,\u201d Ms. McGurk said. \u201cOther traditional digital platforms do not have the level of purchase data that Amazon has on their customers.\u201dAnalysts say some brands, however, particularly those whose products now face competition from Amazon private-label goods, remain reluctant to advertise on the e-commerce giant\u2019s platform.\u201cI do hear some brands saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want to work with Amazon too much because they\u2019re going to get too much information from us,\u201d said Will Margaritis, a vice president for e-commerce at the ad agency 360i. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s overthinking it. Amazon has enough data to understand everything about any category it wants to be in.\u201dSapna Maheshwari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Is it such a bad idea?Contributing Opinion WriterTEL AVIV \u2014 In January 1968, only a few months after Israel conquered the territory on the West Bank of the Jordan River, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol received a memo. The reasonable way to deal with the newly occupied territory, wrote the memo\u2019s author, a professor named Benjamin Akzin, was to join it to Jordan, the country from which it was taken during the 1967 war.Akzin\u2019s memo, which is recounted in a new book by the historian Yoav Gelber, was one of the first articulations of what is known as \u201cthe Jordanian option.\u201d It\u2019s still alive today.The long-forgotten 1968 memo explains why. An agreement with Jordan might not be stable, wrote Akzin, but one with the Palestinians would be even less so. Plus, a contract between two established states is preferable to a contract with a state that doesn\u2019t yet exist. With Jordan, Israel can trust arrangements such as demilitarization of certain areas. If Jordan breaches the agreement, there are sanctions that can be used to ensure a return to compliance \u2014 the kind of sanctions that only a real country comprehends.Since 1967, Israel hasn\u2019t been able to identify a Palestinian leadership that can be trusted to keep the peace and maintain order. Likewise, Israel doesn\u2019t really believe that a tiny Palestinian enclave trapped between Israel and Jordan could be economically viable. And so it has always hoped that Israel\u2019s eventual separation from Palestinians will include a guarantee of \u2014 to put it bluntly \u2014 adult supervision.Is a Palestinian-Jordanian confederation currently viable? To be honest, it is not. Jordan vehemently rejects this idea, not wanting to be destabilized by a large new population of Palestinians. The Palestinians, for their part, still hold on to their dream of a state of their own. And among the international community, where the two-state solution is still orthodoxy, the idea is dismissed as a ploy of right-wing rejectionists.An earlier version of this article previously misspelled the name of the Israeli general who wrote a series of articles on the \"Jordanian option.\" He is Gen.

{"Headline": "The Venezuelan Crisis Is Part of Maduro\u2019s Plan", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president has done very little to solve his country\u2019s collapse. There\u2019s a reason. Economic deprivation helps him stay in power.Mr. Corrales is a professor of political science and an expert on Latin America.AMHERST, Mass. \u2014 Most of the current news coming from Venezuela focuses on the country\u2019s extraordinary economic crisis, and with good reason. By any measure, this is one of the worse crises in recent world history. But the most unspeakable aspect of this calamity is the government\u2019s nonchalant response.It\u2019s easy to see why the government\u2019s nonchalance strongly suggests this is Mr. Maduro\u2019s strategy. An extremist government like his prefers economic devastation to economic recovery because misery destroys civil society, and with it the potential challenges to tyranny.Economic deprivation along with repression changes incentives from political engagement toward escape. This is exactly what Mr. Maduro wants \u2014 to gut the resistance \u2014 and the reason he has allowed the crisis to continue for this long.Mr. Maduro\u2019s extremism is entirely state led. In that sense, it borrows heavily from another Bolshevik-inspired tropical revolution: Cuba\u2019s famous 1968 revolutionary offensive. This was a campaign by Fidel Castro, nine years in power, to nationalize the little that was left of the private sector. Mr. Castro confiscated 55,636 small businesses, including most food outlets and semiprivate farms. Castro wanted zero private profits and total state monopoly over food distribution. The goal was to turn citizens completely dependent on the state.Furthermore, some homegrown elements exist that render the president\u2019s revolution truly idiosyncratic. Perhaps the most sui generis element is the collapse of the oil sector in the hands of the state. Other than external borrowing, oil exports constitute the revolution\u2019s main source of dollars. Despite a recovery of the price of oil since 2016, Venezuela\u2019s oil production has shrunk by more than half since then.It\u2019s hard to argue that Mr. Maduro\u2019s neglect of his crown jewel is intentional, since its most serious victim is Mr. Maduro himself. This neglect suggests that his rule is also about ineptitude.And yet, Venezuela requires more than just technical fixes. Recovery will require a fundamental overturning of the development model in place for the past 15 years. That model, invented by Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, consists of eliminating controls on state activity and imposing excessive controls on the private sector. Venezuela needs to introduce more controls on the state (including free and fair elections) and more facilities for the productive private sector. Obviously, the biggest loser from this inversion would be the state, and for this reason Mr. Maduro won\u2019t change the model.Chaos, whether intentional or accidental, can be useful to extremist states. For that reason, we should not count on Mr. Maduro\u2019s extremist government to do anything minimally promising to stop Venezuela\u2019s descent into hell.Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College, is the author, most recently, of \u201cFixing Democracy: Why Constitutional Change Often Fails to Enhance Democracy in Latin America.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Journey to a Night Flower", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "OpinionThere I was, driving through a parched landscape on a pilgrimage to watch a single flower bloom. Why?Supported byContributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 For decades, my grandmother was the caretaker of a gangly, disorganized houseplant with nothing, so far as I could see, to recommend it. The plant was ugly, an awkward tangle of greenery fashioned from what seemed to be spare botanical parts: long stems that reached out in a vaguely threatening way and generated new stems, randomly, from within their own stretching expanses. Some of the stems were round and some of them were flat and some were almost serrated, and there were no leaves at all. It was less a plant than something out of a nightmare. As a little girl, I thought it might bite me.In warm months, the plant stayed on the front porch of that equally gangly, equally disorganized old farmhouse, a dogtrot structure that had been added onto willy-nilly over the years. When the evenings began to cool in early autumn, my grandmother would bring the plant indoors, set it on a table next to the fireplace, and wait hopefully for it to bloom. She called it her \u201cnight-blooming series.\u201dI have no idea how my grandmother, a teacher in a two-room schoolhouse tucked among peanut fields in lower Alabama, came to be in possession of such an exotic plant, but I understand her attachment to it. All my life I have longed to see such a plant in flower, but so far my own night-blooming cereus has proved to be a nonblooming cereus. All it grows are ridiculous appendages: One stem is 92 inches long and still growing. This particular variety of cereus is a pass-along plant, easily shared via rooted cuttings. My cutting came from my brother and sister-in-law\u2019s plant, a proven bloomer, but it has never formed a single bud under my care.Last week, my brother texted a photo of the bud he\u2019d discovered on his plant. \u201cIt might bloom tonight!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI looked in my garden journal, and it was fully open by 8 p.m. in 2014.\u201d My brother\u2019s garden journal is a force of nature in its own right, a combination of art and detailed field notes, and I had full faith in his best guess. So I got in the car and drove straight to his house in Clarksville, more than 50 miles from here, stopping only for gas. With a night-blooming cereus, the transformation from bud to blossom can take less than an hour.Believe me, I recognize the irony: There I was, driving through a parched landscape with a full tank of gas, on a pilgrimage to do nothing more than watch a flower bloom, while the hot winds from the 18-wheelers shook my whole car as they passed.I am only one generation removed from the farm, and I spent much of my childhood in the very world where my mother grew up, the same one where my grandmother grew up, and my great-grandmother before her, going back farther than anyone could remember. For weeks of every year, I slept in the bed my mother slept in as a child; I walked barefoot down the same red-dirt roads she walked down barefoot as a child; I ate the dark plums that grew beside her childhood porch, at least until they fermented in the hot Alabama sun and made the red wasps drunk on their wine.Today only 2 percent of Americans live on farms or ranches, but we have not lost our need to be among green things. Which may explain why friends and neighbors were already hurrying to my brother and sister-in-law\u2019s house by the time I got to Clarksville, and why we all gathered together in their living room to wait for the miraculous event to unfold. The plant\u2019s single bud, which spanned the full length of my hand, was clearly in no hurry to open, pink filaments still tightly ribbing it from stem to tip an hour after we arrived. \u201cIt\u2019s like counting contractions, waiting for a baby to be born,\u201d someone said.Then, finally, the bud began to open, at first just one tiny aperture at the very end. The pink filaments began to loosen and lift. As the aperture widened, a star-shaped structure unfolded within it \u2014 a white star inside a white flower \u2014 and the translucent petals unlayered and arrayed themselves around the star. The flower was nine inches across fully opened, and its perfume filled the whole room with sweetness. It was not a nightmare plant at all. It was the flower of dreams. It would be gone by morning, not to return for another year. If then.It was just one flower on just one ordinary day in September. Its arrival did nothing to mitigate the drought unfolding in the night outside, and nothing at all to make the floodwaters recede in North Carolina. You could insist that it didn\u2019t matter in any way at all, and I would not think to argue with you.But it was also not nothing. That night-blooming cereus brought my grandmother back to me in her halo of white hair. It brought back, too, her plum tree, long since cut down, and the feeling of red dirt between my toes. In a time of great cultural dislocation and environmental despair, for an hour it made me remember what it feels like when the world is exactly as it must be, and I am exactly where I belong.Advertisement"}

Many longtime hackers, like Ms. Sell and Mr. Wyler, have been drawn into the open by corporate demands, or have traded their anonymity for public roles as high-level cybersecurity experts. Others alluded to the ways in which a widespread professionalization and gamification of the hacking world \u2014 as evidenced by so-called bug bounty programs offered by companies like Facebook and Google, which pay (often handsomely) for hackers to hunt for and disclose cybersecurity gaps on their many platforms \u2014 have legitimized certain elements of the culture.\u201cThis is a profession for a lot of people now,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t fill out a W-9 with your hacker handle.\u201dMr. Moss, perhaps the epitome of a hacker who has jettisoned anonymity and entered the public sphere, has had an evolving relationship with aliases. Like many of his early online friends, he was interested in hacking and phone phreaking (the manipulation of telecommunications systems) \u2014 \u201cstuff that wasn\u2019t really legal,\u201d he said. Aliases provided cover for such activity. And every once in a while, he explained \u2014 if a friend let slip your name, or if you outgrew a juvenile, silly alias \u2014 you\u2019d have to burn your identity and come up with a new name.\u201cIn my case, I had a couple previous identities,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when I changed to The Dark Tangent, I was making a clear break from my past. I\u2019d learned how to manage identities; I\u2019d learned how the scene worked.\u201dHe also remembers when everything changed. During the dot-com boom, many hackers transitioned to \u201creal jobs,\u201d he said, \u201cand so they had to have real names, too.\u201d\u201cMy address book doubled in size,\u201d he said with a laugh. And in time, as Defcon\u2019s popularity ballooned, his list of formal appointments grew, too: membership at the Council on Foreign Relations, a seat on President Obama\u2019s Homeland Security Advisory Council.For Mr. Harewood, maintaining his alias is partly about creating a personal brand \u2014 a retro nod, in a sense, to the era when using a hacker handle was a more essential element of the trade. But it also has practical advantages. \u201cPeople want to reach out all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still not all that comfortable communicating with people on my Facebook profile, under my real name.\u201d\u201cIn a way,\u201d he said, \u201cit just helps me filter my communications.\u201d\u201cI came up with it a couple years ago, when I first got included in a news article,\u201d he said. \u201cI think an alias helps you get more recognition \u2014 sort of like how The Dark Tangent has his.\u201d\u201cP0wnyb0y is shorter and catchier than my name,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it just seems a lot cooler.\u201dEmmett said his involvement with Defcon \u2014 he has attended for several years, accompanied by his father \u2014 has left him skeptical about the degree to which his peers share things online. \u201cMy friends put everything up on the internet,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m more mindful.\u201d Still, he said he wasn\u2019t invested in keeping his real name separate from his alias. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as the end of the world\u201d if people can easily link the two, he said. \u201cBut some other people take that stuff more seriously.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say, though, that the younger generations of hackers are all comfortable operating so openly. Ms. Sell\u2019s daughter, who spoke with me on the condition that I refer to her by her hacking handle, CyFi, was especially guarded about her identity.\u201cWhen I was 9, I discovered a class of zero-day vulnerabilities,\u201d said CyFi, who is now 17, referring to software bugs that developers are unaware of. She ultimately disclosed the bugs, she added, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t want to risk being sued by all those companies \u2014 so hiding my identity was the best way to go.\u201dAs with Emmett, CyFi is wary of her generation\u2019s penchant for oversharing online. \u201cMy friends have definitely been frustrated with my lack of social media,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the less data there is about you out in the world, the less people can try to mess with you.\u201dOne of the most intriguing aspects of Defcon is the relationship between the hacker community and the attendees from the federal government, the complexities of which have ebbed and flowed over time. For many years, the tension resulted in a cat-and-mouse game called \u201cSpot the Fed.\u201d\u201cIn the early days, if a fed got spotted, it was pretty consequential,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cLater on, they were outing each other,\u201d he said with a laugh \u2014 because they wanted the T-shirt granted to both the fed and the person who outed them.Mr. Wells said that governmental officials who attend Defcon fall into one of three categories. \u201cOne was the people who openly announced they were feds \u2014 either speakers who announced their affiliations, or there was a Meet the Fed panel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were others who wouldn\u2019t deny it if you asked them, but who didn\u2019t go out of their way to advertise it. And then there were those who were either officially or unofficially undercover.\u201dThe relationship hasn\u2019t always been contentious, he added, noting that, in 2012, Keith Alexander, who was then director of the N.S.A., \u201ccame out here and spoke in a T-shirt and bluejeans.\u201d Less than a year later, though, after the Edward Snowden leak, things soured. \u201cFor the next couple years,\u201d Mr. Wells said, \u201cthe feds were \u2014 well, if not uninvited, then at least tacitly not particularly welcome.\u201d\u201cIt probably helped their agenda \u2014 by having these kids show up with fake names,\u201d said Mr. Grand, who sat for an interview at Defcon. \u201cIt probably made it that much more intriguing.\u201d\u201cBut using our handles,\u201d he added, \u201cwas our natural way of communicating. And having that protection, it felt good. We were putting ourselves out there as hackers communicating with the government \u2014 which, at the time, was not something you did.\u201dAs with many longtime hackers, Mr. Grand \u2014 who became widely known after appearing on a Discovery Channel show called \u201cPrototype This!\u201d \u2014 has grown more comfortable operating in the open. But he still appreciates the value of anonymity. \u201cHiding behind a fake name doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something malicious, and it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means you\u2019re trying to protect your privacy.\u201d\u201cAnd, in this day and age, you need to,\u201d he added,\u00a0\u201cbecause everywhere you look, your privacy is being stripped away.\u201d\u201cMore and more people who started hacking in the \u201990s are now becoming icons and thought leaders \u2014 and, most importantly, role models for the younger generations of hackers,\u201d she said.To help guide younger generations, elder hackers can often still use nicknames, she added. \u201cBut sometimes it makes it more powerful when they can speak up in their own voices.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.New York is a big state with small politics. It is home to many of the most ambitious and inventive people in the world, but its governance is stunted by party hacks and special interests, petty rivalries and systemic corruption.The Democratic primaries on Thursday, Sept. 13, provide some ground for hope. The damage being done by the Trump administration has reawakened New Yorkers to the importance of political participation. Recognizing this new spirit, energetic Senate candidates are promising real reform. Candidates for attorney general \u2014 in particular Zephyr Teachout, a national expert on corruption \u2014 are campaigning to clean up Albany and take on the Trump administration, and they\u2019re well positioned to do just that.Unfortunately, the top of the ticket offers less cause for enthusiasm.In his two terms as governor, Andrew Cuomo has had significant accomplishments. But he has done little to combat the corruption in the Legislature and his own administration, and he has allowed the subway system, the foundation of the New York City economy, to rot. The case for change, at a time when so many New Yorkers yearn for change, is not hard to make.Yet the actor and activist Cynthia Nixon was the only Democrat with the guts to take on Mr. Cuomo, his $30 million campaign war chest and his reputation for vindictiveness. She has campaigned on sweeping promises to address New Yorkers\u2019 hunger for health care, housing and a fair criminal justice system.Ms. Nixon\u2019s candidacy has demonstrated the impressive effect of reformist pressure on Mr. Cuomo. When she spoke forcefully about criminal justice reform, he restored voting rights to parolees. When she criticized him for blessing the Independent Democratic Conference \u2014 a group of rogue Democrats who empowered Republican control of the State Senate in exchange for perks and pork \u2014 he made sure the alliance was dismantled.But Ms. Nixon\u2019s lack of experience in government or management of any sort do not inspire confidence that she could overcome the old guard in Albany to fulfill her promises and run the state. Her campaign has, at times, boiled down to a largely negative message \u2014 that she is not Andrew Cuomo \u2014 and while that can indeed seem an appealing truth, it is not, in the end, enough.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]This is not a reason to despair. Strategic and at times bullying in his use of power, driven and maddeningly evasive, deeply schooled in state and federal policy, Mr. Cuomo is, his supporters and critics would agree, a formidable political animal, and he has scented a change in the wind. His legacy is at stake. New statehouse reformers are demanding striking progress on promises long stymied by special interests and Albany deal-making. And Donald Trump is threatening his constituents. These are circumstances that are likely to summon Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strengths, and that is the reason we think he merits one more chance to serve New York and fulfill his potential as governor.When Mr. Cuomo is focused on governing, no New York politician in memory has been as effective. Because of his leadership, New York passed one of the toughest gun control measures in the country, legalized same-sex marriage, raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour and enacted paid family leave. While his tuition-free plan for state colleges remains too narrowly focused to benefit most of the families who need it, it is a step in the right direction.The governor has supported clean energy programs and banned hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking. His handling of Hurricane Sandy \u2014 the kind of crisis that most tests a leader \u2014 was sure and largely efficient. Urged on by his rival Mayor Bill de Blasio, he funded a prekindergarten program that has given thousands of New York children a better start in life.Mr. Cuomo has also overseen the construction of a bridge to replace the decrepit Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson River, pushed to transform Midtown\u2019s James A. Farley Post Office into a grand new train station and led a long-overdue overhaul of La Guardia and Kennedy airports.And he has stood up against President Trump\u2019s assaults on racial minorities, immigrants and other vulnerable groups. We are glad to see him fighting to protect New Yorkers from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan, which sharply reduced the amount of state taxes that can be deducted from federal tax bills. He backed a change to the state tax code to blunt the impact of the federal changes and directed the state to sue the federal government.Yet Mr. Cuomo\u2019s failures threaten to eclipse his record of accomplishments.Day after day, New Yorkers are being tormented below ground, at a cost to the state\u2019s economy of billions of dollars, because of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s inadequate efforts to address the crisis in the subway system. Let there be no doubt, the governor controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. As Mr. Cuomo has said, \u201cIf a governor wanted to step up and be responsible, he or she could be.\u201d It is past time for Mr. Cuomo to step up, to persuade the Legislature to approve congestion pricing as a source of revenue \u2014 despite the mayor\u2019s blinkered opposition \u2014 and to find whatever other funds he needs to turn the system back into one of the glories of New York, if not the wonders of the world.One reason the governor has been able to build up a campaign treasury large enough to repel potential competition is that he has raised funds through the \u201cL.L.C. loophole\u201d that he pledged to end years ago. This loophole allows businesses called limited liability companies to flout limits on corporate donations.Four years ago, because Mr. Cuomo had failed to deliver promised ethics reform and because he faced a more prepared opponent in Ms. Teachout, we did not endorse any candidate in the Democratic primary for governor. This year, his ethics record remains a black mark, but circumstances have changed.If the State Senate shifts to Democratic control, as now seems possible, Mr. Cuomo will be in a position to push through reforms he has failed to deliver in the past. First among these should be changes to make it easier for New Yorkers to vote, including by mail-in ballot, and to run for office. Though it may be hard to persuade even Democrats in Albany to support genuine campaign finance reform, the L.L.C. loophole is so egregious, and Mr. Cuomo so relentless when he sets his mind to something, that we expect him to close it at last.Mr. Cuomo is flawed. When he allows petty enmity and political grievance to distract him from his commitment to public service, he is his own worst enemy. But when he confronts a real problem and gets down to work, he is a very capable governor.Yet he can\u2019t \u2014 he won\u2019t \u2014 do it alone. Voters need to show up at the polls on Thursday, Sept. 13, in large numbers and, wherever possible, support reform-minded candidates who will hold Mr. Cuomo to his promises and take on Democrats beholden to corporate interests. Those voters will need to return to the polls in November.That is how New York can finally get the government, and governor, it deserves, and how it can become the model of humane and honest public service that all America needs.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Water Droplets Don\u2019t Just Hover on a Hot Pan. They Roll.", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesPhysicists took a deeper look at the Leidenfrost effect, which you\u2019ve likely experienced when you\u2019ve dripped water into a pan to test its temperature. Drip water on a hot pan, and the droplets will skitter around the pan, speeding like tiny mad hovercraft on cushions of steam.This is the Leidenfrost effect, which you\u2019ve probably experienced while cooking. Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, a German doctor and theologian, described the phenomenon in 1756 in a book about the properties of water.But French scientists have now figured out something new about those skittering drops. When they are small enough \u2014 about a millimeter in diameter \u2014 the roiling of heat in the liquid will cause the droplet to tilt and rotate. That, in turn, propels the droplet to roll.Scientists \u2014 and home cooks \u2014 never noticed this before, because no one had tried pinning a water droplet on a precisely flat surface. Plus, since water is clear, you usually can\u2019t see which way the liquid is churning.It was already known that the droplets, levitating on top of a layer of vapor, move easily, but the presumption was that they were sliding down a slope or pushed by air currents. The new research shows that they can move all by themselves.\u201cIt's embarrassingly simple,\u201d David Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, a scientist at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris, said of the discovery. \u201cThe drop is running away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a little motor inside, which is surprising. From this view, it\u2019s amazingly different from usual drops, which, of course, stay where you place them.\u201dLarger drops, those more than 1.5 millimeters in diameter, are more flattened in shape (Dr. Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 described them as puddles). Within the droplet, the liquid splits into two convective cells rotating in opposite directions. Think of two wheels spinning in opposite directions toward each other, one largely canceling out the other. (Tracers mixed in with the water enabled the scientists to observe the flow.)As the water evaporates, the droplet shrinks and becomes nearly spherical, with room for just one convective cell. When the needle is lifted, the smaller droplet speeds off in the direction of the convective spin.Dr. Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 calls it a Leidenfrost wheel.The next step in their experiments is guiding the droplets through grooves or differences in temperature, Dr. Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said. There are additional fundamental phenomena to be studied, such as why the temperature of the surface must be far above the boiling point before the drops start levitating.\u201cVery remarkably, there is no answer to this question today,\u201d Dr. Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Does Rabbi Voice Come From?", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cSeinfeld\u201d parodied it. It\u2019s all over Woody Allen. But no one quite knows how the singsong lilt of the Jewish clergy got its start.The author, most recently, of \u201cThe Chicago Cubs: The Story of a Curse.\u201dWhy do rabbis talk like that? Where does that voice come from? Last spring, while sitting through my son\u2019s bar mitzvah, I suddenly wanted to know. If I could find the source of that voice, I believed, I might understand something about my tradition. I might understand how it is that, though much of the religious service leaves me cold, though the sermons don\u2019t often stir me, I still find myself in the pew. Is it the prayers that keep bringing me back, the stories, or is it something about the voice itself? That\u2019s culture: people copying people they don\u2019t even know they\u2019re copying. Is this what happened with the voice? There\u2019s not been much written about the voice. Possibly because it\u2019s vague. Researching it is like researching the history of a smell. Important but insubstantial, hard to document. There are a few articles and some work done by linguists, but a general history remains elusive; the voice is everywhere and nowhere. If something can\u2019t be measured, it\u2019s as if it does not exist.So I made phone calls, spoke to rabbis, scholars, linguists. One of them asked me to imitate the voice. When I did \u2014 \u201cWhile eating a cherry Danish this morning. \u2026 \u201d \u2014 she laughed and said: \u201cYeah, I know what you\u2019re talking about. And yeah, it\u2019s absolutely a real thing.\u201d (The voice is without gender, by the way; you hear it from women and men.) Each expert offered a slightly different explanation, but there was overlap, agreement. A pattern emerged. As far as I can tell, there are three basic explanations. The voice is the intricate product of a multipronged historical process.According to this explanation, the voice is a side effect of a life of intense religious study. Because neither the Torah nor the Talmud is punctuated, students learn to add intonation with vocal emphasis. Which is why so many rabbis end sentences on a rise. \u201cLong ago, that phrasing was translated into everyday language by Ashkenazi Jews, then brought into English,\u201d Sarah Bunin Benor, a professor of Jewish studies at Hebrew Union College, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s so common that even newcomers to the community pick it up,\u201d she added, presumably meaning mothers-in-law, converts, Hollywood agents, \u201csometimes intentionally, sometimes unknowingly.\u201dIt\u2019s a literary style that created a certain kind of mind \u2014 made by the people, it remade the people in turn, organized their thinking around endless probing.The cadence comes from the dialect of the shtetl and the Pale of Settlement, where Jews developed an especially expressive language to describe especially terrible circumstances. In New York, Yiddish-isms mixed with neighborhood lingo, creating a patois. Some of those phrases made it into the American lexicon, where they live forever. Or consider my Grandma Esther, born in Poland, moved to New York, then to what she called \u201cthe true promised land of the Jews,\u201d North Miami Beach, where she lived in a condo complex named the Three Seasons \u2014 because there is no winter in the land of milk and honey. You could never tell if she was trying to be funny, or if it was just the Yoda effect. When her second husband, Izzy, died a year into the marriage, she told it this way: \u201cIzzy was doing a dish. I was in the bathroom. A crash I heard. I thought Izzy dropped a dish, but, when I came out, I saw that what Izzy had dropped was dead.\u201dThe voice originated from the Talmud and Yiddish, but spread via imitation \u2014 many rabbis imitating some long ago Rabbi Chuck Yeager. That\u2019s why it thrives among even the most assimilated clergy members. For many people who\u2019ve forgotten the rituals, the voice, along with bagels and lox, Streisand and Koufax, is what remains of the old ways, a comforting item in the storehouse of cultural Judaism. Why do even Reform rabbis talk like that? Because it makes them seem Jewish and because it\u2019s what their congregants want. When I asked an old friend who was ordained as a Reform rabbi \u2014 he did not talk like that in school \u2014 if he knew about the voice, he emailed me, saying, \u201cMy rabbi spoke in the same way, and I\u2019ve adapted the approach.\u201d He doesn\u2019t use it all the time, he said, but it has its uses. \u201cI definitely do when I know I\u2019m going to have a big audience, such as on the High Holy Days. That voice is sort of the rabbi\u2019s version of a mic drop.\u201dEmbedded in that tone is the history of a particular branch of the Hebrews, the Expulsion and the endless walk out of Zion, forays in Germany and Poland, shtetls and schools, the jewel like cities of the East, the mystics and false messiahs, the misery, hatred and pogroms, the wars, harbors and ships, grandparents who laid their lives across the water so that we could walk into Brooklyn and Cleveland and Chicago, then the big shul in the suburbs, where the voice is all that remains.Rich Cohen is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Chicago Cubs: The Story of a Curse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Could Monitoring Students on Social Media Stop the Next School Shooting?", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHours after the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Fla., companies that market their services to schools began to speak up. \u201cGovernor, take pride that a Vermont-based company is helping schools identify the violence before it happens,\u201d one company wrote on Twitter to Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont.The chief executive of another company appeared on the news to boast of a \u201chome run\u201d: Its algorithms, he said, had helped prevent two student suicides.To an anguished question that often follows school shootings \u2014 Why didn\u2019t anyone spot the warning signs? \u2014 these companies have answered with a business model: 24/7 monitoring of student activity on social media.Often without advance warning to students and parents, the companies flag posts like those of Auseel Yousefi, who was expelled in 2013 from his high school in Huntsville, Ala., for Twitter posts made on the last day of his junior year. \u201cA kid has a right to be who they want outside of school,\u201d he said later.More than 100 public school districts and universities, faced with the prospect that the next attacker may be among their own students, have hired social media monitoring companies over the past five years, according to a review of school spending records. And each successive tragedy brings more customers: In the weeks after the Parkland attack, dozens of schools entered into such contracts, even though there is little evidence that the programs work as promised.The customers have included districts reeling in the aftermath of shootings, like the Newtown Public Schools in Connecticut; some of the nation\u2019s largest urban school systems, like Los Angeles and Chicago; and prominent universities like Michigan State and Florida State. The monitoring is one of a host of products and services, including active shooter insurance and facial recognition technology, that are being marketed to schools amid questions about their value.\u201cIf it helps save one life, it\u2019s worth every dollar spent on it,\u201d said Chris Frydrych, the chief executive of Geo Listening, a California company whose website says, \u201cDon\u2019t miss out on the opportunity to listen.\u201dIn many cases the monitoring contracts have not worked out as planned. There is little evidence the companies have helped ferret out brewing threats of violence, bullying or self-harm, according to a review of contracts, marketing materials and emails obtained through public records requests.But in hiring them, schools expand the traditional boundaries of their responsibility, and perhaps, experts say, their liability. And, the documents show, they vacuum up hundreds of harmless posts, raising questions about student privacy.One of the posts by Mr. Yousefi, now 22, said he was going to \u201cchop\u201d a teacher \u201cin the throat,\u201d which he said was an inside joke among the class, the teacher included. He believes his posts were brought to the school\u2019s attention by a social media monitoring company seeking clients.\u201cIt takes authority and extends it to an inappropriate extent in a way that\u2019s truly terrifying,\u201d he said. Shortly afterward, the district hired a firm to monitor posts, and more than a dozen students were expelled.The monitoring programs have often been initiated without notifying students, parents or local school boards. Because of their relatively low cost \u2014 contracts typically range from a few thousand dollars to $40,000 per year \u2014 the deals can get buried in school board agendas.In their advertising, the companies promise much, but when contacted, they declined to give details on specific incidents, citing nondisclosure agreements and student privacy laws. Many schools also declined to give details of instances in which they used the companies\u2019 information.Interviews and marketing materials help paint a picture of the companies\u2019 basic approach. Some apply and pay for access to social media companies\u2019 public data, such as Twitter\u2019s so-called data fire hose, which gives users the ability to access and analyze public tweets in bulk.Rather than asking schools for a list of students and social media handles, the companies typically employ a method called \u201cgeofencing\u201d to sweep up posts within a given geographic area and use keywords to narrow the pool. Because only a small fraction of social media users share their locations, the companies use additional clues, like a user\u2019s hometown, to determine whose content is worth flagging.School officials are alerted to flagged posts in real time or in batches at the end of each day. Burlington High School in Massachusetts typically receives two to six alerts per day from Social Sentinel, the company based in Vermont, according to a list of alerts from 2017. Many consisted of normal teenage banter.\u201cOk so all day I\u2019ve wanted my bio grade up online and now that it\u2019s up I\u2019ve decided I want to die,\u201d one Twitter post said.\u201cHangnails make me want to die,\u201d said another.By its count, Social Sentinel has contracts in more than 30 states.\u201cWe\u2019re a carbon monoxide detector,\u201d said Gary Margolis, the company\u2019s chief executive and a former campus police chief. \u201cIf a student is posting about not liking their teacher, that\u2019s not what we pay attention to. If a student is posting about shooting their teacher, we would hope we\u2019d be able to find something like that.\u201dMark Pompano, the security director for the school district that includes Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, has vetted hundreds of school safety products since the mass shooting there. In 2015, impressed by Social Sentinel\u2019s pitch, he gave the company a try for a few months, but it never caught anything serious, he said.Social Sentinel struggled to weed out posts from the Twitter account of a nearby liquor store, records show.\u201cI cannot recall a single incident that we used Social Sentinel to pursue some type of security threat or anything like that,\u201d Mr. Pompano said. \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019re not going to stick with it.\u201dToday, Mr. Pompano said, the district relies mostly on tips from students, a system that works well if there is an atmosphere of trust. \u201cIt goes back to human intelligence, where kids have at least one trusted adult,\u201d he said, \u201cknowing what they\u2019re telling them is confidential.\u201dIn a few cases, school administrators said, monitoring services have helped them identify students who appeared to be at risk of harming themselves. More rare were instances in which an imminent threat to others was thwarted. In 2015, as the first anniversary of a shooting at Florida State approached, a post expressing sympathy for the gunman and an intent to visit the campus was intercepted by Social Sentinel, the campus police chief said. The man was stopped on campus and warned to stay away. When he returned, he was arrested.Patrick Larkin, an assistant superintendent in Burlington, Mass., said he receives alerts on his phone in real time from Social Sentinel. \u201cNineteen out of 20\u201d come from people who are not even his students, he said earlier this year.Real threats, administrators said, are more often flagged by vigilant users, as was the case with the Parkland gunman, whose troubling comments on YouTube were reported to the F.B.I.Mr. Larkin said Social Sentinel helps him sleep easier at night. And because it can track only public posts \u2014 nothing that requires a \u201cfriend\u201d request \u2014 he doesn\u2019t see it as an intrusion.\u201cMy concern was, what if it\u2019s some odd hour and some kid tweets something I don\u2019t see?\u201d he said.Mr. Margolis said it is hard to demonstrate that harm has been averted. \u201cHow do you measure the absence of something?\u201d he said, adding that Social Sentinel\u2019s algorithms have improved in recent months.One client, Michael Sander, the superintendent of Franklin City Schools in Ohio, said he had planned to contact the police about a Twitter message that read, \u201cThere\u2019s three seasons: summer, construction season and school shooting season.\u201d But the poster appeared to attend school in Franklin, Wis. \u2014 not Ohio.Some companies have backed off from early promises, including creating watch lists that tracked specific people. LifeRaft, based in Nova Scotia, told the Salem-Keizer Public Schools in Oregon that it could help the district find \u201cbehavioral information\u201d on \u201cindividuals of concern.\u201d The company also vowed to monitor the conversations of \u201cgroups and networks\u201d connected with those individuals.Mary Jane Leslie, the vice president of LifeRaft, acknowledged that the language was \u201ccreepy,\u201d saying, \u201cTo be frank, I don\u2019t think the software ever really did that.\u201dShe added that the company no longer markets its services to schools.The A.C.L.U. called out Media Sonar, an Ontario firm that recommended that its police clients monitor hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter, #DontShoot and #ImUnarmed. In late 2015, around the one-year anniversary of the death of Michael Brown in an encounter with the police in Ferguson, Mo., Media Sonar briefly contracted with the Ferguson-Florissant School District, which asked for alerts on the terms \u201cprotest\u201d and \u201cwalkout.\u201dKevin Hampton, a spokesman for the district, said the service was used strictly for safety purposes. Media Sonar did not respond to interview requests.But privacy advocates questioned whether safety was the companies\u2019 only motive. \u201cThe companies seem to dance back and forth\u201d between marketing themselves for public health and student discipline, said Kade Crockford, director of the A.C.L.U. of Massachusetts\u2019 Technology for Liberty program. \u201cThose two goals seem fairly at odds and somewhat contradictory.\u201dIn 2013, the Huntsville City Schools in Alabama enlisted a consulting firm for a surveillance program that led to the expulsion of 14 students, 12 of them African-American.Casey Wardynski, the district\u2019s former superintendent, told local news organizations that the program had helped break up a local gang, and some students were expelled for wielding guns on Facebook.One student had been accused of \u201cholding too much money\u201d in photographs, an investigation by the Southern Poverty Law Center found, and one was suspended for an Instagram post in which she wore a sweatshirt with an airbrushed image of her father, a murder victim. School officials said the sweatshirt\u2019s colors and the student\u2019s hand symbol were evidence of gang ties, according to the investigation.Monitoring students\u2019 lives off campus is untested terrain. School lawyers are advising administrators to be \u201cvery cautious,\u201d said Sonja Trainor, the managing director of legal advocacy for the National School Boards Association. Districts \u201ctend to find that they\u2019re inundated with information, and it becomes very difficult to establish parameters for issuing warnings to the community,\u201d she said.In 2013, the Glendale Unified School District in California hired the company Geo Listening in response to student suicides in which online bullying had been cited as a factor.Lilly Leif, a 2017 graduate of Glendale\u2019s Crescenta Valley High School, said she was summoned to the assistant principal\u2019s office after using an expletive in a post about her biology class. The assistant principal showed her a printed copy and asked her to change her account settings to private, she said.\u201cShe said it reflected poorly on my high school and my teacher,\u201d said Ms. Leif, 19, now a college sophomore.In another instance, Ms. Leif said, an administrator asked students to delete a message promoting a school fund-raiser at \u201cBlaze Pizza\u201d and \u201cBaked Bear\u201d \u2014 actual pizza and ice cream establishments \u2014 because of the apparent allusions to marijuana.Rene Valdes, the district\u2019s former director of student support services, said the program included teaching students online etiquette. \u201cThe conversation with the kid would be, \u2018Realize that companies are now monitoring social media before they hire people,\u2019\u201d Mr. Valdes said.After an outcry in Glendale, the State Legislature passed a 2014 law requiring California schools to notify students and parents if they are even considering a monitoring program. The law also lets students see any information collected about them and tells schools to destroy all data on students once they turn 18 or leave the district.That\u2019s no longer a concern for Glendale, which dropped its contract with Geo Listening last year.\u201cWe discovered more and more kids were using Instagram and Snapchat, and those were not being monitored by Geo Listening,\u201d Mr. Valdes said. \u201cIt seems like the kids are always two steps ahead of the adults.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Loosens Vaccine Law Just as Children Return to School", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 For years, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement has spread confusion about vaccines.Its co-founder raised links between vaccines and autism. Its political leader campaigned against a law making vaccines obligatory. Its myriad websites drew traffic with posts by vaccine skeptics, and its party representatives blamed vaccines for tumors and allergies. For one senator, vaccine scars were \u201cbranding for beasts.\u201dOn Thursday, as school began this past week around Italy, the Five Star Movement and its coalition partner, the League, passed a measure that allows children to stay in school as long as their parents attest that they have been vaccinated, or will be by March. No doctor\u2019s note is required.Critics consider the decree a dangerous, and purely political, measure that creates chaos in the school system, increases the risk to classmates with autoimmune deficiencies and tempts a public health crisis.Only a year ago, the number of measles cases in Italy climbed to 5,006 in 2017, from 843 in 2016. Last year, Italy had Europe\u2019s third-highest per capita rate of measles after much-poorer Romania and Greece. Mexico has recommended that its citizens be vaccinated before traveling to Italy.Italy is perhaps the most acute case of a contagion of another kind spreading in Europe and the West \u2014 one in which populist politics, misinformation and psuedo-science on the internet have combined with an anti-establishment mood in which experts are not to be trusted.But now the populist forces that have fueled that trend hold power, and must deal with the consequences affecting the public health and security of citizens.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the anti-establishment drift,\u201d said Beatrice Lorenzin, the health minister in the previous, center-left government and the namesake of the 2017 law making vaccines obligatory. \u201cBecause everything is a caste, also science becomes a caste. But science is the last bastion, when you have minimized the authority of science, there is nothing else.\u201dFacing an increase in measles cases and a decade-long erosion of trust in vaccines, the prior Italian government required that children receive 10 vaccinations before enrolling in school. The law came into force this year.But this summer, Ms. Lorenzin\u2019s successor in the new populist government, Giulia Grillo of the Five Star Movement, sought to loosen the requirements, at one point offering something she called \u201cflexible obligation.\u201d Ms. Grillo, who declined to comment for this article, finally settled on the extension for students without proof of vaccination.\u201cNothing has changed; it\u2019s exactly like it was,\u201d Rocco Casalino, the spokesman for the Five Star Movement, said after the law was approved on Thursday \u2014 raising the question of why, then, it was passed at all.On Thursday, Five Star senators said they would next seek to undo the vaccine law altogether.\u201cUnfortunately, the state has diffused ambiguous information that can confuse the parents who are trying to decide whether or not to vaccinate their kids,\u201d said Roberto Burioni, a leading immunologist at Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele and a b\u00eate noire of the anti-vaccine movement. (One mother posted a Facebook message saying she hoped he\u2019d drowned on his summer vacation.)\u201cThe state should be clear, and be clearly on the part of science,\u201d Mr. Burioni said.The measles vaccine, which over the past 50 years has helped eliminate the disease in the United States, was introduced in Italy in 1976. The percentage of coverage climbed steadily to more than 90 percent in 2003. But the obligation was eased in 1999, Ms. Lorenzin said, because Italy had mistakenly believed it had ingrained the belief in science and vaccines into the culture.Instead, she said, the opposite happened. She attributed the surge of distrust in vaccines to the fact that the diseases had become so rare as to seem unreal, to the debacle of a since-rejected and retracted report in the scientific journal The Lancet linking vaccines to autism, and to what she called \u201cDoctor Google.\u201dBy 2015, coverage had declined to about 85 percent. Cases of measles, which can cause blindness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and in some cases death, have been rising.Italy\u2019s \u201cNo-Vax\u201d movement has risen, too. In Rimini, a hotbed of No-Vax activity and the site of a 2012 ruling by a local judge, later overturned, that linked autism to vaccines, anti-vaccination advocates attached streamers to planes that read, \u201cEveryone to School. Freedom of Choice.\u201dIn Veneto, the governor, Luca Zaia of the League, has promoted a \u201cpersonalized\u201d approach to evaluating vaccinations. Families have organized a secluded \u201cschool in the woods\u201d for unvaccinated children, while others have met in private homes.Ms. Lorenzin said that if she were still the health minister, she would send the police to break up the illegal schools. \u201cIt\u2019s a chemical bomb,\u201d she said.Mattia Marchi, a spokesman for the Veneto chapter of Corveleva, a No-Vax umbrella group, said parents skeptical of vaccines still had little choice but to vaccinate.\u201cNo one ever said that a vaccine causes autism,\u201d Mr. Marchi said. \u201cBut if a thousand people see a U.F.O., do we want to tell these people that they are crazy or do we want to find a solution?\u201dLast week, Federico Aliberti, an artisan, came from Livorno to Rome with his 3-year-old son to protest the required vaccination of all Italian nursery and school children.Mr. Aliberti, who voted for Five Star, said he resented the \u201carrogance\u201d of scientists who presumed to understand something as complicated as the human immune system. His Facebook feed, he said, had been filled with clips of Five Star politicians promising personal choice, as well as articles and videos about the pharmaceutical interests behind vaccines and the vaccines\u2019 supposed connections to cancers and autism.The government, he said, had given him hope but, even with the new measure, delivered only \u201ca stab in the back.\u201dIndeed, for years, the Five Star Movement, and more recently, the League, had given him something to believe in.Beppe Grillo, the co-founder of the Five Star Movement, has raised a link between vaccines and autism, suggested that vaccines weaken the immune systems of healthy children, and claimed that the pharmaceutical industry has pushed them for profit. Members of the party in the European Parliament have proposed eliminating some obligatory vaccinations for some public employees and professed a link between leukemia, tumors, allergies and autism to vaccinations.In another instance, they raised concerns that vaccines might be dangerous for possessing metals. The party\u2019s mayor in Livorno called the obligation to vaccinate \u201cintolerable,\u201d while others in Puglia invited people to a hearing by doctors who believed eating nuts was more effective than vaccines in preventing illnesses.Last February, Paola Taverna, a prominent Five Star senator, fondly recalled \u201cparading to her cousin\u2019s\u201d house to catch whatever disease was going around as a preferable option to vaccines, which she compared to \u201cbranding for beasts \u201d (This week, though, Ms. Taverna said she would have her own child vaccinated.)In July, a regional council member in the Five Star Movement from Lazio presented a proposal requiring students to go into quarantine for four to six weeks after receiving their vaccinations. The member, Davide Barillari, also called for an \u201cinformational\u201d stage about the \u201ccausal correlations\u201d between vaccines and pathologies for parents who sought vaccines in clinics. \u201cPolitics comes before science,\u201d he said.Davide Casaleggio, the powerful son of the party\u2019s other co-founder, who many believe controls the web platforms upon which the party functions, wrote on his blog that the Five Star Movement \u201ctotally distances itself\u201d from Mr. Barillari\u2019s statements.\u201cIt was to draw traffic and advertising, on the theme of health,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of consensus around it, but when the party got bigger and it became uncomfortable, they distanced themselves.\u201dDuring the campaign, as the candidates raised questions about vaccines, the party\u2019s leaders made sure to always say they were not against vaccines. They did so again after passing Thursday\u2019s law.Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League, Five Star\u2019s coalition partner, apparently wanted to get in on the anti-vaccination action as he built his own populist movement.In March 2013, Mr. Salvini seemed unbothered about vaccines when he wrote on Twitter that his daughter Mirta had received her first vaccinations. \u201cShe laughed, mom was the most worried,\u201d he wrote.Two years later, in October 2015, when he was still closer to the political margins, he seemed to test the political power of the issue. \u201cObligatory vaccinations, sanctions on the doctors who advise against it. What do you think?\u201dTwo years after that, in April 2017, he asked, \u201cThe first Italian doctor who says NO to vaccines has been expelled. What do you think?\u201d Soon after he tweeted that he thought it was \u201cmad\u201d to impose so many vaccines. He insisted the choice should be left to parents.In subsequent Twitter posts he made it clear that he supported parents protesting in front of Rome\u2019s parliament building, that he was always on the side of \u201cfreedom of choice,\u201d and that he was suspicious of multinational corporations promoting vaccines.He also called for preventive pre-vaccine tests to ensure the vaccines would not harm the children.Such a test \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Ms. Lorenzin said. \u201cIt\u2019s misinformation.\u201dEmma Johanningsmeier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The New York Times Endorses Jumaane Williams for Lieutenant Governor in Thursday\u2019s Primary", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "OpinionThe City Council member from Brooklyn can bring welcome change to Albany.Supported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The lieutenant governor of New York, day to day, is in charge of ribbon-cutting and little else. But twice in 45 years, the occupant of that office rose to become the state\u2019s chief executive upon a governor\u2019s departure. So while races for lieutenant governor have often been forgettable, the result can be consequential.Jumaane Williams, an independent-minded New York City Council member, has shown that he can be a real leader and is the right choice for lieutenant governor in the Democratic primary next Thursday.The current lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, a lawyer and former county clerk and House member from Buffalo, is a dedicated public servant. But in her more than three years in office, Ms. Hochul has served as little more than an echo for Gov. Andrew Cuomo. During a debate with Mr. Williams, Ms. Hochul could not name a single instance in which she had changed the governor\u2019s mind on an issue, or opposed one of his policies.We have endorsed Mr. Cuomo for governor in the Democratic primary, while arguing that he is likely to act aggressively against systemic corruption in Albany only if reformers continue to pressure him.While the lieutenant governor holds an essentially ceremonial position, Mr. Williams has vowed, if elected, to do what he can to add to that pressure.Mr. Williams, a three-term councilman from Brooklyn, has also said he would use the office as a bully pulpit to push for progress on affordable housing, the subways and criminal justice reform. And he has promised to call out the governor \u2014 whoever that may be \u2014 whenever necessary. Mr. Williams, 42, comes with an impressive record on the City Council, which oversees the city\u2019s nearly $90 billion budget, and the largest school system and police department in the country. It was his 2013 legislation, known as the Community Safety Act, that brought much-needed changes to the New York Police Department, which had conducted unconstitutional pedestrian stops of millions of innocent New Yorkers for nearly a decade. The hard-fought legislation from Mr. Williams and Councilman Brad Lander, another Brooklyn Democrat, created an inspector general to provide independent oversight of the department.It also made it easier for New Yorkers who felt the city police had discriminated against them based on sexual orientation, gender or other categories to bring a lawsuit.Time and time again over his near-decade in public service, Mr. Williams has brought issues to the fore that affected millions of New Yorkers but had gone unaddressed by the city\u2019s leaders. He was an early advocate of an anti-violence model known as Cure Violence, which uses mediators to stop shootings before they occur. The approach has become widely used in New York City, where police officers and others have credited it with driving down crime. Mr. Williams also led a yearslong campaign to push the city to create thousands more summer jobs for young people.He has a reputation for thoughtfully building consensus, earned by passing some 50 pieces of legislation. That total makes him among the most productive members of the City Council. Ms. Hochul has made this campaign ugly at times, running digital ads that have unfairly characterized Mr. Williams and his record on important issues.One ad questions Mr. Williams\u2019s support for gay rights. The councilman once said that he believed marriage was between a man and a woman; in 2014 he chose not to give an up-or-down vote on a Council bill to allow transgender New Yorkers to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. Mr. Williams has apologized for failing to vote on the 2014 legislation, and he has become a strong, reliable supporter of L.G.B.T.Q. rights. We expect Mr. Williams, if elected, to continue to be a defender of a woman\u2019s right to choose and of L.G.B.T.Q. rights. On Primary Day next Thursday, Democrats should vote for Mr. Williams, a real reformer who would be a potent voice for all New Yorkers. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.D.A. Targets Vaping, Alarmed by Teenage Use", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday declared that teenage use of electronic cigarettes has reached \u201can epidemic proportion,\u201d and it put makers of the most popular devices on notice that they have just 60 days to prove they can keep their devices away from minors.The order was part of a sweeping government action that targeted both makers and sellers of e-cigarettes. If Juul Labs and four other major manufacturers fail to halt sales to minors, the agency said, it could remove their flavored products from the market. It also raised the possibility of civil or criminal charges if companies are allowing bulk sales through their websites.E-cigarette users inhale far fewer toxic chemicals than do smokers of traditional cigarettes. But they can take in higher levels of nicotine, which is addictive.\u201cThe developing adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to addiction,\u201d the F.D.A. said in its statement announcing the actions.In an emailed statement, a Juul spokeswoman said: \u201cJuul Labs will work proactively with F.D.A. in response to its request. We are committed to preventing underage use of our product, and we want to be part of the solution in keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of young people.\u201dIf such \u201cstraw sales\u201d are happening, it should be readily apparent to the manufacturers, he said. \u201cIf the companies don\u2019t know, or if they don\u2019t want to know, we\u2019ll now be helping to identify it for them.\u201dThe other four products facing the 60-day deadline are RJR Vapor Co.\u2019s Vuse, Imperial Brands\u2019 blu and devices made by Logic. They said they were working with the F.D.A. as well.RJR, Imperial and Altria are all major tobacco companies. As smoking rates have declined, the industry sees e-cigarettes as an important piece of its survival, a fact that makes some in public health mistrustful.\u201cThey say they\u2019ve changed from the days of Joe Camel,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said. \u201cBut look at what\u2019s happening right now, on our watch and on their watch. They must demonstrate that they\u2019re truly committed to keeping these new products out of the hands of kids.\u201dDr. Gottlieb has said many times he believes that e-cigarettes and similar products known as electronic nicotine delivery systems may be effective options for adults who want to stop smoking but still crave nicotine. But he said teenage vaping has become so concerning that regulators may have to curb the availability of the devices to keep them out of the hands of youths.\u201cInevitably what we are going to have to contemplate are actions that may narrow the off-ramp for adults who see e-cigarettes as a viable alternative to combustible tobacco in order to close the on ramp for kids,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate trade-off.\u201dDr. Gottlieb\u2019s aggressive approach against private industry is unusual for an official in the business-friendly Trump administration which has sought to roll back numerous environmental and health regulations. But critics said that his decision last summer to extend a deadline for e-cigarette manufacturers to demonstrate that their products comply with public health concerns helped perpetuate the current problem.She also pointed to the popularity of vaping among young adults. Researchers generally believe that the adolescent brain continues to develop through age 26. \u201cIt\u2019s a big epidemic among people ages 18 to 30, too,\u201d she said.And while the F.D.A.\u2019s announcement struck many as tough, legal experts said the agency could face a protracted legal fight if it follows through on its threats to ban flavors and curtail marketing.While the actions against the industry are alarming to the e-cigarette companies, they are also problematic for the F.D.A.In July 2017, as part of a broad plan to reduce tobacco deaths in the United States, the F.D.A. extended the deadline for e-cigarette makers to comply with new tough federal guidelines, which, among other things, require companies to prove the e-cigarettes are beneficial to public health. In granting the five-year extension till 2022, Dr. Gottlieb said he would also force manufacturers to cut nicotine levels in traditional cigarettes, to render them nonaddictive. For that to work, he said, smokers needed more and better cigarette substitutes.But in an interview, Dr. Gottlieb said the immense popularity of vaping among teens and the growing addiction among young people was not something he foresaw last summer, and the agency must rethink its policy \u2014 perhaps moving the deadline closer and requiring companies to gain F.D.A. approval to stay on the shelves.\u201cI\u2019m highly concerned now,\u201d Dr. Robinson said. Beyond nicotine, the addition of heat to the e-liquid flavors generates chemicals that have not yet been studied in depth, she added.The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, who recently began an investigation into the marketing and sale of e-cigarettes to minors, praised the F.D.A.\u2019s action.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked too hard over the past 50 years to reduce smoking rates among young people to let these companies profit off of getting them hooked on nicotine,\u201d Ms. Healey said. \u201cThis move by the F.D.A. is a good first step to shut down companies targeting minors.\u201dA Juul spokeswoman, Victoria Davis, said recently that the company had already stepped up its own patrol of retailers who advertise to youths or who don\u2019t enforce age requirements, as well as social media posts. But it\u2019s not always easy.From Jan. 1 through July 28, Ms. Davis said, Juul asked Instagram to remove over 5,500 posts, and the social media company complied on 4,562. Facebook Marketplace was less agreeable. The company agreed to remove 45 of 144 posts. Amazon took down 13 of 33.Dr. Gottlieb said he was not impressed by the measures Juul and the other companies have taken.\u201cIt didn\u2019t have the intended impact or I wouldn\u2019t be viewing the statistics I\u2019m now seeing,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We\u2019re Trying Something New. This Is \u2018On Politics.\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHi. Welcome to the first edition of On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host and curator. You may have noticed, I\u2019m new here.At On Politics, we believe that politics is much more than the White House and the horse race. It\u2019s culture and sports. It\u2019s across the globe and in your backyard. It\u2019s devouring your Facebook feed.It\u2019s the way we live today. And it can be completely, utterly overwhelming.So we decided it was time to try something different.What if we could send a letter to our readers that would be a guiding hand through the chaos? That would introduce them to the people reshaping our politics. And that would engage voters across the country in a respectful conversation.It\u2019s an ambitious idea, and we\u2019ll need your help. As I said before, I\u2019m new here.I\u2019ve been a political reporter for over a decade, covering presidential campaigns, Congress and the White House. But I\u2019ve never written a newsletter \u2014 certainly not a daily one. (Did we mention? We\u2019re daily! Every morning we\u2019ll round up the day\u2019s biggest stories, and every evening I\u2019ll help you make sense of the madness.)So, to mark our first day trying something new, we decided to ask for tales of other beginnings \u2014 and get a bit of advice, too.Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, called from her kitchen in Cambridge to tell us this story:When I was young, my Aunt Bea would get me one outfit for the first day of school. This was a really big treat and it was our tradition every year. When I\u2019m in fifth grade, I pick out a really cool number with a straight skirt and a vest that matches. They\u2019re wool.This is Oklahoma. It\u2019s September. It\u2019s hot. Really hot.I get up on my first day of school and my mother said, \u2018You can\u2019t wear that. It\u2019s going to be 90 degrees outside.\u2019 Of course, I insisted and wore it.I can still remember how miserable I was sweating through that first day. The backs of my legs were stuck on that itchy wool skirt. Sweat dripped down my legs. When I got home, my mother said, \u2018How was it wearing your outfit on the first day?\u2019 I said, \u2018It was just great.\u2019When you determine something\u2019s going to be great, it will be great.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida offered up this:My first day on the job after my freshman year in high school was a disaster. I was working as a messenger and courier. And after three parking tickets and an accident with a fender bender with a postal carrier, I was a whole month\u2019s worth of pay in the hole \u2014 after just one day.Representative Nancy Pelosi, the first female speaker of the House, told us:When I went to my first meeting as leader of House Democrats with President Bush, I thought this was an ordinary meeting at the White House. But when I went through the door, I realized it was unlike any other meeting I had ever been to, or any woman had ever been to, because there it was, the leadership of our country, all men, and I, as a woman, having a seat at the table. As President Bush welcomed me there, I felt very closed in to my seat.I couldn\u2019t figure out what it was, and then I realized \u2014 there I was with Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Alice Paul. All the suffragettes who fought so hard for the right to vote. And as they sat with me on that chair, I could hear them say, \u2018At last we have a seat at the table.\u2019 And then they were gone.Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, said:My first day as speaker of the House, at about 7 a.m., I went out on the speaker\u2019s balcony and I looked down the mall and I thought, it is amazing that an army brat could end up being speaker of the House. I had no money. I had no connections. And yet, there I was.My advice to anyone starting something new: Cheerful persistence.We\u2019ll end with the most simple advice, a perennial favorite of Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, which he once dispensed to me at a cocktail party:Don\u2019t [expletive] it up.Lisa: It was a big weekend in the governor\u2019s race: An anti-Semitic mailer, a \u201cpotentially dangerous situation\u201d with the Tappan Zee Bridge and a very bad poll for Cynthia Nixon. Did any of this change the race in some fundamental way?Shane: The race dynamics seem very set and very stable and they all point to Cuomo winning. But, yeah, he had a horrible weekend \u2014 probably the worst of his campaign.So don\u2019t expect another Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez moment on Thursday night?Probably not. I went to a rally that Nixon had on Saturday with Ocasio-Cortez and she\u2019s drawing all the people you\u2019d expect a liberal challenger to draw. But she\u2019s not engaging a bigger audience.Even if she loses, has Nixon reshaped New York politics in some way?At this point, it seems like Nixon\u2019s biggest impact on New York politics may be determined by what other people on the ballot end up doing on Thursday, especially Zephyr Teachout, who\u2019s running for attorney general and is a huge Cuomo antagonist, and Jumaane Williams, who\u2019s running for lieutenant governor. Bernie Sanders endorsed both of them on Monday, but not Nixon. That just about says it all.And Cuomo, where does he go from here? He\u2019s not going to run for president, is he?He has said only death will stop him from finishing his third term. God or death. Which are two things that are tough to change your word on.Eh, maybe it\u2019s more a \u2018spiritual\u2019 death. He\u2019s a politician \u2014 and a very self-confident one at that. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way to wiggle out of death.At the beginning of 2019, I think it\u2019s safe to say Andrew Cuomo will look around the country and think of himself as one of the most qualified Democrats to be president.

{"Headline": "Where and Why Do People Come Together in Your Community?", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStudent OpinionIs there a place in your neighborhood, town or city that is especially welcoming to all kinds of people? A shared space where people connect and spend meaningful time together? Why do people like to gather there?Do you think our world has fewer and fewer places like this? Do they matter?Ms. Pilon writes about Skate World, the roller rink of her Oregon youth, and what she realizes about its role in her community as it closes:...Many a crush was nursed within those carpeted walls, where kitschy pop and disco songs were requested one-by-one on steady rotation, the smell of stale nachos and body odor permeated the air, and beige skates were rented out with questionable aromas of their own. I was an ambidextrous child, and the symmetry of roller skating was a welcome respite from my awkwardness with physical activities that involved a ball or a racket.For a small fee, paid in loose change and crumpled dollar bills, carnations could be dedicated to those circulating on the baby blue floor, eliciting a round of giggles or groans. Chewing gum and \u201cfoul language\u201d were supposedly banned; I can now come clean about dropping obscenity bombs in a rebellious preadolescent fervor and sneaking in Bubble Yum on multiple occasions. In a mud hole of constant drizzle, skating was a welcome activity for cooped-up children and their exhausted parents, a more kid-friendly bowling alley. As a community gathering spot, the rink felt less classist than a shopping mall but less intimidating than a church, and much less soggy than a park.It was perfect.I also found myself wondering about the consequences of a beloved shared space closing its doors in this era of great disconnection. Some communities are formed through schools, churches, workplaces. But much of how we learn about one another as a society comes from physically being together in places like skating rinks. Today, we\u2019re more likely to sext than skate, to troll online than to twirl on a floor, to rant on Twitter than dedicate carnations to one another. Social media has created a digital latticework, but it has also, for some, created abusive commenters, silos and validation rather than curiosity.As a Skate World kid, I don\u2019t think I could have told you, nor did I care, about the political leanings of my classmates or their families. We were bound by something different from the angry Facebook stream we grew up to inhabit: a genuine interest in spending time together.Read the entire article, then tell us:\u2014 Is there a place like Skate World in your community? Was there one you remember from childhood? What do you \u2014 or did you \u2014 like about it best? How do or did people come together there?\u2014 Do you agree with this writer that we are in an era of \u201cgreat disconnection,\u201d and that places where we are physically together are dwindling? Why or why not? How much do you think this matters?\u2014 Can coming together on the Internet be just as powerful as coming together in a shared public space, like this roller rink?

{"Headline": "Lady of the Rings: Jacinda Rules ", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJacinda Ardern, one of the young, progressive leaders countering Donald Trump, talks about being only the second world leader to give birth.Opinion ColumnistAt first, the skies were cloudless in the Land of the Long White Cloud. \u201cIt was highly coveted among the princesses at the dinner,\u201d Ardern\u2019s partner, Clarke Gayford, told me. \u201cThey made a beeline for her, and I\u2019m surprised she managed to leave wearing it, to be completely honest.\u201dShe was going to be able to run a country and nurse a baby at the same time \u2014 without a nanny or a wedding ring! The boyish and charming Gayford, the 40-year-old host of a TV fishing show who smiles with delight no matter how many times he is asked \u201cIs Jacinda your greatest catch?\u201d would be the stay-at-home dad who would show the way for modern men. Why had it taken us so long to realize how seamless it could all be? Then Ardern took her first official trip since she gave birth to her daughter, Neve, 11 weeks ago and the fantasy of easy equality evaporated.She has been forced to justify abbreviating her trip to the Pacific Islands Forum on the island of Nauru from three days to one, flying separately from her foreign affairs minister, Winston Peters, on an Air Force jet \u2014 at a cost of about $50,000 in American dollars \u2014 so that she could breast-feed her daughter. Neve was too young to get the vaccinations necessary to go along. Even though Ardern had to fly there in the middle of the night and fly back a day later in the middle of the night, she wanted to attend because all Kiwi prime ministers consider it a can\u2019t-miss; and also because she didn\u2019t want to seem like she was shying away from an ongoing debate with Australia, as she tries to rescue refugees from the hideous holding facilities in Nauru, the shame of Australia.Critics said Ardern should have gone for the whole three days or just stayed home and left the duties to Peters, who was \u201cmore than capable of holding court with all the local leaders over a drink at happy hour,\u201d as the morning TV host Duncan Garner huffed.Never mind that in a nation dependent on tourism, Jacinda is the biggest thing to hit here since Frodo dropped the ring into Mount Doom. Her ministers had to defend her.\u201cThis is an aircraft and a crew who would be working anyway,\u201d Grant Robertson, the finance minister, told the press. \u201cWe allocate a certain amount of money to them each year, so it\u2019s either this flight or another flight.\u2019\u2019 And Peters told me that he knew of an instance when a man in government here \u201cwith less authority and status who did that and no media beat him up. She should ignore the craven, cowardly trolls.\u201dBut she is not ignoring the trolls. When I met her at her gray frame bungalow, a few hours after she got home, she was handing off her big black briefcase to an aide at the door, breast-feeding her daughter and anguishing about what she calls her \u201cdamned if I do, damned if I don\u2019t\u201d moment.\u201cWhat surprised me the most is how hard I took that, being given a hard time for going, but actually it did upset me a bit,\u201d she said, wearing jeans with holes in the knees and a maternity pullover, kicking off her fuzzy leopard slippers and sitting in bare feet on the floor of the living room. Gayford stood in the kitchen, cradling the beautiful baby in a blue-and-white striped blanket. (In a cosmic wink, Neve was born on Bhutto\u2019s birthday.)\u201cIn New Zealand, we\u2019re really careful about excess,\u201d said Ardern, who bought her maternity clothes at Kmart and frequents secondhand stores. The country even resisted the global pandemic of Starbucks. \u201cI hate the idea of anyone thinking that I don\u2019t put a lot of thought about the cost to taxpayers. I make our ministers travel to events in vans to pool together.\u201d She instituted a salary freeze last month that stopped a 3 percent raise for her and the members of Parliament. \u201cI want to be a good leader, not a good lady leader,\u201d Ardern said, stretching out her legs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be known simply as the woman who gave birth.\u201dArdern\u2019s official residence is in Wellington. The Auckland bungalow is surprisingly small and down-to-earth for a prime minister, with knitted items for the baby sent by New Zealanders and toys strewn around. There\u2019s a pink cardboard box full of congratulatory notes from the queen, Prince Charles and world leaders. Gayford has just renovated the deck and is working on the front path. As cyberbullying is to Melania, saving the oceans is to Clarke. Ardern, who intends to teach her daughter Maori, has magnets with Maori numbers from one to 10 on the refrigerator and gave Neve a middle name of Te Aroha.The couple met when he got in touch with her about a constituency issue \u2014 a bill that Gayford worried would erode privacy. They share a love of D.J.-ing and a droll sense of humor. She teased him during one joint interview that she could never shield her daughter from the sight of his dad sweater. And when he saw Ardern\u2019s Vogue spread, he tweeted, \u201cWell that\u2019s the desktop sorted.\u201d When a columnist wrote a nasty piece dismissing the First Bloke as a \u201chipster salty seadog,\u201d he tweeted a picture of himself holding a fish and calling it another bottom feeder. I ask Ardern if she is surprised that America has not yet had a woman at the top. \u201cYes,\u201d she shot back. \u201cBut I was equally surprised at the debate about universal health care. That\u2019s not something we question here.\u201dDespite its beer and rugby bro culture, New Zealand is more progressive than Australia, where women leaders are lining up to call out sexism and bullying. Aotearoa, the Maori name for New Zealand, is celebrating 125 years of suffrage and its third woman prime minister. But Ardern says there\u2019s still work to be done.\u201cI got this letter today from a young woman that was so lovely, I just scribbled a reply back,\u201d she said. \u201cShe got pregnant around the same time as me and she just felt like her boss was more willing to be flexible because he saw this expectation being built around making sure that women could have babies and remain in their jobs. And I thought, well, even if I only create that sentiment or that environment or even create a little bit of solidarity for other women, that is something.\u201d She wants to show that women can lead with different styles, not cast themselves in the egotistical, brash mold of many male politicians. \u201cOne of the criticisms I\u2019ve faced over the years is that I\u2019m not aggressive enough or assertive enough or maybe somehow, because I\u2019m empathetic, it means I\u2019m weak,\u201d she said. \u201cI totally rebel against that. I refuse to believe that you cannot be both compassionate and strong.\u201d On another day, when I came to interview Gayford, Ardern\u2019s mother, Laurell, is there, helping with the baby. Jacinda was raised as a Mormon but left the faith when she was in her 20s over its stance on same-sex marriage. This year, she became the first New Zealand prime minister to march in a gay pride parade. Laurell Ardern said her daughter\u2019s optimism flowered early. At 8, she started a \u201cHappy Club\u201d for unhappy girls in her class, with rules about saying nice things to each other. Her sense of social justice developed early as well. Her mother recalled that when Jacinda was 16 and working as a cashier in a grocery store, she dipped into her own wallet when a customer came up short. Her sunniness is a contrast to the doomsday cult burrowing into her country, which has become a favorite with Peter Thiel and other Silicon Valley digerati obsessing on the end of the world in the land of \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d The Parliament just passed a bill to curb foreigners from snapping up existing homes and crowding out local buyers. Ardern met President Trump in November at the East Asia summit in Vietnam. It came out that at first Trump mistook Ardern for Sophie Trudeau. When he realized who she was, he playfully told someone standing near her, \u201cThis lady caused a lot of upset in her country.\u201d She retorted, laughing, \u201cNo one marched when I was elected.\u201d She did not tell Trump that she herself joined the global women\u2019s march the day after his inauguration. Ardern is so committed to moral leadership, I wondered what she made of the charge in the explosive anonymous Times Op-Ed piece about Trump\u2019s \u201camorality\u201d and how his aides are working to ameliorate his habit of roughing up allies and flirting with foes. New Zealand, after all, is part of the Five Eyes intelligence coalition. And while Silicon Valley types might be marshaling bunkers and building panic rooms in New Zealand for the apocalypse, Washington was already in an apocalypse. Doesn\u2019t she ever call the prime minister of Canada and yell, \u201cOMG, Justin! Are you seeing this?\u201d With classic New Zealand understatement, Ardern replied: \u201cWell, I mean, there was a time when things were a lot more predictable than they are now.\u201d She said she is not fearful because she believes the checks in the American system will hold. President Trump will be presiding over the United Nations Security Council when the General Assembly meets in New York later this month. The prime minister will be trying to combine mothering and traveling again, this time hopefully with less ludicrous commentary. She will be juggling more than 40 events in seven days, with Neve and Gayford as part of the entourage.  I wonder if she worries that she will do something to evoke Trump\u2019s wrath and get a nickname hurled at her. \u201cI\u2019ve been given so many, it\u2019d be quite hard to come up with a new one,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cBack in the early days of my political career, I was called Socialist Cindy. I just hate the nickname Cindy.\u201d Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sheet-Pan Suppers Without the Meat", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA Good AppetiteVegetarians don\u2019t have to miss out on the glory of the sheet-pan dinner: Chickpeas, tofu and black beans are all great proteins to build a meal around.Most sheet-pan suppers rely on meat or fish as the anchor. Toss your chicken or salmon fillets on the pan, surround them with vegetables, and roast until everything turns golden brown, a perfect one-pan meal.But what if you want your choice of protein to come from plants, not animals? It\u2019s no harder to build a sheet-pan supper around a vegetarian protein, and there are more options than you might initially think.Take, for example, beans. While they may not be the first ingredient to spring to mind when you think of a sheet-pan supper, they can work wonderfully, whether you want them crunchy and golden, or soupier and more like chili.Crisping chickpeas in the oven to serve as an hors d\u2019oeuvres or snack is something I\u2019ve been doing for years. Just coat them in oil and spices, and roast at high heat until they sizzle. But to turn them into a sheet-pan supper, I added potatoes. Then, on a separate pan, I roasted chunks of cauliflower strewn with skinny lemon slices. Drizzled with a garlicky herbed yogurt sauce, it\u2019s an incredibly satisfying, richly textured meal zipped up by the caramelized bits of citrus.Cooking beans in the oven is even easier because you don\u2019t have to worry about browning. To make a topping for bean tostadas, I spread a mix of canned black beans, chipotle chiles, oregano and garlic on a sheet pan, and let it bubble in the oven as it thickened. It comes out just as it would in a pot on the stove, but with the added appeal of not having to babysit a simmering pot. While the oven is on, I also roasted thinly sliced bell peppers until tender and golden. Then to serve, the beans, sweet peppers and some avocado get layered onto crisp tortillas for vegetarian tostadas that are easy enough for weeknights.One of my favorite tofu recipes calls for marinating it in tamari and honey, coating it in cornstarch, then baking it until it\u2019s crunchy and brown.Turning this basic formula into a sheet-pan meal is a cinch: Just stick another pan of veggies in the oven at the same time, and add some herbs and crunchy peanuts as garnish.Sliced sweet potatoes work particularly well as a pairing. The wedges turn velvety, adding texture to the meal. But broccoli, brussels sprouts, mushrooms or any number or others can work. Watch them as they cook, pulling them from the oven when they\u2019re finished even if that happens a bit before \u2014 or after \u2014 the tofu is done.A word of warning: The cornstarch coating will most likely cause the tofu to stick to the pan. Using a small metal spatula, either an offset or a fish spatula, will help pry the pieces off for flipping halfway through. You could use nonstick liner here, but it will inhibit the browning and crunch factor. Or skip the cornstarch entirely. What you sacrifice in crunch you gain in ease of preparation.Tempeh and seitan can be used interchangeably with tofu, though you don\u2019t need to drain them first. And in many cases, they even come marinated and ready to just cut up and bake along with your veggies.Finally, there is another, even simpler route for a meatless sheet-pan dinner, one I probably use more than any other. Simply roast up your favorite combination of vegetables, then add a protein-packed garnish at the end. Toasted nuts, crumbled cheeses, yogurt sauces, or fried or hard-cooked eggs can round out your plate with style and verve \u2014 no added meat whatsoever.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does the Cost of Living in New York Spell the End of Its Artistic Life?", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNotes on The CultureMicro-galleries, jury-rigged studios, an old church with a cemetery out back: Real estate has become its own, potentially deal-breaking, creative pursuit.Rines\u2019s circumstances represent the current reality of making and selling art in New York City, where being an artist, or even a gallery owner, often involves day jobs and concessions as prices \u2014 for both rent and the art itself \u2014 have hit a premium. This is an odd dilemma for the New York art world, which has historically tended to cluster and then expand like a bedbug infestation, moving through a variety of central neighborhoods, often with artists themselves leading the way before a larger infrastructure becomes established. This was the case with SoHo in the 1970s and the East Village in the 1980s, and in the \u201990s, high-end galleries planted themselves in the Chelsea neighborhood, driving up prices and development. Less financially secure artists and galleries found themselves pushed farther out from Manhattan, to Brooklyn and, in many cases, beyond.We are now thoroughly in the \u201cbeyond\u201d era. Despite the geographic dispersion of working artists, Manhattan remains the commercial center for exhibiting contemporary art in New York, but the art business no longer has such an obvious center as it once did. For years there was a rigid class system in the city: larger, more expensive galleries in Chelsea; smaller, more up-and-coming ones on the Lower East Side. Now, Chelsea galleries have moved to Chinatown and Harlem, Upper East Side galleries have moved to the Lower East Side and a few pioneers have moved to new frontiers altogether. Artists, meanwhile, exist wherever they can. This means artists \u2014 and art professionals \u2014 have had to get as creative about their working environments as they are with their actual work.To supplement their income as artists, Matranga manages an artist\u2019s studio in Long Island City, while Delacruz works an assortment of mostly art-industry-related temporary gigs. Their housing situation, though, has made possible a lifestyle that would have felt more common in a previous era of New York, or perhaps at any point in history in a smaller, more affordable city. A formal studio, separate from the place where an artist lives and sleeps, once a given for a serious artist, has now become a luxury. When asked about having an actual studio, Delacruz says, \u201cI\u2019ve never done it, so I don\u2019t know.\u201dAbelow told me a story about a young artist who recently approached him asking for guidance regarding a potential move to New York City \u2014 he currently lives in a factory converted to an apartment building in Providence, R.I., where his rent is significantly less than that of his New York City equivalents. Like more and more artists of late, Abelow was hesitant to offer any definitive advice about the best geographic positioning for an artist in his 20s. \u201cIn the past, I would\u2019ve always been like, \u2018Move to New York,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I really don\u2019t know anymore.\u201dWright\u2019s C.V. almost reads like a timeline of the past few decades of underground American art. In the late 1990s, he made silk-screens for Shepard Fairey. He counts among his peers artists like Barry McGee, a beloved West Coast graffiti writer turned fine artist, and members of the performance collective Forcefield, which was included in the 2002 Whitney Biennial. But unlike many of his friends, a certain kind of gallery success has so far eluded Wright. Though he has staged solo exhibitions everywhere from New York to Tokyo, he often gets his funding through corporate commissions \u2014 most recently, he painted a mural for Facebook. I asked him how he thought his career would be different if he had been based in New York this whole time. \u201cI don\u2019t know which way it would\u2019ve went,\u201d he said. \u201cI could\u2019ve been like one of my friends who moved to New York after they were done at the Rhode Island School of Design and just got a corporate job. Or some friends who are still in coffee shops and making their art, you know what I mean? I haven\u2019t had to work at a coffee shop and make my art.\u201d He presented two options for a sustained career as an artist: \u201cIf your artwork makes money, then you can make more of it, or if you have a way to live real skinny, then you can make more of it,\u201d Wright said. \u201cSo I am living skinny \u2014 and making more art.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Depressed About the Future of Democracy? Study History ", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe liberal project has faced far greater challenges before. Mr. Eisen is the chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.On my first day as United States ambassador in Prague in 2011, I found, branded beneath the surface of an antique table in my official residence, a small black swastika. It was one of many swastikas hidden throughout the palace, relics of the days when it was occupied by the Nazis.My reaction was not one of horror or dismay, but of triumph. The swastikas were not only a reminder of the evil they represented \u2014 they were also a reminder of the Allies\u2019 destruction of that bestial regime.I\u2019ve been thinking of those swastikas lately, as I contemplate what to make of the surging illiberal tide on both sides of the Atlantic. Some see today\u2019s threats to the liberal order and feel despair. It\u2019s not just the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin axis, but also their equivalents in Hungary, Turkey, Poland, Italy, Austria and elsewhere. But I am hopeful. I believe that democracy will beat back the illiberal wave, and that President Trump will be one of the first to go. My faith is based on the lessons of history. The liberal project has faced down much worse: the First World War, the Depression, World War II, the Cold War. And democracy overcame them all.But if you\u2019ve studied the power of democracy to topple those far more formidable than Mr. Trump, it will come as no surprise that the pushback has been ferocious. That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump\u2019s fall is inevitable \u2014 nor that of his equivalents in Europe. There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be. In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich. We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued. The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy\u2019s inexorable march is accelerated or delayed. Americans face several of these inflection points now. And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague. My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home. She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika.With that as my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?Advertisement"}

That is, don\u2019t just treat those who are sick; find and test their household members, neighbors, classmates and colleagues \u2014 and then treat the ones who test positive.

{"Headline": "How the Far Right Conquered Sweden", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA bastion of social democracy, the country refused to deal with the realities of mass immigration. Mr. Bittner is a political editor of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit.STOCKHOLM \u2014 To understand why Sweden, a bastion of social democracy, might end up with a far-right party in government after national elections on Sunday, you need to take a walk with Ahmed Abdirahman. An American-educated Somali immigrant who works as a policy analyst at the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Abdirahman grew up and now lives in the suburb of Rinkeby-Tensta, where some 90 percent of residents have a foreign background, roughly 80 percent live on welfare or earn low incomes and 42 percent are under age 25. It is a violent place: Sixteen people were killed there in 2016, mostly in drug-related conflicts, an unheard-of number in this typically peaceful country. As we walk along one of its main streets at 7 p.m., shopkeepers pull down the metal shutters in front of their windows, while young masked men on scooters start speeding through the streets. A police helicopter hovers overhead.The segregation and violence of Rinkeby-Tensta, and the likelihood that the far-right, anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats party will win the most votes in this weekend\u2019s national elections, are both the result of the country\u2019s long-running unwillingness to deal with the realities of its immigration crisis.For decades, Sweden, once a racially and culturally homogeneous country with an expansive social welfare system, insisted that it could absorb large numbers of non-European migrants without considering how those migrants should be integrated into Swedish society. As they did in cities across Western Europe, migrants tended to cluster in low-income neighborhoods; facing poor job prospects and rampant employment discrimination, they naturally turned inward. More young women have started wearing the hijab recently, Mr. Abdirahman tells me, and more young men \u201cinternalize the otherness\u201d \u2014 rejected by their new society, they embrace the stereotypes imposed upon them. This can lead to a point where they reject gay rights or liberalism as \u201cwhite, Western ideas,\u201d and even attack firefighters because they represent the state.As we walk around, Mr. Abdirahman, who is single and childless, confesses: \u201cWhen I came here in 1998, to me this place was paradise. Today, I wouldn\u2019t want my children to grow up here.\u201dMr. Abdirahman says he was lucky: His mother encouraged him to contribute to society and get a good education. He earned a degree in international studies in New York, then worked in Geneva and with the United States Embassy here before going to work with the chamber of commerce. Not all immigrants get the same push at home, he says; some parents discouraged their youngsters from going to the city center to mix. Sweden, he is afraid, has entered a vicious circle of immigration, segregation and growing mutual hostility.The situation grew worse with the latest mass influx of refugees, in 2015, after which a number of suburbs became almost exclusively migrant. Considered \u201cno go\u201d areas by some Swedes, these neighborhoods are known to outsiders only from horrific headlines. What people don\u2019t get to see, Mr. Abdirahman worries, is the bus driver or the cleaning lady working themselves ragged to get their children into a university. None of this is new, and yet the government, dominated by the traditionally strong Social Democrats and the centrist Moderate Party, did far too little. That left an opening for the Sweden Democrats, until recently a group relegated to the racist fringe of Swedish politics. In the past few years, the party has recast itself; just like the populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland party in Germany and the Five Star Movement in Italy, it has repositioned itself as anti-establishment and anti-immigrant. The Sweden Democrats accuses all other political actors and the media of \u201cdestroying\u201d Sweden, calls for a suspension of the right to asylum and promotes an exit of Sweden from the European Union. The party has clocked up to 20 percent in the latest polls, enough to make a coalition government between the Social Democrats and the Moderate Party unlikely \u2014 and raising the chances that one of those parties will have to enter into a government with the Sweden Democrats. \u201cIf the major parties had been able to read the majority\u2019s concerns, things would have been different,\u201d Mr. Abdirahman says. Similar stories have played out across Western Europe, from the Netherlands to Austria. But Sweden always imagined itself as something different, a society bound by its unique brand of togetherness. But that self-satisfaction justified a myopic approach to the very complex problem of how to integrate vast numbers of foreigners. If you believe in giving everyone a state-of-the-art apartment, social welfare and child benefits, then it\u2019s unlikely you will tackle the hurdles of the highly regulated Swedish labor market.The anti-establishment Sweden Democrats profit from the fact that they were often the first to point to the downsides of immigration. Yet as much as they despise wishful thinking, they replace it with simplistic thinking. No matter what problems there might be in Sweden \u2014 housing shortages, school closings, an overburdened health care system \u2014 in the view of the Sweden Democrats, it is always one group\u2019s fault: migrants.Even if the Sweden Democrats win big on Sunday, the election might be a force for good. The Moderate Party, which is likely to take second place, might split over the question of whether to rule with them. And the Social Democrats, already under pressure to move to the left, might likewise fall apart. Sweden\u2019s party landscape, in other words, might be blown to pieces.If the country is lucky, some parts from this explosion will bind together as a new force \u2014 one that takes seriously the need for realism on immigration and integration, without falling for the siren song of right-wing populism.Jochen Bittner is a political editor of the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter Bars Alex Jones and Infowars, Citing Harassing Messages", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, though, Twitter said it would permanently suspend Mr. Jones\u2019s account, as well as the account for Infowars. The social media company said Mr. Jones had posted messages within the previous 24 hours that violated its policies, which prohibit direct threats of violence and some forms of hate speech but allow deception or misinformation.\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,\u201d Mr. Dorsey tweeted in August.New followers are also crucial to Mr. Jones\u2019s business hawking nutritional supplements and survival gear, which help fund his Infowars operation. Without access to mainstream social-media sites, he will increasingly be speaking to his established audience that already goes directly to Infowars.com for his shows.Infowars did not respond to a request for comment. But Mr. Jones quickly found a way to make his anger about Twitter\u2019s decision known \u2014 on Twitter.Broadcasting on Thursday through the Periscope account of @WarRoomShow \u2014 which is the name of an online video show hosted by an Infowars colleague \u2014 Mr. Jones said: \u201cThey\u2019re scared of us. They\u2019re scared of the populist movement.\u201dHe added, \u201cThey know their bans of not just me but millions of other people have angered folks, so they\u2019re moving aggressively.\u201dPeriscope is Twitter\u2019s live-streaming video app. While Twitter\u2019s permanent ban affects the Periscope accounts for Infowars and Mr. Jones, the company temporarily suspended @WarRoomShow after Mr. Jones appeared on its broadcast. In a tweet, the company said it would take action \u201cif other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent\u201d the ban of Mr. Jones and Infowars.\u201cThey are outright banning people, and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech,\u201d he said.The video of Mr. Jones\u2019s harassing behavior toward Mr. Darcy was among the material that Twitter considered before deciding on the bans, according to a person briefed on the situation, who was not authorized to speak publicly.In his Periscope broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Jones defended his behavior toward Mr. Darcy, saying the CNN reporter is a public figure and had bullied tech companies into barring Mr. Jones. He suggested, without evidence, that Twitter had barred him to protect CNN and Mr. Darcy because the news organization was part of a government conspiracy.\u201cCNN is part of this C.I.A. stay-behind network that I brought up, that Obama set up, that we\u2019re telling the president about,\u201d Mr. Jones said.Mr. Darcy referred requests for comment to a CNN spokeswoman, who declined to comment.Twitter said it had followed routine procedures in permanently suspending the accounts of Mr. Jones and Infowars. The company typically issues temporary suspensions, like the one Mr. Jones received last month, before enacting a ban.Mr. Jones is one of the most prominent alt-right figures to be barred from Twitter. In 2016, the company barred Milo Yiannopoulos, a former editor of Breitbart, for his involvement in an online harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Another former Breitbart writer, Chuck Johnson, was suspended for threats toward the civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson. Twitter also bars hate groups like the American Nazi Party and Golden Dawn, an ultranationalist organization based in Greece.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Germans Seek News, YouTube Delivers Far-Right Tirades", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterThe man whose killing had set off the riots, they said, had died while trying to stop asylum seekers from molesting a local woman. And it wasn\u2019t just one local man who had been killed, but two. Could he comment?These sorts of accusations suddenly seemed to be everywhere. But none were true. They had come, Mr. Uhle and others suspected, from social media \u2014 particularly YouTube.The video, posted by an obscure fringe group, was rambling, and it appeared to be cheaply produced. Yet it had nearly half a million views \u2014 far more than any news video on the riots. How was that possible?Mr. Serrato scraped YouTube databases for information on every Chemnitz-related video published this year. He found that the platform\u2019s recommendation system consistently directed people toward extremist videos on the riots \u2014 then on to far-right videos on other subjects.Users searching for news on Chemnitz would be sent down a rabbit hole of misinformation and hate. And as interest in Chemnitz grew, it appears, YouTube funneled many Germans to extremist pages, whose view counts skyrocketed.Activists say this may have contributed to a flood of misinformation, helping extremists shape public perceptions even after they had been run off Chemnitz\u2019s streets.\u201cThis was new,\u201d Mr. Uhle said. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened to me before that mainstream media, big German newspapers and television channels, ask me about false news and propaganda that had clearly become so pervasive that people just bought it.\u201dResearchers who study YouTube say the episode, far from being isolated, reflects the platform\u2019s tendency to push everyday users toward politically extreme content \u2014 and, often, to keep them there.A YouTube spokeswoman declined to comment on the accusations, saying the recommendation system intended to \u201cgive people video suggestions that leave them satisfied.\u201d She said the company planned to work with news publishers to help \u201cbuild a better news experience on YouTube.\u201dThough YouTube has typically drawn less scrutiny than other social networks, that may be changing. Its parent company, Google, faced criticism from American lawmakers this week for declining to send its chief executive to congressional hearings attended by chief executives from Twitter and Facebook.YouTube\u2019s recommendation system is the core of its business strategy: Getting people to click on one more video means serving them more ads. The algorithm is sophisticated, constantly learning what keep users engaged. And it is powerful. A high ranking from the algorithm can mean huge audiences for a video.Mr. Serrato wondered if that explained how his family member had discovered the conspiracy video. He had read studies about users who blindly followed the recommendation system; inevitably, they seemed to end up watching long series of far-left or far-right videos.Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent social media researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has written that these findings suggest that YouTube could become \u201cone of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\u201dBut, as Ms. Tufekci and other researchers stress, such experiments are anecdotal.Using YouTube\u2019s public developer interface, Mr. Serrato plugged in a dozen recent videos related to Chemnitz. For each, he scraped YouTube\u2019s recommendations for what to watch next. Then he did the same for those videos, and so on. Eventually, he identified a network of about 650 videos, nearly all from this year.The results, he said, were disturbing. The network showed a tight cluster of videos that Mr. Serrato identified as predominantly conspiracy theorist or far right.This was the first sign that YouTube\u2019s algorithm systemically directs users toward extremist content. A more neutral algorithm would most likely produce a few distinct clusters of videos \u2014 one of mainstream news coverage, another of conspiracy theories, another of extremist groups. Those who began in one cluster would tend to stay there.Instead, the YouTube recommendations bunched them all together, sending users through a vast, closed system composed heavily of misinformation and hate.Viewers who come to YouTube for down-the-middle news may quickly find themselves in a world of extremists, Mr. Serrato said.\u201cThat\u2019s what I found bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are they so close together, unless the aim is to trigger a reaction?\u201d Content that engages viewers\u2019 emotions or curiosity, he suspected, would hook them in.And it wasn\u2019t just that the platform directed people to unreliable videos about the subject they had sought out \u2014 in this case, Chemnitz.Many of the videos in Mr. Serrato\u2019s analysis were unrelated to Chemnitz. Some offered positive portrayals of white nationalism in general or of Alternative for Germany, a far-right political party. Others went further astray, detailing fringe conspiracies; one argues that President Trump is a pawn of the Rothschild banking family.Why would YouTube surface videos like these in a search for news stories?How many steps are there on YouTube\u2019s algorithm from news story to fever swamp? \u201cOnly two,\u201d Mr. Serrato said. \u201cBy the second, you\u2019re quite knee-deep in the alt-right.\u201dPerhaps most striking is what was absent. The algorithm rarely led back to mainstream news coverage, or to liberal or centrist videos on Chemnitz or any other topic. Once on the fringes, the algorithm tended to stay there, as if that had been the destination all along.Activists and residents in Chemnitz say far-right conspiracy theories seemed unusually common in the days before and after the demonstration.Mr. Flesch, who has 20,000 subscribers, operates in a political bubble. Yet his claims had filtered into the mainstream enough that journalists asked Mr. Uhle, the Chemnitz official, about them. How?And misinformation can travel in other ways. Some German officials said this week that a widely circulated video, appearing to show a far-right activist chasing a dark-skinned person during Chemnitz\u2019s riots, may have been faked.Thomas Hoffmann, who helps run a local refugee organization, was on a train from Hamburg when the riots broke out. So he searched YouTube for \u201cChemnitz\u201d and the date, hoping to follow the events.Instead, the platform returned obvious forgeries. One video of dark-skinned residents being attacked was edited to make them look like the aggressors. Others were interspersed with footage from previous rallies, to make this one look more peaceful than it was.\u201cIt was incredible how much blatantly doctored material there was,\u201d Mr. Hoffmann said. \u201cWhen you click on one video, whether you like it or not, another one is proposed that features content from far-right conspiracy theories.\u201dYouTube has been more cooperative with the German authorities about removing hate speech than other social media companies, said Flemming Ipsen, who tracks political extremism at Jugendschutz.net, a government-linked internet monitor.But some researchers consider YouTube to be unusually permissive about content that it does not consider overt hate speech, and its algorithm unusually aggressive in pushing users toward political fringes. YouTube also designates some content as borderline, neither blocking nor promoting it.YouTube says it does not code videos by political content, but rather by viewer interest. Critics say that leads the platform to surface fringe material that reliably wins more clicks.Mr. Serrato said that even while researching videos he found abhorrent, he was unable to resist.\u201cAs soon as I was on one of the videos, I thought, O.K., now I\u2019m going to watch the next one,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s YouTube\u2019s goal. I stay engaged, ads play. And it works.\u201dGuillaume Chaslot, a former engineer at YouTube\u2019s owner, Google, said that during and after high-profile political events like the demonstration in Chemnitz, extremism and misinformation often spike on the platform. But this reflects deeper tendencies in YouTube\u2019s algorithm, he said.\u201cThe example I like to cite is the flat-earth theory, because it\u2019s apolitical,\u201d Mr. Chaslot said. Videos claiming the earth is flat, he said, are \u201cstill going viral, still getting highly recommended by the YouTube algorithm, because it gets watch time.\u201dMr. Chaslot worked on YouTube\u2019s algorithm until 2013, when he was fired. Google has said he was fired for poor performance, Mr. Chaslot has cited disagreements over the company\u2019s direction.\u201cYouTube doesn\u2019t give you a straight representation of the world,\u201d Mr. Chaslot said. \u201cIt looks like reality, but it deforms reality, because it is biased toward watch time.\u201dEven in Germany, which has some of the toughest social media restrictions of any democracy, officials say they have little power to regulate the vast majority of social media content.\u201cLies, propaganda and manipulation are harmful for society, but on their own are not illegal \u2014 and so our hands are often tied,\u201d said Mr. Ipsen, of the government-linked internet monitor.German officials have urged social media companies to make their algorithms more transparent. American lawmakers have done the same, citing research linking social media to polarization, foreign meddling and hate speech.But the companies are refusing.\u201cThe algorithm is central to their business model,\u201d Mr. Ipsen said. \u201cAll we can do is remind them of their social responsibility.\u201dChristopher F.

The advertising group took up Bahnhof\u2019s post after it received 15 complaints contending that the image was objectifying and bore little relation to what was being promoted.The judgment reflects changing mores across Europe, as well as a shift for the advertising industry, said Cathrine Jansson-Boyd, a consumer psychologist at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, England.\u201cWe have seen across Europe, in terms of consumer advertising, that these messages are not OK,\u201d Dr. Jansson-Boyd said. \u201cWe\u2019re more aware what is correct and what isn\u2019t. The idea that you can swap a woman just like a job isn\u2019t acceptable.\u201dBut Bahnhof is unrepentant.Jon Karlung, the chief executive, maintained that the decision \u2014 which carries no punishment or fine \u2014 was an overreaction. He pointed out that the meme had been shared with no sexist intent by the head of Bahnhof\u2019s communications division, who happens to be a woman.\u201cWe will fight fiercely to use memes in any way we feel,\u201d Mr. Karlung said. \u201cWe will not be subject to censorship in any sense.\u201d\u201cPeople will be annoyed by anything,\u201d he added.Still, the decision may make other companies consider more carefully how much benefit they get from using these images, according to Anja Lambrecht, a professor at London Business School who focuses on digital marketing.\u201cWe actually know from research that ads perceived as outrageous get more attention, but are not necessarily more persuasive,\u201d Dr. Lambrecht explained.Mr. Karlung said that was something that he had weighed: \u201cThis ad now has probably been the most published Swedish job ad ever. That was not our plan, and now we have got a lot of attention.\u201d\u201cIt can be good, it can be bad,\u201d he added.The ombudsman depends on self-regulation within the industry and said the ruling was intended to serve as a guide to other businesses.Bahnhof noted in its statement, \u201cIf we are to be punished, it\u2019s because of using an old and tired meme.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the Bahnhof chief executive.

His marriage was also falling apart. (He and his wife eventually divorced.) He decided to volunteer at a homeless shelter in Northwest Washington. A Vietnam veteran who was staying there encouraged him to go to church, and Volz started attending services, trying different congregations. After more than a year, he was hired as a case manager at the shelter, and then as its director. \u201cI loved the whole second-chance culture,\u201d he said. \u201cThe accountability, the \u2018We\u2019re in this together.\u2019\u2009\u201dIn 2008, Volz agreed to spend a few months fixing up a condominium in Fort Myers, Fla., that his parents inherited, so the family could sell it. He didn\u2019t know anyone in town. He met a woman, fell in love and decided to stay in Fort Myers, cleaning pools and restaurants at night. He and his girlfriend married and joined a nondenominational church, where Volz ended up taking a job as outreach director. He went on to run a recovery center and to lead the county homeless coalition.In 2015, Volz happened on a meeting at Florida Gulf Coast University, where a small group of students and community activists were listening to an African-American law-school graduate named Desmond Meade. He was talking about his yearslong crusade to restore voting rights to people who had committed felonies, as he had. The issue affected Volz, who knew he was barred from voting, as is automatically the case in Florida for anyone with a felony conviction. Meade was president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, an organization founded by the Florida A.C.L.U. for former felons, or, as he and others prefer to call themselves, \u201creturning citizens.\u201d Meade was in the midst of trying to collect the 766,200 signatures required to place an initiative on the ballot to amend Florida\u2019s Constitution, which denies former felons the right to vote. Volz stayed after the meeting to talk to Meade. \u201cWe chatted for a long time, and by the end, I wanted to help,\u201d he said.Volz, who is 47, has a reddish-brown beard and still roots for the Ohio State Buckeyes. He said he was nervous about taking the job and especially about talking to me when we met in June at a coffee shop near his home in Fort Myers. Several years ago, he participated in a documentary about Abramoff and self-published a memoir, and the media mostly mocked him as a man desperate to eat again in Washington steakhouses. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get back in the game,\u201d he said of returning to politics. At the same time, he remains an informed Republican \u2014 he wasn\u2019t a Trump supporter, but he was precise and analytical when talking about Trump\u2019s appeal \u2014 and he said he found it satisfying, if surreal, to put what he learned in Washington at the service of the second-chances movement.To its supporters, Amendment 4 represents a potential civil rights triumph: It could enfranchise more people at once than any single initiative since women\u2019s suffrage. Amendment 4 could also change the Florida electorate. White people represent a majority of the state\u2019s former felons. At the same time, black people are disproportionately affected by the current ban. More than one in five black voters can\u2019t vote in Florida, compared with about one in 10 voters in the state\u2019s general population (and one in 40 nationwide). Florida is one of the country\u2019s truly purple states, with a recent history of squeaker elections for governor, Congress and other offices. In three of the last five presidential contests, Florida went to a candidate who won the state by a margin of 1.2 percent or less. This year, polls show tossup races for governor (the Republican Ron DeSantis running against the Democrat Andrew Gillum) and senator (the Republican Rick Scott against the Democrat Bill Nelson). Five of the state\u2019s congressional seats are also in play.I asked Volz if he thought he might be hurting the Republican Party if Amendment 4 had a shot at turning Florida from purple to blue. He said he didn\u2019t think it would happen. But if it did, I asked, would its passage undermine his conservative policy goals? \u201cYou have to cross a line,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you believe that it\u2019s better that more people vote, or not? I crossed that line long ago.\u201d[Read about how there\u2019s a good chance we simply won\u2019t know if someone has altered the digital votes in the next election.] Weeks after the case was filed, Florida brought the contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore to a halt with one of the most disputed vote counts in the country\u2019s history. After Bush was declared the winner by 537 votes, it came to light that before the election, just over 12,000 people had been wrongly eliminated from the voting rolls, many of them because they were misidentified as former felons. Though African-Americans made up about 11 percent of registered voters in the state, they accounted for a reported 44 percent of the people who were purged. Given the strong support of black voters for Democrats in Florida, if they had remained on the rolls, the election might have been decided differently.In the last few years, other researchers have challenged Uggen and Manza\u2019s assumptions about partisan effect and turnout. \u201cRe-enfranchisement might not produce big electoral effects,\u201d Traci Burch, a political scientist at Northwestern University, told me. \u201cCohorts released many years ago\u201d \u2014 people she thinks are more likely to support Republicans \u2014 \u201cmight be more likely to vote than people who finished their sentences more recently.\u201dNorris Henderson was convicted of murder in 1977 and spent 27 years in prison before being released on probation. Since then, he has worked for voting rights in Louisiana, his home state, registering former felons, who can vote when their sentences have been completed. \u201cWhen folks get to the box for picking a party, most of them choose to be independent,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cBecause in our state, like a lot of places, felon disenfranchisement was bipartisan. Both y\u2019all parties done this. Folks assume this is a population that\u2019s indebted to Democrats. That\u2019s far from the truth.\u201d Uggen, who has interviewed former felons in Oregon, has reached a similar conclusion. But he still thinks that they could tip the balance toward Democrats in a closely contested election in Florida.At 51, Meade has a clean-shaven head and a short salt-and-pepper beard. He was born in St. Croix and moved to Miami with his parents when he was 5. His mother worked as a waitress, and his father was a mechanic. His family was stable and neither well off nor poor, he said, and he remembers his upbringing as \u201ctypical\u201d \u2014 he played football and wrestled, but not seriously, and after graduating from high school in 1985, he went into the Army. He worked on helicopters as a mechanic, hoping to become a pilot. But Meade\u2019s eyesight wasn\u2019t sharp enough, and in his early 20s, he found his ambitions stymied. Around that time, while he was stationed on a military base in Hawaii, a friend introduced him to cocaine.Meade soon developed a drug habit and started stealing to support it. After being caught stealing liquor and electronics on the base, he was dishonorably discharged and given a three-year sentence in a military brig, which he served in Kansas. After his release in 1993, Meade went back to Florida and started working as a celebrity body guard, a job that led him back to cocaine. He was devastated by the death of his mother in 1996, followed by a bank foreclosure on the home he grew up in. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really dove deeper into drugs,\u201d he said. He was convicted of aggravated battery, a felony, after a fight with his brother and his brother\u2019s friend.Meade went to jail for felony cocaine possession multiple times over the next handful of years. In 2001, he was convicted of possession of a firearm as a felon. He was sentenced to 15 years but got out in 2004 when his conviction was reversed on appeal because of a problem with the jury selection. Meade returned to cocaine and to living on the streets.Speaking at the benefit in Pensacola, Meade began his story here, at his lowest point. \u201cIn August of 2005, I found myself standing in front of railroad tracks in South Florida,\u201d he told his audience. \u201cAs I stood there that day, I was a broken man.\u201d Meade paused. \u201cBut there was a power greater than me that did not allow that train to come that day,\u201d he said. \u201cI crossed those tracks, and I walked a couple blocks further, and I checked myself into drug treatment.\u201dMeade got clean over the course of the four-month program and found a spot at a homeless shelter. While living there, he enrolled at Miami-Dade College, paying with Pell grants and student loans. He tried to take full advantage of the school, visiting his professors during their office hours, asking them to read and comment on his papers and rewriting them. He graduated summa cum laude in 2010. In 2011, he enrolled in law school at Florida International University, graduating three years later. But the Florida Bar won\u2019t allow him to sit for the bar exam until the state restores his rights.Meade first applied for clemency to be able to vote in 2006, before Charlie Crist streamlined the clemency process. In 2011, he was told he had to wait five more years, and he still can\u2019t vote. Meade became the unpaid head of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. At first, the project often felt like a one-man operation. He put 50,000 miles a year on his car to travel the state and give talks at churches, universities, community events, picnics \u2014 anywhere he could gather an audience to hear his message. Struggling to raise money, he spent part of his student loans on fruitless fund-raising trips to New York and Washington. In 2012, he started working for the Live Free Campaign, which addresses gun violence and mass incarceration, while continuing to do the voting rights work. He married a woman that year whom he met doing voting outreach; they\u2019re raising her five children, who are between the ages of 12 and 21. Meade says that when he started the drive for Amendment 4 in 2015, his mother-in-law sorted the petitions, and his children counted the names.In fall 2017, several months after the Florida Supreme Court unanimously approved the proposed language of the ballot initiative for clarity, the Florida A.C.L.U. (whose director, Howard Simon, has been working on voting rights since he marched in Selma in 1965) put $1.6 million into hiring people to help collect and sort signatures, eventually contributing a total of $5 million to support the initiative. Other major donors came on board, beginning with the Open Philanthropy Action Fund, based in California and started by a group including the Facebook founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife, Cari Tuna. Meade began drawing a paycheck from the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition for the first time last year.Before his speech in Pensacola, Meade spent time with a small group of the local leaders of Movement for Change. One of them wondered if Hillary Clinton would have won Florida if turnout had been higher in black communities like the one in Pensacola. Meade offered a general theory about turnout. One reason people who can vote don\u2019t do so, whether they realize it or not, is that they\u2019re closely related to someone who can\u2019t vote, he proposed. \u201cBack in the day, when Dad went to vote, he took the whole family with him, and voting was part of the conversation at the dinner table.\u201d But, Meade continued, \u201cwhen you strip Mama and Daddy of the right to vote, you kill that conversation. So what we think is happening now is, a person like me who can\u2019t vote, you come to me talking about going out to vote, it\u2019s like you slapping me in my face, reminding me I\u2019m not part of society. So to mask that pain, \u2019cause I don\u2019t want to tell you I\u2019m a felon, I\u2019m going to say, \u2018Man, your vote don\u2019t count.\u2019\u2009\u201d In other words, former felons may discourage turnout among those around them by covering their hurt with indifference.The crowd erupted in applause. Meade had a seven-hour drive back to Orlando, but he stayed until all the people lined up to shake his hand and take a photo with him were satisfied. When he returned to his home in a tidy gated community near Universal Studios, the dawn was breaking.The majority-white low-income neighborhood, which voted for Trump in 2016, sits between two branches of the interstate and feels rural, with few sidewalks, lots of trees and the occasional pickup truck parked on the lawn. The group of canvassers approached a gray-haired woman as she came out of her ranch house, where an American flag hung from the front porch, to check the mailbox at the end of her driveway. One canvasser, Tammie Schafer, asked the woman if she remembered signing the Amendment 4 petition, explaining that it would restore the vote to former felons if it passed. The woman said that her next-door neighbor hadn\u2019t been able to vote for the last 30 years. \u201cFor something she did when she was 19 years old. That makes no sense. She did her time. She made a mistake. Move on. Give them a chance to vote!\u201dSchafer, who is petite and has short blond-streaked hair, started volunteering for the campaign after she saw a Facebook post by Volz, whom she knew through homeless-outreach work. Now 40, she was convicted 15 years ago of possession of Xanax without a prescription, a felony. In 2006, a couple of months after she gave birth to her daughter, she was sent to jail for violating her probation by testing positive for marijuana, which she says she used to relieve back pain and anxiety. She had to leave her newborn baby with her mother. \u201cThree months in, my mother sent me a picture of her, and I didn\u2019t recognize her,\u201d she said. \u201cI was heartbroken.\u201d After that, she never went back to jail.Schafer rarely voted before her conviction. But two years ago, she got interested in an initiative on the Florida ballot to expand access to medical marijuana. \u201cIf I could have voted for my medicine, that would have been tremendous for me,\u201d she said. The initiative passed, and she got permission to use the marijuana that had landed her in jail.At one house in Palmona Park, Schafer and her group knocked on a door with a sticker that read \u201cMy Dog Is a Republican.\u201d The older man who answered wore an undershirt, shorts and knee-high compression stockings. Once he understood the canvassers\u2019 pitch, he put up a hand to stop them from talking. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go to jail, you lose all your rights. You kill someone, you don\u2019t ever get them back.\u201dSchafer told him that Amendment 4 wouldn\u2019t give the vote to people convicted of murder or sex offenses. \u201cThis is for people like me,\u201d she said, looking the man in the eye. \u201cI never did anything violent. I just want a second chance.\u201d The man shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll work up to the murderers next. You\u2019ll see.\u201d He turned to go inside but first aimed one more retort at Schafer: \u201cYou don\u2019t need second chances.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve turned a corner,\u201d says Jon Liss, who has worked on the issue for more than a decade as co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, a civic-engagement organization. He wonders if the opioid epidemic has affected the way people think about the issue. \u201cWe have large numbers of white working people incarcerated now in Virginia. If you\u2019re a white rural legislator, a lot of your constituents can\u2019t vote.\u201dOne researcher has data, not yet published, that could help explain it. Victoria Shineman, a political scientist at the University of Pittsburgh, did a study with 150 former felons in Ohio and Virginia. Some of them received help getting back their voting rights and registering to vote, and afterward, that group was more likely to say they trusted the government and the justice system. \u201cThe results suggest that reversing disenfranchisement causes citizens to increase their pro-democratic attitudes and behaviors \u2014 all of which are predictors of reduced recidivism,\u201d Shineman wrote.Meade and Volz would like the expansion of the franchise to be a key pillar of the platform of both parties. That\u2019s an idealistic notion, at odds with current Republican strategy and the intensely polarized national landscape. If Amendment 4 passes, however, it will be possible to argue that democracy for democracy\u2019s sake is good politics.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the affiliation of Neil Volz. He is the political director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, not the Amendment 4 campaign.An earlier version of this article included an erroneous description of Amendment 4, a Florida referendum to restore former felons\u2019 voting rights. If the amendment becomes law, it is not the case that it would allow former felons to serve on juries and run for public office.Advertisement"}

So they decided to celebrate early, putting up a tree and decorations, and their Ohio neighborhood followed suit.\u201cIn his mind it is just Christmas,\u201d said McKenzie Allen, 21, Brody\u2019s sister. \u201cHe woke up one day and the Christmas tree was out. He doesn\u2019t know it isn\u2019t really Christmas. He is just enjoying it.\u201dBrody\u2019s health has deteriorated so that he no longer has the energy of a toddler or the use of his left arm and left leg. He likes to be outside, so he often sits in a red Radio Flyer wagon, a blanket thrown over him and a hoodie pulled over his head, while his siblings pull him around their neighborhood in Colerain Township, a suburb of Cincinnati.There he can see an inflatable Minnie and Mickey Mouse, a snowman, Santa Claus and a Christmas tree on the yard of Barbara Elliott, a neighbor whose home is one of six in the Allens\u2019 cul-de-sac that has been decorated for Brody.\u201cI offered Ms. Allen some pull-ups that I had for my grandson who is not potty trained, and she said they weren\u2019t going to bother with potty training Brody, because he had cancer,\u201d Ms. Elliott, 74, said, describing what she had heard from Brody\u2019s mother.\u201cIt broke our heart,\u201d Ms. Elliott added, her voice cracking. \u201cSo I said to my husband, \u2018We got stuff, let\u2019s decorate!\u2019\u201dBrody\u2019s family first learned he was sick after he complained in May about being dizzy; a doctor said it was probably an ear infection. The family was sent to Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center for further tests, which revealed that Brody had four embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes.\u201cOne on his lower spine, one intertwined with his brain stem and two behind his pons,\u201d Ms. Allen, his sister, said.\u201cIt is extremely rare,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t respond to treatment very well.\u201dHis father, Todd Allen, 45, said it was \u201ca very aggressive brain tumor that he had from birth and we had no idea.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt was in him all along, just a part of who he is.\u201dThe hospital, which has helped pay medical bills that Medicaid does not cover, gave Brody the most aggressive chemotherapy treatment it could.It was not effective. One of Brody\u2019s tumors grew by 30 percent and he developed a fifth tumor in his brain. Using radiation to treat the tumors was not an option because Brody was too small.\u201cIt would just end up hurting him,\u201d Mr. Allen said.There were no other options for Brody. So the family set out to keep him happy.\u201cThey tried to treat and it failed, but they gave us a family,\u201d Mr. Allen said. \u201cThose nurses and doctors loved on Brody like no one else. They are just part of our family.\u201d\u201cI was willing to buy the decorations from them, but so many were donated,\u201d Mr. Allen said.Ryan Simpson, 34, who said he is known as \u201cthe Christmas guy\u201d among friends, was tagged in the Facebook group.\u201cWhen I showed up, I really did not know what I was getting myself into,\u201d he said.Mr. Simpson appeared at the Allens\u2019 door with a plastic tote filled with lights and decorations, and helped the family decorate inside and out.\u201cWhen I showed up that day, Brody was outside in a red wagon and his sister was pulling him around,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. \u201cI handed him a little gingerbread house with gumdrops on it, and it kind of spoke to him.\u201dMr. Simpson went back to the house to add more decorations four days in a row. He also helped neighbors decorate their houses.\u201cMy next-door neighbor, who only speaks Spanish, took down all her fall stuff and put up snowflakes and poinsettias, and did garland on her fence and lights,\u201d Ms. Elliott said.\u201cWhen Brody saw it, he couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. \u201cHe has been very animated.\u201dPeople have also sent Brody gifts and snacks. He has a feeding tube, but he likes licking the sugar off sour straws and sipping blue Gatorade.\u201cWe got 25 Christmas cards yesterday,\u201d Ms. Allen said.The community is now planning a Christmas parade for Brody.\u201cWe needed to get involved because he lives in our neighborhood,\u201d said Amanda Beckman, 34, who reached out to the Facebook group. \u201cWe just wanted to do something to make this really special for them, because they are going through a hard time.\u201dThe parade is scheduled for Sept. 23 and will feature Santa Claus in a fire truck, carolers and superheroes. Some people just want to drive their cars in the procession.\u201cEverybody wants to be a part of it,\u201d Ms. Beckman said.Brody has good days and bad days, but with these efforts, he has a lot of good moments.\u201cIt\u2019s emotional because I know this will be his last\u201d Christmas, said Brody\u2019s mother, Shilo Allen, 41.\u201cIt is really hard, but I love seeing the joy in his eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did it to make him happy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Violence at the Heart of Our Politics", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Congress before the Civil War, partisan disagreement often featured Bowie knives and pistols. Are we headed back toward that way of life?Ms. Freeman has spent her career as a historian studying American political violence.Mike Huckabee waxed historic this week while denouncing protesters who interrupted Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. \u201cClear the room or start caning them when they open their yaps!\u201d he tweeted, making a backhanded reference to the most famous caning in American history: the 1856 attack on Senator Charles Sumner. Outraged by one of Sumner\u2019s antislavery speeches, Preston Brooks of South Carolina brutally beat him to the ground in the Senate chamber a few days later, stopping only when his cane broke. Clearly, the United States has a long and storied history of polarizing crises. The 1960s was one such time, as were the late 1790s; in both cases, Americans of opposing politics turned on each other with violent outcomes. The 1850s were even more severe. The period\u2019s raging debate over slavery fractured political parties, paralyzed the national government and divided the nation. In time, this struggle tore the nation apart.In many ways, the crisis of the 1850s played out on the floor of Congress, the focus of national politics for much of the 19th century. A forum for national debate with the power to decide the fate of slavery, it became a bullpen for sectional combat, with armed clusters of Northerners and Southerners defending their interests with fists and weapons as well as legislation.Some of the furor wasn\u2019t slavery related; antebellum America was inherently violent, as was its politics, and Congress is a representative institution. The mighty oratory of the 1830s and \u201940s was accompanied by an undercurrent of brute force. Threats and fistfights were part of the political game, and congressmen sometimes put such violence to legislative purpose.Initially, most of the fighting centered on matters of personal honor, party loyalty or regional pride. Take, for example, the 1838 duel between Representatives Jonathan Cilley, a Democrat from Maine, and William Graves, a Whig from Kentucky. Although their duel had dire consequences, it was sparked by little more than political name-calling in the House. When Henry Wise, a Virginia Whig and a notorious bully, suggested that an unnamed Democratic congressman was corrupt, Cilley leaped to the defense of his party. Wise then did what bullies were wont to do: He tried to silence his opponent by taunting him with a duel challenge and then declaring him too cowardly to fight. Like many a Northerner, Cilley faced a difficult choice. Should he ignore Wise\u2019s taunts and risk dishonoring himself and his constituents by proxy? Or should he risk fighting a duel and be ostracized by his constituents for engaging in a barbaric Southern practice?The growing immediacy of the problem of slavery made matters worse. Congressional brawling increasingly pitted North against South, fracturing national parties across sectional lines and rendering routine congressional violence far less tractable. Westward expansion set off a desperate debate over the slavery status of new states, and Southern congressmen defended their slave regime by attempting to silence antislavery advocates with threats and violence.Take, for example, Representative John Dawson, a Democrat from Louisiana. Dawson routinely wore both a Bowie knife and a pistol, and he wasn\u2019t shy about using them in the House, particularly when someone dared to attack slavery. In 1842, when Thomas Arnold, a Whig from Tennessee, defended John Quincy Adams\u2019s right to discuss antislavery petitions, Dawson strutted over to Arnold with his knife plainly visible and threatened to cut his throat \u201cfrom ear to ear.\u201d Dawson went even further three years later in what may well be the all-time greatest display of firepower on the floor. When the Ohio abolitionist Joshua Giddings gave an antislavery speech, Dawson, clearly agitated, positioned himself in front of Giddings, vowing to kill him, and cocking his pistol. Four armed Southern Democrats immediately joined him, which prompted four Whigs to position themselves around Giddings, several of them armed as well. After a few minutes, the pistoleers sat down. But the potential for bloodshed was very real.The press amplified the crisis. In their efforts to rouse public sentiment for or against the act, newspapers promoted conspiracy theories about sectional plots to seize control of the Union. Antislavery papers argued that an organized \u201cSlave Power\u201d was trying to spread slavery throughout the Union by stifling Northern opposition. Pro-slavery papers insisted that Northern aggressors were trying to isolate and destroy the slaveholding South. New technologies like the telegraph broadcast these accusations with ever-increasing speed and reach throughout the nation, and did just what editors and reporters hoped they would do: outrage the public and encourage them to fight for their rights and demand the same of their congressmen.The Republican Party was born of this furor. The arrival of a Northern antislavery party in Congress caused violence to spike. Dedicated to fighting the Slave Power, Republican congressmen did their duty, confronting Southerners as never before, and Southerners replied in kind. Sumner\u2019s caning was of a piece with this wave of violence. Slavery supporters saw his raging antislavery rhetoric as proof of Northern attempts to degrade and subjugate the South. Antislavery advocates, in turn, saw Brooks, Sumner\u2019s attacker, as part of a Slave Power plot to dominate the North. Joined with some recent assaults on Northern congressmen and the rising intensity of antislavery efforts, for Northerners and Southerners alike, the caning seemed to prove the existence of a sectional conspiracy to seize national control.One House brawl in 1858 shows such thinking in action. During an overnight debate about slavery in Kansas, Galusha Grow \u2014 a feisty Pennsylvania Republican \u2014 raised an objection while standing amid Southern Democrats. One of those Democrats \u2014 the equally feisty Laurence Keitt of South Carolina \u2014 immediately took offense, insisting that Grow object on his own side of the House. When Grow declared that it was a free hall and he could do as he liked, Keitt stalked over to Grow, mumbling \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that,\u201d and grabbed his throat in preparation to throw a punch. Grow responded by slugging Keitt hard enough to knock him flat.To onlookers in Congress and the country alike, the implications of the Grow-Keitt rumble were clear: North and South had gone to war in the House chamber. Congressmen on each side assumed that the other side was angry, overbearing and itching for a fight. This distrust was no back-of-the-mind matter of speculation. It was immediate. Both sides jumped into action in seconds. And the public shared these suspicions. By the late 1850s, Northerners and Southerners alike were urging their congressmen to fight \u2014 literally \u2014 for their rights. Some Northerners even gave guns to their congressmen, who were less likely to carry arms than their Southern colleagues. Distrustful of each other and of Congress\u2019s ability to contain their struggle, Americans were prepared for open combat in the Capitol.The destructive power of the press becomes even more marked when spread with new technologies. In the 1850s, the telegraph confronted Americans with a steady stream of virtually instant information: contradictory, confusing, overlapping and inaccurate, it scrambled and intensified the political climate. Today, social media is doing the same. At its heart, democracy is a continuing conversation between politicians and the public; it should come as no surprise that dramatic changes in the modes of conversation cause dramatic changes in democracies themselves.At the center of this conversation is the United States Congress, the only institution in which representatives from throughout the nation come together to hash out national policy. In the 1850s, a crisis over fundamental American values and institutions \u2014 the slavery crisis \u2014 eroded the process of debate and compromise that gives Congress its purpose and power. In 2018, a crisis over different fundamentals \u2014 immigration, the rule of law, the status and safety of women and people of color \u2014 is doing much the same. If Congress\u2019s checkered past teaches us anything on this score, it teaches this: A dysfunctional Congress can close off a vital arena for national dialogue, leaving us vulnerable in ways that we haven\u2019t yet begun to fathom.

{"Headline": "Giant Trap Is Deployed to Catch Plastic Littering the Pacific Ocean", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA multimillion-dollar floating boom designed to corral plastic debris littering the Pacific Ocean deployed from San Francisco Bay on Saturday as part of a larger high-stakes and ambitious undertaking.The patch, a gyre of trash between California and Hawaii, comprises an estimated 1.8 trillion pieces of scattered detritus, including at least 87,000 tons of plastic.Over the next several days, the boom will be towed to a site where it will undergo two weeks of testing. If everything goes as planned, the boom will then be brought to the garbage patch, nearly 1,400 miles offshore, where it is expected to arrive by mid-October, said Boyan Slat, 24, the Dutch inventor and entrepreneur who founded Ocean Cleanup.The boom has an impenetrable skirt that hangs nearly 10 feet below to catch smaller pieces of plastic. The nonprofit said marine life would be able to pass underneath.But the ocean can be unpredictable, and simulation models are no guarantee of future performance.Small fish, drawn to a new structure, can attract bigger fish, he added, creating an \u201centire ecological community.\u201dIt is unclear how well the boom would fare on the open ocean, where it faces high winds, corrosive salt water and other environmental challenges. And then there\u2019s the question of whether it is possible to clean half of the garbage patch in just five years.\u201cI think the big challenge here is not the long-term goal but the short-term goal,\u201d Mr. Leonard said on Saturday. \u201cCan it remove plastic at all?\u201d\u201cAnd to me this is where I think my largest anxiety lies at this point in time,\u201d he said of the system\u2019s ability to collect and retain plastic. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s something that we haven\u2019t really been able to test very well.\u201dBut on Saturday morning, Mr. Slat was decidedly optimistic.\u201cI\u2019ve definitely never been so confident about the chance of success as I am today,\u201d he said.Skeptics questioned whether this was the most economically efficient way to address the problem.\u201cI fully agree that this is not the full solution to plastic pollution,\u201d Mr. Slat said.While it\u2019s necessary to prevent more plastic from entering the ocean, what is there already isn\u2019t going to go away by itself, he added.\u201cWe have to clean it up at some point in time and, actually, I would say the sooner the better,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tricky Ads From a Vitamin Company That Talks Up Openness", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingThe online vitamin and supplement marketplace is fierce, star-studded and murky. The Kardashians endorse gummies they say promote hair health. Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop website pushes pills and liquids in the name of holistic wellness. Even the conspiracy website Infowars is partly funded through the sale of potions and powders.Yet a closer look at Ritual\u2019s marketing showed that the Los Angeles company, which has raised $16.5 million in funding, has not always helped customers separate facts from spin. The company has paid for articles on websites like Well & Good and PureWow, and then taken positive quotes from those articles in its ads on Facebook and Instagram. It has also used news coverage from CNN and The New York Times to suggest that the outlets endorsed benefits from its vitamins.\u201cPeople want to believe that there\u2019s some all-natural, healthy supplement that they can take that\u2019s going to make them feel and look better, and a lot of times much of it is based on hype or misleading marketing,\u201d said Bonnie Patten, the executive director of Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit organization.In an industry built on products that do not require reviews for safety or effectiveness from the Food and Drug Administration, companies can easily get away with making dubious claims.Another Ritual ad includes a quote plucked from a different sponsored Well & Good post, which links to the article under the excerpt: \u201cBottom line: I\u2019ll be signing up for that recurring subscription.\u201d This ad, like the other ad making use of a line from a Well & Good post paid for by the company, includes an article link.Ritual has also featured praise from the site PureWow: \u201cOne month was great. But improving my health over time is really the goal. And to do it with a vitamin that I\u2019m not skeptical about? All the better.\u201d That bit of testimony also comes from a post paid for by the company.Katerina Schneider, Ritual\u2019s chief executive and founder, said the company did not believe it was misleading to use those quotations in its ads, although they were taken from sponsored posts.\u201cIf it were a statement of more substance, about the product\u2019s efficacy or something mirroring a structure-function claim, we would treat it differently,\u201d Ms. Schneider said in an email.She added that the links included in the ads that quote from the sponsored Well & Good pieces are enough to give consumers an idea of Ritual\u2019s financial relationship with the site.It\u2019s a powerful marketing tactic, particularly among supplement companies, to refer to popular publications in ads to bolster credibility, Ms. Patten of Truth in Advertising said. \u201cThe key really in all this kind of marketing is transparency, so it has to be clear if the content is advertising,\u201d she said.(Ritual\u2019s ads have also cited unpaid enthusiasm from outlets like BuzzFeed.)Ms. Schneider defended the use of the blurb, saying the phrase was \u201cwell-constructed and illustrates our mission better than some of the copy we\u2019ve written ourselves.\u201dOther ads from the company have said, \u201cMeet the visionary vitamin making headlines in New York Times, CNN, and VOGUE for its clean label transparency and glow-worthy benefits.\u201d The articles about Ritual in those publications did not describe such benefits, but Ms. Schneider said that wasn\u2019t the implication.Sales of dietary supplements and multivitamins rose to $20.7 billion last year in the United States from $16.4 billion in 2012, according to Euromonitor International, a provider of market research. (That excludes single vitamins and tonics.) The firm forecasts sales of $24.1 billion in 2022. The booming industry has, in recent years, been bolstered by Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, where brands peddle promises to social media users based on whom they follow and what they read.Then there\u2019s the more sober, science-citing \u2014 but still Instagrammable \u2014 approach of Ritual and start-ups like Care/of, which customize daily vitamin packs for consumers based on a quiz.Ritual has also aimed to share more information than other multivitamin companies: Its site details ingredients and their origins and says the pills are vegan and free of gluten and genetically modified ingredients.\u201cThey can use all kinds of suggestive and deceptive wording to make you think you\u2019ll be healthier by taking their product,\u201d said Dr. David S. Seres, director of medical nutrition at Columbia University Medical Center.The interest in supplements, which have long been hyped by television doctors, has become increasingly disconnected from what people need for their long-term health, said Dr. Brent Bauer, the director of the Integrative Medicine and Health Research Program at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He said he talks to patients at length about diet, exercise and other elements of their lifestyle before considering supplements.\u201cI\u2019m not averse to the use of dietary supplements and use them in my practice routinely, but they\u2019re never the first answer,\u201d he said.Dr. Bauer said people should take them only to target specific deficiencies.\u201cAs soon as you say your product is good for everybody, it\u2019s hard for me to see the science,\u201d he said.Dr. Seres elaborated on that message: \u201cLots of fruits and vegetables, eating things that look as much like when they came out of the ground, or off the hoof or hook, as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cLess processed food.

{"Headline": "How Alliances Made Athens Great", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ancient Athenians manipulated their allies, spreading democracy and providing protection, always with their own interests first. Trump could learn something.Mr. Konstandaras is a columnist at the Greek newspaper Kathimerini. ATHENS \u2014 In his declared intention to \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d President Trump appears set on destroying the foundations of American greatness. The multinational organizations and agreements that established peace and stability, and encouraged economic growth for some seven decades, were designed principally by Americans. They organized the world pretty much the way that suited them, and they reaped the benefits of dominating it through a complex network of organizations and treaties. On a global scale, this post-World War II American hegemony echoed the way that ancient Athens, after leading a victorious alliance of Greek city-states against a Persian invasion, gradually shaped the alliance into an empire. The Athenians of the fifth century B.C.E. took charge of the Greek states\u2019 defense, controlled their diplomatic and trade relations, and intervened in their politics.An enigmatic figure from that time known only as the Old Oligarch, because of his blunt critique of democratic Athens, was very clear in his writing about what he did not like about the city\u2019s Constitution and its citizens\u2019 behavior. Unlike Mr. Trump, however, he understood that the Athenians had gained much by rigging the Greek world in their favor.\u201cI do not think well of their Constitution,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut since they have decided to have it so, I intend to point out how well they preserve it and how they accomplish those other things for which the rest of the Greeks criticize them. One must forgive everyone for looking after their own interests.\u201dIn democracy, the Old Oligarch declared, the worst citizens had an equal say and could even be elected to office, at the expense of the city\u2019s finest. Furthermore, as the economy boomed through the links of empire, some slaves and foreign residents had even become rich in trade and commerce. Slaves didn\u2019t know their place, the Oligarch complained. You could not even beat them in the street. They dressed the way their masters did, and it was impossible to tell them apart.The Athenians, he charged, bullied their allies, turning a defense agreement into an empire in whose center they sat, pulling all the strings. They drew tribute from their allies; they supported democrats against the best citizens to fit Athenian interests. \u201cFor like is well-disposed to like. Accordingly, the Athenians prefer those sympathetic to themselves,\u201d the Old Oligarch noted. With their powerful navy, the Athenians controlled their allies\u2019 dealings, from politics to trade. They made their partners use Athenian currency, weights and measures. They obliged the allies to bring their legal issues to Athenian courts, where litigants had to win the favor of Athenian citizens who sat in judgment of them. \u201cIn this way, the allies have become the slaves of the Athenian people,\u201d the Old Oligarch charged.Scholars are uncertain of the date of the \u201cOld Oligarch\u201d text (originally attributed mistakenly to Xenophon of Athens). It may have been written before 431 B.C.E., when war broke out between Athens and Sparta, and certainly before 404, when the victorious Spartans imposed an oligarchy on Athens, tore down its walls and dismantled its alliance. (Less than a year later, after brutal oligarchic rule and civil strife had made the city ungovernable, the Spartans accepted a return to democracy in Athens.)One year into the war with Sparta, in the prime of his city\u2019s democracy and power, Pericles, the great Athenian leader, also expressed a composite view of his state\u2019s policies: \u201cIn nobility of spirit, we stand in sharp contrast to most men; for it is not by receiving kindness, but by conferring it, that we acquire our friends,\u201d the historian Thucydides quoted him as saying at a funeral of war dead. But Pericles was no softhearted liberal in the modern sense. His pursuit was Athenian greatness \u2014 and domestic and foreign policy contributed to this. Before succumbing to a plague that struck Athens during the war, he tried to encourage his fellow citizens. \u201cIt will be remembered forever, how we of all Greeks held sway over the greatest number of Greeks, how in the greatest wars we held out against our foes whether united or single, and inhabited a city that was the richest in all things and the greatest,\u201d he declared.Both the grudging respect of a political opponent of democracy and the inspired rhetoric of its champion reveal that Athens had created a network of common interests among its citizens and with its allies, all of which it was able to manipulate to its own advantage. Allied tribute helped fund the glorious temples whose ruins still grace the Greek capital; allied money and ships contributed to Athens\u2019s naval might, which, in turn, helped the Athenians dominate their allies. In Thucydides\u2019s analysis, it was this rise in influence that provoked Sparta to reassert its authority as the Greeks\u2019 greatest power. After Pericles\u2019s death, arrogance toward other states and recklessness contributed to Athens\u2019s defeat.The Oligarch was given his catchy name a century ago by a prominent classicist, Gilbert Murray, at a time when the word was not synonymous with friends of Vladimir Putin or billionaires funding political campaigns. The name reflected the perennial tension in Athens and other city-states between the rule of the many and the rule of the few. Unlike those who today try to manipulate politics to their ends, the Old Oligarch could appreciate the effectiveness of what he did not like. He knew that the common people had to have economic benefits and a say in the running of the state, because the state depended on them. \u201cThe people generally are right to have more than the highborn and the wealthy, because it is the people who man the ships and impart strength to the city,\u201d he wrote.Today, as President Trump tries to roll back health care for a large part of the population, as he invests in domestic division and further economic inequality, as he undermines alliances and the international order, he seems blind to the value of what he does not like, indifferent to the consequences of his actions. Endowed with the immense powers of his office, he lacks the cynical Old Oligarch\u2019s understanding of politics. Unlike Pericles, he does not see that power can be enhanced through the projection of kindness.Nikos Konstandaras is a columnist at the Greek newspaper Kathimerini.Advertisement"}

Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Breitbart News described the 2016 video as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d because it showed Sergey Brin, the Google co-founder, telling everyone how he felt about the new leader of the free world.Spoiler: Not good.\u201cMyself, as an immigrant, as a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do, too,\u201d he said in his flat, nasal voice. He was obviously rattled, as were the other top Google executives on stage with him. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values.\u201dConservatives who have been spreading the canard that social media companies oppress their views \u2014 a drum Mr. Trump has himself been banging on lately \u2014 seized on the video as proof of Google\u2019s bias. But it should not have shocked anyone to find that Mr. Brin, a Russian exile who built the quirkiest of companies on the planet, is no fan of the president.Responding to the attack on its motives, a Google spokeswoman said, \u201cNothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.\u201d Blah blah blah. I don\u2019t mean to be cavalier. But I am astonished by the focus on this ridiculous scandal when a much more important issue concerning Google and censorship has been largely ignored by the public and by Washington.I\u2019m talking about the fact that Google is considering re-entering the Chinese market after leaving it with a lot of righteous indignation less than a decade ago. Reports say it might once again offer a range of services, including a censored version of its flagship search engine. A Google spokeswoman told me that the controversial effort \u2014 code-named Dragonfly \u2014 is \u201cexploratory,\u201d and that Google is \u201cnot close to launching a search product in China.\u201d What\u2019s most interesting is that much of the outrage about the possibility seems to be coming from Google employees who have registered strong objections, rather than from outside.For those who don\u2019t know the history, Google began operating in China in 2000 and in 2005 the Microsoft tech leader Kai-Fu Lee was hired as the head of Google China. By 2009 Google controlled more than 36 percent of the market share and served hundreds of millions of mainland Chinese users.It offered a truncated version of a search product, which included this disclaimer at the bottom of the page: \u201cSome results have been withheld because of the government restrictions.\u201d Google\u2019s justification for being there was that bringing more information to the information-starved Chinese was a good thing.\u201cAt least Chinese users knew what they were missing,\u201d Nicole Wong, a former top Google lawyer, recently explained to me on my podcast.The hope was that more information could help loosen the government\u2019s stranglehold. That did not happen.By 2010, Google was fed up with increasing repression and intrusions into its systems by Chinese-government-backed hackers. After a prolonged debate, Google withdrew to Hong Kong with a noncensored offering and was effectively out of the larger Chinese market. \u201cOur objection is to those forces of totalitarianism,\u201d Mr. Brin said at the time. He also wrote on his Google Plus page that the \u201cprimary threat by far to internet freedom is government filtering of political dissent.\u201d This rejection of censorship was a bold stance, setting Google apart from other companies, like Apple, that had compromised with the Chinese government in order to do business there.Fast forward to today, when Google is being falsely accused of censoring speech in the United States, when what it is really doing is mulling a return to censorship in China.If this makes you pause, it should, and Washington politicians should take all their sanctimony and direct it at the China issue, which actually deserves some scrutiny. Perhaps that is the real reason Google avoided sending its current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, to the recent Senate hearings, so he could avoid explaining what it was thinking when it came China 2.0: Now With 100 Percent More Hypocrisy.Google seems to have no problem climbing down off its high horse to grab the thing it needs in China.Which is, simply put, more data.That is what Ms. Wong and Dr. Lee, whom I also did a podcast interview with this week, suggested to me was the key impetus for the move.Right now, he notes, with China\u2019s aggressive use of sensors and you-say-facial-recognition-I-say-surveillance, a population hooked on mobile in a much more significant way than here and consumers more willing to trade away their privacy for digital convenience, China\u2019s internet companies have access to 10 to 15 times more data than American ones. Dr. Lee and others have called it a \u201cdata gap\u201d that Google has to bridge, and soon, if it wants to remain competitive.Ms. Wong agrees, noting that doing otherwise might give China the advantage in the next computing era.It\u2019s certainly a far cry from what he wrote with great emotion back in 2012 about leaving China:\u201cRegardless of how you feel about digital ecosystems or about Google, please do not take the free and open internet for granted from government intervention. To the extent that free flow of information threatens the powerful, those in power will seek to suppress it.\u201dWell said, Mr. Brin. Say it again.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook Security Breach Exposes Accounts of 50 Million Users", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook, already facing scrutiny over how it handles the private information of its users, said on Friday that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users.The breach, which was discovered this week, was the largest in the company\u2019s 14-year history. The attackers exploited a feature in Facebook\u2019s code to gain access to user accounts and potentially take control of them.Senior executives have testified several times this year in congressional hearings where some lawmakers suggested that the government will need to step in if the social network is unable to get tighter control of its service. On Friday, regulators and lawmakers quickly seized on the breach to renew calls for more oversight.In the conference call on Friday, Guy Rosen, a vice president of product management at Facebook, declined to say whether the attack could have been coordinated by hackers supported by a nation-state.Three software flaws in Facebook\u2019s systems allowed hackers to break into user accounts, including those of the top executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, according to two people familiar with the investigation but not allowed to discuss it publicly. Once in, the attackers could have gained access to apps like Spotify, Instagram and hundreds of others that give users a way to log into their systems through Facebook.The software bugs were particularly awkward for a company that takes pride in its engineering: The first two were introduced by an online tool meant to improve the privacy of users. The third was introduced in July 2017 by a tool meant to easily upload birthday videos.Facebook said it had fixed the vulnerabilities and notified law enforcement officials. Company officials do not know the identity or the origin of the attackers, nor have they fully assessed the scope of the attack or if particular users were targeted. The investigation is still in its beginning stages.\u201cWe\u2019re taking it really seriously,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cI\u2019m glad we found this, but it definitely is an issue that this happened in the first place.\u201dCritics say the attack is the latest sign that Facebook has yet to come to terms with its problems.\u201cBreaches don\u2019t just violate our privacy. They create enormous risks for our economy and national security,\u201d Rohit Chopra, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement. \u201cThe cost of inaction is growing, and we need answers.\u201dFacebook has been roundly criticized for being slow to acknowledge a vast disinformation campaign run by Russian operatives on its platform and other social media outlets before the 2016 presidential election.Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, testified in a Senate hearing that month about what the company was trying to do to prevent the same thing from happening in midterm elections in November.In April, Mr. Zuckerberg testified about revelations that Cambridge Analytica, the British analytics firm that worked with the Trump presidential campaign, siphoned personal information of millions of Facebook users.Outside the United States, the impact of disinformation appearing on Facebook and the popular messaging service it owns, WhatsApp, has been severe. In countries such as Myanmar and India, false rumors spread on social media are believed to have led to widespread killing.Facebook said the attackers had exploited two bugs in the site\u2019s \u201cView As\u201d feature, which allows users to check on what information other people can see about them. The feature was built to give users move control over their privacy.The company said those flaws were compounded by a bug in Facebook\u2019s video-uploading program for birthday celebrations, a software feature that was introduced in July 2017. The flaw allowed the attackers to steal so-called access tokens \u2014 digital keys that allow access to an account.It is not clear when the attack happened, but it appears to have occurred after the video-uploading program was introduced, Facebook said. The company forced more than 90 million users to log out early Friday, a common safety measure taken when accounts have been compromised.The hackers also tried to harvest people\u2019s private information, including name, sex and hometown, from Facebook\u2019s systems, Mr. Rosen said. The company could not determine the extent of the attackers\u2019 access to third-party accounts, he said.Part of that effort has been to gird Facebook against attacks on its network in preparation for the midterm elections. Facebook has spent months setting up new systems to pre-empt such attacks, and has already dealt with a number of incidents believed to be connected to elections in Mexico, Brazil and other countries.Still, the recently discovered breach was a reminder that it is exceptionally difficult to entirely secure a system that has more than 2.2 billion users all over the world and that connects with thousands of third-party services.\u201cThis has really shown us that because today\u2019s digital environment is so complex, a compromise on a single platform \u2014 especially one as popular and widely reaching as Facebook \u2014 can have consequences that are much more far-reaching than what we can tell in early days of the investigation,\u201d said April Doss, chairwoman of cybersecurity at the law firm Saul Ewing.As the news of Facebook\u2019s data breach spread quickly across Twitter, Google searches and other online sites, there was one place where it remained difficult to find some detailed reports: Facebook.Users who posted breaking stories about the breach from The Guardian, The Associated Press and other outlets were prompted with a notice that their posts had been taken down. So many people were posting the stories, they looked like suspicious activity to the systems that Facebook uses to block abuse of its network.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Connected Is Your Community to Everywhere Else in America?", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementFollow Us:Get the Upshot in your Inbox\nAmerica is often described as a place of great divides \u2014 between red and blue, big cities and rural towns, the coasts and the heartland. But our social lives are shaped by a much stronger force that ignores many of these lines: distance.Even in the age of the internet, distance matters immensely in determining whom \u2014 and, as a result, what \u2014 we know.Coastal cities like New York, Washington, San Francisco, Boston and Los Angeles do exhibit close ties to one another, showing that people in counties with similar incomes, education levels and voting patterns are more likely to be linked. But nationwide, the effect of such similarity is small. And the pull of regionalism is strong even for major cities. Brooklynites are still more likely to know someone on Facebook near Albany or Binghamton than in the Bay Area.This map shows an index of connectedness, created using friendship links between pairs of anonymous Facebook users from a snapshot of the platform in April 2016. The researchers aggregated the links at the county level, so neither the Times nor other academics working with the data can identify individual users within it, or how many Facebook users live in each county. Because counties with more people invariably have links to more places, this map rescales the index to account for differences in population.The darker the color, the greater the relative likelihood that any two people living in two different counties are connected on Facebook. Counties that are broadly tied to more \u2014 and more distant \u2014 places will color in more of the map. Counties where nearly all ties are very local will look more isolated.The networks that emerge reveal a distinct social fingerprint for each county, influenced by past migration patterns, geographical features and quirks of the local economy \u2014 whether, for example, the county is home to a military base, a resort hub or a booming oil industry.\u201cBut distance is the thing that shows up everywhere,\u201d said Johannes Stroebel, a professor at N.Y.U.\u2019s Stern School of Business and a co-author of the research, along with Michael Bailey at Facebook, Rachel Cao at Harvard, Theresa Kuchler at N.Y.U. and Arlene Wong at Princeton. \u201cDistance matters,\u201d Mr. Stroebel said, \u201cin explaining every single county\u2019s connectedness.\u201dProximity works alongside every other pattern shown below.State lines are powerful boundaries in binding nearby places. For many counties, as the maps illustrate, the likelihood of friendship drops off sharply at state borders. And counties within a given state tend to be strongly connected to one another. This is particularly striking in Michigan, where counties near the Indiana and Ohio state line are more closely tied to Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula than to out-of-state counties closer by.History is another significant force in shaping these networks. Decades-old migration patterns can help explain why some distant counties are disproportionately connected today. Northern cities like Chicago and Milwaukee still retain close ties to Southern counties along the Mississippi River, where African-American workers who were part of the Great Migration starting a century ago left communities for industrial jobs in the North.In other parts of the country, physical geography forms a kind of social barrier. Friendship links from Belmont County, Ohio, extend east but don\u2019t cross the Appalachian Mountains in Pennsylvania or the Blue Ridge range in Virginia. In Scott County, Ark., friendships do cross state lines, into Oklahoma, Louisiana and Texas. But they don\u2019t cross the Mississippi River to the east. In Nassau County, N.Y., the likelihood of friendship links declines steeply off Long Island.Other county outliers in the data can be explained by distinct roles some communities serve: Onslow County, N.C., which is connected to much of the country, is home to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune.Charlotte County, Fla., a retirement community destination, is disproportionately connected to counties across the northern Midwest and Northeast. Washington, D.C., a magnet for college graduates from across the country, is closely tied to counties that are home to major state universities in Florida, Alabama, Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan.The power of distance underlying these other patterns can be seen another way: If we were to divide the United States into two regions, merging counties that are most closely connected to one another, we would get a very simple map. It would not show the coasts versus the heartland, or red America versus blue America.It would show, simply, all of the continental U.S. and Alaska in one region, and far-off Hawaii in the other. Divide the country further, and cohesive regions become clear at different scales. Northern Florida merges with southern Georgia. Texas and California splinter. Divide the country into 50 regions, and you get something that looks like how we might redraw our state borders to reflect the social worlds people in America inhabit today.These networks are important in part because of other patterns that are correlated with them. Counties with more dispersed networks \u2014 where a smaller share of Facebook friends are located nearby, or among the nearest 50 million people \u2014 are on average richer, more educated and have longer life expectancies. Places that are more closely connected to one another also have more migration, trade and patent citations between them.Counties that are more geographically isolated in the index are more likely to have lower labor force participation and economic mobility, and they have higher rates of teenage births. Some of the most economically distressed parts of the country appear to be the most disconnected: Among the 10 U.S. counties with the highest share of friends within 50 miles, six are in Kentucky.Where most friends live within 50 milesThe patterns in this Facebook data don\u2019t necessarily mean that limited social networks cause worse economic and health outcomes, or that wide-ranging networks produce better ones. But other researchers say this data will make it possible in future studies to untangle why they\u2019re related.\u201cThis gives us the first way to systematically look at some of those relationships,\u201d said Mark Granovetter, a sociologist at Stanford who has written influential papers on the value of social networks. \u201cThey have just scratched the surface here.\u201dFacebook links used in the research are between users active on the platform within 30 days of the April 2016 snapshot. Users in the study were assigned a county based on the location in their Facebook profile, their activity on the site and their regular login sources. Some independent cities in Virginia are missing from the data.The Upshot has partnered with Siena College to poll dozens of the most competitive House and Senate races across the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Discussion Questions for \u2018Earning the Rockies\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Read This1. In \u201cEarning the Rockies,\u201d Kaplan relies heavily on the work of Bernard DeVoto, an American historian with a passion for public lands. He writes that DeVoto saw how \u201cthe geography of the American West freighted the United States with a precise and unprecedented international destiny.\u201d Do you agree with this statement? If so, what is that destiny?2. Kaplan writes that the American character remains a frontier attitude, which manifests itself today in capitalism, Silicon Valley and the activities of the Army and Navy. Do you see the frontier attitude of the early settlers as still relevant today?3. Kaplan calls our modern era \u201can age when technology tricks us into thinking geography irrelevant.\u201d Do you think this is true? How do you see the geography still shaping the country today?4. \u201cEarning the Rockies\u201d devotes a number of pages to describing how America\u2019s geography is unique, one way being that the country has more miles of navigable inland waterways than the rest of the world combined. What are some other ways? Why does this matter?5. Why were the Rockies and America\u2019s desert particularly hard to settle? What were the motivations of the people who did?6. Kaplan describes an earlier reporting road trip in which he found everyone in America was focused intensely on their local history. Do you find this to be true today?7. Among Kaplan\u2019s analyses is the claim that idealized concepts have \u201crarely taken firm root in America\u201d because people are too busy making money, which he sees as an extension of the frontier ethos of \u201cdoing\u201d rather than \u201cimagining.\u201d Do you believe that\u2019s the reason? Do you see other reasons?8. In \u201cEarning the Rockies\u201d Kaplan laments that the removal and decimation of American Indians was simply \u201ceminently practical for the settlers,\u201d more practical than allowing coexistence. What do you think America would have looked like had coexistence with Native people and traditions happened instead?9. Several pages in the book are devoted to what Kaplan sees as a backlash to globalization in America right now, in which people do not or cannot adapt to a multinational cultural fusion. This failure to adapt is blamed in part on America\u2019s size and geography, in which parallel universes can exist in urban and rural areas. How do you think geography plays a role in differing attitudes toward globalization today?10. Kaplan writes: \u201cIf a small city is not connected in some demonstrable fashion to other continents, it is dead.\u201d Have you seen this to be true in any American cities you\u2019ve lived in or visited?11. The book refers continuously to America\u2019s frontier ethos and how that ethos extends internationally, because, as he explains the thinking, \u201cif the frontier could be conquered the world could be too.\u201d How have you seen that ethos play out in America\u2019s activities internationally?12. \u201cThe United States may have fought unnecessary wars in Vietnam and Iraq, making situations in those countries worse rather than better,\u201d Kaplan writes, \u201cbut over the chasm of decades, since the mid-twentieth century, the U.S., through both it\u2019s military and diplomatic service, has made the world far less unstable and far more friendly to civil society than it would otherwise have been.\u201d Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Why?13. Kaplan describes rarely hearing people talk politics while he\u2019s on the road, but instead discussing the challenges of daily life. Is that your experience as well, even as politics dominates the news?14. He also describes the media as \u201ca carapace, a noise barrier, underneath which the real drama of the nation is played out.\u201d How do you see the media today?15. \u201cEarning the Rockies\u201d describes how the Hoover Dam created the American Southwest, but also how such a project may not be possible today. Why?16. Do you see America\u2019s geography as exceptional?17. Toward the end of the book, Kaplan argues that American foreign policy may require both morality and amorality, because to lend humanitarian efforts may also require the amoral acquisition of power to maintain interests. Do you agree with this statement?18. Kaplan closes by saying he wants us to remember not some but all of the lessons of the frontier. What are the foibles and lessons that you think bear remembering?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Dorsey Avoids Taking Sides in Partisan House Hearing", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and Mr. Dorsey testified at the Senate hearing about their companies\u2019 response to foreign interference in elections and the moderation of online content.\u2022 Larry Page, the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, was also invited to the Senate hearing but the company declined to send him. Several senators noted that no one from Google was there.The House hearing kicked off with a more political tone than the morning Senate hearing with social media executives.Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive officer, was asked by Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, the Republican chairman of the committee, how algorithms could be suppressing conservative views on the service.It was a stark change from the morning hearing, when Senate Intelligence Committee members were more collegial and appeared to share similar concerns with Facebook and Twitter over disinformation and foreign influence on their site.The top Democrat in the House hearing, Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, accused his Republican counterparts on the committee of having political motives behind their accusations.\u201cPresident Trump and many Republicans have peddled conspiracy theories about Twitter and other social media platforms to whip up their base and fund-raise,\u201d Mr. Pallone said. \u201cI fear the Republicans are using this hearing for those purposes instead of addressing the serious issues raised by social media platforms that affect Americans\u2019 everyday lives.\u201dRepresentative Joe Barton, a Republican of Texas, said: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion if there wasn\u2019t a general agreement that your company had discriminated against conservatives.\u201dMr. Dorsey, who read opening remarks from a phone while live-tweeting, said the company has found no evidence of political bias.\u201cLooking at the data, we analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate, and found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a Republican, even after our ranking and filtering of tweets has been applied,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, accused Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, of sounding the alarm of anti-conservative bias for political gains.He described those accusations as a \u201cload of crap.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangAs House lawmakers threw political jabs in the hearing, Mr. Dorsey managed to steer clear of taking sides.Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, asked Mr. Dorsey if he felt manipulated by Republican politicians who have raised accusations of anti-conservative bias for fund-raising purposes.Mr. Dorsey demurred.\u201cI do believe there is growing concern around power companies like ours hold,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. \u201cPeople do see us as a digital public square and that comes with certain expectations.\u201dRepresentative Ben Luj\u00e1n, Democrat of New Mexico, asked Mr. Dorsey to compare the number of bot accounts Twitter took down that followed President Trump versus President Obama. Mr. Luj\u00e1n knew the answer to his own question. (Two million follower accounts for Obama were taken down versus 320,000 for Mr. Trump, a sign, Mr. Luj\u00e1n suggested, that Twitter was not biased against Republicans.)Mr. Dorsey, however, did not weigh in the issue.\u201cNot sure of those details,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. \u201cBut it was a broad-based action across Twitter.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangRoughly 90 minutes into the afternoon hearing, right-wing activist Laura Loomer stood up from her seat in the back of the room and began yelling over committee members to \u201cstop the bias.\u201dHolding up her cellphone camera so that she could film her own interruption, Ms. Loomer accused tech companies of holding a bias against conservative voices. As committee members asked her to take her seat so that they could resume their discussions, one lawmaker decided to take matters into his own hands.Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, imitated an auctioneer\u2019s patter, running a live auction as Ms. Loomer repeated her accusations in an ever-louder voice. Mr. Long owned an auction business for decades.Leaning close into his microphone and speaking in a steady, rapid-fire voice, Mr. Long called out, \u201cFifty cents, a dollar!\u201d as Ms. Loomer was escorted from the room.Mr. Long\u2019s performance drew laughs from lawmakers of both parties.\u2014 Sheera FrenkelLawmakers and Mr. Dorsey are using a lot of jargon in Wednesday afternoon\u2019s House hearing. Here are explanations of some of those terms.Conservative Twitter users have recently rallied around claims that Twitter shadow bans users based on their politics. In July, President Trump tweeted that he would look into the \u201cdiscriminatory and illegal practice.\u201d However, Twitter says it does not shadow ban users. Twitter\u2019s algorithmic timeline ranks tweets based on a number of factors, causing some tweets to appear higher in the timeline than others.\u2014 Kate CongerSenator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, asked the executives about their responsibilities to control harmful behavior on their platforms.He noted that the illegal sale of opioids on their platforms still exists. Mr. Manchin asked if the companies felt that they should bear some responsibility for deaths related to opioid sales on their platform.Neither Mr. Dorsey nor Ms. Sandberg answered that question directly, and they stressed the importance of laws that protect internet platforms from lawsuits.The executives said they could be open to further reforms to a law that provides a safe harbor from liability to internet companies, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law, passed in 1996, is considered the Holy Grail of internet policy, providing broad protections that are credited with the rapid growth of Silicon Valley.But they said that the protection also allows them greater freedom to police bad behavior without fear of legal actions.\u201cWe benefit from a lot of protections it gives,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.\u201cThe safe harbor of 230 has been very important in enabling companies like ours to do proactive enforcement without increasingly our liability,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said. \u201cSo we would like to work very closely on how this is enacted.\u201dLawmakers pressed the two executives on how their platforms notify users of foreign influence campaigns.Ms. Sandberg said Facebook is getting better at letting users know of fake accounts and ads. She raised the example of an event in Washington, D.C., that was promoted by an inauthentic account. When Facebook detected the account, the company took down the event and notified users who indicated their interest in attending.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, criticized Twitter for Russian activity that affected her account but that was only brought to her attention by researchers from Clemson University.Mr. Dorsey admitted that Twitter needed to improve its process of detecting fake accounts and notifying users, and said the company wants to work more with academics.\u201cWe do believe in transparency and a big part of where we need the most work,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.\u2014 Cecilia KangRegulation is coming. Senators made that clear in their statements to Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey. But the precise form of that legislation is unclear.\u201cCongress is going to have to take action here,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. \u201cThe era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end.\u201dSeveral lawmakers indicated that they saw an opening for regulation related to election interference on social media platforms, because they considered it a threat to national security. Other senators appeared to favor a privacy approach, focusing on individual rights to control personal data.Data privacy, said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat from Oregon, would serve as the \u201cfoundation\u201d of legislation that he has previously discussed with Twitter and Facebook.Social media companies are resigned to the notion that regulation is on its way. Twitter and Facebook have endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a proposal that would require more transparency about who is paying for online ads, and have begun building so-called ad transparency centers on their platforms.But expect some resistance from the tech giants. In a white paper, Mr. Warner proposed 20 legislative possibilities. When pressed on one of the proposals, Ms. Sandberg replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of whether regulation, we think it\u2019s a question of the right regulation.\u201d\u2014 Kate CongerMs. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey\u2019s opening statements before the Senate hearing displayed their obvious differences.Ms. Sandberg, who was born in Washington, and spent years living there during her time at the Treasury Department, appeared confident in her opening remarks. Speaking clearly and with practiced pacing, she complimented the committee\u2019s previous work on election interference.Mr. Dorsey stumbled during his opening, forgetting to turn on his microphone and reading from a cellphone he held in his hand. He added that he was also live-tweeting his opening remarks through his Twitter account.While Ms. Sandberg made consistent eye contact with the senators, Mr. Dorsey appeared to be reading from his phone between questions.\u2014 Cecilia Kang and Sheera FrenkelAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biblical Guide to Reporting", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI spent five years in Christian ministry. My faith has made me a better journalist. Mr. Allen is a reporter who explores why health care in the United States is so costly.More than a dozen years ago I was a finalist for a reporting job at a small newspaper. All I needed to do was survive an interview with the top editor. The other editors warned me, saying their boss took perverse pleasure from smashing the hopes of na\u00efve reporters. I braced myself as he studied my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. His lips curled into a sneer. To be fair, my job history was a tad unusual. I had spent five years in full-time ministry, including three as an evangelical Christian missionary in Kenya. Then there was my master\u2019s degree in theology from Fuller Theological Seminary. There didn\u2019t seem to be a lot of churchgoing, Bible-believing, born-again Christians like me working at daily papers. He emphasized \u201cChristian\u201d as if it was some kind of slur. I liked that he spoke his mind, but I was taken aback. I explained what I saw as a natural progression from the ministry to muckraking, pointing out that both are valid ways of serving a higher cause. The Bible endorses telling the truth, without bias. So does journalism. The Bible commands honesty and integrity. In journalism, your reputation is your main calling card with sources and readers. Obviously, many people have succeeded as reporters without strong religious beliefs. But I told him my faith had made me a better, more determined journalist. He replied with a noncommittal grunt. But I got the job. My response to that editor is more relevant than ever today. It has become popular for some conservative leaders to argue that people like me don\u2019t exist in America\u2019s newsrooms or that journalism is immoral. Just the other day, a Washington State lawmaker called journalists \u201cdirty, godless, hateful people,\u201d according to The Seattle Times. President Trump seems to take delight in taunting reporters and has referred to members of the media as \u201clying, disgusting people.\u201d It\u2019s estimated that about a third of Americans attend a regular church service. From my experience, most newsrooms don\u2019t come close to that. But in 17 years, I\u2019ve never had a colleague suggest that my religious beliefs kept me from hard-nosed reporting. In fact, my convictions give me a foundation to be demanding.The mission statement of ProPublica, my employer, says we want to use the \u201cmoral force of investigative reporting to spur reform.\u201d If you go through my work, you may sense a bit of \u201cmoral force.\u201d Another basic tenet of fairness is refusing to accept any gifts, of any amount. Our readers need to trust that our work is untainted by any reward. \u201cDo not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent,\u201d Deuteronomy says. Most journalists admit their mistakes and run corrections. This is consistent with biblical teaching about humility. God didn\u2019t direct the writers of the Bible to avoid controversy. I love how Luke describes his mission in the first few verses of his Gospel: \u201cI myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning\u201d he wrote, \u201cso that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.\u201d Luke\u2019s goal was to tell the truth about Jesus, which upset many people. Luke didn\u2019t airbrush the early Christians. He named names. Luke told the story of Judas betraying Jesus. He exposed Peter denying Jesus three times. He verified the facts and then told the truth. If it was good enough for Luke, it\u2019s good enough for me. The biblical mandate is to tell the truth. But some conservative Christians don\u2019t seem to understand that. I started out in the Christian media and had run-ins with editors because of my interest in reporting about Christian leaders, even if it made them look bad. Administrators recently censored student journalists at Liberty University, a conservative Christian institution, for, in their view, making the school look bad. But God calls us to publish the truth, not propaganda.The biblical prophets were the moral conscience of God\u2019s people. Today, in a nonreligious sense, journalists are the moral conscience of the wider culture. We live in a fallen world, so there\u2019s no shortage of material.

{"Headline": "For Fans of Iran\u2019s Sophisticated Cuisine, a Reason to Cheer", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosWhen you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Considering the history, the influence, the depth and the sophistication of Iranian food, it has always seemed unfair that New York City has so few places to eat it. Unfair to the cuisine and unfair to would-be eaters.All summer, Iranian expats and hopeful fans of Iranian cuisine have been filing in, armed with questions: Does the saffron rice stand high in voluminous heaps of discrete grains? Are nigella seeds embedded in the dimpled, golden crusts of the oval loaves of barbari? Do the cold shards of sorbet frozen around threads of noodles in Sofreh\u2019s faloodeh contain just enough rose water to soften the bite of lime syrup? Check, check and check.Ms. Alikhani has never worked in a restaurant before. Rather than following the plating fashions of more trend-conscious chefs, she models the cooking after the things she might make when company comes over. Platoons of kebabs dominate the menus of other Iranian restaurants around town, but home kitchens are rarely built with vast indoor grills; Sofreh\u2019s cooking, entrusted to two chefs named Ali Saboor and Soroosh Golbabae, revolves around the oven and stovetop.A loaf of barbari, its crust baked to a Roman-pizza crackle in a revolving oven, is served with many of the appetizers, and it is always gone so soon that I end up ordering one or two more. This flatbread is of course ideal for tearing and swishing into the thick yogurt dips, one mixed with golden raisins and shredded cucumber, another with minced shallots and chives. It is indispensable with the eggplant mash enriched with walnuts, strained yogurt and sweet fried onions. A loaf of barbari is also spread with herbs and feta that is more creamy than briny.Earlier in the summer Sofreh offered an appetizer of dry, underseasoned beef meatballs with sour cherries. One of the only things on the menu that was hard to warm up to, it has been replaced lately by beef kofte, made light and tender by rice and stewed split peas. The kofte sit in a gentle saffron-tomato sauce that is another natural partner for Sofreh\u2019s bread.Ms. Alikhani, 59, grew up in the sprawling desert city Isfahan, and moved to the United States in her early 20s. For years she cooked Iranian dishes from memory, and it would be decades before she traveled back to Iran to learn more about its food in preparation for opening Sofreh. Her version of ash, the herb and whole-wheat noodle stew, stands out on the menu because it stays so close to tradition. Other dishes show the acclimatizing effect of New York.It\u2019s an article of faith for chefs in the city that any dish can be improved by putting a poached egg on it. I\u2019m not so sure that Sofreh\u2019s smoked eggplant halves with their sweet, garlic-drenched tomato sauce need one, though.Is the watermelon feta salad familiar from restaurants that have nothing to do with Iran? Maybe just a bit, but Sofreh\u2019s version stands out for its intriguing sauce of nigella seeds crushed into mint oil. And while the Shiraz salad isn\u2019t chopped to fine bits in the traditional way that makes it something like Iran\u2019s answer to pico de gallo, its sour purple flecks of sumac distinguish it from the herd of tomato-cucumber assemblages.The menu is fairly concise, and occasionally I wished that it plunged into tradition with less restraint. For a dish called \u201ccatch of the day,\u201d Ms. Alikhani has adapted ghalieh mahi, a tamarind-soured stew of fish and fresh herbs from southern Iran. In her version, a pan-seared hunk of whitefish \u2014 halibut and cod have taken turns in the role \u2014 is set over a long-cooked sauce. Dark with caramelized onions and fried cilantro and fresh fenugreek leaves, the sauce is hypnotically complex. Still, a sauce sitting under fish is not the same as one that has been cooked with fish so the flavors can get acquainted.A simple flattened and griddled half chicken, though, is a wonderful foil for a topping of tart barberries and a captivating sauce of dried Persian plums and saffron. And there\u2019s lovely simplicity to the braised lamb shank with roasted garlic and sizzled onions; the turmeric- and cinnamon-scented sauce might have been put on this earth to be spooned over fluffy rice.There is no shame in ending the meal with a goblet of thick yogurt parfait with jam and pistachios. But there are harder-to-find sweets, too, like the rose-water custard, grainy with rice flour, transformed into a sort of tart by a crust of chopped nuts. Saffron and rose-water ice cream is luxuriously rich despite a few stray ice crystals. And the faloodeh, one of the world\u2019s oldest frozen desserts, will put to rest all doubts about the wisdom of embedding sorbet in a nest of vermicelli, if there were any doubts to begin with.When you make a reservation at an independently reviewed restaurant through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Reservations powered by OpenTablecookingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "They Say Sexual Assault, Kavanaugh Says It Never Happened: Sifting Truth From Memory", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHow trauma and time alter the way we recollect significant events.When Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford present their vastly different recollections to the Senate on Thursday, the quality and reliability of memory itself will be on trial.Judge Kavanaugh has emphatically denied allegations from Dr. Blasey that he tried to rape her when they were teenagers or ever committed sexual assault against anyone. Dr. Blasey and another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, have recounted their alleged incidents with both precise detail and gaping holes.Could Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers be mistaken about his identity? Could he somehow have erased the experiences they allege from his memory? Or, even, could all be telling what they genuinely believe is the truth?For a trauma victim, this encoding combines mortal fear and heart-racing panic with crystalline fragments of detail: the make of the gun, the color of the attacker\u2019s eyes. The emotion is so strong that the fragments can become untethered from time and place. They may persist in memory even as other relevant details\u2014the exact date, the conversation just before the attack, who else was in the room \u2014 fall out of reach. Conversely, experts suggest, there are scenarios in which someone could have committed an assault and yet also have almost no memory of it. If an assailant attaches little significance to an assault\u2014for instance, if he doesn\u2019t consider it an assault \u2014 his brain may only weakly encode details of the encounter. Retrieving such experiences from memory is an equally selective task and prone to error. In biological terms, recollection is a process of both revisiting and reassembly. Recalling an event draws on some of same areas of the brain that recorded it; in essence, to remember is to relive.Every time the mind summons the encoded experience, it can add details, subtract others and even alter the tone and point of the story. That reassembly, in turn, is freshly stored again, so that the next time it comes to mind it contains those edits. Using memory changes memory, as cognitive scientists say. For a victim, often the only stable elements are emotions and the tunnel-vision details: the dress she wore, the hand over her mouth.The reliability of those details depends in part on when they entered the narrative. \u201cIn this case the question is, when did the accuser attach Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s name to the incident?\u201d said Elizabeth Loftus, a professor in psychological sciences at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cWas it right away or did it come much later, say, in therapy?\u201d How do victims of sexual assault forge ahead without succumbing to the weight of a terrible memory? Dr. Hopper suggested that the answer may lie, in part, with how that memory is retrieved. \u201cIf you cling to an abstract, emotionally void description of an event and don\u2019t label it \u2018an attempted rape,\u2019 then you can go for years and that\u2019s all that will pop up,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t go there with the sensory details that you have pushed away. You tell yourself, \u2018I was forced into a room, I struggled and I got away.\u2019\u201dA perpetrator\u2019s memory of the encounter is at least as prone to revision on retrieval. The encoded fragments of the event are there but typically less vivid; many relevant details may be impossible to summon, especially if the assailant hasn\u2019t thought about the incident for years. The memory trace isn\u2019t erased, but it can be reconfigured and supplanted.A similar sleight of retrieval may protect perpetrators of abuse, experts say. The human mind works to preserve a sense of moral integrity. That process is a self-serving one, allowing us to function day-to-day, tweaking our personal narrative to support who we are or want to be.Men who commit sexual assault rarely think of themselves as assailants, Dr. Hopper said: \u201cWe tend to go with the abstract descriptions of events that make us feel less bad about ourselves, and less ashamed.\u201dFor the senators trying to sort out this explosive drama, the most important element may be timing: what happened between encoding and retrieval, and when. One thing that brain scientists have consistently found is that, once people settle on the basic \u201cfacts\u201d of what happened, however flawed that perception, they rarely make corrections, even in face of contradicting evidence. They have their story and they\u2019re sticking to it.Advertisement"}

Mr. Isa and Mr. Faccini are Latin American filmmakers. It turned out that Dulce\u2019s mother, Betty Arboleda, was a pianguera. Had she taken her daughter out to join her at work among the mangroves? No, Betty told us \u2014 because Dulce could not swim. Luckily for us, this was about to change. A boy had pushed Dulce off a dock a few days before, giving her and her mother a serious scare. Betty was determined: Dulce must learn to swim. So over three days we filmed her doing that, with all the intimate conversations, natural sights and sounds, and Dulce\u2019s unmistakable emotions forming the arc of the story.The region\u2019s dense coastal mangrove forests help absorb destructive tides, but these seaside bulwarks are being chipped away by development and unscrupulous firewood collection.

And now local and international groups are teaming up with residents to reduce piangua harvests in the name of conservation, establish \u201cno-take zones\u201d to allow the piangua populations to recover, and enforce new zoning rules to protect 35,000 acres of mangroves that nurture the pianguas \u2014 and secure the coastline against rising seas.It\u2019s an hour by boat from La Ensenada to the nearest hotel, so we stayed with Betty and Dulce while filming; crew members were guests in houses nearby.

{"Headline": "Thomas, Kavanaugh and Race", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere\u2019s one distinct difference between the Clarence Thomas hearings and the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. Opinion ColumnistThere is no effort yet to thoroughly investigate her claim, by either the F.B.I. or the Senate itself, and there are no plans as yet to call any witnesses other than the accused and the accuser. This is designed to be a spectacle that will embarrass her and elevate him, much the way the Clarence Thomas hearings featuring accuser Anita Hill played out in 1991.Indeed, many people have drawn attention to the numerous parallels between the two cases, but I would like to draw attention to one difference, one that could bode well for Ford: the absence of a racial element in a heated racial environment.One could argue that this was the first modern Black Lives Matters case \u2014 a private citizen recording and sharing video that exposed police brutality.\u201cFifteen police officers in 10 patrol cars stopped Mr. King\u2019s white sedan. As Mr. King lay on the ground offering no resistance, he was surrounded by officers, one of whom shocked him with a stun gun as others hit him more than 50 times with their batons and kicked him in the head and body at least seven times while he begged them to stop.\u201dBut the two men could not have been more different: Marshall, a true liberal, and Thomas, a man hostile to civil rights initiatives.Then came the allegation of sexual harassment brought by Professor Hill, and everything changed. It is not that Hill wasn\u2019t credible, but it was that Thomas was on the defensive and the image of yet another black man under attack from a group of white men had an eerie echo of King under assault from the L.A.P.D.After the hearings, The Chicago Tribune reported on an ABC News-Washington Post poll that showed support for Thomas\u2019s confirmation had actually risen to 56 percent. But as the paper pointed out:Thomas\u2019s support was strongest among blacks, with 70 percent backing his nomination; 50 percent of whites support him. Another weekend poll, conducted by The Los Angeles Times, said 51 percent overall believed the Senate should confirm Thomas, down from 54 percent in September. But when broken down by race, the figures showed 61 percent of blacks backed Thomas\u2019s confirmation, up from 55 percent in September, while only 50 percent of whites said he should be confirmed.Black people, to their everlasting regret, backed Thomas, as did the Senate, over Hill\u2019s warnings.This time, that racial element is absent. The Republicans on the committee, those likely to be hostile to Ford, are all still white men. Ford and Kavanaugh are both white.This is a much more focused battle of testimonies. Either a boy assaulted a girl or he didn\u2019t. Either an older child took advantage of a younger one, or he didn\u2019t.One of these people is lying and in this collision of gender narratives, women will not have to struggle with the choice that black people did.

He points out that Mueller\u2019s mandate does not necessarily include a full investigation of Trump\u2019s businesses.

If Democrats win House control, Schiff will gain subpoena power. If Republicans keep control, just imagine how emboldened Trump will feel. He could mount a full-on assault on the rule of law by shutting down Mueller\u2019s investigation and any other official scrutiny of the Trump Organization.At this point, who can doubt that Trump wants to do so?

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.\u201cLook at me when I\u2019m talking to you! You\u2019re telling me that my assault doesn\u2019t matter. That what happened to me doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d \u201cI cannot imagine that for the next 50 years they will have to have someone in the Supreme Court who has been accused of violating a young girl,\u201d raged Ms. Archila, who told the senator that she too had been sexually assaulted.Mr. Flake did little more than awkwardly mumble that he had to go and that he had already issued a statement about this matter. Even so, a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee gathered to vote on whether to recommend Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, the lawmaker announced that he could support a floor vote only if there was first a weeklong delay to allow for a targeted investigation by the F.B.I. Soon, Senator Lisa Murkowski had joined the call for a delay, giving the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, little choice. At the White House, President Trump was calling Christine Blasey Ford a \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201ccompelling\u201d witness and saying that he was no longer sure that Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination would \u201ccontinue onward.\u201d Whatever happens next, Republican lawmakers ought to tread carefully. They thus far have not covered themselves in glory in their handling of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. This brief pause provides them with an opportunity to start repairing some of that damage, to try to come across as \u2014 and maybe even to actually be \u2014 more interested in the truth than in shoving through their nominee regardless of it. As they try to figure out how best to move forward, they would do well to keep something in mind: Women are watching.Many women have been eyeing the Republican Party with growing unease since it was taken over by Donald Trump, whose retrograde views on gender are straight out of the 1950s \u2014 or maybe the 1590s. Confronted with serious and credible allegations against Judge Kavanaugh, Republican lawmakers could have seized the moment to reassure anxious women that they realized some issues transcend partisanship. Instead, they failed, quite spectacularly, to rise to the occasion \u2014 turning their furious defense of the nominee into an illuminating microcosm of the disregard and disrespect for women that have become hallmarks of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican Party. As the Kavanaugh nightmare took form, women watched in dismay as Republican lawmakers worked to discredit Dr. Blasey by suggesting that she was either hopelessly confused, a political pawn or a liar. They watched in disbelief as Republicans repeatedly declined to call for an independent investigation into Dr. Blasey\u2019s allegations, much less the subsequent ones brought by Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick. They watched in frustration as Republicans failed to call material witnesses or outside experts to testify.And women most definitely were watching on Thursday, when the Senate Judiciary Committee spent the day listening to the testimony of Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey. Women saw how the 11 Republican men brought in a female prosecutor to chip away at Dr. Blasey\u2019s account, while showing little interest in the alleged attack itself. They saw how those same Republican men then tripped over themselves to assure Judge Kavanaugh that they felt his pain and were so very sorry that Democrats had, as Senator Lindsey Graham shrieked in a display of self-righteous hysteria, conspired to put the nominee \u201cthrough hell.\u201dLess than 24 hours later, the committee gave its seal of approval to Judge Kavanaugh and advanced his nomination to the full Senate on a party-line vote of 11 to 10.To their credit, Republican lawmakers have said all along that they were going to do this, with Mr. Flake the first to demand a different path. When the accusations against the nominee surfaced, prominent senators like Orrin Hatch and Mr. Graham rushed to assure their base \u2014 and their president \u2014 that whatever Dr. Blasey had to say would not alter their support. Some Republicans dismissed her story as false. Others judged that, even if it was true, it didn\u2019t much matter. Collectively, they made clear their determination to, as Mr. McConnell memorably put it, \u201cplow right through.\u201dStill, it\u2019s hard to believe that they showed so little interest, especially in the face of the public turmoil this episode has stirred up. Dr. Blasey\u2019s story, and the way it has been met with sneering disbelief, has resonated with women in a way that even many of the #MeToo horror stories did not. It feels as though everyone knows someone \u2014 a friend, a neighbor, a daughter \u2014 who has pulled them aside in recent weeks to share a similarly wrenching experience.In response, Republican men have largely shrugged their shoulders \u2014 or worse, shifted into high dudgeon, issuing stern lectures about how such \u201ccharacter assassinations\u201d will drive good men away from public service and how the real danger here is that this nation\u2019s sons and husbands will all become vulnerable to false, or at least insignificant, accusations. This is straight-up culture warfare, a message of fear, resentment and male victimhood being sold as sympathetic concern for all those mothers and wives who, as Republicans tell it, could soon see their beloved males torn down by political plots. It\u2019s a particularly rich message coming from some of the same conservative corners that dismissed the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh with the swinish rationalization that boys will be boys. Then again, such attitudes reflect the broader values of this president and his party. Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet contains notably few women\u2019s voices. The president himself has been endlessly forgiving of men with reputations for mistreating women. From Roy Moore to Bill O\u2019Reilly, from Bill Shine to Rob Porter \u2014 if you are a man who has been disgraced for behaving badly, the Trump White House wants you to know that it is on your side. In policy terms, the administration has proved hostile to women on matters of reproductive health, not only chipping away at abortion rights but also curtailing access to birth control and peddling abstinence-only sex education. It also has worked to weaken protections for victims of sexual violence. At the same time, Republicans in Congress have been fighting to take away women\u2019s access to health care in general, targeting both Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act. They have also proved incapable of passing even basic legislation to reform how sexual harassment is handled within their own ranks. Maybe Republicans don\u2019t care about the message they\u2019re sending. They\u2019ve been losing ground with women for years now. And, while they've occasionally toyed with addressing the root causes of the gender gap, Mr. Trump\u2019s election seems to have convinced them that things are fine after all. Why bother trying?But this is a dangerous lesson. Along with all the protests and the political organizing, women have stepped up to run for office in record numbers. Polls show the gender gap to be growing ever wider in terms of whom women plan to vote for. (Hint: It\u2019s not Republicans.) The Kavanaugh debacle is unlikely to help \u2014 barring an exculpatory revelation, of course. After the allegations against him surfaced, a similar gender gap began opening up in terms of who supported his nomination.From atop his tower of self-pity on Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh warned that the partisan plot to tank his nomination would haunt Democrats. \u201cYou sowed the wind,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cFor decades to come, I fear the whole country will reap the whirlwind.\u201dWe don\u2019t know about the whole country. Certainly, die-hard partisans will stick by their party, come what may. But, where more and more women are concerned, Republicans are overdue for a reckoning. Women have not simply been watching. They\u2019ve been preparing their response. That response may come in 2018 or in 2020. But it will come. And, without a course correction far more dramatic than the frantic shuffling spurred by Mr. Flake\u2019s 11th-hour pang of conscience, the damage Republican lawmakers are doing to their party could last for decades. An earlier version of this editorial misstated the location of flowers strewn in support of Dr. Blasey. They were on the steps of the Supreme Court building, not the Capitol building.Advertisement"}

Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for about $715 million, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with Mark Zuckerberg about growth.\u201cThey are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,\u201d Mr. Acton said. \u201cThey just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don\u2019t necessarily agree with.\u201dYes, founders take their money and make a choice. But Facebook\u2019s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. That\u2019s a problem: Facebook\u2019s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.That\u2019s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It\u2019s very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. \u201cYou think they can\u2019t eat any more,\u201d says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs \u201ccram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.\u201dThe bigger worry might be to SoftBank\u2019s investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don\u2019t go too far.\u2022 Amazon\u2019s associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to \u201censure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.\u201d\u2022 Keith Enright, Google\u2019s new chief privacy officer, told them to \u201ctake into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.\u201dFox is selling at the behest of Walt Disney, which struck a deal over the summer to buy most of Mr. Murdoch\u2019s media empire.So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy. But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed\u2019s chief, said yesterday: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider political factors.\u201dThe sportswear company\u2019s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.Another factor: Under Nike\u2019s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can\u2019t sell league-branded merchandise after 2020. That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process. Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.And:If companies\u2019 profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds. But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year. And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more. In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more. Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading! We\u2019ll see you tomorrow.Advertisement"}

Vendors \u2014 mostly immigrants, many undocumented \u2014 have faced fines, misdemeanor criminal charges and, increasingly in the Trump era, the threat of deportation.\u201cIt\u2019s really a big deal for vendors across the state,\u201d said Carla De Paz, an organizer in Los Angeles on behalf of vendors. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of undocumented workers who are facing the fear of deportation, especially in our current political climate.\u201dStreet vending here has always been bound up with issues of race and class, as well as the nature of the urban landscape of Los Angeles \u2014 its sprawl, the centrality of the automobile and debates about how public spaces are used.And in the last two years, the administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration gave new urgency to the push to legalize street sellers. Activists here made the argument that protecting immigrant street vendors was an important step for the city in pushing back against the president\u2019s agenda.Rudy Espinoza, an activist who has worked for years to legalize street vending in Los Angeles, had been involved in promoting economic development in immigrant communities when he learned about the plight of street vendors. \u201cThey told us, \u2018Hey, we are getting criminalized out here,\u2019\u201d he recalled.Mr. Espinoza said the history of street vending, and why it was illegal for so long, had been intertwined with the \u201cracism and classism\u201d of Los Angeles, and how the city came to \u201cprivilege cars over people.\u201dJonathan Gold, the revered Los Angeles Times food critic, was an enthusiastic evangelist for street food, vibrant sidewalks and raising awareness about the plight of street vendors.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)Can a concert hall dream?Mr. Anadol, a data artist, said he likes to imagine the Frank Gehry-designed building as an enormous artificial intelligence that recalls the orchestra\u2019s past and slips into reverie about its future.\u201cI thought it was time to take these beautiful memories and organize them into a story,\u201d he said. \u201cFrank Gehry\u2019s building is now having its \u2018Inception\u2019 moment.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "TV Keeps the Faith With Supernatural Procedurals. Again.", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookWhen the broadcast networks unveil their fall lineups, there are a few sure bets. There will always be a cop show. There will always be a lawyer show and a doctor show. There will always be a comedy that seems doomed to fail. These days, there\u2019ll be a reboot or revival, too, and probably something based on a movie.Some years, there\u2019s a big-swing drama, or a high-profile comedian finally landing a plum gig.And some years \u2014 this year and last among them \u2014 there\u2019s that quirky light drama with a spiritual or religious tinge. A lighthearted yet poignant show in which some Joe or Jane Schmo begrudgingly embarks on a weekly quest to do good at the behest of some higher power.And maybe \u201cGod\u201d is too. It\u2019s part of a noble tradition of shows like \u201cJoan of Arcadia,\u201d \u201cReaper,\u201d \u201cBeing Erica,\u201d \u201cKevin (Probably) Saves the World,\u201d \u201cWonderfalls,\u201d \u201cEli Stone\u201d and \u201cDead Like Me.\u201dThese supernatural deed-oriented procedurals start the same way. Our lead is somewhat dissatisfied with his or her lot in life (aren\u2019t we all? the show suggests), until one fateful day: A voice, a song, a vision! A dog that goes crazy, a tchotchke that suddenly speaks. Maybe there\u2019s some other explanation \u2014 a meteor, an aneurysm, a panic attack \u2014 but there\u2019s no avoiding it. The noise, the stranger, the Facebook add, whatever it is, it\u2019s insistent.And so our heroes acquiesce. Jaye on \u201cWonderfalls\u201d obeys the talking wax lion. Joan on \u201cJoan of Arcadia\u201d believes the strangers who tell her they\u2019re God in various forms are telling the truth. Eli of \u201cEli Stone\u201d decides his visions are a prophecy and he\u2019s going to be a better man. Erica on \u201cBeing Erica\u201d embraces her new therapist\u2019s odd technique of sending her back in time to right the wrongs of her past. Sam on \u201cReaper\u201d agrees to be a bounty hunter for Satan himself. Kevin on \u201cKevin (Probably) Saves the World\u201d sets out with his guardian angel to discover the lost righteous souls of this generation. George on \u201cDead Like Me\u201d decides to join the undead as a grim reaper.And now Miles of \u201cGod Friended Me\u201d accepts God\u2019s friend request.The weekly duties bind these shows together, but more essentially, these are all family shows. Each character has significant, though sometimes fraught, relationships with his or her siblings and parents, and there\u2019s a primal familial wound that remains unhealed \u2014 a death or catastrophic accident, or sometimes just a lie or a secret that\u2019s lingered without resolution.The bigger danger than hokiness or blandness is simple cancellation. The strange thing about the persistence of this genre is that these shows never find much of an audience. Of the ones mentioned here, only \u201cBeing Erica\u201d made it past Season 2 \u2014 and that was in Canada, so it was playing a different ratings game. Some of these, \u201cWonderfalls\u201d especially, are great shows, special shows, beautiful tender creatures. Almost all were too precious for this cruel and indifferent world. So precious in fact that many are not even available to stream. (The absence of \u201cWonderfalls\u201d and \u201cJoan of Arcadia\u201d from even a la carte streaming purchases is cultural cruelty.)So the fact that we keep making these shows is itself a curious act of faith, perhaps part of a desire to create tidy stories not devoted solely to murder. It doesn\u2019t help that these shows keep getting made in essentially the same ways, with the same weepy monologues and bottled up fear, the same frustrating jobs and the same kooky sidekicks who immediately get on board with the visions and the tasks. With the same love interests who can\u2019t be let in on the big secret, and the same dads who are loving in their gruff and broken ways. With the same family tensions that are so entrenched that sometimes it takes an act of God, or really an act of faith, to get everyone around a dinner table.When we watch cop shows, we know the cop wants to solve crimes. Doctors want to heal patients. But what do podcasters, or big-box store clerks, or temps, or souvenir-shop employees, or former finance bros want? They want the same thing those cops and doctors really want, too, what most of us want: purpose. We want to believe we matter, and that our decisions have some influence on the grander scale of wins and losses. Sure, we\u2019re all just killing time before the Sun eats the Earth, but if an estranged parent reconciles with their child, hasn\u2019t it all been worth it?Maybe. But where these shows struggle sometimes is with what they imply about celestial priorities. Perhaps the scale of suffering in our world wouldn\u2019t be quite so immense if God was less focused on podcasts or Joan\u2019s high school musical or Kevin\u2019s surly niece.It\u2019s one reason \u201cBeing Erica\u201d fared the best, both narratively and in terms of longevity, of all these shows: Because it was the most focused on its own main character and her personal development, without an attached direct theology. Erica is only ever tasked with fixing her own mistakes, not with establishing a reign of justice or preventing evil from further encroaching on our broken world. It\u2019s the \u201cthink globally, act locally\u201d of decency. Hey, it\u2019s a start.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Pinot Noir, Put Anderson Valley Among California\u2019s Best", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of the TimesTop producers have swarmed to the region in Mendocino to make restrained, nuanced wines. It\u2019s been some time since I last visited the Anderson Valley, a bucolic sliver of coastal Mendocino County, where Pacific fogs glide through the towering California redwoods, playing cat and mouse with the rising sun.The wines were often just as idiosyncratic, refusing to toe a line set by some other region or publication. The land and the climate were conducive to good pinot noir, and, by the early years of the 21st century, the valley had gained a reputation for a leaner, more balanced style than the powerful, jammy wines that were then fashionable.A lot has changed in the Anderson Valley in the last 15 years. The region caught the eye of successful producers in other parts of California, and they have flocked en masse. Some simply buy grapes and transport them back to their bases to make wines. Some have planted or bought vineyards, while a few have gone so far as to establish winemaking facilities here.A recent tasting of 20 Anderson Valley pinot noirs by the wine panel suggests that the region is one of California\u2019s most promising areas for the kind of restrained, savory, nuanced wines that until recently were in short supply in the state.The term terroir refers to the soil in which the vines grow, the climate and nuances of that site, its elevation and angle of exposition to the sun, along with the desires and intentions of the people farming the site and making the wine. That last element is the most powerful. It can permit a wine to express the character of a site, or it can overwhelm it.So terroir really refers to the potential of a place rather than its unwavering qualities.We all agreed that the Anderson Valley has great potential to make fine pinot noir in a precise, focused style. The best examples we found were harmonious and nuanced, with aromas and flavors of flowers, red fruits and earthy minerality. Many were moderate in alcohol as well. Among our top 10, only one, the 2015 Velvet Sisters Vineyards from Hartford Court, hit 14 percent. The others were largely below 13.5 percent, and six were under 13 percent. Not that alcohol levels are invariable indicators of style or quality, but they can be suggestive. In pinot noir particularly, alcohol levels rising above 14 percent can signal wines that may be thicker in texture and offer the impression of sweetness. We certainly found a few of those high-octane pinot noirs in our tasting, wines that were cloyingly sweet, jammy and rich. But those were the exceptions. Most of the wines were made with a much lighter touch. Beyond the clumsy few, what separated our top wines from those that did not make the cut was an extra dimension, a wrinkle or two that distinguished the intriguing from the serviceable. \u201cSome were light and bright, others deeper and darker,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI liked the balance of savory, herbal and mineral.\u201dWilliam noted that many had great acidity, which gave them freshness, and he felt that many of the wines were enjoyable with food, or on their own. Our No. 2 bottle was the lively, floral 2016 Filigreen Farm from Donkey & Goat, based in Berkeley. Jared and Tracey Brandt, another husband-and-wife team, are more likely to be making blends or wines from esoteric grapes than they are Anderson Valley pinot noir, but this one, their first pinot from Filigreen, is superb. The third of our top wines was the earthy, precise 2016 Savoy Vineyard from Peay, a family operation better known for wines from its Sonoma Coast estate. While pleasantly fruity, the Savoy had just enough alluring extra elements \u2014 an herbal edge, a touch of minerality \u2014 to make it interesting.The next rank included the homegrown 2015 Fog-Eater from Drew, bright, energetic and crunchy; and the lively, refreshing 2015 La Selva from Lioco, which is better known for its Sonoma wines, but seems to be making a greater commitment to the Anderson Valley. The Copain was followed by the subtle, complex 2016 Les Larmes from Littorai, which specializes in pinot noirs and chardonnays from the Sonoma Coast and Anderson Valley. Les Larmes is a blend from several different vineyards, and so something of a less expensive introduction to the single-vineyard wines more typical of Littorai.Next came the 2015 Hartford Court, a bigger wine than the others, with darker fruit flavors but well balanced nonetheless. Also keep in mind the 2016 Savoy Vineyard from Failla, softer textured and more straightforward than the Peay Savoy, and the 2015 Charles Vineyard from The Withers, a fresh, harmonious wine with flavors of sweet red fruit.It\u2019s no accident that so many of these producers are also making pinot noirs from the Sonoma Coast and, in the case of Ceritas, from the Santa Cruz Mountains.These regions, along with the Santa Rita Hills in Santa Barbara County, are the sources of California\u2019s finest pinot noirs. The Anderson Valley may wish by nature to stand apart, but it has taken its place among California\u2019s pinot noir elite.Focused, well-structured and refreshing, with aromas and flavors of flowers, red fruits and stony minerals.Fresh and lively, with earthy, floral aromas and flavors, as well as a touch of citrus.Earthy and precise, with flavors of herbs and red fruits.Bright and energetic, with crunchy flavors of herbs, red fruits and flowers.Lively and refreshing, with harmonious flavors of sweet red fruits and herbs.Well-balanced and energetic, with flavors of herbs and sweet-tart red fruits.Balanced and precise, with subtle flavors of red fruits, flowers and minerals.Earthy, complex flavors of dark fruit and herbs.Softly textured, with plenty of straightforward flavors of red fruits.Harmonious and fresh, with flavors of sweet red fruit.Advertisement"}

But the hurricane flooding in North Carolina has been terrible. Let\u2019s give it some serious thought right now.Particularly when it comes to ways the government screwed up. First lesson is easy. Coastal flooding is getting way, way worse because of global warming. So obviously we\u2019ve got to join other nations in combating this universally recognized threat.Hahahahaha.Maybe he\u2019ll evolve. After all, Trump does occasionally show some concern for nature. When he visited North Carolina on Wednesday, he particularly inquired about the well-being of the state\u2019s Lake Norman. (\u201cI love that area \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you why, but I love that area.\u201d)Well-informed observers did note that there happens to be a Trump golf club on Lake Norman\u2019s shores.The president came in for some criticism when, while distributing free hot dog lunches, he told one flood victim to \u201chave a good time.\u201d It is absolutely true that our commander in chief tends to babble. But in the grand scheme of things, this would seem to rank much lower as a problem than, say, ignoring the rising oceans and exploding weather systems.If we\u2019re not going to do anything to keep the waters from encroaching, the least the government can do is to stop developers from building housing on the growing flood plain.North Carolina seemed to be thinking along these lines when it commissioned experts to figure out how much the sea level was likely to rise over the next century. They concluded the water could go up by as much as 39 inches by 2100.Go, North Carolina!\u201c\u2026 and we blew it,\u201d he concluded.Whoops. State lawmakers basically ordered the government to ignore the study.Some North Carolina politicians are still struggling to get this right, and it would obviously be helpful if they got some encouragement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is supposed to be our go-to expert on climatic disaster. FEMA is also the place to look if you want to reform the federal flood insurance program, which is currently underwriting developments in the wrong places, water-wise.Maybe there should be a rule requiring that government officials who insist on bringing staffers home with them have to put their helpers up in the family guest room.Finally, we\u2019re getting to the moment \u2014 a high point in all stories about the environment in North Carolina \u2014 when we discuss the hog lagoons.Hog lagoons are basically huge bodies of pig poop. The waste is treated with bacteria that turns it pink. I flew over one of these suckers, and if you ever want to experience what it feels like to soar above what appears to be a large lake of strange-smelling Pepto-Bismol, this is the ticket.The good news on the hog-lagoon front (Did you ever think you\u2019d read a sentence starting with: \u201cThe good news on the hog-lagoon front\u201d?) is that North Carolina farmers, officials, and even some of the Big Pork corporations that created the whole system, have been working to get it under control.A lot more could probably be done faster if, say, the federal government put big money into closing down hog farms in flood plains. The farmers, you will be happy to hear, are pretty enthusiastic about getting compensation to transition into some new crop that does not create lakes of manure in their neighborhood.\u201cAs we look toward recovery, we look toward fully funding the lagoon buyout program,\u201d said Maggie Monast of the Environmental Defense Fund.God, will we never get a cabinet member who likes to take the occasional bus? Now Pruitt is gone and the E.P.A. is run by Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist who was also an aide to Senator James Inhofe, the biggest global warming denier in the history of the U.S. Congress.Not much to hope for there. How the hell do you get these people to focus on the environment, even if it\u2019s just for flood-prevention purposes? Maybe North Carolina could declare the entire state a Donald Trump golf course.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Hearing Is Stacked Against Christine Blasey Ford", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is almost unthinkable that there will be a second Supreme Court justice taking his seat under suspicions of perjury and sexual misconduct. Ms. Abramson is a former executive editor of The Times and author, with Jane Mayer, of \u201cStrange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas.\u201dThere is a reason Thursday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing will be short and feature only two witnesses, the Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford. Republicans have designed the hearing to end in a \u201che said, she said\u201d stalemate. No matter how credible Dr. Blasey is, isolating her as a lone accuser is the most effective political strategy for confirming Judge Kavanaugh.His strategy will be simple: categorical denial.Republicans will then be able to claim that fairness had been served because both witnesses were heard. But Americans, denied the testimony of other relevant witnesses who could support Dr. Blasey\u2019s account and denied an F.B.I. investigation into other evidence, won\u2019t be any closer to the truth.If the Judiciary Committee votes to confirm Judge Kavanaugh on Friday and the full Senate follows as early as this weekend, as some Republicans insist, there will be a furious backlash. The Supreme Court will be left under another cloud of possible perjury.And then there is Mark Judge, whom Dr. Blasey said participated with Judge Kavanaugh in the high school assault on her and whom Ms. Swetnick said helped him lure girls into \u201cside rooms\u201d at parties to be \u201cgang raped.\u201d The Judiciary Committee has refused to subpoena Mr. Judge, who reportedly was hiding out at a beach house on the Delaware shore.We\u2019ve seen this movie before. Back in 1991, during Clarence Thomas\u2019s confirmation hearing, there were other women who waited in airless witness rooms to testify in support of Anita Hill. They, too, were never called. Two other women were ready to testify that Judge Thomas had made inappropriate, sexualized comments to them in the office, incidents that were similar to the harassment that Ms. Hill had described in her opening statement. There were people willing to be called before the committee who would have testified under oath about Judge Thomas\u2019s interest in pornography, information that also would have buttressed Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony. But none were called.Instead, Senator Joe Biden, the Democratic committee chairman, fearing political backlash, abruptly gaveled the hearings to an end. Anita Hill remained isolated as the lone accuser.Clarence Thomas categorically denied her testimony and famously denounced the hearing as a \u201chigh-tech lynching.\u201d Just hours after the hearing ended, he was confirmed in a 52-to-48 vote, the closest vote ever for a successful Supreme Court nominee.I was in the Senate hearing room, bleary-eyed, when Senator Biden brought the curtain down on that travesty of a hearing. It was only in the wee morning hours that I learned that there was a second woman, Angela Wright, who had been ready to testify that Judge Thomas, in the office, had asked about the size of her breasts. Several senators told me years later, when I was reporting for a book, \u201cStrange Justice,\u201d that if Ms. Wright had been allowed to testify, Judge Thomas might not have been confirmed.At the time of the Hill-Thomas hearing, there was a lot more that was concealed from the public. There were four other women who would have supported aspects of Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony and four others who knew about Judge Thomas\u2019s interest in pornography. At least Hill was permitted to call as witnesses friends in whom she had confided about the sexual harassment she endured. Dr. Blasey won\u2019t have even that.After the curtain abruptly fell on the 1991 hearing, a confirmation vote was hurriedly scheduled. Now, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is trying to muscle through the same rushed vote. There was such nervousness in 1991 that more would come out about Judge Thomas after the confirmation vote that his swearing-in was also hastily moved up. Literally at the moment he became an associate justice, The Washington Post was preparing a story about his habitual use of pornography. (Ms. Hill had testified that the harassment she had endured involved him calling her into his office at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Education and describing pornographic films.)

The authors are 12th graders at Gann Academy in Waltham, Mass.WALTHAM, Mass. \u2014 Like most high school students, we have spent years studying American history \u2014 from the cultures of the Native Americans to the Revolutionary War, right up to the 21st century. Yet when we look closely at the story of who we are as a nation, we find little, if anything, about the history of people with disabilities.This is not surprising. The extent of what most Americans know about disability is limited \u2014 we see bright blue logos plastered on parking spaces or hear accounts of friends with challenges. We may know people with autism or dyslexia. We may see loved ones with permanent injuries or physical ailments. But for many, the understanding ends there.We now know a few things. And we believe informing the public about the history of people with disabilities is necessary. We also believe that a major step in doing that means having a national museum dedicated to disability history.This matters to us personally \u2014 many of our classmates, and some of us, identify as having a disability \u2014 and learning this history has given us perspective and a fuller sense of who we are as people and as citizens of the United States.Even experts on disability say they do not know the full story. When we spoke with Mr. Koch, he told us that there were moments when he thought to himself that as a young man, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know my own history.\u201dThat\u2019s why we are calling for a national museum, one that would be a hub of information for, by and about people with disabilities. It would bring all aspects of disability history together in one place and tell a cohesive story using artifacts, firsthand accounts, media and more. It would allow visitors to interact with the story and better understand what it means to be part of the disability community.Without a place like this, disability history in this country could be lost.This year, we studied an institution founded in Boston in 1848 originally called the Massachusetts School for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Youth \u2014 a name that could never be used today \u2014 and renamed the Walter E. Fernald Developmental Center. (We also learned about the use of respectful disability language and how that idea changed over time.) The school had one goal: teach students who were thought to be too cognitively or developmentally disabled to learn. It was the first public school of its kind in America. Despite its name, the school made some progress. Its base of special education techniques grew. The observations made in teaching the students there influenced education practices across the country. In 1887, the school moved to a larger campus. Then slowly, it became nightmarish, complete with abuse and experimentation on residents.The remains of the closed school are less than a mile from our own, but when we began our work, few students knew of it. Good and bad, the Walter E. Fernald Developmental Center is an important historical landmark, and it\u2019s only one of many such chapters in the history of disability that deserve a home. And in this case, many of the buildings on the campus could be repurposed to serve as a home for the museum.The authors are 12th graders at Gann Academy in Waltham, Mass.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Google\u2019s Turn in Washington\u2019s Glare", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Google executives, after months of mostly avoiding the harsh spotlight put on their internet peers, are being grilled in Washington this week by lawmakers questioning if the Silicon Valley giant is living up to its promise to be a neutral arbiter of online information.On Friday, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, will meet with Representative Kevin McCarthy, of California, the Republican House majority leader and a vocal critic of Google, and more than two dozen Republicans to discuss complaints the company is trying to silence conservative voices.\u201cGoogle has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior, and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a statement.The Friday meeting will cap a week of tech-related sessions in Washington in which Google \u2014 in the cross hairs of Silicon Valley\u2019s conservative critics since late summer \u2014 has played a starring role.At a gathering of the heads of the Justice Department and a dozen state attorneys general on Tuesday, Google was mentioned more than any other company when it came to concerns about antitrust enforcement and privacy practices, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity.At a Senate hearing discussing online privacy on Wednesday, Google\u2019s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, received the toughest and broadest array of questions from lawmakers who wanted to know about the company\u2019s consideration of introducing search services in China. Google says it is not close to starting such a service.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, also questioned Mr. Enright about claims of bias against conservatives in search results. \u201cI can tell you that millions of Texans believe Google is actively censoring the speech of conservatives,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.On Thursday, Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer and Republican Party official, is set to testify in the House about anti-conservative bias in tech. Ms. Dhillon represents several former employees in a lawsuit filed last year against Google that claims the company discriminated against them based on their political beliefs.Google executives did not attend the Senate hearing, though they were invited. The company offered to send Kent Walker, a senior vice president for global affairs who is also the company\u2019s top lawyer. But urged on by Facebook officials, according to two people familiar with the matter, senators insisted on a more powerful executive. Google refused.It was the \u201cworst business decision of 2018,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a founder of the business research firm Gartner L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business. \u201cIt feels like the tide has turned substantially,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cThey\u2019ve sort of poked the bear.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said officials from the company had testified before Congress 22 times since 2008. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to continue explaining our products and practices,\u201d Becca Rutkoff, the Google spokeswoman, said in a statement.For longtime Google critics and even some of its Silicon Valley peers, it is surprising that Google has avoided the spotlight for so long.It has 90 percent of the global search market \u2014 a share so high that it has for years had to sidestep concerns that it is a dominant monopoly that needs to be regulated. Competitors have long claimed that Google is using its search dominance to advantage its own services and should be controlled by antitrust laws.The Google-owned YouTube video service is also dominant, and has for several years faced questions about videos that show terrorist violence and disinformation, similar to issues that Facebook and Twitter have had to address in congressional hearings.Emails leaked last week showed lower-level Google employees discussing whether they could alter search results to counter President Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from predominantly Muslim countries. Google is adamant that no one in a position to make such a change seriously considered it.Employees are bracing for more embarrassing leaks. The company has long encouraged workers to speak their minds on internal message boards. That includes politics.The next day, the president posted a video that seemed to show that Google did not promote his State of the Union address on its home page as it had in the past for President Obama. He used the hashtag #StopTheBias. The video was incorrect. Google said that it didn\u2019t promote Mr. Obama\u2019s inaugural address, a joint statement to Congress but not technically a State of the Union address, in 2009 either.Shortly after, other Republicans were calling for regulations and greater scrutiny. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, called for antitrust regulators to reopen an investigation into Google.Some Google officials wonder if competitors are organizing a campaign to prompt regulatory scrutiny.At the Senate hearing Google did not attend, lawmakers mentioned a report that had come out a day before from the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit watchdog group that often publishes research critical of Google. The group posed as Russian trolls to buy what it called politically divisive ads on Google\u2019s systems, which failed to stop them.Google called the report \u201ca stunt\u201d by its rivals and blamed the software maker Oracle for its release. Ken Glueck, a senior vice president at Oracle, said it had made a one-time financial contribution in 2016 to the Campaign for Accountability but denied that the company had any involvement in the report.Google has many business opponents in Washington, including telecommunication giants like AT&T and Comcast. Oracle and News Corp. have put significant resources into funding third-party coalitions and public relations firms to place ads and to lobby lawmakers on Google\u2019s dominance in search and on allegations it uses its power to unfairly harm publishers and other tech rivals.But few companies have been as tenacious as Yelp, a midsize internet outfit with far fewer resources. It has waged a seven-year battle to get regulatory agencies around the world to investigate Google. Until recently, its calls have been largely ignored in the United States. The company claims Google prioritized its own reviews over others, making it much harder for competing reviews sites like Yelp to be discovered.Early in September, a White House official received an email with an attachment from Luther Lowe, the senior vice president for policy for Yelp.\u201cCheck out the attachment,\u201d Mr. Lowe wrote in an email. \u201cTell me what you think.\u201dThe attachment was a document called, \u201cExecutive Draft Order to Protect American Competition and Small Businesses From Bias in Online Platforms.\u201d It was a draft presidential order instructing antitrust officials to recommend ways to protect competition and clamp down on content bias on internet search and social media sites.Mr. Lowe said in an email that he did not know the origins of the document and that it had been forwarded to him.While there is no evidence that administration officials are seriously considering such a move, the document\u2019s existence made clear that Google\u2019s problems could get worse.\u201cAlthough the White House is concerned about the conduct of online platforms and their impact on society, this document is not the result of an official White House policymaking process,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, the deputy White House press secretary.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco and Cecilia Kang from Washington.

{"Headline": "Biography Is Not Enough, for John McCain or Anyone Else", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe senator\u2019s heroism should not blind us to his political failures.Mr. Buskirk is editor and publisher of the journal American Greatness and a contributing opinion writer.Biography does not predict success in office. It never has. And yet we\u2019re all drawn to it. We love personal stories of heroism, sacrifice, challenges overcome, outstanding virtue. That said, we should also recognize that a compelling back story may be necessary, but it is not a sufficient condition for political greatness. Which brings me to John McCain.The rationale behind his political career was always his personal story: son and grandson of admirals, Annapolis, naval aviator and finally long-term prisoner of war. Military service, especially under the extreme duress of combat and imprisonment, is certainly noble. But surely we can agree that not everyone who has sacrificed for his (or her) country would make a great statesman. Aristotle describes the primary virtue needed for statesmen as prudence, what might be better described as practical wisdom. Yet prudence is a word that has rarely, if ever, been invoked in relation to Senator McCain. What we heard instead were terms like maverick, honorable, heroic \u2014 and it\u2019s these charismatic qualities that afforded Mr. McCain a large degree of latitude when he chose to oppose his own party.Throughout Mr. McCain\u2019s long political career, he was the Republican most beloved by Democrats. The reason is simple: They often agreed, especially when it came to sticking a thumb in the eye of Republicans and undermining conservative priorities. His service to the country as an aviator and a prisoner of war deserves nothing but praise and commendation. Such devotion to the country cannot be emulated too often. But Mr. McCain\u2019s political legacy is more complicated. When discussing it, we must not conflate his military service or even his personal sacrifice with political wisdom or effectiveness. In fact, John McCain\u2019s career is an example of the danger of electing \u2014 and re-electing \u2014 politicians based on their personal story rather than on demonstrated political accomplishments. Throughout his political life Senator McCain either misunderstood or disagreed with the principles that animate the party whose members he relied upon for electoral success. He ended up staying in office with votes from a coalition of Republicans afraid that abandoning him would mean electing a Democrat and Democrats who saw him as an ally. I speak as a lifetime Arizona Republican who has heard fellow conservatives justify voting for Mr. McCain in just such terms for decades. His 2016 re-election is a case in point. To win his narrowest victory, he patched together 53.7 percent of the vote (down from 58.7 percent in 2010) by winning 16 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of independents.What I found truly objectionable was that legitimate criticism of Mr. McCain\u2019s politics and policies here in Arizona was countered by the reply that he was a war hero. While that should earn someone personal respect, even deference, it should not be used as a weapon to silence dissent. During his long political career, Mr. McCain maintained a very high profile as one of the most quoted Republican senators and most sought-after television guests. Yet he left virtually no legislative mark. The one major piece of legislation which he underwrote was the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill that, in directing money away from political parties and into independent expenditure groups, had precisely the opposite effect from what was intended. Likewise, he was a relentless proponent of military spending, but there is no significant national security legislation that exists because of Mr. McCain. Yet his fingerprints are clear on some signal Republican failures. This was often characterized as \u201cindependence.\u201dMr. McCain built a brand around being an un-Republican and the media lavished praise on him for that. He clearly relished the role of an outsider who would tell it like it is. But was that really who he was? Or was he just another senator with presidential aspirations and a flare for fraternal invective?Of course, Mr. McCain was not the first or the last politician to use his military service as a prophylactic against criticism. But that\u2019s dangerous. No politician should be beyond the reach of public criticism regardless of prior service to the country. The issues at stake are too important. What\u2019s worse is that this sense of invulnerability encourages the self-regard to which many politicians are already prone.Much responsibility lies with voters, who must not allow themselves to be hypnotized by a compelling biography. Mr. McCain was out of step with his Republican constituents on virtually every major issue of the past generation, including Obamacare, immigration and foreign policy, where Mr. McCain had long supported military intervention around the globe \u2014 a policy that has cost our nation dearly. In the senate, Mr. McCain was the Democrats\u2019 near-perfect instrument for hectoring Republicans. He relished his role as a gadfly, and Democrats were eager to encourage him because doing so made the Republican conference less united and less effective. Of course, the paeans to Mr. McCain ended briefly when he ran for president against Barack Obama.The formula was simple: when he was a foil against Senate Republicans, he was a straight-talking American hero; when he was running for president against Mr. Obama, he was a dangerous madman. It didn\u2019t help that his behavior in the 2008 election was quirky to the point of being erratic. Remember that at one point during the financial crisis he unilaterally suspended his campaign and flew back to Washington, and then began campaigning again a few days later having done nothing noteworthy. It demonstrated for the nation the sort of impulsiveness Arizonans had grown used to. It was supposed to be a grand gesture that demonstrated that he was above politics and therefore more worthy of the presidency than his opponent. It actually demonstrated self-indulgence and a lack of political maturity. As a result, when he faced Mr. Obama and his substantial political talents, he lost the Electoral College by 2 to 1.In some sense, McCain\u2019s biography \u2014 and the overheated rhetoric it encouraged in discussions of his political persona \u2014 deprived him of agency. He often seemed to be playing a role created for him by others. Even his work on campaign finance reform with Russ Feingold seemed to lack a guiding principle. It was more a form of penance for his implication in the pay-to-play Keating Five scandal. He became a symbol when what Arizona needed was a legislator.Part of Mr. McCain\u2019s legacy, which is yet to be fully understood, should serve as a warning to us. We can honor John McCain the man while having reservations about his political career. Among the things for which he will be remembered are his service to the country in the United States Navy, his advocacy for a strong military, his opposition to torture, the Keating Five scandal, two unsuccessful presidential runs, his yearslong feud with conservatives in his own party and the vote that killed Obamacare reform. It\u2019s a mixed bag. So let\u2019s honor the good and noble in Mr. McCain\u2019s life while not being afraid to be point out \u2014 and even carry on \u2014 legitimate political disagreements.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Should Match California\u2019s Effort to Slow Climate Change", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy pledging to cut its emissions in half by midcentury, China would propel itself into a world-leading role in the fight against global warming.Mr. Gillis and Mr. Harvey are writing a book on how to speed up the clean-energy transition.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At long last, a handful of political leaders are starting to set goals on greenhouse emissions that are consistent with the magnitude of the climate crisis.It is not clear how this goal can be met, and we will come back to that in a moment. But first, we offer a challenge: China should match California\u2019s initiative with a bold new target of its own.A zero-emissions goal by midcentury may be unrealistic for a fast-growing developing country, but China could shoot for a 50 to 60 percent reduction in emissions by then, to be followed by a goal of zero later in the century. This week, Governor Brown has been hosting a big climate-action meeting in San Francisco, with thousands attending. China sent the largest delegation of any country, highlighting its efforts to modernize its power grid, push electric cars and buses, and clean up the air pollution that chokes its cities.Both California and China have made historic progress. California already gets more than half its power from low-emission sources. The state long ago adopted one of the world\u2019s best building codes, so that every new house and office is highly efficient. Sales of electric cars are growing rapidly. California emissions have fallen below 1990 levels years earlier than expected, and the state is in the vanguard as emissions throughout the United States have begun to fall. The Chinese emissions story is more complicated. The country started the cleanup race with a filthy, inefficient power system based largely on coal; with massive, highly polluting basic industries; and with manufacturing techniques that consumed far more energy to do a given task than those in the industrialized West.About 15 years ago, China adopted energy-efficiency targets that cut the energy used per dollar of goods farther and faster than any nation ever has. China also invested heavily in wind and solar power, helping to drive the cost down drastically; in many places they have become the cheapest new sources of electricity. Thanks largely to that push, developing and developed nations alike are turning to clean power on a scale that was hard to imagine even a decade ago.Now, as China pushes electric vehicles to mass adoption, Western companies are straining to keep up. Shenzhen, a city of 12 million near Hong Kong, has 17,000 electric buses on the street. The entire taxi fleet will be electric by the end of the year, and its version of Uber is close behind.Despite all this, economic growth in China has been so strong that total greenhouse pollution is still growing, and partly because of that, so are global emissions. Globally, we have simply not made enough progress to put emissions on a downward slope. Until emissions get to zero, the climate problem will keep getting worse, so we have a long way to go. Governor Brown\u2019s new pledge is important not just because others may follow, but because the dynamic California economy can help invent much of the necessary technology. It is true that his zero-carbon goal for the state\u2019s economy is just an executive order and could be reversed. But in California, such newly announced goals from governors tend to be followed within a few years by legislation locking the targets into law.China\u2019s leaders have engaged in intensive dialogue with California on climate policy for more than a decade, and they consider the state\u2019s role to be more important than anything happening in Washington. That is fortunate, given the reprehensible efforts of the Trump administration to take America backward on climate.As we mentioned, it is not yet clear how a zero-carbon goal for an economy the size of California\u2019s can be met \u2014 especially in the time set by the governor, 27 years hence. Governor Brown leaves office at the beginning of next year, so he is making promises his successors will have to keep.What we do know is that California started setting climate goals during the administration of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican governor, and it has tended to meet or exceed them years early. Goals serve to organize the bureaucracy; they point up gaps in achievement that may need to be filled with detailed policies; they send a powerful signal to inventors that useful technologies or business concepts will find a market. For example, it was a California mandate, copied by other states, that pushed electric cars into the American marketplace.If China were to follow California\u2019s target in setting an ambitious low-emissions policy, the challenge would be enormous. How do you eliminate emissions from huge industries like steel making or aluminum smelting, or limit oil use in a country of 1.4 billion people pining for cars?Industrial techniques will need to be reinvented, and this work cannot drag out for decades. But that, in a sense, is the point. We are already seeing profound damages from global warming, and the situation is likely to worsen rapidly.The crisis is urgent; the time for half measures is past. Governor Brown has shown the world what really needs to be done. We hope other politicians will find the courage to follow in his footsteps, China\u2019s leaders above all.Advertisement"}

Living near a nature reserve, my front lawn was also on the menu, despite being slightly yellow and overgrown. I often woke in the morning to find it littered with small pellet souvenirs from the previous night\u2019s soiree.But then came the day when I found the same droppings on my back lawn, which was far lusher for being recently relaid. The furry little buggers had somehow cottoned on to the restaurant reserving the best food out back, and were undaunted by the need to hop down a driveway, across some paving, and even down some stairs in order to source it.I didn\u2019t think much of it until the morning when I woke to find a smoke gray joey pinballing around my backyard. It had somehow gotten lost from the mob when it had bounded back up to the mountain at dawn, or had decided to stay on for another course and was now unable to find its way home.Clearly terrified, the kicking joey needed to find an escape route fast before it injured itself. Calling a ranger would take too long, and I was in no position to try and catch it. Spying my fruit bowl, I grabbed an apple, cut it into pieces, and carefully laid an exit trail.

{"Headline": "Whose Religious Liberty Is It Anyway?", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt his confirmation hearings, Brett Kavanaugh said just what religious conservatives \u2014 and Christian nationalists \u2014 wanted to hear.Ms. Stewart is the author of \u201cThe Good News Club: The Christian Right\u2019s Stealth Assault on America\u2019s Children.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh, eager to signal his agreement with Mr. Cornyn, tossed back the catch phrase that Mr. Cornyn appeared to be fishing for: \u201creligious liberty.\u201dIf the Senate confirms Brett Kavanaugh, it will be declaring that the United States is a nation in which one brand of religion enjoys a place of privilege; that we are a nation of laws \u2014 except in cases where the law offends those who subscribe to our preferred religion; and that we recognize the dignity of all people unless they belong to specific groups our national religion views with disapproval.When a pharmacist refuses to fill a prescription on the basis of his own religious beliefs, according to today\u2019s Christian nationalists, that is a shining example of \u201creligious liberty.\u201d It is not. When a Catholic hospital delays or refuses to perform a legal and medically indicated procedure on a woman suffering a miscarriage on the grounds that the procedure violates its religious directives, that isn\u2019t religious liberty. When a private school that miseducates students with scientifically illiterate and historically inaccurate theories claims a public subsidy, or a Medicare-supported retirement home turns away a lesbian couple, that isn\u2019t religious liberty, either.Let\u2019s call it by its true name: religious privilege, not religious liberty. Today\u2019s Christian nationalists want the ability to override the law where it conflicts with their religious beliefs, and thus to withdraw from the social contract that binds the rest of us together as a nation.This kind of religious privilege has a history. In the Jim Crow south, for example, when black doctors and black patients were routinely shunted to inferior hospitals, many people justified the practice in terms of their sincerely held \u201cbiblical\u201d belief that God intended for the races to be forever separated.Religious privilege of this sort was never intended for all belief systems, but rather for one type of religion. Sure, its advocates will on occasion rope in representatives of non-Christian faiths to lend the illusion of principle to their cause. But the real aim and effect of the religious liberty movement is to advance their idea of religion at the expense of everyone else.If your religion or deeply held moral beliefs include the view that all people should be treated with equal dignity, then this religious liberty won\u2019t do anything for you. If you\u2019re a taxpayer who helps to fund your local hospital, a patient who keeps it in business, or a professional who works there, then your sincerely held religious and moral conviction that all people are entitled to equal access to the best medicine that science can provide and the law permits won\u2019t stand a chance against a Catholic bishop\u2019s conviction that some procedures are forbidden by a higher authority.Today\u2019s Christian nationalists will insist they are the only victims here. But that is as false as it is lacking in compassion. The terribly real effect of the kind of religious supremacy they seek is to target specific groups of people as legitimate objects of contempt. L.G.B.T. Americans, women and members of non-favored religions may be able to get the services they need from some other pharmacist or cake decorator or retirement home or emergency room \u2014 at least we have to hope so. But what they won\u2019t get back is the equal dignity to which they are entitled \u2014 and that\u2019s the point.All of these detestable initiatives, however, are really just a preview of the damage Brett Kavanaugh would be able to deliver from the Supreme Court.To understand the significance of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, you have to know something about how he got to this crowning point in his career. Judge Kavanaugh comes from a hothouse carefully tended by the ideologues of the Federalist Society and given the stamp of approval by Mr. Trump\u2019s court evangelicals and conservative Catholics. Having lost the so-called culture war on women\u2019s and L.G.B.T. rights among the general public, Christian nationalists understand that the only way for their regressive views to dominate is if they control the courts.The confirmation process brought to you by today\u2019s Republican Party only serves to confirm the antidemocratic nature of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment. Republicans defaulted on their Constitutional obligation to advise and consent on the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. But now they are aiming to push Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s through without anything close to a full revelation of his documentary trail.The part of the trail that is visible confirms that Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s theoconservative backers have chosen a candidate who will advance their agenda. There was a time when Thomas Jefferson\u2019s \u201cwall of separation between church and state\u201d was part of the furniture of American constitutional thought. Only a grumbling minority talked about tearing it down. But in a recent speech, Judge Kavanaugh seized on a dissenting opinion in which his judicial hero, Justice Rehnquist, argued that the wall metaphor was \u201cbased on bad history\u201d and \u201cuseless as a guide to judging.\u201dBut in Garza v. Hargan, he thought it was no real burden for a minor, pregnant and in federal custody, to be denied access to the abortion she desperately wanted in order for the government to search for a sponsor, rather than arrange for her medical treatment directly.In response to Mr. Cornyn, Judge Kavanaugh gave favorable mention to the Supreme Court decision in the Good News Club v. Milford Central School case. At one time, public elementary schools largely excluded these clubs in response to Establishment Clause concerns. The Good News decision required the schools to open their doors to evangelical clubs, which gives young children the false but unavoidable impression that their school endorses one religion above all others.Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s disdain for the separation of church and state will matter in decisions that go well beyond the usual battlegrounds in the culture war. He has expressed enthusiastic support for school voucher programs, for example, which are ways of pretending to reform education while funneling money from the public purse to religious organizations.There is another vision of America, one where we come together as a people to solve as many of the problems that we face as we can. In an America that must still exist somewhere in our collective imagination, no group of individuals is singled out to be stripped of their dignity. In this America, we treat everybody equally under the law and we expect everyone to follow it. Citizens are free to exercise their religion, but not to impose it on other people or to fund it at public expense. The choice before the Senate is whether we continue to advance this vision of an open and tolerant America or stamp this low moment in our political history on the highest court of the land.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook and Twitter Have a Message for Lawmakers: We\u2019re Trying", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For months, Facebook, Twitter and Google have grappled with criticism over the misuse of their services by foreign operatives and the disproportionate influence their platforms have over people\u2019s thinking.\u201cWe were too slow to spot this and too slow to act. That\u2019s on us,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said in prepared testimony that was reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better at finding and combating our adversaries, from financially motivated troll farms to sophisticated military intelligence operations.\u201dThe two executives, who will be making their first appearances before Congress, are expected to face tough queries on Wednesday morning at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about foreign manipulation of social media sites. Mr. Dorsey will then appear alone in the afternoon at a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing about content moderation on the sites.Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had also invited Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, to testify on Wednesday. But the company declined to send Mr. Page and instead submitted written testimony from Kent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president for global affairs.In a blog post on Tuesday, Mr. Walker tried to distinguish Google from Facebook and Twitter as less problematic and vulnerable to foreign meddling.The appearances of Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey in Washington mark the third time in less than a year that top social media executives from Silicon Valley have come to Capitol Hill to defend their companies.Since then, Facebook, Google and Twitter have tried to demonstrate their efforts to fight misinformation and foreign influence by hiring thousands of content moderators, as well as developing tools with artificial intelligence and other technologies to more quickly identify and root out fake accounts and foreign-backed influence campaigns.\u201cWhen we find bad actors, we will block them,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said in her prepared testimony. \u201cWhen we find content that violates our policies, we will take it down. And when our attackers use new techniques, we\u2019ll share them to improve our collective defense.\u201dThe testimonies of Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey are expected to draw wide interest, just as Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance before Congress was considered must-see TV by tech industry officials, regulators and others.Ms. Sandberg is a veteran of Washington politics. She was the chief of staff to the former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers during the Clinton administration, and now oversees policy for Facebook, among other things.Both executives have been preparing for the hearings for several weeks. They each have been coached by company lawyers and Facebook and Twitter\u2019s Washington policy staffs on what questions specific lawmakers may ask and which ones may use the hearings to level new accusations or threats of regulations, according to people involved in the preparations, who were not authorized to talk publicly. Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey have been advised to appear contrite, to be direct with their responses and to be patient if interrupted, the people said.Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey met with several lawmakers on Tuesday, ahead of the hearings. Both met with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, including Mr. Burr, as well as Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, according to committee aides.The Senate hearing wasn\u2019t expected to yield many new revelations on foreign interference, and some lawmakers were expected to veer into other topics. Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, would most likely raise concerns of content biases by social media sites that stifle conservative views, according to committee aides. And Mr. Wyden was expected to focus on online privacy and the potential need for regulations.In particular, lawmakers may press the executives on how vulnerable their sites are ahead of the midterms.The companies also plan to highlight a gap between themselves and law enforcement officials on battling foreign meddling.\u201cOur understanding of overall Russian activity in 2016 is limited because we do not have access to the information or investigative tools that the U.S. government and this Committee have,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said in her written remarks.Though Google won\u2019t have an executive present, lawmakers, including Mr. Warner, were expected to criticize the company for declining an invitation to testify.And Mr. Dorsey, in his marathon day of hearings, will seek to quash the growing accusations that his company suppresses conservative views.In recent months, Mr. Dorsey has met privately with Republican and Democratic politicians and pundits. Last month, before agreeing to testify in the House hearing, he had a call with the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, and the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, to allay their fears of anti-conservative bias on the site.The lawmakers still threatened to subpoena Mr. Dorsey if he didn\u2019t agree to testify.Cecilia Kang and Sheera Frenkel reported from Washington. Kate Conger contributed reporting from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Low-Dose Aspirin Late in Life? Healthy People May Not Need It", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShould older people in good health start taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks, strokes, dementia and cancer?No, according to a study of more than 19,000 people, including whites 70 and older, and blacks and Hispanics 65 and older. They took low-dose aspirin \u2014 100 milligrams \u2014 or a placebo every day for a median of 4.7 years. Aspirin did not help them \u2014 and may have done harm.The news may also come as a shock to millions of people who have been dutifully swallowing their daily pills like a magic potion to ward off all manner of ills. Although there is good evidence that aspirin can help people who have already had heart attacks or strokes, or who have a high risk that they will occur, the drug\u2019s value is actually not so clear for people with less risk, especially older ones.The newest findings apply only to people just like those in the study: in the same age ranges, and with no history of dementia, physical disability, heart attacks or strokes. (Blacks and Hispanics were included in the study at a younger age than whites because they have higher risks than do whites for dementia and cardiovascular disease.) In addition, most did not take aspirin regularly before entering the study.The message for the public is that healthy older people should not begin taking aspirin.\u201cIf you don\u2019t need it, don\u2019t start it,\u201d Dr. McNeil said.But those who have already been using it regularly should not quit based on these findings, he said, recommending that they talk to their doctors first.Dr. McNeil also emphasized that the new findings do not apply to people who have already had heart attacks or strokes, which usually involve blood clots. Those patients need aspirin, because it inhibits clotting.The study, named Aspree, is important because it addresses the unanswered question of whether healthy older people should take aspirin, said Dr. Dr. Evan Hadley, director of the division of geriatrics and gerontology at the National Institute on Aging, which helped pay for the research. The National Cancer Institute, Monash University and the Australian government also paid. Bayer provided aspirin and placebos, but had no other role.\u201cFor healthy older people, there\u2019s still a good reason to talk to their doctors about what these findings mean for them individually,\u201d Dr. Hadley said. \u201cThis is the average for a large group. A doctor can help sort out how it applies individually. It\u2019s especially important for people already taking aspirin who are over 70. The study didn\u2019t include many people who had been taking it, and doesn\u2019t address the question of continuing versus stopping.\u201dFor people 60 to 69 with the same risk level, the guidelines say it should be an individual decision whether to take aspirin.But for people 70 and over, the guidelines say there\u2019s not enough evidence to make any recommendation.Aspree was designed to fill the information gap for older people.Rather than looking only at individual ailments, the study also tried to evaluate aspirin\u2019s effect on \u201cdisability-free survival,\u201d meaning whether it could help older people prolong the time in which they remain healthy and independent.\u201cPreventive medicine is focusing on older people, how to keep them out of nursing homes, alive and healthy,\u201d Dr. McNeil said. \u201dWhy would an elderly person be taking a drug if it doesn\u2019t keep them alive and healthy any longer? A lot of the previous studies have looked at aspirin and heart disease. But a lot of drugs do good things and bad things. Just looking at one doesn\u2019t seem to be enough.\u201dThe study enrolled 16,703 people from Australia, and 2,411 from the United States, starting in 2010. They were assigned at random to take low-dose aspirin (100 milligrams a day) or a placebo. That is slightly more than the widely sold dose that most people take, 81 milligrams.With a median follow-up of 4.7 years, the two groups had no significant difference in their rates of dementia, physical disability or cardiovascular problems.But those on aspirin were more likely to have serious bleeding \u2014 it occurred in 3.8 percent, as opposed to 2.7 percent in the placebo group.The death rates also differed: 5.9 percent in the aspirin group, and 5.2 percent in those taking placebos. Much of the difference was the results of a higher rate of cancer deaths.Dr. McNeil said his team could not explain the apparent increase in cancer deaths. They wondered if excess bleeding might have contributed to deaths in cancer patients, but did not find evidence of it. They will continue to follow the participants, and to study tissue samples from cancer patients who died.Although it may seem counterintuitive, he said the cancer finding does not rule out the possibility that aspirin can help prevent colorectal malignancies. The protective effect may not show up until people have been taking aspirin for some time, longer than the average follow-up in the study.Dr. McNeil, 71, does not take aspirin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "No More Grandstanding. Ask Kavanaugh Better Questions.", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJustices often do not perform the way partisans and the news media expect them to.Mr. Schuck is an emeritus professor of law at Yale.Commentary on Supreme Court nominations these days is more akin to sportscasters announcing a close baseball game: \u201cThe liberals and conservatives are tied going into the bottom of the ninth. Brett Kavanaugh, a promising rookie pitcher with a strong minor league record, is coming in to replace the streaky Anthony Kennedy. When Kennedy was hot, the conservatives won, but when he slumped, the liberals could squeeze by. Kavanaugh seems a lot steadier than Kennedy.\u201dThis way of handicapping Supreme Court nominees has a definite allure. We all love a horse race, and politics often seems like one. But for court nominations, sports analogies are dangerously misleading. It is true that knowing the party of the president and the nominee provides a strong indication of how the nominee will later vote in cases of sharp partisan differences on the underlying policy issue \u2014 for example, the recent Janus v. Afscme decision barring a union from imposing agency fees on nonmembers. But in 75 percent of cases, partisan affiliation is not fully predictive of justices\u2019 votes. In the hardest ones, lower courts reached different results despite seeing the same evidence, and considering the same legal arguments. This week, senators should spend less time grandstanding with questions that simply highlight Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s well-known ideological positions, and a lot more time trying to assess how he would vote in these much trickier cases.What accounts for these \u201ccircuit splits\u201d? In hard cases, excellent legal arguments (not just ideological ones) can be made on both sides, often because the relevant legal principles are unclear or conflicting. Also, judges (and administrative agencies initially) can reasonably interpret the key facts differently. The competing values (there may be more than two) may be compelling. Most justices care about a decision\u2019s legal and social consequences, yet in hard cases these effects may be opaque and unpredictable \u2014 perhaps because they depend on what the states decide to do. In some hard cases \u2014 Brown v. Board of Education or same-sex marriage, for example \u2014 the legal and social landscape may have shifted so much that even conservative justices, who normally resist \u201cliving Constitution\u201d arguments, may take these changes into account. In clashes between national security and individual rights claims (e.g., the recent travel ban decision), even liberal justices may defer to the government\u2019s judgment. And it is hard to predict how courts will apply the multiple criteria \u2014 what Judge Kavanaugh referred to in his testimony this week as \u201cprecedents on precedents\u201d \u2014 for deciding when precedents may be overturned. This is why even some conservative justices may resist overturning Roe v. Wade. (They may try to eviscerate it in other ways, of course.) And, of course, even on the Supreme Court, politics has a way of trumping ideology in unpredictable ways. Who would have expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would seek out a way to rescue the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius?Media and politicians have traditionally tended to ignore these complexities, preferring to depict a Manichaean liberal/conservative battle for legal supremacy. This perverse ideological focus hides or denies the fascinating interplay among legal doctrine, textual interpretation and the factual record in determining outcomes. It also crowds out the more revealing lawyerly divisions among the justices about what should matter in resolving hard cases \u2014 for example, the relative importance of national uniformity versus local diversity, of clear rules versus more contextual standards, of government authority versus individual rights, of deference to elected officials versus bureaucratic expertise, of the default rules for interpreting ambiguous language, and so forth. Ideological labels are even misleading in their own terms. Real judges (like real people) mix liberalism on some issues with conservatism on others. For example, even the arch-conservative Antonin Scalia voted with liberals to uphold punitive jury awards against product manufacturers, adopting the position advocated by the trial lawyers (a leading Democratic lobby), because he thought the Constitution permits such awards. The labels also reveal little about what should be our real concerns: the mix of values underlying them. For example, is a \u201claw-and-order conservative\u201d callous toward the life challenges faced by poor people, or instead sensitive to the depredations that crime inflicts on their communities? Is race-based affirmative action a policy that levels the playing field for all or instead one that advantages some minorities over others? None of this means that partisan decision patterns don\u2019t exist. But it does argue for a more nuanced view of a nominee, one that includes factors beyond partisanship.Once confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh will enjoy total independence from any president. Had a \u201cnormal\u201d president nominated him rather than a bizarre, lawless one, this nomination would be no more controversial than, say, Elena Kagan\u2019s \u2014 another superbly qualified choice. Unless the Democrats come up with something disqualifying, he should be confirmed. Peter H.

While the chief executive often takes to his personal Facebook page to write short notes about the company, he said this month that he would publish pieces looking more in depth at issues facing it, starting with a post about securing elections worldwide.Facebook faces several coming tests of whether it can detect and stop election interference: The company is being scrutinized for its role in Brazil\u2019s presidential election next month, and the November midterm elections in the United States are fast approaching.Since November 2016, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s outward stance has shifted from being defensive and evasive to taking more responsibility for Facebook\u2019s role and influence in the world.As he has shifted, the company has rolled out tools and policies to clamp down on disinformation and interference.The efforts range from using automated programs to find and remove fake accounts, to featuring Facebook pages that spread disinformation less prominently so that fewer people potentially see them. Mr. Zuckerberg wrote that Facebook was also well on its way toward hiring 10,000 additional people to work on safety and security issues, as well as improving coordination with law enforcement and other companies over suspicious activity.But Mr. Zuckerberg also framed Facebook\u2019s actions as part of a continuing digital information war, an \u201carms race\u201d against those who invest in ways to sow havoc across the social network of 2.2 billion regular visitors.\u201cWhile we\u2019ve made steady progress, we face sophisticated, well-funded adversaries,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in the post. \u201cThey won\u2019t give up, and they will keep evolving. We need to constantly improve and stay one step ahead.\u201dOne of Facebook\u2019s toughest challenges has been navigating how to handle coordinated misinformation campaigns without becoming an arbiter of truth. The company has taken pains not to appear biased toward one side of the political spectrum or the other.Perhaps the strongest message of Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s memo is that it is not just up to Facebook to fight back. Many disinformation campaigns occur across social media platforms \u2014 Twitter, Reddit, Instagram and others \u2014 and Mr. Zuckerberg said companies needed to get better at sharing information to understand the scope of attacks.\u201cThe last point I\u2019ll make is that we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d he wrote in his blog post. \u201cThe definition of success is that we stop cyberattacks and coordinated information operations before they can cause harm. While I\u2019d always rather Facebook identified abuse first, that won\u2019t always be possible.\u201d\u201cWe will all need to continue improving and working together to stay ahead and protect our democracy,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China\u2019s Leaders Confront an Unlikely Foe: Ardent Young Communists", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUIZHOU, China \u2014 They were exactly what China\u2019s best universities were supposed to produce: young men and women steeped in the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party.They read Marx, Lenin and Mao and formed student groups to discuss the progress of socialism. They investigated the treatment of the campus proletariat, including janitors, cooks and construction workers. They volunteered to help struggling rural families and dutifully recited the slogans of President Xi Jinping.Then, after graduation, they attempted to put the party\u2019s stated ideals into action, converging from across China last month on Huizhou, a city in the south, to organize labor unions at nearby factories and stage protests demanding greater protections for workers.That\u2019s when the party realized it had a problem.The authorities moved quickly to crush the efforts of the young activists, detaining several dozen of them and scrubbing the internet of their calls for justice \u2014 but not before their example became a rallying cry for young people across the country unhappy with growing inequality, corruption and materialism in Chinese society.\u201cYou are the backbone of the working class!\u201d the protesters chanted at one rally, addressing workers at an equipment factory. \u201cWe share your honor and your disgrace!\u201dIn the decades since that massacre, university students have generally helped advance the party\u2019s economic and political agenda, focusing on jobs, homes and other aspects of material well-being while supporting authoritarian rule, or at least eschewing politics. As economic growth has slowed, party officials have grown more nervous about Western influences on the nation\u2019s youth, who are more worldly and digitally connected than ever before.But the Huizhou activists represent a threat the authorities did not expect.Carrying portraits of Mao and singing socialist anthems, they espoused the very ideals that the government fed them for years in mandatory ideological classes, voicing grievances about issues like poverty, worker rights and gender equality \u2014 some of communism\u2019s core concerns.\u201cWhat we are doing is entirely legal and reasonable,\u201d said Chen Kexin, a senior at Renmin University in Beijing who took part in the protests. \u201cWe are Marxists. We praise socialism. We stand with workers. The authorities can\u2019t target us.\u201dOn Aug. 24, the police raided the apartment the young activists and workers were sharing in Huizhou, crushing their campaign for workers\u2019 rights.But they have. On the morning of Aug. 24, police officers wearing riot gear raided the four-bedroom apartment the activists were renting in Huizhou and detained about 50 people. As the police burst through the door, the activists held hands and sang \u201cL\u2019Internationale.\u201dBut some in the party seem uneasy about the proliferation of student groups devoted to Marxism and Maoism, apparently worried that their calls for greater economic equality and worker rights could undermine China\u2019s modern-day embrace of capitalist markets.While only a small minority of students are involved, they represent a leftist critique of Chinese society that seems to be gaining traction on college campuses, partly because the authorities have been more hesitant to suppress it than other political discussion.On the Chinese internet, thousands of young people participate in vibrant Maoist and Marxist chat rooms, and some have started leftist news websites, posting commentary on topics like pollution, globalization and economic theory, without much interference by censors, until recently.Younger Chinese are often described as apathetic, selfish and obsessed with money. But Eric Fish, a writer who has studied Chinese millennials, said that the generation born after the Tiananmen Square massacre lacks the instinctive fear of authority of older generations.\u201cThey\u2019re more willing to go out on the street and stick their necks out,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is not as much appreciation for what could go wrong.\u201dThe dispute in Huizhou began in July, after Jasic Technology, a manufacturer of welding equipment, prevented its workers from forming an independent union. China allows labor organizing only under the auspices of the official, party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions.The workers said managers had seized control of their branch of the official union. Complaining of being underpaid and treated like slaves, they began to organize a petition before the police intervened and detained several of them.The young activists learned of the workers\u2019 plight on internet messaging apps and took up their cause, with about 40 students and recent graduates going to Huizhou, a manufacturing hub of 4.8 million people in Guangdong Province. Hundreds of others spoke out in support online \u2014 so many that several universities warned students not to go to Huizhou.\u201cI could not sit still,\u201d Yue Xin, a recent graduate of Peking University who majored in foreign languages, said in an interview before she was detained. \u201cI could not let myself be a mere internet commentator. I had to stand up.\u201dZhang Shengye, 21, who graduated in June from Peking University with a degree in pharmacology, said he was inspired to join the protests by his family\u2019s own struggles. His father, a sailor, was laid off from a state-owned firm during a wave of privatization in the 1990s, an experience Mr. Zhang described as a \u201cfinancial and emotional apocalypse.\u201dBut it was in college that he decided to answer Marx\u2019s call to \u201cwork for mankind,\u201d he said. Frustrated by the low wages and poor treatment of workers on campus, he and 60 other students, calling themselves the Marxist Research Association, published a report documenting labor violations.\u201cWe share a very simple sympathy for workers and the aspiration of a better future for communism,\u201d he said.In Huizhou, the young activists called each other \u201ccomrade\u201d and wore T-shirts with images of clenched fists and the slogan, \u201cUnity is strength.\u201d They marched alongside workers, holding banners that declared, \u201cForming unions is not a crime.\u201d They staged re-enactments of the abuse the workers said they endured at the factory.The young protesters insist that they are good communists who support President Xi.She added that the campaign in Huizhou had its roots not in foreign ideas, but in the May Fourth Movement of 1919, a student-led uprising in China that the party considers a precursor to the Communist Revolution.Friends are also worried about Shen Mengyu, one of the first students to call attention to the workers\u2019 campaign. She was held by security officials at a hotel and is now under surveillance at her parents\u2019 home, activists said.Several workers at the equipment factory have also been formally arrested and charged with disturbing social order. Huang Lanfeng, whose husband, Yu Juncong, was among those detained, said the government was unfairly punishing workers while ignoring factory abuses.\u201cWe will never give up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe swear to fight the evil forces until the end.\u201dAs the school year began, the activists vowed to press their campaign. Mr. Zhang and others staged a rally in Mao\u2019s hometown, Shaoshan, on the 42nd anniversary of the Chinese leader\u2019s death this month, and called on the government to release their friends. The police broke up the protest and briefly detained Mr. Zhang, who was also held and released after the Aug. 24 raid.Mr. Zhang has circulated a petition calling on the party to punish local officials. He wrote:\u201cWe are here because we are deeply aware that what we do is legal and just.\u201cWe are here because we want to repay the workers with what we have learned for so many years.\u201cWe are here because we don\u2019t want to believe that dark forces can laugh malignantly in the world we inhabit.\u201dZoe Mou and Echo Hui contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Battle Plan for a War on Rare Diseases", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bya Conversation With...Dr. Matthew Might is developing a strategy for people seeking treatments for little-known ailments.A decade ago, when their son Bertrand was still an infant, Matthew Might and his wife, Cristina, realized that there was something terribly wrong.When he cried, his eyes stayed dry; the lack of tears damaged his corneas and threatened blindness. Eventually, he suffered seizures, a movement disorder and a severe developmental delay. It took four years to discover the problem: Bertrand had inherited two mutations of the NGLY1 gene, which plays a key role in recycling cellular waste. That meant the child\u2019s cells were choking on their own trash.Eventually Dr. Might found about 60 other people with this mutation. He found a treatment for the condition \u2014 an unintended side effect of the over-the-counter antacid Prevacid \u2014 and started working with a company to produce a stronger version of the drug. Now director of the Hugh Kaul Precision Medicine Institute at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, he\u2019s begun to create a road map for other families facing rare diseases \u2014 as much as 10 percent of the population, or 30 million Americans. The Times spoke with Dr. Might about the challenges of finding treatments for these diseases and about the Mights\u2019s experiences with their son. The conversation below has been edited and condensed for space and clarity. In every case we\u2019ve tried so far, we\u2019ve found something. We\u2019re just finding existing drugs that already work. Repurposing is a key step in addressing rare diseases and avoiding the huge costs that come with novel drug development. What you really want to do is test all the approved drugs that are out there. Ion channel-driven epilepsies \u2014 epilepsies where there\u2019s a clear electrophysiological origin. These kind of occupy a sweet spot where it comes to finding treatments. They\u2019re kind of accessible with drugs. Many approved molecules will hit them incidentally, even though that\u2019s not what they\u2019re trying to do. You do have large classes of diseases where it\u2019s not that simple. You can\u2019t directly target the root cause.  Personalized or precision medicine is absolutely the future \u2014 not just because it\u2019s better care, but long-term, it will also reduce cost. Ultimately, by delivering the right drug to the right patient at the right time, it\u2019ll get cheaper, too.I think we are at an inflection point. The costs have come down to the point where it\u2019s reasonable to start to do this for basically everybody. A pharmacogenetic panel that will tell you your response essentially to every drug on the market costs on the order of $300. And you\u2019ll have that data for the lifetime of the patient. We\u2019ll sequence everybody at birth at some point.Right now there\u2019s a gap between diagnostics and therapeutics. Genetics has gotten really good at telling patients what they have, but not what to do next.That\u2019s really the goal of my life right now: to systematize the entire process of finding treatments, so it\u2019s less art and more focused science. One of the things I\u2019m building as part of my institute at U.A.B. is the infrastructure necessary to take a patient from diagnosis to a therapy. This is uncharted territory for physicians. They\u2019re not used to saying, \u201cWhat you need to do next is a science experiment.\u201d But for many of these rare diseases, that\u2019s exactly what you have to do.We craft a research plan for them and say, \u201cThis is the way you need to go,\u201d and even connect them with the right researchers to make that next step.As you network these companies and institutions together, it\u2019s suddenly changing drug development from this insurmountable process into something that\u2019s actually quite achievable for individual patients or patient foundations.I\u2019ve seen companies get involved in shockingly small diseases. Patient foundations have a major role to play in \u201cde-risking\u201d the science around therapeutic development. If they \u201cde-risk\u201d it enough, companies will jump in. For all 7,000 now, and however many more remain to be found. Whether it\u2019s realistic or not, it\u2019s a moral imperative that we do it. So, we\u2019ll do it one at a time. I\u2019ve learned it\u2019s not so helpful to focus on what\u2019s possible or realistic anymore. Just focus on the next step, keep taking next steps, and see how far you can go.  He\u2019s very happy. He\u2019s definitely got some severe developmental problems that will be difficult to correct. If we\u2019d intervened earlier, he might be better off now.

It's not.Opinion ColumnistTen years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the official economic statistics \u2014 the ones that fill news stories, television shows and presidential tweets \u2014 say that the American economy is fully recovered.Look around, and you can see the lingering effects of the financial crisis just about everywhere \u2014 everywhere, that is, except in the most commonly cited economic statistics. So who are you going to believe: those statistics, or your own eyes?[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]Over the course of history, financial crises \u2014 and the long downturns that follow \u2014 have reordered American society in all sorts of ways. One of those ways happens to involve the statistics that the government collects. Crises have often highlighted the need for new measures of human well-being.Almost a century later, it is time for a new set of statistics. It\u2019s time for measures that do a better job of capturing the realities of modern American life.As a technical matter, the current batch of official numbers are perfectly accurate. They also describe some real and important aspects of the American economy. The trouble is that a handful of statistics dominate the public conversation about the economy despite the fact that they provide a misleading portrait of people\u2019s lives. Even worse, the statistics have become more misleading over time.The stock market, for example, has completely recovered from the financial crisis, and then some. Stocks are now worth almost 60 percent more than when the crisis began in 2007, according to a inflation-adjusted measure from Moody\u2019s Analytics. But wealthy households own the bulk of stocks. Most Americans are much more dependent on their houses. That\u2019s why the net worth of the median household is still about 20 percent lower than it was in early 2007. When television commentators drone on about the Dow, they\u2019re not talking about a good measure of most people\u2019s wealth.All the while, the federal government and much of the news media continue to act as if the same economic measures that made sense decades ago still make sense today. Habit comes before accuracy.And there is no reason that data reform needs to be limited to G.D.P. The Labor Department could change the monthly jobs report to give more attention to other unemployment numbers. It could also provide more data on wages, rather than only broad averages. The Federal Reserve, for its part, could publish quarterly estimates of household wealth by economic class.\u201cAs someone who advises policymakers, I can tell you there is often this shock: \u2018The economy is growing. Why aren\u2019t people feeling it,\u2019\u201d Boushey says. \u201cThe answer is: Because they literally aren\u2019t feeling it.\u201d She argues \u2014 rightly, I think \u2014 that the government should not focus on creating wholly new statistics. It should instead change and expand the ones that are already followed closely. Doing so could force the media and policymakers to talk about economic well-being at the same time that they are talking about economic indicators.It\u2019s worth remembering that the current indicators are not a naturally occurring phenomenon. They are political creations, with the flaws, limitations and choices that politics usually involves.Several years later, he received a promotion. He was named the first head of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, a job he would hold for 20 years. His original methods from Massachusetts influenced the way that the federal government began calculating unemployment data, and still do to this day. The fact that the official rate ignores millions of discouraged workers is \u2014 although Wright wouldn\u2019t have used this phrase \u2014 a feature not a bug.The whole point of statistics is to describe reality. When a statistic no longer does so, it\u2019s time to find a new one \u2014 not to come up with a convoluted rationale that tries to twist reality to fit the statistic.After all these years, though, we haven\u2019t solved the problem. Maybe it takes a financial crisis to do so.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2-Second Rule for Distracted Driving Can Mean Life or Death", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe large rubber strip that I was speeding toward on the Ventura Freeway near Los Angeles looked easy enough to avoid. I swerved, but not enough.That strip was actually metal, however, and it ripped through my right front tire, which went spinning across four lanes of the freeway. Moments later, I was driving 80 miles an hour with one bare metal wheel, sparks flying. I pulled onto a median to await a tow truck, worried for our safety as cars screamed past.I had been looking at my wife for about four seconds before glancing back at the road. Had I just become a victim of distracted driving? The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration would probably say yes.Drivers should never take their eyes off the road for more than two seconds at a time, the agency says. The Auto Alliance, a manufacturers\u2019 trade group, agrees. \u201cThe odds of a crash double if your eyes are off the road for more than two seconds,\u201d said Wade Newton, a spokesman.Just two seconds can be the life-or-death difference between hitting that metal strip, or a deer, and avoiding it. In 2016, more than 9 percent of United States traffic deaths \u2014 or 3,450 \u2014 were linked to distracted driving. With these facts in mind, the government, automakers and tech companies are dreaming up new ways to keep drivers\u2019 eyes on the road, at a time when there are more opportunities for distraction than ever.One thing that does not work is an appeal to common sense. Asking people to just say no to their gadgets and social media feeds cannot overcome the temptation to check on them, even while behind the wheel.Which is why many states now forbid the use of devices if they need to be held, unless they\u2019re connected through the vehicle\u2019s built-in screen or can be operated with voice commands. But even that may not be enough. \u201cLaws against distracted driving do not reduce crashes,\u201d said Jessica Cicchino, a vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.Instead, N.H.T.S.A. and the Auto Alliance have come up with a set of voluntary design guidelines to limit distractions and make driving safer.Under these guidelines, makers are encouraged to design screens that do not obstruct the driver\u2019s field of view, use internationally recognized icons and symbols, allow the driver to control the pace of input, and disable information not pertinent to driving when in motion.Given that they\u2019re suggestions, their use varies. Volkswagens lock out navigation input using the touch screen when the vehicle is in motion, while some Audis don\u2019t. A list of favorite radio stations disappears from the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\u2019s screen after a few seconds, before the driver may have had a chance to choose. And some vehicles position digital displays above the standard dashboard.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing things that N.H.T.S.A. says not to use while driving, being used,\u201d said Jake Nelson, director of traffic safety advocacy and research at AAA, the auto association. \u201cAutomakers are making it really easy for drivers to do multiple things.\u201dMr. Nelson added, \u201cPeople are accessing Facebook while they\u2019re driving. We\u2019ve seen the biggest increase in fatal crashes in the last 50 years, with more pedestrian and cyclist deaths.\u201dRather than try to stop distracted driving behavior, manufacturers are offering technological solutions to hopefully lessen the distractions.They include features like head-up displays, which project speed and other information onto the windshield in front of the driver; and audio alerts when the vehicle drifts into another lane without signaling. Others include blind-spot detection, automatic braking when about to hit another vehicle or pedestrian, and cross-traffic warnings when a vehicle is about to pass behind the driver in a parking lot.These technologies work. According to Ms. Cicchino of the Insurance Institute, forward-collision warning systems with automatic braking cut rear-end crashes by 50 percent, and rear cross-traffic alerts reduce accidents by 33 percent.Distractions like eating or grooming have a long history for drivers, and now smartphones are adding to them. \u201cThere is evidence to suggest that distracted driving is getting worse,\u201d said Charlie Klauer, lead for the teen risk and injury prevention group at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute.But the severity is unclear. \u201cThere is no correlation between fatalities and the use of smartphones,\u201d said Ms. Cicchino of the Insurance Institute. \u201cDistraction caused by electronic devices is replacing that caused by eating, drinking and talking to passengers while driving.\u201dThe problem is especially acute for teenagers. \u201cThey\u2019re not judicious when they engage in distracted behaviors,\u201d Ms. Klauer said. \u201cThey\u2019re not good at detecting hazards.\u201dSmartphone makers are trying to help drivers focus, too.Apple CarPlay and Android Auto allow drivers to use some of their familiar smartphone apps on a vehicle\u2019s built-in display. A recent AAA study of five cars and trucks conducted with the University of Utah found that, on average, using voice commands with CarPlay or Android Auto reduced visual and mental distractions by 15 seconds, compared with the vehicles\u2019 own infotainment systems.In addition, visual and mental demands for both the Apple and Google systems were moderate, in contrast to a rating of \u201chigh\u201d for the built-in systems of test vehicles.It takes automakers longer than the smartphone companies to develop and adjust their products, so there is lag time in changes. But less-distracting infotainment systems are beginning to appear.Acura\u2019s 2019 RDX SUV puts its infotainment screen at eye level so a driver doesn\u2019t need to look down. Coupled with a head-up display, a driver can make selections without losing sight of the road.In addition, every selection on the screen matches the same absolute position on a touch pad near the armrest; if the user wants to select a radio preset that is in the upper right of the screen, a touch of the upper right corner of the pad changes to that channel, making a selection a logical move.Also, favorite SiriusXM stations, phone contacts, and map locations can be moved to the home screen to eliminate the need to dig through multiple layers of menus. And physical buttons are retained for simple actions, such as increasing the radio volume.Designers considered adding haptic feedback \u2014 the slight vibration one feels when making certain selections on a smartphone \u2014 but decided against it. \u201cIt added more distractions,\u201d said Ross Miller, the principal engineer for infotainment user interfaces at Honda, Acura\u2019s parent company.At Chrysler, KeySense technology enables a specific key for its Pacifica minivan to be programmed so that the user cannot raise the radio volume above a certain level, mutes the radio if the front seatbelts are not fastened, and gives the car a speed limit. (Pay attention, parents of teenage drivers.)KeySense also gives an early warning for low fuel, blocks certain satellite radio stations, and always turns on the headlights when the windshield wipers are on.Chrysler also prevents Bluetooth pairing while driving, and forbids inputting a destination into the navigation system using the onscreen keyboard.To further mitigate distracted driving, \u201cwe\u2019re investigating the use of a camera to detect driver eye movements and incorporating a head-up display,\u201d said Dominic Ronzello, Chrysler\u2019s senior manager of human-machine interface and ergonomics.These design elements are making the best of a bad situation; using one\u2019s hands to input information is bound to distract even the best driver.\u201cThe direction to go is voice recognition,\u201d said Dr. Matthias Erb, Volkswagen of America\u2019s chief engineering officer. \u201cAnd when we add a head-up display, this will improve safety significantly.\u201dDr. Erb said VWs would eventually be able to learn an individual driver\u2019s behavior, and move certain functions higher up on the vehicle\u2019s display to curb distraction.\u201cThe problem is software,\u201d Dr. Erb said. \u201cThe delay in vehicle software development means that currently we cannot compete with smartphones. But vehicle over-the-air software updates will eventually come.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Supreme Confusion", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conversationRevelations about Brett Kavanaugh and Rod Rosenstein got the week started on a tumultuous note. Where are we headed now?Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.I have a lot more faith in the staying power of the Justice Department than in the staying power of the president. But we\u2019ll see. And renaming Eighth Avenue \u2014 you know the way Rosenstein\u2019s fate has been bouncing around, I\u2019m thinking maybe we could find him a nice traffic rotary upstate.Let\u2019s switch tack and talk about Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. Trump broke radio silence on Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusation against the judge by tweeting that if the attack had been bad she or her parents would have reported it to the police.I have mixed views about the case, but if you are going to defend Kavanaugh this seems to me as nearly the worst argument to make. Your thoughts?I\u2019ve been wondering if he could survive this by simply saying: \u201cI never thought of myself as someone who abused women but listening to these stories I realize now that I was. If one of my daughters was ever mistreated in that way I\u2019d want to kill the kid who did it. This happened long, long ago but that\u2019s no reason to say it isn\u2019t important. Whether my nomination is approved or not, I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life trying to be a better man.\u201dI still wouldn\u2019t want to vote for him. But as things stand now, even if he\u2019s confirmed he\u2019ll still be the walking, talking symbol of how men just don\u2019t get it.Given the way things are cartwheeling around right now, I wouldn\u2019t put any bets on how this will end. What about you?But deep down, this isn\u2019t really about whether Christine Blasey Ford is telling the truth. I suspect most people, including many of the Judiciary Republicans, privately thinks she is. The real issue is whether a respected judge can be held accountable for a drunken sexual assault he made as a teenager.Or at least that was the issue until a woman from Kavanaugh\u2019s college years spoke up. Bret, I have no idea how many issues \u2014 and charges \u2014 we\u2019re going to have before this is over. What I do know is that we\u2019re at a marker in the transformation of Western culture \u2014 how\u2019s that for a sweeping statement? Powerful men are going down because they failed to realize women were genuinely equal, not only when it comes to getting jobs and promotions, but also when it comes to how they\u2019re treated at work, and even at a party of drunken teenagers.But that\u2019s not what this moment is about. I think it\u2019s about the truth and who is telling it: Blasey or Kavanaugh. I don\u2019t want to accept a world in which Blasey\u2019s allegation \u2014 and now another accusation from Deborah Ramirez, a classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s at Yale \u2014 is breezily dismissed as some kind of unprovable charge about some no-big-deal event from long ago. But neither do I want to accept one in which mere accusation without substantial corroboration can destroy a person\u2019s career and reputation. I don\u2019t think that helps anyone.I don\u2019t know what the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee privately believe about Blasey\u2019s accusations. But it seems to me the right approach is to acknowledge that none of us really knows, that prejudgment is bad judgment, and that we should try to get as much information as possible to reach a clearer determination.Question for you: What kind of evidence would persuade you that Kavanaugh is being truthful?But here\u2019s my other bottom line. Nobody deserves a lifetime Supreme Court nomination. This isn\u2019t like the right to buy a home or to be employed. It\u2019s an exceptional honor. If the Senate decided Kavanaugh should stay in the superpowerful Court of Appeals, I don\u2019t see it as the equivalent of putting him in the stockades.I share your enthusiasm for the Texas Senate race, for a couple of small reasons and one very big one. Small reasons: I like Beto O\u2019Rourke, the Democratic challenger, and I like the idea that Texas can turn a bit purple if you have a candidate with energy, wit and a human touch.The big reason is that I despise Ted Cruz. That is \u201cD-e-s-p-i-s-e,\u201d in case I haven\u2019t spelled out my loathing clearly enough. Would you like to know why?Otherwise, you might say I\u2019m his No. 1 fan.But wait a minute, I do have one question. This is a six-year term. Presuming a Democrat defeats Trump in 2020 (pause for short novena to the Blessed Mother), what if the Senate was still teetering by a one vote-margin? Say the new president\u2019s priorities included increasing government regulation, moving the U.S. embassy back to Tel Aviv from Jerusalem and raising taxes on high-income people and corporations.If the deciding vote on all these things you don\u2019t like was going to be the Senator from Texas, who would you want it to be \u2014 the highly principled and sincere Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke or a certain Republican slimy snake?Advertisement"}

For many nonwhite evangelicals, the life issues that matter most are voting rights, living wages, environmental protection, access to health care and public education. The experience of many of those evangelicals illuminates how life issues have been narrowly defined by conservative evangelicals over the last 40 years. Whether we have any experience in reading the law, evangelicals are familiar with Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s way of reading authoritative texts. This is precisely how fundamentalists read Scripture in the early 20th century, when evolutionary science challenged their reading of Genesis and social science confronted narrow corporate interests during the Gilded Age. Fundamentalism taught reactionary religious voices to dig in their heels and claim final authority about what the text \u201cactually says.\u201d But evangelicals should know better: Our movement in America was founded in an attempt to maintain a commitment to Jesus and the Bible while rejecting reactionary extremism. As proponents of \u201cChristian nationalism\u201d continue to be the most consistent base of support for President Trump, my evangelical faith compels me to challenge the way reactionary conservatives have hijacked our faith to serve their narrow interests. With Judge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, their 40-year effort to overturn expansions of 14th Amendment protections by the Warren court may be in reach. This will not necessarily save unborn children, but it will make life more difficult for minorities, workers, poor people and the L.G.B.T.Q. community.When Jesus said, \u201cI have come that they might have life, and have it more abundantly\u201d in John 10:10, he wasn\u2019t thinking about a victory for those who have used religion to fight back against the gains of the civil rights movement.

Opinion ColumnistWhile there, Obama gave a press conference, and the questions and answers, viewed in hindsight, with the full knowledge of the hell we\u2019ve been through for nearly two years, is fascinating.The first question was from Darlene Superville of The Associated Press, who asked:\u201cYou\u2019ve been telling world leaders this week that President-elect Trump is unlikely to govern in the divisive way that he campaigned. But I\u2019m wondering, how can you be so certain of that, given that the first group of people he\u2019s chosen for top national security and law enforcement positions hold the same views that he espoused as a candidate?\u201dObama responded in part:\u201cPeople should take a wait-and-see approach in how much his policy proposals once in the White House, once he is sworn in, matches up with some of the rhetoric of his campaign. My simple point is, is that you can\u2019t assume that the language of campaigning matches up with the specifics of governing, legislation, regulations, and foreign policy.\u201dBut the exchange people remember most came with another questioner, Rich Edson of Fox News, who asked:\u201cSpeaking of your predecessor, he made sure to offer essentially no public criticism of you during your time in office. Will you equally withhold public criticism for President Trump, even if he attempts to dismantle much of what you\u2019ve accomplished?\u201dObama responded in part:\u201cAs an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there are issues that have less to do with the specifics of some legislative proposal or battle, but go to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it\u2019s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals, then I\u2019ll examine it when it comes.\u201dWell, it appears that that moment has finally come for Obama, though, in all honesty, it came months ago for many of us.It was a departure from the genteel tradition of the presidents\u2019 club in which the exes try not to personally criticize the current one and vice versa, although Trump had never adhered to this tradition. He insults and condemns his predecessors without end, particularly Obama, the black man whom his largely white base most detests.Nothing Obama said was particularly new or revelatory. It was that he was saying it at all that arrested attention.For instance, he told the audience that \u201ceach time we painstakingly pull ourselves closer to our founding ideals\u201d there are dark forces that push us back, and that \u201cit did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause.\u201dHe continued:\u201cHe\u2019s just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years. A fear and anger that\u2019s rooted in our past, but it\u2019s also born out of the enormous upheavals that have taken place in your brief lifetimes.\u201dHe could have read similar words in a thousand essays written since Trump was elected.But, for me, I deeply appreciate his words for another reason: He is loosening Trump\u2019s stranglehold on the news.There is only so much time in a news day, only so many column inches in a newspaper, only so much prominent real estate on a website. Up to this point Trump has dominated the news by overwhelming it, and no one has had the weight to challenge that dominance. Obama has that weight. Just by speaking he\u2019s altering the diet of the news people consume.His very presence in the fight, as a presidential voice \u2014 even if former, for some he\u2019s forever \u2014 is disruptive.For this I say, welcome back Mr. President.

But there are also fresh concerns, some based on recent experience, that these individuals are assuming an unhealthy amount of influence.\u201cEven good billionaires need to have less of a role in our public life,\u201d said Anand Giridharadas, author of \u201cWinners Take All,\u201d a new book about the global elite. \u201cThey are buying up the free press, which is meant to hold them accountable.\u201dBeyond the marquee names, local billionaires now own the daily newspapers in Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Boston. Smaller outlets \u2014 including The Village Voice, The New Republic and Gothamist \u2014 were also bought by wealthy individuals in recent years.And all of this is happening as the business model for print and online journalism remains precarious at best.\u201cWe have a new era, particularly in the last few years, of billionaire owners from the new economy who are intrigued by this old dilemma,\u201d said Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, a journalism advocacy group.In some cases, these new owners succeed in revitalizing the publications they acquire, injecting them with new energy and freeing them from the pressures of short-term profits, while preserving editorial independence.And in Minnesota, a local businessman, Glen Taylor, has drawn praise for his ownership of The Minneapolis Star Tribune, which he bought for about $100 million in 2014.But just as often, it seems, the new owners of newspapers and magazines can sap newsroom morale, or quickly discover that they have little tolerance for financial losses, or unions.\u201cBeing owned by a local billionaire is not necessarily an act of charity,\u201d Mr. Rosenstiel said. \u201cThere are clearly billionaires who are buying up publications because they want to influence political discourse in the country.\u201dEven John Henry, who made a fortune with his investment firm and is well regarded as the owner of The Boston Globe, has recently expressed some distaste for the economics of print media.For much of the 20th century, print publications were largely owned by private companies \u2014 often helmed by families like the Scrippses and the Chandlers \u2014 that had started a publication in one city and gradually expanded.By the 1970s, consolidation and ample profits from print advertising led many of these companies to go public.But in the late 1990s, advertising on the internet began to chip away at print profits. And in recent years, many once-proud print empires have consolidated, others have been sold for parts, and some papers and magazines are simply going out of business.Amid this turmoil, the new generation of wealthy buyers has emerged. But while buying a high-wattage publication can deliver an owner a certain amount of status and prestige, it can also invite controversy.President Trump, displeased with coverage of his administration in The Washington Post, has taken to attacking Amazon on Twitter, even though Mr. Bezos \u2014 not Amazon \u2014 owns the newspaper.Walter Isaacson, a former editor of Time, said that for most of his career, he had believed that the best owners for media companies were publicly traded corporations, where there was less of a chance for a wealthy owner to meddle.That changed, he said, during his tenure at Time.\u201cThen I went through the disaster of Time Warner, a company that only cared about short-term stock price and didn\u2019t have a feel for journalism,\u201d he said.Now, Mr. Isaacson said, \u201cI have come to the belief that a sole proprietor, especially a benevolent and public spirited one, is a good thing in troubled times.\u201dMr. Giridharadas, however, remains skeptical that ultrarich individuals, however public spirited, are the best owners for the free press.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the powerful having an oligopoly of the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only amount of power that a billionaire should have over a paper they own is zero.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "To Get a Better Job, First Train for the Job Training", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesThe unemployment rate is 3.9 percent. Businesses are desperate for workers. Yet at the same time, a large group of people can\u2019t find a job.  Jesibel Done is 20. She\u2019s a high-school graduate supporting others members of her family. She\u2019d love to buy a house. But the most she\u2019s ever made is $10.25 an hour. (Do that for a year, and you make $21,320.) She\u2019s worked at Walmart, Family Dollar, Hollister and 7-Eleven. She\u2019s often left a job because family problems needed attention or because of conflicts with co-workers. But she finds another one quickly. \u201cIf I keep looking and calling, I usually get a job in a week or two,\u201d she said. At 7-Eleven, she worked the night shift, sometimes running a store alone overnight in Elizabeth, N.J. \u2014 not a great place for doing that. Still, she considers that the best job she has ever had \u2014 because 7-Eleven pays workers even during their lunch breaks. \u201cYou get your whole paycheck,\u201d she said. There are millions of people like Ms. Done. They\u2019d love to have a real career and be able to support a family. But life gets in the way: Training can cost tens of thousands of dollars. They can\u2019t take time off from work to study. They have no one to take care of the children. The car has broken down. They\u2019ve lost their driver's license. Bus fare costs too much.  The best job-training programs understand that students lead complicated lives. What can work for people reading at elementary school level, who can\u2019t do fractions, who didn\u2019t graduate from high school? (Or even worse \u2014 they graduated, but without those skills.) \u201cWe are cradle to grave,\u201d said Rodney Brutton, the director of work force development. New Community offers infant day care, a nursing home and a lot in between: therapeutic counseling, high-school equivalency classes, housing, health care, a charter school, a food pantry \u2014 even a community newspaper. Job training has been a centerpiece for many years. For example, the Ford Motor Company spent a million dollars 25 years ago to create an automotive training facility for New Community \u2014 a giant mechanic\u2019s garage with a classroom in the back. Ford did it so its dealerships could hire the graduates. New Community also has courses in construction and building trades, culinary arts, medical assistance and patient care. I met Ms. Done in the clinical medical assistant course, whose schedule is 9 to 3, five days a week, for six months. Her goal is to get a job at the beige brick complex of University Hospital, which you can see from New Community\u2019s window. Starting pay is $19.80. Because New Community is an accredited postsecondary school, students can get federal Pell grants. No student can owe more than $1,800. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t put me in much debt,\u201d Ms. Done said. (Students at for-profit trade schools can emerge from a course with $20,000 or more in debt.) Three years ago, New Community started working with Local Initiatives Support Corporation to improve its wallet-related programs. The company helped New Community to start and fund what it calls a financial opportunities center, making it one of about 90 community organizations with such an attribute. Typically, such centers include a job coach; a social services expert to connect clients to supports that they qualify for, such as bus passes or supplemental food aid; and a financial adviser to help clients reduce debt, set goals and start to save. New Community had been doing some of those things, but piecemeal. \u201cYou can say we were connecting students to living-wage jobs and careers, but it was almost a half-baked cake,\u201d Mr. Brutton said. \u201cYes, we got them a job, but they still went to the local check-cashing place. They did not develop strategies on how to save. They didn\u2019t have a financial goal, what it is they want to save for.\u201d The other big Local Initiatives innovation is Bridges to Career Opportunities. New Community just started Bridges two weeks ago. Bridges teaches basic math, science and reading, tailored to each course. The health care courses, for example, are using a number line to put unit measures in order and learning fractions by calculating dosage. They study the prefixes, suffixes and roots of medical terminology. The automotive, culinary and building trades courses will have their own tailored lessons. The students might not have been paying attention in high school, but they\u2019re paying attention now. \u201cThis is why we need to know fractions,\u201d Mr. Brutton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because my math teacher said so. It\u2019s that I have to cut this piece of Sheetrock and frame up this room.\u201d Bridges runs at the same time as the course it serves, at least two hours a day, three days a week. Traditional remedial education elsewhere is a prerequisite to real courses \u2014 and students don\u2019t earn credits for it. This is why a lot of students leave college. \u201cThey might not even get into that training program because their math skills are not up to snuff, and they \u2018re going to use their Pell money on remedial education and they\u2019re going to hate it and be out,\u201d said Seung Kim, the Local Initiatives organization\u2019s senior program director for family income and wealth. The Bridges program is two years old and now in 31 Local Initiatives sites, in 11 cities. The organization said the average Bridges class raises math and reading skills about two grade levels. What separates the Local Initiatives organization and its partners from other job-training programs is its holistic approach. \u201cOften people just do work force \u2014 just that one component,\u201d said Maurice Jones, the president and chief executive of Local Initiatives. \u201cBut there\u2019s all the other things: financial competency, transportation and housing and child care. You have to really do all of these things simultaneously if you really want to have a lasting impact helping people get into living-wage jobs and careers.\u201d Mr. Jones said the study showed that clients were getting jobs, but having trouble keeping them. \u201cThey had these other things they were battling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had challenges keeping people in jobs long enough for wages to increase.\u201d The organization began telling its job coaches to stay with clients, even after they found employment. \u201cThe value of coaching does not stop when someone gets a job,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t have been a revelation, but it was.\u201d Now the Local Initiatives company is also starting a pilot program of retention-focused coaching in three sites. Transportation and child-care issues don\u2019t go away, Mr. Jones said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t help folks solve these problems, I don\u2019t care how great your skill imparting is. They won\u2019t be able to get to work on time.\u201d A previous version of this article misspelled the name of a nationwide company that supports community organizations. It is Local Initiatives Support Corporation, not Local Initiative Support Corporation.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s What We Know About Him.", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMark Judge, who has been named by two women as being a key witness to sexual misconduct by Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, said Friday that he would cooperate with any law enforcement agency \u201cassigned to confidentially investigate\u201d the accusations.A high school friend of Judge Kavanaugh, Mr. Judge quickly became a significant but elusive figure. His name was repeatedly brought up on Thursday during testimony by one of the women, Christine Blasey Ford, and Judge Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Democratic senators pressed Judge Kavanaugh about his relationship with Mr. Judge and lamented that he had not been called as a witness by the Republican majority that controls the process.Mr. Judge is now an author, filmmaker and journalist who has written for conservative publications including The Daily Caller and The Weekly Standard. He had active profiles on Facebook and YouTube until his name surfaced in recent weeks, but those pages have since been removed. News stories have focused on \u201cWasted,\u201d his 1997 memoir, which describes his alcohol-fueled years as a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Maryland, where he was Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s close friend and classmate.On Thursday, Dr. Blasey, who also goes by her married name, Ford, repeated her accusations under oath, including her allegation about Mr. Judge\u2019s role, stating that he was in the room at a suburban Maryland home in the early 1980s when a drunken Judge Kavanaugh pinned her on a bed, grabbed at her body and clothes, and covered her mouth to keep her from screaming.She also said that music was playing in the room when one of them pushed her into it, and that one of the teenagers had turned it up. She describes a drunk Mr. Judge as a jumpy and at times conflicted accomplice to assault.The Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the man she alleges assaulted her while they were in high school, revealed several details in their stories that do not match up.\u201cBoth Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They seemed to be having a very good time,\u201d Dr. Blasey said. \u201cMark seemed ambivalent, at times urging Brett on and at times telling him to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.\u201dShe said she had never forgotten \u201cthe uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense.\u201cI was underneath one of them while the two laughed,\u201d she testified. \u201cTwo friends having a really good time together.\u201dDr. Blasey said Mr. Judge jumped on top of them twice, causing everyone to tumble off the bed and onto the floor the second time. That allowed her to get out of the room and hide in a bathroom, she said.\u201cI heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs, pinballing off the walls on the way down,\u201d she said, adding that when she could no longer hear them, she ran downstairs and left the house.Get messages from our politics correspondent Alex Burns as he covers the biggest races this election season. Along the way, he\u2019ll take your questions and help you understand what\u2019s at stake on Nov. 6.Weeks later, Dr. Blasey testified, she saw Mr. Judge working at a Safeway grocery store in Potomac, Md. In his memoir, Mr. Judge mentioned that he had worked for a few weeks at a supermarket in the summer before his senior year, helping people load groceries into their cars. He wrote that he often showed up at his early-morning shift hung over from the night before.\u201cI said \u2018hello\u2019 to him,\u201d she said. \u201cHis face was white and very uncomfortable saying \u2018hello\u2019 back.\u201dShe added, \u201cHe was just nervous and not really wanting to speak with me, and he looked a little bit ill.\u201dMr. Judge has disputed this account through his lawyer. In an interview with The New York Times before Dr. Blasey\u2019s name became public, Mr. Judge described high school parties he attended as being mostly small, taking place after football games in basements while parents were asleep upstairs.\u201cI never saw anything like that,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cThe way it was described is even bizarre, about turning up the music and all this other stuff. It\u2019s no situation I recall ever being in.\u201dMr. Judge suggested the allegations were driven by politics. \u201cAny intelligent person knows what\u2019s motivating it,\u201d he said.Certain details of Dr. Blasey\u2019s account resemble his own broad portrait of high school years filled with binge drinking and accounts by former Georgetown Prep students who attended the all-boys school at the same time.In their 1983 yearbook, a photo of football players in pads and uniform showed Mr. Judge and Mr. Kavanaugh grinning side by side. Mr. Judge\u2019s yearbook page says he was a member of the club \u201c100 KEGS or Bust\u201d and includes the quotation, \u201cCertain women should be struck regularly, like gongs.\u201dSome former classmates of the two men have said that aspects of Dr. Blasey\u2019s recollections of Mr. Judge rang true.The book describes a person named \u201cBart O\u2019Kavanaugh\u201d as having \u201cpuked in someone\u2019s car the other night\u201d and \u201cpassed out on his way back from a party.\u201d A former classmate of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s said that the judge earned the nickname \u201cBart\u201d after a Georgetown Prep teacher garbled his name.In the hearing Thursday, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, pressed Judge Kavanaugh about the \u201cBart O\u2019Kavanaugh\u201d passage. Mr. Kavanaugh said that the book was a \u201cfictionalized\u201d account and that only Mr. Judge could answer about his intention.Under questioning Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh said that he and Mr. Judge became friends in ninth grade and that they shared the same group of friends. Mr. Judge was popular in school, Judge Kavanaugh said, and a talented writer.But Mr. Judge later developed a serious addiction that lasted decades, he said, and was near death a couple of times. He \u201csuffered tremendously,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh said, adding that they had not talked in several years but might have been included on mass emails sent among old friends.Steve Eder, David Enrich and Kate Kelly contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Roy Cooper of North Carolina said on Tuesday, as he ordered what he believed was the first state-mandated evacuation of the state\u2019s barrier islands. \u201cThe waves and the wind this storm may bring is nothing like you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dSchools began closing on Tuesday in affected areas, and will be used this week as hurricane shelters. In South Carolina, the closings were indefinite, affecting about 400,000 students, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state Education Department. Government offices and businesses shut down. Evacuees from the coast packed onto highways, where coastbound lanes had been converted into routes inland.A bartender at the Barbary Coast, said to be the oldest bar in Wilmington, N.C., told The Wilmington Star News that it would \u201cprobably\u201d close on Thursday, the first time in his memory that it would shut its doors for a storm.In Fair Bluff, one of the small towns on North Carolina\u2019s coastal plain inundated two years ago during Hurricane Matthew, construction was to begin in the coming months on storm-damaged houses that had been federally approved for rebuilding or elevation.\u201cWe don\u2019t need this,\u201d said the mayor, Billy Hammond, who works for a funeral home. \u201cBut we have to take what the Lord gives us.\u201dBut 200 miles north, in Princeville, N.C., Regina Cobb was not so sure. She was moving as much as she could out of her home.\u201cIf it floods this time, I think my family is out,\u201d said Ms. Cobb, 50, who lives directly across the street from a dike along the Tar River. \u201cThis is God\u2019s way of saying: \u2018It\u2019s time to do something different.\u2019\u201dResidents in North Carolina compared Florence to some of the state\u2019s worst storms in recent history \u2014 Floyd in 1999 and Fran in 1996 came up a lot \u2014 and many worried that Florence would be even more destructive, a combination of the worst qualities of storms past.Brian Asbill, a spokesman for Crabtree Valley Mall in Raleigh, said the mall hadn\u2019t taken on water since Hurricane Fran.The mall has floodgates, and officials planned to block off its lower-level parking areas. Tenants were being encouraged to move merchandise to higher shelves and put displays on counters. But with some of the rainfall totals being discussed in news reports \u2014 20 to 40 inches of rain may fall on parts of North Carolina and Virginia \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s not going to be a good sight,\u201d Mr. Asbill said.Here in Carolina Beach, Jesse Jordan, 66, nailed the last plank of plywood over the windows of the dune-colored, two-story home he owns on the island. His daughter had painted orange hurricane logos on each plank.Since Mr. Jordan built the house in 1999, he said, it has withstood a number of punishing nor\u2019easters and other storms. \u201cNever lost a shingle,\u201d he said.But the town manager, Michael Cramer, was worried.\u201cWe could have 120-to-125-mile-per-hour winds by the time it gets to us, with a projected storm surge of nine feet,\u201d Mr. Cramer said inside the town\u2019s brick municipal center, where an emergency management center has been set up.Traffic on Route 501, which runs from Myrtle Beach, S.C., to Virginia, was four to six times heavier than normal on Tuesday, said Capt. Kelley Hughes of the South Carolina Highway Patrol. Interstate 26, which runs from Charleston to the western part of the state, had three times as much traffic as normal, he said.The goats from Goat Island in Murrells Inlet, S.C., were loaded onto a pontoon boat and shipped to a farm to comply with their evacuation order, according to The Myrtle Beach Sun News.But some residents in evacuation zones were hauling in porch furniture and stocking up on food and water. One of them was the mayor of Nags Head, N.C., Ben Cahoon, who said he and his wife had decided to stay in the small Outer Banks beach town despite a mandatory evacuation order that he had helped develop.\u201cThere are folks like myself, who have lived here a long time, who sort of have a sense about these things,\u201d said Mr. Cahoon, 56. \u201cWhether that\u2019s entirely rational or not, that\u2019s something else.\u201dThe mayor\u2019s personal preparations have been fairly modest: He has purchased only about six gallons of water, some cans of soup, peanut butter and crackers. He has a gas range he said he could use for cooking if his home loses electricity.On Facebook, \u201churricane party\u201d pages encouraged others riding out the storm to share information.Officials said it was too early to gauge the success of the evacuation measures.\u201cThere are some places,\u201d said Bill Holmes, a spokesman with the North Carolina Joint Information Center, \u201cwhere people are doing a better job of leaving than others.\u201dReporting was contributed by Anemona Hartocollis, Adeel Hassan, Timothy Williams and Richard A.

{"Headline": "The Amazon on the Brink", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "OpinionOnce a leader in protecting the region\u2019s vast forests, Brazil is now moving in the opposite direction. Supported byDr. Fearnside is an ecologist based in Brazil; Mr. Schiffman is an environmental journalist.The Trump administration is not the only government that has been busy slashing funds for environmental protection. Brazil has been doing the same.If the government\u2019s retrenchment on environmental protection continues, there may soon be nothing to stop the chain saws on the Amazonian frontier, where the rule of law can be weak and land is frequently seized and cleared illegally. This has implications beyond Brazil. The Amazon\u2019s lush forests make up the largest reserve of carbon dioxide on the surface of the earth. This potent greenhouse gas is released when forests are burned or bulldozed and left to decay.Brazilians are going to the polls on Oct. 7 to choose among nine candidates for the presidency, with a likely runoff later in the month between the top two vote-getters. The outcome will bear significantly on the future of the Amazon. The current front-runner, Jair Bolsonaro, is a climate-change skeptic who has been called \u201cthe tropical Trump.\u201d He has threatened to take Brazil out of the Paris climate accord. Another of the leading contenders, the former S\u00e3o Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad, is regarded as a moderate on the environment. Marina Silva, who as Brazil\u2019s environment minister pushed to limit deforestation and encourage sustainable development in the Amazon, is running well behind in the latest polls. Why this change in policy? The scientists put it succinctly: \u201cIn exchange for political support, the Brazilian government is signaling landholders to increase deforestation.\u201dPresident Temer\u2019s minister of justice is pushing plans to allow agribusiness to rent indigenous land that had been off limits to developers. Other proposals would effectively freeze the creation of new protected areas, open others to resource exploitation and block the mapping of boundaries of indigenous lands, potentially opening native communities and their forests to invasion by miners and ranchers. Indigenous territories contain more forest than all of the government\u2019s conservation units combined, and historically Brazil\u2019s native peoples have been far more effective in defending the rain forest than the government or private landowners.Not so long ago, Brazil was doing things right. Despite low global prices for soy and beef, the nation experienced a remarkable economic expansion while deforestation fell 60 percent from 2004 to 2007, demonstrating that environmental growth is consistent with economic growth. But now that demand for soy and beef on the global market is high, pressure on the forest is mounting. Deforestation is still well below historical highs. But that could soon change if the power of the agribusiness lobby is not checked.The ruralists came into increased prominence toward the end of the administration of the Workers Party president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and grew more powerful during the term of his successor, Dilma Rousseff. During Ms. Rousseff\u2019s presidency, which ended when she was removed from office following impeachment, amnesty was granted to landowners who had illegally cleared forests, encouraging continued lawbreaking in the world\u2019s largest rain forest.Climate change has also increased the danger of catastrophic forest fires. In dry El Ni\u00f1o years, burned areas can greatly exceed what is cleared for cattle pasture.The changing climate represents both a threat to the Amazon and a key reason for protecting its forests. Transpiration from tree leaves generates rivers of moisture in the atmosphere that act as conveyor belts bringing much-needed rain to Brazil\u2019s heavily populated south and to Argentina. S\u00e3o Paulo, which already regularly runs dangerously short of water, will be a major victim if continued deforestation removes this water vapor transport that fills the reservoirs on which the city, South America\u2019s largest, depends.The Amazon forest itself would also suffer. As more of it is cut, the huge volume of self-generated rainfall it needs to remain verdant is steadily reduced, worsening droughts made more frequent and severe by global warming. At some point \u2014 we are not sure how close we are to this critical tipping point \u2014 the entire ecosystem dries out.Brazilians have consistently said in opinion polls that they want to preserve the Amazon. But in the current atmosphere of unbridled greed and corruption in high places, the voices for wise policy are often drowned out. Brazil alone has not created the deforestation problem, and neither can it address it alone. Demand for Brazil\u2019s beef from Western nations, and increasingly from China, has created an enormous temptation to cut the forest to turn a quick profit.Only then, can we insure that the Amazonia forests, the living heart of Brazil \u2014 and of the world \u2014 will remain intact.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Let Teenagers Sleep In", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStarting schools before 8:30 a.m. shows a tragic disregard for both the mental health of children and for science.Mr. Nicholls is a journalist and a high school science teacher.This article has been updated to reflect news developments.A fresh-faced batch of teenagers just began a new school year, but will they get the most out of it? In the mornings, many are forced to get to school much too early. And at night, ubiquitous screens are a lure that\u2019s hard to resist. This double whammy is a perfect lesson in sleep deprivation.It is important to understand why teenagers have a particularly hard time getting enough sleep, and what adults need to do to help.First, a reminder of the basic biology: After puberty, adolescents are no longer the morning larks of their younger years. They become rewired as night owls, staying awake later and then sleeping in. This is not part of a feckless project to frustrate parents, but is driven by changes in the way the brain responds to light.The growth in screen time is particularly problematic for sleep. Not only does it eat into the time available for rest, but the blue light emitted by LEDs, TVs, tablets and smartphones suppresses the body\u2019s secretion of melatonin, the hormone that signals it\u2019s time to sleep. Overdosing on screens at night effectively tells the brain it\u2019s still daytime, delaying the body\u2019s cues to sleep even further. Parents should set real limits on screen time, model responsible use of devices and praise children who show signs of regulating their own media consumption. In the hour before bedtime, there should be a moratorium on bright lights in the home, avoiding devices and harsh LED bulbs often found in kitchens and bathrooms.But Ms. Ziporyn Snider remains upbeat: \u201cEventually a bill like this, created in the best interests of children, will pass. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201dParents need to be vocal about the reasons change is so important, joining forces with community leaders, sleep scientists, health professionals and educators to put school start times on the local, then state agendas.Advertisement"}

But anyway \u2026 who do you think it is?By the way, about Jeff Sessions. A lot of people feel that even though he was a weasel throughout his career, they\u2019re glad he\u2019s attorney general right now. I know you\u2019re definitely not a fan, so what\u2019s your take?In that connection, I\u2019m generally of the view that people in the administration who think \u2014 as that anonymous author does \u2014 that they\u2019re saving us from Trump are really just enabling him. My only exception to this rule is Jim Mattis and anyone else in the national security apparatus, since they make me sleep better at night.We\u2019re all grateful to anybody who\u2019s staying with the administration in order to keep things from blowing up. Whoever they are, I say, stick with it, guys.But there\u2019s a heck of a lot more going on than the road to Armageddon. Trump is also delivering on a very traditional conservative wish list \u2014 tax cuts for the rich, the attempt to undermine public education in favor of private schools and charters, the assaults on Obamacare and organized labor.That\u2019s why I\u2019m so eager to see the Democrats take control of Congress. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll lead to impeachment \u2014 unless the president starts wandering around in his underwear babbling about space alien takeovers. But I want them to put the brakes on his assaults on environmental protection, health care and the safety net for the poor. Am I right in guessing you don\u2019t look at the elections the same way?But this isn\u2019t a normal presidency, so I\u2019m rooting for a Democratic Congress as a check on a dangerous and lawless president. I also think Trump is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors for conspiring with Michael Cohen to violate campaign-finance laws and that he ought to be impeached, convicted and removed from office. Conservatives should be delighted by the prospect: They would get a more typical Republican, Mike Pence, as president.The big question, of course, is whether pursuing an impeachment strategy is politically wise for House Democrats. Republicans remember that it didn\u2019t exactly serve them well in 1998, when they managed to make themselves look extreme and Bill Clinton appear comparatively sympathetic. What do you think? How should Democrats use a House majority, if they get it?My prediction, for what it\u2019s worth, is that the Democrats will retake control of the House and possibly the Senate in November. That we\u2019ll then manage to stagger through two more years of craziness during which everybody but the Trump kids gradually abandons ship. And I\u2019m not even totally sure about Jared.And then finally in 2020, we elect a new president who is hopefully both a Democrat and kind of boring. What say you?Advertisement"}

Did the Russians have anything to do with President Trump\u2019s becoming the Republican candidate in the first place? Did Russia interfere in the primaries?\u2014 Jim Houghton, Encino, Calif.As we say in our story, it certainly must have been welcome news at the Kremlin that the one person to emerge from a very crowded field of Republican candidates was someone who advocated better ties to Russia. That said, we don\u2019t know of any evidence that the Russians had a hand in helping the Trump campaign win the nomination.Is there any solid evidence that anyone actually voted for Mr. Trump instead of Hillary Clinton as a result of the fake accounts?\u2014 David Merzig, Oneonta, N.Y.Why didn\u2019t the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. realize what was going on? Where were American spies in Russia? Some news reports indicate that the United States has an informant in Russian President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s inner circle; is it possible that the person knew but did not want to disclose the information?\u2014 Kristian Wachtell, CopenhagenHow do we know the Russians didn\u2019t hack the voting machines and voter registration databases in swing states to allow Mr. Trump to win? How would we know?\u2014 Ron Balassanian, San FranciscoWhat is the most direct evidence currently known connecting Mr. Trump with any Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election?\u2014 John English, East Lansing, Mich.What I don\u2019t understand is why Russia wanted Mr. Trump as president and not Mrs. Clinton? Why are Russia and Mr. Putin better off with Mr. Trump?\u2014 Tony Olds, Lansing, Mich.In practice, the Trump administration has produced a contradictory record: Mr. Trump has kept up the Putin-friendly rhetoric even as his cabinet has persuaded him to take a series of tough actions, escalating sanctions, expelling Russian diplomats suspected of spying and supplying defensive weapons to Ukraine.Is Mr. Putin seeking to overtake the United States in terms of dominance and presence on the world stage? Does Mr. Putin believe that with President Trump\u2019s help Russia will emerge as a rejuvenated world power, with the United States in a diminished capacity?\u2014 John C. Turley, ChicagoWhat Mr. Putin has demonstrated, however, is that by using the cheap, new tools of hacking, leaking and social media manipulation, Russia can cause outsize trouble for the United States and other countries. Presumably one of Mr. Putin\u2019s goals is to convince Russians and their neighbors that the United States is a deeply troubled, bitterly divided country whose brand of democracy should be a model for no one. Russia is a much-discussed, much-feared player on the world stage, and that may be enough for Mr. Putin.Has there ever been successful foreign interference in American internal affairs on this scale before? Or did Russia achieve something that had never been done before during the election?\u2014 Jeffrey Rahman, Washington StateWhat changed by 2016 was the availability of hacking, leaking and social media chicanery as inexpensive tools for political meddling \u2014 and Mr. Putin\u2019s willingness to risk using such tools aggressively.Who decides whether or not the results of Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation are made public? Who decides the form of that reporting? I\u2019m sensing we may be heading for a Pentagon Papers moment.\u2014 Renata Simone, MassachusettsFrom there, Mr. Rosenstein will face a decision about whether to deliver the report to Congress, which could then make Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings public. The conventional wisdom is that there will be intense political pressure on Mr. Rosenstein to deliver any report to Congress, and it seems far more likely than not that Mr. Mueller\u2019s findings will officially be made public.What are all of the \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201cthoughts\u201d of Mr. Putin you describe and state throughout the article based on?

Her daughter, Courtney, said she had no idea her mother was the first African-American woman to become a staff photographer at The New York Times. Her editors said that while she won awards, she didn\u2019t go to galas to accept them. And when she fell ill with breast cancer in 2010, many of her colleagues had no clue, since she kept on working.This week, many of them were stunned when they learned that Ms. Washington, 66, died after her cancer returned earlier this year. Her reticence may have been more than just a quirk, but a survival strategy for someone who was promoted from lab technician to staff photographer, much to the intense resentment of some of the men who felt they had been passed over.Her response? Silence.\u201cShe was harassed a lot,\u201d said Mark Bussell, who was deputy picture editor at the time of her promotion. \u201cShe confronted difficulty with a straight face. She diffused negativity with a cool response.\u201dIt\u2019s sobering to realize that we worked alongside trailblazers, even quiet ones.

She then moved in with Freddie in Brooklyn, going to college and starting at The Times in the mid-1970s, working in the back copy department. Soon enough, she moved to the lab and, later, staff.Nancy Weinstock, who was a picture editor on Metro, was a mentor of sorts to Ms. Washington, whom she described as a \u201cwell-rounded\u201d news photographer. More important, she said, her cool demeanor was an asset when working with reporters in delicate or tense situations.\u201cThe temperature would go down a couple of degrees because she had that nice, calming way and was nonthreatening with a ready smile,\u201d Ms. Weinstock said, echoing the remarks of her colleagues on social media. \u201cShe would observe, step back a little, and she was very observant.

I think we were both driven. Being female, I think we had a greater understanding of how to work with people. It showed in her work, where she could get the most flattering photos of people who didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the camera.\u201dA deep love of the arts led her to seek out chances to photograph dance and drama, Ms. Lee said. \u201cShe had a great interest in art, and that made her think a lot about the photographs she was doing,\u201d Ms. Lee said. \u201cI think, understandably, there was sometimes a little bit of concern whether she was getting the assignments that she should or wanted to have, but I think she did very well for herself.\u201dAnd when Ms. Washington grew discouraged, Michelle Agins, a staff photographer since 1989, counseled patience. \u201cYou\u2019re in the middle of a revolution,\u201d Ms. Agins said. \u201cIn the revolution, you have to prepare for war.

{"Headline": "Gordon Parks on Poverty, the \u2018Most Savage of Human Afflictions\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRACE STORIESEmpathy for the poor may not come easily to people who never experienced poverty. They may blame the victims and insist their predicament can be overcome through determination and hard work. But they may not realize that extreme poverty can be psychologically and physically incapacitating \u2014 a perpetual cycle of bad diets, health care and education exacerbated by the shaming and self-fulfilling prophecies that define it in the public imagination.Gordon Parks \u2014 perhaps more than any artist \u2014 saw poverty as \u201cthe most savage of all human afflictions\u201d and realized the power of empathy to help us understand it. It was neither an abstract problem nor political symbol, but something he endured growing up destitute in rural Kansas and having spent years documenting poverty throughout the world, including the United States. \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fearful Foe\u201d was the second article in \u201cCrisis in Latin America,\u201d a five-part series intended to promote President John F. Kennedy\u2019s proposed Alliance for Progress, which fostered cooperation between the United States and Latin America, while discouraging the spread of communism by raising the standard of living in region.The magazine initially asked Mr. Parks to find one emblematic image about poverty in each of seven Latin American countries. Finding this approach too abstract and detached, he argued for a more in-depth story. Working in Brazil with a Portuguese-speaking reporter, Jos\u00e9 Gallo, he soon found his subject: 12-year old Flavio, the eldest child of Jos\u00e9 and Nair da Silva. Mr. Parks spent nearly three weeks documenting the boy\u2019s desolate life, a daily grind of cleaning, cooking, scavenging for supplies and taking care of his seven siblings. While Mr. Parks portrayed the da Silva family with dignity, he did not sidestep the brutal details of their lives: their ragged and filthy clothes; the rickety shed in which they lived; the despair and anger of children struggling to survive; and the desolate landscape strewn with garbage and raw sewage, and teeming with insects. To the editors of Life, committed to anti-communism and American exceptionalism, the wrenching story of Flavio \u2014 whom they portrayed as a \u201csymbol of impoverished millions\u201d \u2014 could help sway public opinion in favor of intervention. Raising nearly $30,000, first in unsolicited reader contributions and later in an understated appeal, Life began its own rescue effort. It arranged for Flavio, who suffered from asthma and malnutrition, to be treated at a Denver hospital, moved the da Silva family to a new home and administered funds to support the favela. Mr. Parks, who later returned to Brazil to bring Flavio to the United States for medical treatment, maintained a relationship with the young man for many years. Some Brazilians resented Mr. Parks\u2019s photo essay. Convinced that Americans should examine their own legacy of extreme poverty, the weekly magazine O Cruzeiro retaliated by sending the photographer Henri Ballot to New York to document the urban poor. After photographing despairing street scenes in East Harlem and on the Bowery, Mr. Ballot, echoing \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fearful Foe,\u201d focused on a Puerto Rican family: Felix and Esther Gonzalez and their six children, who lived in a small apartment in a decrepit Lower East Side tenement. The parallels that Mr. Ballot set up between his photographs and those of the Life photo essay were meant to underscore that poverty in the United States was no different from that in Brazil. But they also appeared contrived. \u201cBy presenting Ballot\u2019s work as a page-by-page comparison without making a critical assessment of the independent quality and effectiveness of the photographs,\u201d wrote Mr. Burgi, \u201cO Cruzeiro inadvertently exposed the Brazilian photographer, and the magazine itself, to criticism of the methods used to produce the report.\u201dO Cruzeiro\u2019s implicit criticism of \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fearful Foe,\u201d while valid, may have applied more to Life than to Mr. Parks, who acknowledged at the time that the United States needed to \u201cclean up its own yard\u201d with regard to racism and segregation before it could credibly address the plight of Latin America. He intrinsically understood that the magazine\u2019s largely middle class readers did not have to confront Flavio\u2019s daily challenges nor those of millions of poor people close to home. In this regard, he resisted the magazine\u2019s impersonal approach to the assignment, preferring instead, as Mr. Roth wrote, \u201cto confine the story to one situation, hoping that Life\u2019s readers could more easily relate to it.\u201d Through his disturbing photographs, he wanted to convince them that extreme poverty \u2014 no matter where \u2014 was an injustice and threat to humanity that needed to be remedied.\u201cThe world must see the tragedy of poverty as it is, and feel all its drama\u201d Mr. Parks told the Brazilian newspaper Jornal do Brasil in 1961. \u201cEveryone must face the problems of humanity. My way of facing these issues is through photography.

{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Flawed Solution to Political Polarization", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bail is a sociologist.During his appearance before Congress on Wednesday, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey, repeatedly denied that Twitter\u2019s algorithms are biased against conservative voices. His denials echoed recent statements he has made about the importance of exposing people to opposing political views. Indeed, he announced last month that Twitter was experimenting with new features that would actively expose people to such views.The link between social media and political polarization, however, presents a classic chicken-or-egg question: Do the accounts we follow on platforms such as Twitter shape our political views, or do we mostly follow accounts that reflect our views? We cannot know whether social media is a cause or a symptom of our deeply divided politics, unless, of course, we conduct a controlled experiment.In a study that was published last month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, my colleagues and I did just that. We surveyed more than 1,200 Twitter-using Republicans and Democrats about their political views. Then we paid half of them to follow for one month a bot we created that retweeted messages from elected officials and other opinion leaders from the other political party.Instead of reducing political polarization, being exposed to opposing ideas increased it. Republicans who followed a Democratic bot for one month expressed social policy views that were substantially more conservative at the conclusion of the study. Democrats who followed a Republican bot exhibited very slight increases in liberal attitudes about social issues, but those effects were not statistically significant.No single solution will reduce political polarization on social media. But a first step should be for Twitter to experiment with removing its character limits. Allowing people to voice their opinions in detail will not improve the civility of discourse by itself, but it may facilitate a better competition of ideas and increase the possibility for Democrats and Republicans to understand one another.Second, as our research indicates, Twitter should not force its users to view messages from a political party they oppose. Instead, it should create an alert system that makes people aware when they are being exposed predominantly to one point of view. The most pernicious effect of social media echo chambers may be that most people are unaware of how much their political views are influenced by selective exposure to information.Finally, if Twitter is resolved to expose users to opposing political views, it should focus on doing so with specific issues. Republican and Democratic Twitter users appear unready to have broad conversations about politics. But breaking up the echo chambers that prevent cross-party discussion about market-based solutions to climate change, for example, might be more successful.Some argue that social media sites will never provide the type of forum necessary to reduce political polarization and that we should focus on offline dialogue. Yet as social media continues to grow as a forum for political debate in our country, such solutions are not practical. We need to try something. But disrupting our Twitter echo chambers will most likely backfire.Christopher A. Bail is an associate professor of sociology and public policy at Duke University. Advertisement"}

Unfortunately, the chances are pretty good that Google will lose \u2014 that the court will order the company to make certain information harder to find. For example, if you are in the United States and you use Google to search for a New York Times article that has been removed from European versions of the search engine, that article will no longer appear in your results.We should be equally worried, however, about the prospect of platforms like Google and Facebook, with their international reach and pervasive role in our lives, doing the bidding of governments around the world.For now, very few countries are asking online platforms to enforce their national laws elsewhere. And the courts that are considering worldwide removal orders mostly sit in democratic and rights-respecting countries. That should give us some hope for better outcomes in those cases. But it also means that their decisions will carry a lot of weight, and set expectations for other national courts and lawmakers about their own power to make platforms globally remove content.Governments around the world know that while online platforms have historically enabled the free flow of information, that needn\u2019t be the case forever. Technical intermediaries can just as easily become choke points, shutting down communication on prohibited topics. Governments of any country have at least some leverage to make this happen: National internet service providers can cut off access entirely. In 2016, for example, Malaysia blocked the entire Medium blogging platform for refusing to delete a London-based journalist\u2019s accounts of corruption in the Malaysian government.That kind of showdown is rare, though. As a matter of both law and international relations, few countries are willing to insist that the rest of the world be bound by their rules. Things should stay that way \u2014 particularly among countries whose laws meet international human rights standards, and vary only in interpreting things like the balance between privacy and speech rights.We would all suffer under a system in which any country could export its own rules through private online platforms.

But deaths still vastly outnumber the rare successes. Ms. Szabo is a health reporter for Kaiser Health News. Facing incurable breast cancer at age 55, MaryAnne DiCanto put her faith in \u201cprecision medicine\u201d \u2014 in which doctors try to match patients with drugs that target the genetic mutations in their tumors. She underwent repeated biopsies to identify therapies that might help. \u201cShe believed in it wholeheartedly,\u201d said her husband, Scott Primiano of Amityville, N.Y. Around this point in the typical news report, readers would learn how Ms. DiCanto, mother to a blended family of five, took a chance on an experimental drug that no one expected to work. She would be the scrappy protagonist who beat the odds \u2014 allowing us to celebrate the triumph of modern science and worry a bit less about our own mortality.But there\u2019s a problem with talking about precision medicine for cancer this way: It misleads the public. Doctors and hospitals love to talk about the patients they\u2019ve saved with precision medicine, and reporters love to write about them. But the people who die still vastly outnumber the rare successes. \u201cThere are very few instances in which we can look at a genomic test and pick a drug off the shelf and say, \u2018That will work,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Nikhil Wagle, a cancer specialist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston who helped develop precision-medicine tests. \u201cThat\u2019s our goal in the long run, but in 2018 we\u2019re not there yet.\u201dMr. Primiano said: \u201cYou think it\u2019s going to be more precise, like a laser versus a shotgun. But it\u2019s still a shotgun.\u201dSome experts, like Dr. David Hyman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, say that such testing should be available to everyone with advanced cancer, because no one can predict which patients will have results that make them eligible for beneficial treatment. When patients respond to these drugs, they tend to do very well, and some survive much longer than expected.But Dr. Hyman acknowledged precision medicine \u201cis not addressing the needs of the majority of cancer patients.\u201d The studies received almost no news coverage.Many of the doctors I interview as a health care reporter are uncomfortable talking about patients who don\u2019t survive. They pivot to talking about people they\u2019ve saved. They rush past the disappointing present and fast-forward to a future in which every patient gets the treatment she or he needs. If you don\u2019t listen carefully, you could easily be led to believe those future cures are already here.Against this backdrop of hope and desperation, how are patients supposed to make informed decisions?Ms. DiCanto gave precision medicine everything she had, including biopsies from her lungs and liver, where her cancer had spread.Her first genomic test matched her to a newly approved drug she would have tried anyway, Mr. Primiano said. When it stopped working, she had another biopsy. That time, tests matched her to a drug that proved so toxic, it \u201cnearly killed her,\u201d he said. Additional tests matched Ms. DiCanto to drugs available only in clinical trials, but she wasn\u2019t eligible to participate in any of them. \u201cShe didn\u2019t give up,\u201d Mr. Primiano said. \u201cHer body gave up. Her body just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201dPaying for tests and treatments poses its own hurdles. Insurers sometimes refuse to cover genetic sequencing, or the nonstandard or experimental treatments that are subsequently recommended.Mr. Primiano, a flood insurance broker, said his family was able to handle the costs: $500,000 out of pocket on his wife\u2019s cancer care over 13 years. But managing his wife\u2019s cancer \u201cwas a full-time job \u2014 doing the research, finding the clinical trials, dealing with the insurance companies, managing the money.\u201dHe worries about people with fewer resources, especially patients tempted to drain their savings account to pay for a treatment with little to no chance of working.The phrase \u201cprecision medicine\u201d suggests a high rate of success. While its successes should be celebrated, its failures must be acknowledged, reminding us how much is left to learn. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend this is something it isn\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Primiano said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t try it.

Farms and canals scattered across swamplands. Highways traversing thickets of rain forest. These are among more than 61,000 ancient Mayan structures swallowed by overgrowth in the tropical lowlands of Guatemala that archaeologists have finally uncovered using a laser mapping technology called lidar.The ancient Maya flourished in what is today southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and western Honduras. They left behind a rich written history painted and inscribed on wood, stone and ceramics. Detailed in their intricate hieroglyphics were tales of kings, queens and war.Lidar is similar to sonar or radar, but it uses bursts of laser light to map an area.\u201cIt\u2019s basically like mowing the lawn. It\u2019s going back and forth, flying very parallel lines along the jungle,\u201d said Dr. Fern\u00e1ndez-D\u00edaz.The 3-D map they made revealed new settlements with houses and temples, defensive fortifications like ditches and moats, as well as agricultural terraces and roads.For him, the biggest surprise was uncovering vast areas of wetlands filled with channels and canals. \u201cAll of these hundreds of square kilometers of what we thought were unusable swamp were actually some of the most productive farmland.\u201dHe said when the Maya were there, their farms probably resembled what we see in present-day Southeast Asia.From the data, the team estimates there may have been about 7 to 11 million people living in the central Maya Lowlands during what was known as the Late Classic Period, which lasted from about 650 A.D. to about 800 A.D.\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about three to four times more people than you previously thought, you have to reconsider how they fed themselves, how they got along and how they handled being overcrowded,\u201d Dr. Garrison said.After constructing their map, members of the team revisited parts of the jungle that they had previously studied in order to verify that the structures they identified with lidar actually existed.

Perhaps your fingernails are not up to the task of breaking the seal on the plastic wrap. Or maybe the pop-up cap is a challenge, seemingly designed to be not only childproof but also adultproof. The foil covering the lip of the bottle may defy neat tearing. Then you struggle to remove every wisp of the cotton wad standing between you and the medicine. But odds are also good that, even if a bit annoyed, you are reassured. All those layers of protection mean you may reasonably trust that the pill you are about to pop is safe. As grim as the Tylenol deaths were, they endure as an example of how a corporation, Johnson & Johnson in this instance, took control of the calamity, came up with a strategy and, with surprising swiftness, regained trust it had lost. \u201cWe concluded we were never going to be judged by what caused the problem,\u201d said Alan Hilburg, a communications and branding consultant who was part of a public relations team enlisted by Johnson & Johnson. \u201cWe were always going to be judged on how we responded to it.\u201d The Tylenol episode remains a textbook illustration of effective crisis management, and yet its lessons are all too often forgotten by the corporate world. One after another in recent years, companies like Equifax, Wells Fargo, United Airlines, Facebook and Toyota have fumbled their way through scandals \u2014 self-inflicted wounds in the main. What they tend to have in common are responses regarded as too slow or too grudging. Or both. In the Tylenol case, Mary Kellerman became the first victim on the morning of Sept. 29, 1982. She was 12 years old. She had swallowed a capsule hoping to fend off a cold. Adam Janus, a postal worker, was next, a few hours later. His brother and sister-in-law, Stanley and Theresa Janus, soon died as well. Then so did Paula Prince, Mary McFarland and Mary Reiner. Their deaths touched off waves of dread nationwide, with Americans wondering if they could trust familiar products on grocery and pharmacy shelves. \u201cPeople were terrorized,\u201d Richard Brzeczek, a former superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, recalled for Retro Report. Investigators rapidly determined that the trouble was not in the manufacture of Tylenol. Stores were where the vulnerability lay. But what was behind the attacks? That was, and still is, a mystery. \u201cIt made no sense,\u201d said Tyrone C. Fahner, a former Illinois attorney general. \u201cThere was no clear and intended victim, but just anyone \u2014 anyone who happened to have the misfortune to buy a bottle of Tylenol.\u201d Suspicion fell on James W. Lewis, a tax consultant, who in October 1982 sent a letter to the drug manufacturer saying he would \u201cstop the killing\u201d if he was paid a million dollars. Arrested and then convicted, Mr. Lewis spent 12 years in federal prison for extortion. No case, however, was built against him for the deaths. (Eight years ago, he wrote a self-published novel somewhat brazenly titled \u201cPoison!: The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma.\u201d) Other men also fell under suspicion, but those investigations reached dead ends. In 1982, there was no dead end for Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of McNeil Consumer Products, which manufactured Tylenol. In short order, J. & J. ordered a nationwide recall of 31 million bottles, with a retail value of more than $100 million, equivalent to about $267 million today. The company took its television commercials off the air. It became clear, though, that the medication itself was fine. \u201cTylenol works,\u201d Mr. Hilburg told Retro Report. \u201cTrust was lost in the packaging because the packaging had enabled the poison, the cyanide, to be entered into the medicine.\u201d The company considered renaming Tylenol, a word that incorporates some of the letters from 4- (aceTYLamino) phENOL, a chemical name for acetaminophen, the drug\u2019s active ingredient. But a name change was rejected. Instead, a mere six weeks after the crisis flared, the company offered a different solution, a new bottle with the sorts of safety elements now familiar (if at times exasperating) to every shopper: cotton wad, foil seal, childproof cap, plastic strip. Capsules began to be replaced with caplets the following year. Johnson & Johnson was viewed as an exemplar of corporate responsibility, and enjoyed what some people described as the greatest comeback since Lazarus. Nowadays, all sorts of products come in containers deemed tamper-proof, or at least tamper-evident, meaning that consumers can readily tell if a seal has been broken or something else is amiss. It was a far cry from 1982, as Mr. Hilburg well knew. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing too many examples,\u201d he said, of companies letting situations worsen \u201csimply because they forgot the lesson that you\u2019re going not to be judged by what caused the crisis but by how you respond.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tiny Device Is a \u2018Huge Advance\u2019 for Treatment of Severe Heart Failure", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA clip used to repair damaged heart valves sharply reduced deaths among patients with a grim prognosis.Almost two million Americans have severe heart failure, and for them even mundane tasks can be extraordinarily difficult.With blood flow impeded throughout their bodies, patients may become breathless simply walking across a room or up stairs. Some must sleep sitting up to avoid gasping for air.Drugs may help to control the symptoms, but the disease takes a relentless course, and most people with severe heart failure do not have long to live. Until now, there has been little doctors can do.In a large clinical trial, doctors found that these patients also avoided additional hospitalizations and described a drastically improved quality of life with fewer symptoms.The results, reported at a medical meeting in San Diego and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, were far more encouraging than heart specialists had expected.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge advance,\u201d said Dr. Howard Herrmann, the director of interventional cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, which enrolled a few patients in the study. \u201cIt shows we can treat and improve the outcomes of a disease in a way we never thought we could.\u201dIf the device is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of severe heart failure, as expected, then insurers, including Medicare, most likely will cover it.In heart failure, the organ itself is damaged and flaccid, often as a consequence of a heart attack. The muscle pumps inefficiently, and in an attempt to compensate, the heart enlarges and becomes misshapen.The enlarged organ tugs apart the mitral valve, which controls blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The distorted valve functions poorly, its flaps swinging apart. Blood that is supposed to be pumped into the body backs up into the heart and lungs.A vicious cycle ensues: The heart enlarges, so the mitral valve leaks. The leaky mitral valve makes the heart enlarge even more, as it tries to compensate, and heart failure worsens.In the new study, a device called the MitraClip was used to repair the mitral valve by clipping its two flaps together in the middle. (The clip is made by Abbott, which funded the study; outside experts reviewed the trial data.)The result was to convert a valve that barely functioned into one able to regulate blood flow in and out of the heart.But that research included many patients with less severe valve problems, the procedure was not performed as adeptly, and the patients\u2019 medications were not as well optimized as in the new study.In the new trial, 614 patients with severe heart failure in the United States and Canada were randomly assigned to receive a MitraClip along with standard medical treatment or to continue with standard care alone.Among those who received only medical treatment, 151 were hospitalized for heart failure in the ensuing two years. Sixty-one died.In contrast, just 92 who got the device were hospitalized for heart failure during the period, and 28 died.The results have left leading researchers unexpectedly optimistic. The trial sends \u201ca very, very powerful message,\u201d said Dr. Gilbert Tang, a heart surgeon at Mount Sinai Medical Center, which enrolled a patient in the trial.Estimates of how many heart failure patients in the United States are like those in the trial range from 1.6 million to 2.5 million, Dr. Williams said. But, he adds, the number who might ultimately be treated will be less than the number who could be treated.The device itself costs about $30,000, not counting the cost of the hospital and doctors: a surgeon, an interventional cardiologist and an echocardiologist, among others, all in the operating room.Cardiologists said the study was impeccably executed.The doctors inserting the device first had to demonstrate their expertise doing so. An independent group of experts ascertained that patients\u2019 medical care was optimal; all too often, heart failure patients do not receive ideal treatment.Patients with severe heart failure often are gravely ill, too sick to have open-heart surgery to have mitral valves replaced. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the risk,\u201d said Dr. Gregg Stone of Columbia University Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, the study\u2019s principal investigator.(Dr. Stone reported no relevant conflicts, but said that Columbia University gets royalties from the sale of the MitraClip.)But the new procedure is much less invasive than open-heart surgery.A cardiologist threads the device to the heart through a blood vessel in the groin. Once it reaches the heart, the MitraClip is guided to the valve, and the device is used to clip the two flaps together. Not every cardiologist is equipped to insert the clip. \u201cThese are difficult procedures that require training and dedication,\u201d Dr. Herrmann said.During the procedure, for example, a tiny echocardiogram camera is placed into the patient\u2019s esophagus behind the heart to show where the catheter with the clip is going.Doctors must watch an X-ray screen and an echocardiogram as they guide the clip to the mitral valve. When the clip arrives, \u201cyou have to see where you are grasping to get a good result,\u201d Dr. Tang said.The device is already approved by the F.D.A. for patients too frail for surgery, but whose hearts are fine except for a mitral valve that does not function properly.Cardiologists predicted the F.D.A. would quickly approve the device for patients with severe heart failure, as well. It already is used in Europe for these patients, but there had been no rigorous studies showing it helped.The new trial promises to alter prospects for many people with severe heart failure who had relatively few options. \u201cThis will change how we treat these patients,\u201d Dr. Williams said.It\u2019s possible, he added, that many would fare even better with the valve repair procedure if they were not so frail when they got it.\u201cMaybe we need to start intervening earlier,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Apple Thrived in a Season of Tech Scandals", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut this year, as it begins to roll out a new set of iPhones, the story line surrounding Apple has improbably shifted. In an era of growing skepticism about the tech industry\u2019s impact on society, Apple\u2019s business model is turning out to be its most lasting advantage.Because Apple makes money by selling phones rather than advertising, it has been able to hold itself up as a guardian against a variety of digital plagues: a defender of your privacy, an agitator against misinformation and propaganda, and even a plausible warrior against tech addiction, a problem enabled by the very irresistibility of its own devices.Though it is already more profitable than any of its rivals, Apple appears likely to emerge even stronger from tech\u2019s season of crisis. In the long run, its growing strength could profoundly alter the industry.For years, start-ups aiming for consumer audiences modeled themselves on Google and Facebook, offering innovations to the masses at rock-bottom prices, if not for free. But there are limits to the free-lunch model.If Apple\u2019s more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech\u2019s dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks.\u201cBecause of Apple\u2019s business model \u2014 because their money comes from their profitable hardware \u2014 it has been much easier for them to make certain choices and certain arguments about how to address problems in the industry,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, a technology research firm.The thrust of Apple\u2019s message is simple: Paying directly for technology is the best way to ensure your digital safety, and every fresh danger uncovered online is another reason to invest in the Apple way of life.These aren\u2019t new arguments for Apple. While Google and Facebook pursued globe-spanning scale by offering free or cheap services supported by ads, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, was warning of the risks of an internet advertising market run amok.Though their businesses keep chugging along, Facebook and Google, the world\u2019s biggest internet ad companies, now face global scrutiny for the spread of disinformation, propaganda and what critics say is their products\u2019 destabilizing effects on politics and society.Amazon is beloved by customers, but its rapid growth has spurred economywide anxieties about the future of jobs. All three behemoths are considered growing targets for antitrust prosecution in the United States and elsewhere.Apple\u2019s business model, by contrast, insulates it from most of the tech fears that have emerged in the last few years. Although it makes the vast majority of the profits in the global smartphone business, Apple\u2019s phones account for a minority of sales, blunting fears of monopoly.Apple\u2019s high prices also set up an expectation of safety, giving it a freer hand to police online properties like its app store, podcast directory and news app. A decade ago, when Mr. Jobs imposed rules on the iOS App Store banning scammy and pornographic apps, he was called a prude. Now his rules seem prescient.Its commitment to curating online experiences has also turned Apple into something like a moral arbiter for tech. When Apple decided to bar the right-wing conspiracist Alex Jones from its services this summer, it cut through much of the hand-wringing in the industry over Mr. Jones\u2019s antics. Many other tech companies immediately followed its move.Apple has not entirely escaped criticism in the Trump era. Its reliance on China, where it makes its products and expects to see much of its growth, and where its products abide by government censors, looks to be a rising liability.Even when Apple\u2019s products have been directly implicated in tech worries, its business model has helped it weather the storm. Consider the rising fears of \u201ctech addiction,\u201d the idea that kids and adults are spending too much mindless time in the digital world, egged on by tech companies\u2019 insatiable need for our eyeballs.In January, a pair of large Apple investors, Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, wrote an open letter to Apple urging the company to address the issue. Charles Penner, a partner at Jana, told me that the campaign had targeted Apple because the company had every reason to respond.\u201cThe biggest source of strength that Apple has is their ability to charge premium prices for their products,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir value depends on people feeling safe and supported within their ecosystem.\u201dAnd, in fact, Apple responded. The company told the investors that it believed the overuse of tech was a serious issue, and that it had been working on it. In the summer, it unveiled a series of widely praised features meant to allow adults to police their own and their kids\u2019 smartphone habits.Google, apparently spurred by the same campaign, offered similar features for its Android phones. Mr. Penner told me that he appreciated the companies\u2019 efforts, though he expects to keep pushing them to reduce their devices\u2019 addictiveness.Apple\u2019s safety-first business model may become only more important as technology becomes even more intimate. The company\u2019s latest phones can be unlocked with your face, while its watch includes sophisticated sensors to monitor your movements and your health. In pushing these and other advances, the company can reasonably argue that only its ad-free business can protect such sensitive information.But it is worth noting that Apple\u2019s model isn\u2019t available to everyone. In the spring, after Mr. Cook took a few swipes at Facebook\u2019s scandals, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, pointed out the inherent limits in Apple\u2019s model.Since then, Apple has raised the prices of its top-end phones, and as the smartphone market slows, the company\u2019s pristine haven from the dangers of online life might get only more expensive.Inequality is the story of our age, and it\u2019s no surprise that it could become the dominant story line of tech, too. As the digital world gets scarier, Apple\u2019s technology may come to resemble a high-priced oasis for the world\u2019s rich. Everyone else takes their chances on a free lunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Instagram\u2019s Co-Founders to Step Down From Company", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, the co-founders of the photo-sharing app Instagram, have resigned and plan to leave the company in the coming weeks, adding to the challenges facing Instagram\u2019s parent company, Facebook.Mr. Systrom, Instagram\u2019s chief executive, and Mr. Krieger, the chief technical officer, notified Instagram\u2019s leadership team and Facebook on Monday of their decision to leave, said people with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger did not give a reason for stepping down, according to the people, but said they planned to take time off after leaving Instagram. Mr. Systrom, 34, and Mr. Krieger, 32, have known each other since 2010, when they met and transformed a software project built by Mr. Systrom into what eventually became Instagram, which now has more than one billion users.\u201cWe\u2019re planning on taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again,\u201d Mr. Systrom said. \u201cBuilding new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us and match that with what the world needs; that\u2019s what we plan to do.\u201dMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, praised the Instagram founders in a statement and said that he wished them \u201call the best and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what they build next.\u201dIn Silicon Valley, reaction to the Instagram founders\u2019 resignation was swift.\u201cWow,\u201d tweeted John Lilly, a venture capitalist at Greylock, calling the exits \u201ca real moment.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat an impact they\u2019ve had on all of us.\u201dInstagram was founded in 2010 and at first was a location check-in app called Burbn. Mr. Krieger, an enthusiastic user of Burbn, met Mr. Systrom at a Stanford University fellowship program and they decided to work together. Eventually, Burbn was retooled and renamed Instagram.Instagram became popular in Silicon Valley almost immediately. The app heavily emphasized the use of a smartphone camera as iPhones were being widely adopted, turning everyday people into amateur photographers. Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger popularized photo filters and camera lenses, spurring a wave of copycat apps for the iPhone and Android-based smartphones.The duo worked out of a small office in the South Park neighborhood of San Francisco. Instagram spent a lot of money in its early years just trying to keep its app online as its servers struggled under the constant stream of new user sign-ups.Instagram eventually caught the eye of Mr. Zuckerberg, who realized how powerful Instagram\u2019s nascent photo-sharing network would become, and saw the wealth of photo-sharing activity across his own social network. Mr. Zuckerberg handled the negotiations with Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger largely on his own.\u201cFor years, we\u2019ve focused on building the best experience for sharing photos with your friends and family,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post about the deal. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll be able to work even more closely with the Instagram team to also offer the best experiences for sharing beautiful mobile photos with people based on your interests.\u201dThe deal immediately turned Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger into millionaires many times over. Instagram has since been valued at 100 times that $1 billion acquisition price by Bloomberg Intelligence, a sizable return on investment on paper.But Instagram remained Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s main success story. As Facebook saw a threat in young people departing the network for Snapchat, a rival photo-sharing network, Instagram was quick to shift and recreate one of Snapchat\u2019s key features of online stories. Since then, Instagram has surged further in popularity, while Snapchat\u2019s growth has been inconsistent.The departures of Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger create uncertainty around the app. It is unclear who will lead the company on the founders\u2019 departures, and if that person can continue Instagram\u2019s longstanding success streak. Marne Levine, who was previously Instagram\u2019s chief operating officer, left her role at Instagram earlier this month to return to Facebook and lead partnerships.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Tariffs Corrupt Again", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump has perverted the process and undermined U.S. credibility.Opinion ColumnistIn normal times, Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, bringing us closer to an all-out trade war, would have dominated headlines for days. Things being as they are, it was a below-the-fold story, drowned out by all the other scandals underway.Yet Trump\u2019s tariffs really are a big, bad deal. Their direct economic impact will be modest, although hardly trivial. But the numbers aren\u2019t the whole story. Trumpian trade policy has, almost casually, torn up rules America itself created more than 80 years ago \u2014 rules intended to ensure that tariffs reflected national priorities, not the power of special interests.The costs of this free-for-all went beyond economics: They undermined U.S. influence and damaged the world as a whole. Most notably, in the years after World War I, America demanded that European nations repay their war debts, which meant that they had to earn dollars through exports \u2014 and at the same time America imposed high tariffs to block those necessary exports.This U.S. innovation became the template for a global trading system, culminating in the creation of the World Trade Organization. And tariff policy went from being famously dirty to remarkably clean.Now, the creators of this trading system knew that it needed some flexibility to remain politically viable. So governments were given the right to impose tariffs under a limited set of circumstances: to give industries time to cope with import surges, to respond to unfair foreign practices, to protect national security. And in the U.S. the power to impose these special-case tariffs was vested in the executive branch, on the understanding that this power would be used sparingly and judiciously.Then came Trump.Even the big China announcement, supposedly a response to unfair Chinese trade practices, was basically a put-up job. China is often a bad actor in the international economy. But this kind of retaliatory tariff is supposed to be a response to specific policies, and offer the targeted government a clear way to satisfy U.S. demands. What Trump did was instead to lash out based mainly on a vague sense of grievance, with no end game in sight.So what are the criteria for these exemptions? Nobody knows, but there is every reason to believe that political favoritism is running wild.Beyond that, America has thrown away its negotiating credibility. In the past, countries signing trade agreements with the United States believed that a deal was a deal. Now they know that whatever documents the U.S. may sign supposedly guaranteeing access to its market, the president will still feel free to block their exports, on specious grounds, whenever he feels like it.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistAnd then there were three.Swetnick, the latest accuser, described Kavanaugh as a \u201cmean drunk.\u201dThis is explosive, extraordinary stuff.However, Kavanaugh has categorically denied that any of this ever happened.I must say that I found his specification of sexual \u201cintercourse\u201d interesting here. First, sexual assault doesn\u2019t require intercourse. Second, one can be sexually intimate \u2014 or sexually violated \u2014 without intercourse. That struck me as a bit of carefully chosen lawyer-speak.To be clear, these accusations don\u2019t paint Kavanaugh as just a cad, but as a lascivious predator. If these things are true, not only must he never be seated on the Supreme Court, he must also lose his current judgeship.\u201cI spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now.\u201dBut he still denies sexual misconduct.Either these women are all lying about Kavanaugh, or he is lying in his denial. But the one thing that is absolutely true here is that someone is lying, and multiple people may be doing so.Democrats are banking on much the same, but there is also a principled and moral argument, aside from political posturing, to allow all three accusers to testify under oath, to call additional witnesses and to order an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Indeed, at this point, the lying is as consequential as the accusations. Kavanaugh has so categorically denied the accusations, leaving no room whatsoever for the possibility that they are true, that one must assume that he is absolutely convinced of his own innocence, or, instead, that he\u2019s a bona fide psychopath, like the man who nominated him.The latter is a possibility that we cannot risk, not with the future of the court hanging in the balance.We must grind this process to a halt until we have exhausted every possible investigative option and every fact has been uncovered.Not doing so is a dereliction of duty and a betrayal of the country that threatens to further and irreparably damage the integrity of the court.But of course the members of this Republican Party, strung out on Trumpism, care nothing about duty and patriotism. They care only about appeasing Trump\u2019s base, delivering him a justice who believes in insulating presidents from prosecution and in realizing a decades-old Republican fever dream of achieving a solid conservative majority on the court.But it seems that Kavanaugh, Trump and Republicans in the Senate do not want to put in any of the time or work to find that truth. Instead, we\u2019ve been promised a show hearing, a competition of narratives and styles of presentation, a contest of contrivances from which we are expected to judge credibility.This is a sham, and Republicans should be ashamed. However, one cannot display what one does not possess. This is a brazen attempt to smother truth in order to advance the career of a man who would spend the rest of his life tasked with discerning truth.They want to anoint a justice by miscarrying justice.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to Say When Someone Asks Why You Aren\u2019t Breast-Feeding", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "It\u2019s a deeply personal question that can challenge a person\u2019s worldview.Supported byWhen you are a new mother, there are two things you will be asked about constantly, your baby and your boobs \u2014 specifically, if you are feeding your baby with them.If the answer is yes, you\u2019ll often get a hearty \u201cGood for you!\u201d and a few good-natured comments about how sore and chafed your nipples must be.But if the answer is no, the conversation often awkwardly ends there. Your questioner may try to brush aside your response with a \u201cYeah, formula makes things so much easier,\u201d but deep down you get the sense you\u2019re being judged. You feel insecure. You start to judge yourself and your ability to parent. And it all devolves from there:I know about this experience because I fall into the category of mothers who did not breast-feed. At first, I would try to brush off the question. \u201cI\u2019m trying!\u201d I\u2019d say with a good-natured grimace. \u201cBoy, am I trying!\u201d\u201cThere are certainly acknowledged benefits, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d said Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, a clinical professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale School of Medicine.\u201cThe problem is that breast-feeding is not an easy thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely time-consuming and even if you work in the most hospitable environment for allowing breast-feeding, it\u2019s hard to do when you\u2019re back at work.\u201d \u201cLike most women, I've had my share of negative sexual experiences, and some of that involved breasts in particular,\u201d she said. \u201cViscerally speaking, the idea of breast-feeding just never made me feel safe.\u201d She added: \u201cAfter sharing my body with my daughter for nine months, I needed to reclaim it to feel safe again.\u201dIf you\u2019re not breast-feeding for whatever reason, and want to answer the question \u201cWhy not?\u201d without getting defensive about it, here are a few things that could help.With the possible exception of your child\u2019s pediatrician, no one is entitled to know how you are feeding your baby: period, end of story. And if you decided when you had your baby that breast-feeding just wasn\u2019t for you, that is absolutely fine, and you don\u2019t owe anyone any insight into the reasons behind your decision. So if someone asks you why you didn\u2019t want to breast-feed, just give them a Larry David-esque, \u201cEh, not for me,\u201d and change the subject. You don\u2019t have to be judgmental (\u201cEw! Breast-feeding! Gross!\u201d) or combative (\u201cI formula-fed. You got a problem with that?\u201d). If you adopt a light and flippant tone, you\u2019ll make it clear to the person who\u2019s asking the question that it\u2019s just not on the table for discussion. For many mothers who wanted to breast-feed but found that it didn\u2019t work out for them, being asked whether or not you\u2019re breast-feeding can be re-traumatizing, even if the person who asks the question has only the best intentions at heart. \u201cWhen people say, \u2018What happened?\u2019, you can say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it, but thank you,\u2019\u201d advised Birdie Gunyon Meyer, a former lactation consultant and counselor at Postpartum Support International who treats women who struggle with postpartum depression or postpartum anxiety.Ms. Meyer added that it is \u201cbeyond common\u201d for women with postpartum depression to report struggles with breast-feeding. She teaches women who struggled with breast-feeding to say, \u201cI wanted to breast-feed, but it didn\u2019t work out for us.\u201d When you tell someone that breast-feeding didn\u2019t work out for you, sometimes their initial reaction is to go into recommendation mode: Have you tried this position, or that pump or that nipple shield? This can even happen long after your baby is post-nursing age.To minimize your time fending off unsolicited \u201chelpful tips,\u201d Sarah Eichler, a lactation consultant based in Brooklyn, suggests being terse but polite. \u201cSay: \u2018Oh, great, that worked for you. Thanks so much for your input.\u2019 Or, \u2018Thanks for sharing that with me,\u2019\u201d she said.If you decide that you do not want to breast-feed before you give birth, you should make that clear to your gynecologist well before you deliver, so the doctor can communicate your wishes to the hospital, Dr. Alyssa Dweck, a gynecologist based in New York, said.Your hospital attendant might ask if you\u2019re sure about your decision, but \u201cthe conversation should stop there,\u201d she said.If you feel pressured by your doctor to try nursing, consider that it might be worth picking another one. \u201cWhen we were picking our pediatrician during pregnancy, I got a surprising amount of resistance about my choice not to breast-feed,\u201d Ms. Mullen-McWilliams said. \u201cThe first pediatrician we met said he was O.K. if we chose not to vaccinate, but that breast-feeding really was best and he\u2019d feel better if I made an effort to do it.\u201d She eventually found a doctor who was open to her feeding plan, but \u201cit was so stressful to interview pediatricians and talk about my breast-feeding preferences at the same time.\u201dAt a certain point, I got so tired of explaining why I wasn\u2019t breast-feeding that I fantasized about showing a three-minute montage of the most emotionally draining moments of me trying and failing to get Sol to latch, sort of the same way aspiring actors in Hollywood give their reels to producers when they see them out at lunch.I briefly toyed with the idea of writing an earnest, overly involved Facebook post explaining my decision to stop trying to breast-feed, or making a \u201c#DontAskAboutMyBreasts\u201d sticker to wear on my jacket when I was out with my baby. But in the end, I realized I was so busy trying to come up with a concise, creative answer to the question that I had totally forgotten it wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business in the first place. After all, no one asked me about my nipples before I became a parent. Why should that suddenly change now?Dr. Smita Malhotra, a pediatrician who also struggled to breast-feed her children, said you do not owe anyone an explanation or any insight into your own difficult breast-feeding journey.\u201cAt first, I did come up with long explanations such as \u2018I\u2019m not making enough milk even though I tried all these things\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m having difficulty latching even though I tried all these different positions,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut what I found with these responses is that I was already shaming myself before anyone else had a chance to do so. This felt incredibly self-defeating.\u201dMs. Malhotra eventually settled on telling people: \u201c\u2018My baby is being fed. And breast-feeding is not for me right now.\u2019\u201d This response, she said, \u201chelped me to own my decision instead of throwing it out there with explanations for someone else to judge.\u201dIt still hurts to think about how when I was at my most physically and emotionally vulnerable, people \u2014 knowingly or not \u2014 made me feel guilty over something I ultimately could not control. Few people had said the one thing I wanted to hear: that if I was terribly unhappy, and breast-feeding wasn\u2019t working out for me, that it was totally O.K. to stop.My son, Sol, is now 18 months old. He\u2019s a little on the small side, and considering he currently uses the same word to describe a dog, a cat and a monkey, he is probably (as of now, at least) not a good candidate for admission to any Ivy League institution. It\u2019s unclear whether my giving him more of my breast milk would have changed that, but I do know that he is extremely healthy and happy and breaks out into a heart-melting grin whenever his mom or dad come home from work, or when he tries to grab our cat\u2019s tail.Ultimately, my one regret from the first few precious months after his birth is not that I failed to breast-feed him, but that I spent so much time explaining why I wasn\u2019t.Advertisement"}

Can we sustain the stare?Ms. Weiss is a writer and an editor in the Opinion section.This Tuesday at sundown, millions of people around the world will participate in a dress rehearsal for their deaths.They will abstain from eating and drinking and making love, since corpses can do none of those things. They will utter a variation of the confessional that they will say on their death beds. And many of them will wear white, like the shrouds they will be buried in.I\u2019ll be one of them.Most people, including many Jews, think of Yom Kippur as a 25-hour caffeine headache capped off by a lox-and-bagels binge. It\u2019s undeniably that.But it is also, at its deepest level, a dry run. It is the one day of the year when we Jews are asked to look our mortality in the face.The day asks us to sustain the stare.I am a serial denier.I try not to be. I tell myself: You are going to die. I repeat it. I grasp it for a second or two, but then it escapes me and I\u2019m back to before. I find that those people I know who have come closer to death are able to hold onto the truth a bit more firmly.One of them is my friend David Wolpe, the rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles. David has had two bouts with cancer. Each diagnosis, he told me, reminded him that he didn\u2019t have forever. \u201cI had to decide, do I even still want to be a rabbi? For me it was wonderful and affirming to find out I really do,\u201d he said.Yom Kippur is meant to perform the same function. \u201cThere\u2019s a wonderful quote from Sartre\u2019s \u2018The Wall\u2019 where the guy is about to be executed and he says, \u2018I lived as if I had forever.\u2019 And the point of Yom Kippur is to remind you as forcefully as possible that you don\u2019t have forever,\u201d David told me. \u201cWe all live with a gun to our head and no one knows when it\u2019s going to go off.\u201dCan we remain aware of the loaded gun? There\u2019s an app for that. Seriously.Six months ago, Angela Buchdahl, the rabbi of Central Synagogue in Manhattan, downloaded it. She says it helps. \u201cThe fact that the app is random and comes at any moment is part of what makes it compelling,\u201d she said. \u201cIt surprises you.\u201d Just like death.\u201cThe app is the digital version of a teaching I love from a 19th-century rabbi, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv. He said, \u2018Remembering death in the proper way can bring a person to the ultimate joy.\u2019\u201dShe\u2019s planning on mentioning all of this on Tuesday night in her sermon, which is about a seeming paradox: that thinking about your death can bring you much closer to experiencing true joy. It \u201ccompels us to squeeze out every bit of life out of every day that we have,\u201d she says.When the sun sets on Wednesday night most of us will still be here. We will be ravenous. Will we have the courage to direct our appetite not just to good food, but to good life?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Revolution, Too, Will Eat Its Children", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat this frenzied national inquest means for our civic culture.Opinion ColumnistIt wasn\u2019t long ago that Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court hinged, as it must, on his qualifications as a judge. Then, necessarily, it became a question of his fitness as a man.Now it\u2019s turned into an exhumation of his antics \u2014 real, alleged, rumored or merely insinuated \u2014 as a high school and college student. However this ends for him, it may not end up too well for the rest of us.And then there is the latest allegation, from a woman named Julie Swetnick via the attorney Michael Avenatti, that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge used drugs and alcohol to inebriate women at parties so they could be gang-raped \u201cby a \u2018train\u2019 of numerous boys.\u201d Swetnick alleges she was raped at one such party, and now the left-wing CREDO Action network has a statement: \u201cWe believe Julie Swetnick.\u201d It\u2019s worth pausing to consider what this frenzied national inquest could mean for the future of our civic culture.Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s credibility rests heavily on the fact that she vividly described details of the alleged assault, named witnesses, and told several people about them long before Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. It\u2019s because she has been able to supply this level of corroboration that her claims deserve to be taken with the utmost seriousness, both by the media and the Senate.In the post-Kavanaugh world, however, we have new editorial standards. The Gawker standards.These are: Report first, verify later (if ever). Use the accumulation of unproven accusations as evidence of their plausibility, rather than as charges to be investigated separately or as variations of the same fundamental untruth. Apply a presumption of guilt standard to the people you oppose, and a presumption of innocence standard to the people you favor. Hear something you like about someone you don\u2019t \u2014 what used to be known as gossip \u2014 and repackage it as \u201cnews.\u201dIf journalists don\u2019t understand why this is destructive to our profession, they have no business being in it.Equally destructive is the effect the post-Kavanaugh standard could have on governance. Will every future Supreme Court or cabinet nominee, Republican or Democratic, be expected to account, in minute and excruciating detail, for his behavior and reputation as a teenager? Is it now fair game to draw moral inferences about a nominee because he went to an elite prep school, or was a member of a rowdy fraternity, or said something mean and dumb in his yearbook, or drank somewhat more than he would like to admit?In an age in which our digital footprints are all-but unerasable, such an accounting will become increasingly easy to furnish, and hence to demand. There are advantages to this kind of radical transparency. But it\u2019s hard to imagine who \u2014 except for the odd souls who are either morally stainless or utterly shameless \u2014 would want to be subjected to the ordeal.Would you?But this is not what the Kavanaugh nomination seems to be about anymore. To half the country, it\u2019s about the future of a Supreme Court nominee, pure and simple. To the other half, it\u2019s about that \u2014 as well as a paradigm shift in the culture, belated reparation for unequal treatment, and a battle in the service of a moral revolution.Much to the good. Then again, it\u2019s worth remembering that revolutions borne by high ideals have a habit of eating their children. If the price of this revolution is the subordination of ordinary fairness to abstract justice, the elevation of rumor over fact, the further debasement of journalism, the devaluation of the rights of the accused, and the complete toxification of public service, it will be a price too high.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Seeking Human Generosity\u2019s Origins in an Ape\u2019s Gift to Another Ape", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterStudying the behavior of our closest living relatives may help scientists better understand the human impulse for generosity.How generous is an ape? It\u2019s a hard question for scientists to tackle, but the answer could tell us a lot about ourselves.People in every culture can be generous, whether they\u2019re lending a cellphone to an office mate or sharing an antelope haunch with a hungry family.While it\u2019s easy to dwell on our capacity for war and violence, scientists see our generosity as a remarkable feature of our species. \u201cOne of the things that stands out about humans is how helpful we are,\u201d said Christopher Krupenye, a primate behavior researcher at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.This generosity may have been crucial to the survival of our early ancestors who lived in small bands of hunter-gatherers.\u201cWhen our own attempts to find food are unsuccessful, we rely on others to share food with us \u2014 otherwise we starve,\u201d said Jan Engelmann, a researcher at G\u00f6ttingen University.To understand the origin of this impulse \u2014 known as prosociality \u2014 a number of researchers have turned to our closest living relatives. For example, a new study involving bonobo apes suggests that the roots of human generosity run deep, but only came into full flower over the course of the evolution of our species.Roughly seven million years ago, our lineage split from the ancestors of chimpanzees and their cousin species, bonobos. Chimpanzees and bonobos share a common ancestor that lived about two million years ago.These two closely related species of apes look almost identical to the untrained eye. But they have evolved some intriguing differences in their behavior, including which objects \u2014 food or tools \u2014 prompt them to behave with generosity. They proved to be generous \u2014 to a point.The researchers designed an experiment that could provide strong evidence that bonobos could give things to each other simply out of generosity \u2014 rather than being pressured into doing so, or expecting some sort of immediate payback.\u201cWould they do it if there was no benefit to them?\u201d asked Brian Hare, a primatologist at Duke University who helped run the study.For their experiment, the researchers took advantage of the fact that the Lola Ya Bonobo apes have learned to crack open palm nuts with rocks. Without a rock, they have to gnaw on the nuts for a long time to get them out of their shell.The scientists put one bonobo in a cage with five nuts. In an adjacent cage, a second bonobo \u2014 a stranger to the first one \u2014 had two rocks, but no nuts. The cages were connected by a window.The bonobos were free to bring gifts to the window to give to each other \u2014 or to ignore their neighbor.But the bonobos in the other cage almost never returned the favor. They refused to pass one of their rocks through the window.In another experiment, Dr. Krupenye got to experience their lack of generosity firsthand.Each bonobo would sit in a cage, with a mesh wall hanging in front of the door to the hallway. A colleague would slip a stick into the cage near the bonobo and leave.Then Dr. Krupenye would come to the doorway and beg for the stick. He would reach out his arm, plaintively calling the bonobo\u2019s name.The bonobos almost never handed Dr. Krupenye the stick. In fact, sometimes they seemed to tease him.\u201cThey will put it through the mesh a little bit and then pull it back when I\u2019m trying to reach for it,\u201d said Dr. Krupenye.\u201cChimps are really reluctant to give food away,\u201d Dr. Warneken said.On the other hand, when it comes to tools, chimpanzees turn out to be generous. They\u2019ll give stones to other chimpanzees. In the stick-begging experiment, they\u2019ll help humans out.\u201cThe same species that will not help you get food will help you get an object,\u201d said Dr. Hare.It\u2019s possible that the separate evolutionary paths of bonobos and chimpanzees have shaped their generosity. Chimpanzees live in habitats where food is often scarce. They have to compete for food, and groups of chimpanzees will sometimes even engage in warlike conflicts over territory.Chimpanzees have also learned a lot of clever strategies for using tools to get food. In addition to cracking nuts with rocks, some chimpanzees kill monkeys with wooden spears. Others fish for termites with carefully fashioned poles.Bonobos, by contrast, live in forests where food is far more abundant. \u201cIt\u2019s paradise \u2014 the stuff just falls off the trees,\u201d said Dr. Warneken.Adapting to this ecosystem, bonobos may have become more tolerant of each other. They recognize the value of food to others, and don\u2019t feel an urge to hoard it for themselves.But bonobos also seem to be less adept with tools. In the wild, they\u2019ve never been observed to crack nuts with a rock or fish termites with a stick.\u201cThey may just not have a deep-seated understanding of tools,\u201d said Dr. Warneken.Chimpanzees may be unable to override their selfish tendencies about food. On the other hand, Dr. Warneken said, they may recognize the importance of tools for other chimpanzees.Dr. Warneken and other researchers have carried out similar studies on children. They\u2019ve found that even babies will spontaneously offer both food and objects to adults.The work of Dr. Krupenye and others makes it clear that humans aren\u2019t unique in their generosity. It\u2019s possible that our common ancestor with bonobos and chimpanzees were already prosocial, at least to a limited extent. And now our generosity expands beyond what he and other scientists observe in our closest relatives.\u201cWe\u2019re really good at realizing when other individuals could benefit from something,\u201d said Dr. Hare.This versatility may have evolved early in our lineage, producing traits that encouraged more sharing. It leads toddlers to have generous inclinations without any coaching.Dr. Warneken notes that around five years old, children become more aware of their prosocial actions. They know that being generous is good for their reputation.It\u2019s possible that after our ancestors evolved the tendency to be generous, they then evolved a brain capable of understanding norms. In turn, humans came to see the benefits of being generous.\u201cIt\u2019s no longer the same kind of motivation that we would find in other animals,\u201d he said. \u201cNow there is some kind of obligation to share with others.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m definitely not opening a five-star restaurant any time soon, but after my freshman negative five \u2014 yes, I actually lost weight \u2014 I realized I couldn\u2019t just turn my nose up at food I don\u2019t like. For now, I\u2019ve been getting pretty creative in the dining hall. One day, I\u2019ll have to actually figure out how to make food for my tastes and needs.You slip an egg into the prepared ramen, and it cooks in the heat. You can put American cheese on there and then it melts. It\u2019s essentially oil, which has been whipped into a plastic form. When it melts it becomes this weird, stringy deliciousness. Sesame seeds, or the Japanese condiment furikake can go in there. Add in some cut scallions. You\u2019ve just cooked. You\u2019ve made something better than it was.The secret that people don\u2019t tell you in college when they\u2019re still trying to make you believe that cooking is complicated is that there\u2019s really only like 11 recipes in the whole world. Right? It\u2019s not that complicated. You\u2019re either going to broil it, roast it or steam it, or in the case of the ramen, reconstitute it. So with the broiler in the toaster oven, you can do a lot.Get the most basic, restaurant-style tongs you can find.This interview has been edited and condensed.Laura Masgula, a recent graduate from N.Y.U., sent us a problem to figure out this week:I\u2019d love to hear how people just out of college are balancing work, friends, family, exercise, extracurriculars, etc. while still attempting to eat well, sleep and budget. It\u2019s been a challenge trying to manage everything personally so getting some advice or just being able to hear from others would be valuable.Nushrat Rahman:Having been out of school for over five months and I\u2019m now realizing how all-consuming school was for me. I juggled community organizing, internships, friendships and family commitments along the way. All of this took a toll on my physical health \u2014 my acne was out of control \u2014 and my mental health spiraled to the point where I was in a perpetual bubble of anxiety. People around me noticed. My spirituality took a hit as well.Now, I\u2019m careful not to fall into the habits from a few months ago. Some good advice I got from a mentor once was to undercommit and over-deliver. I\u2019m trying to live by that mantra daily. I try my hardest to nail down the basics in my day, like food, sleep and five daily prayers. I then prioritize everything else around those three elements, whether it\u2019s work, freelancing or community organizing.Robbie Harms:The biggest thing I\u2019ve learned since I graduated in 2015 is to carve out some daily, uninterrupted me time. For me, that takes the form of running. Every day, no matter how much stuff I have to do and how much time I don\u2019t have to do it, I try to run \u2014 around seven miles a day. Sometimes it\u2019s gloriously mind-clearing, and other times it\u2019s not very fun at all. But without fail, I\u2019m always glad I did it.Maybe you like to draw, or read or watch TV, or just simply sit and talk. I\u2019ve learned that the most important thing with whatever you choose, though, is to do it as consistently as possible \u2014 every day if you can. That way it becomes as ingrained in your daily routine as brushing your teeth. One more thing: I deleted my Facebook account on Jan. 1, and I haven\u2019t missed it yet.Karina Balan Julio:I\u2019ve accepted that in some weeks I\u2019ll be more effective in some areas than in others, and that no matter how much I plan my days, some things will take more time than I originally expected. For instance: There are weeks where I have to work a little bit longer to get everything under control at my job, so I end up exercising less and postponing other activities I planned for myself. In others, I\u2019m super healthy and everything is fine with my extracurricular studies and at work, but my apartment\u2019s a bit messy, and I may have some unexpected expenses. Sleep, though, is not negotiable for me. I feel like I need to sleep at least six hours a day, otherwise everything else won\u2019t work.Ian Caveny:I\u2019ve been out of undergrad (though not out of school) since 2013, married since 2014, and a parent since 2016, and I am beginning to understand that one of the truths of this stage of life is learning how to \u201csurf.\u201d Having a balanced life does not look like trying to make my life still, it\u2019s about learning the skills necessary to stay on the surfboard when there\u2019s a big wave.Omar Pablo:Ebony Miranda:Don\u2019t feel like you have to fill up all of your time! It can be hard to adjust to the slower pace of things post-college, but the beauty of not being in school is that everything you do is usually on your own time.

{"Headline": "What Does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Think About the South China Sea?", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rising left needs more foreign policy. Here\u2019s how it can start.Mr. Bessner is a historian of American foreign policy.As the insurgent left wing of the Democratic Party captures headlines and wins votes, many of its supporters are coalescing around a growing set of policy priorities: universal health care, higher taxes on the rich, the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But when it comes to matters of war and peace and to America\u2019s place in the world, the left is either silent or confused.To be fair, there are good reasons leftists haven\u2019t grappled much with foreign policy. For one, there are few decision makers from whom they can learn: Since the early days of the Cold War, foreign policymaking has been dominated by a bipartisan commitment to militarism and American hegemony; those who depart from the consensus view have largely been kept out of the State Department, the Pentagon and other parts of the government. At the same time, the left itself lacks institutions dedicated to developing foreign policy ideas. While Republicans and moderate Democrats have a host of think tanks pushing interventionism, no corporation or billionaire has yet decided to fund a left-wing foreign policy think tank to which politicians could turn for advice.But if the left wing of the Democratic Party wants to be taken seriously, it must speak convincingly about security and diplomacy. Without core, identifiable beliefs about foreign affairs, left-wing politicians will either embarrass themselves or repeat some version of the tired conventional wisdom. Moreover, there is an opportunity here: Just as many Americans are fed up with the economic status quo, so too are they fed up with business as usual in foreign policy.A foreign policy for the left won\u2019t emerge overnight. A conversation is just starting to take place, and it will continue as more socialists win power and shape American politics. Though a concrete agenda remains a ways off, there are five broad principles that merge the left\u2019s commitment to egalitarianism and democracy with a sober analysis of the limits of American power.The American foreign policy establishment is notoriously forgiving \u2014 of itself. Rarely are policymakers held to account when they offer bad advice, such as supporting a disastrous war in Iraq or helping organize torture or assassinations. This amnesia has plagued Democrats and Republicans alike.This unaccountability cannot continue. A system that does not punish poor foreign-policy making is a system doomed to repeat its mistakes. Politicians on the left should make this a core tenet of their approach to foreign policy by promising that when they are elected, they will hold decision makers and advisers professionally accountable.But professional accountability is not enough. The left should demand that those who violated domestic or international law see justice, even if that means prosecuting them. It will enable the left to demonstrate to both the American people and the international community that it is serious about the rule of law.We can bring our troops home and cut the military budget because the United States doesn\u2019t face any serious external challengers. North Korea, Iran, the Islamic State, Russia and China can\u2019t challenge American sovereignty in the ways Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union once did. While there are admittedly serious global threats, none are existential and none are unmanageable. But for too long, politicians have inflated international threats to justify military adventurism, boost military spending, increase domestic surveillance and campaign on a politics of fear.The left should change that. Candidates and policymakers alike should educate the public about the United States\u2019 relative safety. Such education will encourage a military drawdown, engender a more honest domestic politics and protect Americans\u2019 civil liberties.The left should also commit itself to reducing global economic inequality by reordering the hierarchical relationships that benefit rich countries over poor ones. For example, the left should not allow American-led corporations to use underpaid and abused workers to produce inexpensive products. Policymakers should also prevent the wealthy from avoiding taxation by working with foreign countries to shutter tax havens.Finally, the left should take human rights seriously. In particular, left-wing foreign-policy makers should pressure allies like Saudi Arabia and Israel to stop committing human rights abuses by withholding arms transfers and other forms of assistance.A democratic socialist left is shaping the conversation in American politics right now. This makes it necessary for left-wing politicians to think beyond bread-and-butter issues and to develop new ways of approaching the United States\u2019 world role. An explicit program may not yet exist, but the five principles discussed above can serve as the base upon which future leaders can build a left-wing foreign policy that ushers in a more just and peaceful era.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trouble With South Sudan\u2019s New Peace Deal", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe agreement will divide the country into a collection of tribes and disenfranchise minorities in each tribal homeland. Mr. Mamdani is the director of the Institute of Social Research at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, and a professor at Columbia University.The most urgent question remains whether the new peace agreement is any different from earlier ones and if it could survive. This is not an agreement between Mr. Kiir, a Dinka, and Mr. Machar, a Nuer, who lead two of the biggest rival factions in the country. This is an agreement between Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir, the president of Sudan, and Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda. Mr. Bashir and Mr. Museveni are the guarantors of the agreement.What happened can be understood as the product of a learning process. All previous agreements contained one big loophole: Sudan had not been among their signatories or guarantors. Sudan had no reason to support an agreement in which one objective was its own isolation. This meant that whoever wanted out of the agreement had a ready-made way out. Given its historical role in unified Sudan and its location, Sudan would be an invaluable source of diplomatic and military assistance for any group with a grievance.The result will be the disenfranchisement of a large section of South Sudan\u2019s population. Every tribal homeland will be considered the monopoly preserve of its \u201cindigenous\u201d majority; the result will be to deprive minorities within each district of two critical rights, the right to \u201ccustomary\u201d use of land and to participation in local government. It will now be much easier for ambitious leaders of different tribes to mobilize popular discontent and fan flames of a future conflict.The agreement says state boundaries will be drawn by an independent boundaries commission appointed by Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, the regional trade bloc, within two weeks of the signing of the agreement in Addis Ababa. The boundaries commission will be chaired by a non-South Sudanese and shall conduct a referendum \u201con the number and boundaries of States of the Republic of South Sudan\u201d within eight months. After that, the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development shall appoint a committee \u201cto define and demarcate the tribal areas of South Sudan.\u201dIf there is disagreement between two parties, the guarantors of the agreement, Sudan and Uganda, will be the mediators. Any tribe with a boundary-related grievance shall be entitled to bring a case against the South Sudan government before the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague within a two-year period.The agreement is signed by the parties to the conflict, the government and the opposition, by witnesses, and Mr. Bashir and Mr. Museveni as guarantors. A second agreement between South Sudan and Sudan on dividing oil and revenue is in the offing, according to officials in the African Union.South Sudan is on its way to becoming an informal protectorate of Sudan and Uganda. By formally acknowledging them as \u201cguarantors,\u201d the agreement recognizes their strategic role in determining the future of South Sudan: Ugandan troops are physically present to support Mr. Kiir\u2019s faction, and Sudan provides critical support to opposition groups, including those led by Mr. Machar. South Sudan will likely turn into a tribally fragmented society. The state will reflect this fragmentation and will in turn deepen the societal fragmentation.The president, the five vice presidents and the ministers will be appointed on basis of tribal identities. The South Sudan Army, already a collection of militias, will further fragment into tribal militias.Only one institution still stands for a united South Sudan. That is the Parliament. Recall that Parliament was not implicated in the violence of 2013. For now, it is a debating society with no teeth, but it is the only forum that brings together representatives of all groups in South Sudan.The future of South Sudan is likely to be marred by continuing chaos until a single dominant group emerges out of it. When this happens, regional powers will likely be further drawn into the conflict. To forestall that development is to recognize the key deficiencies in the present agreement \u2014 its tribal architecture and the absence of a pan South Sudan political process \u2014 by finding ways to give primacy to a political process over a military contest.Mahmood Mamdani is Hebert Lehman professor of government at Columbia University, the director of the Makerere Institute of Social Research in Kampala and the author, most recently, of \u201cSaviors and Survivors: Darfur, Politics, and the War on Terror.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Their vocal repertoire comprises more than a dozen distinct grunts, barks and squeaks, most of which amount to some version of \u201cleave me alone.\u201dBut when mating season rolls around, both male and female giant pandas turn to their preferred come-hither call: a husky, rapid vibrato that\u2019s commonly known as the bleat.Megan Owen, a conservation ecologist at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research and an author of the study, offered a human analogy for how this ability works.\u201cIf you\u2019re walking into a crowded room and someone calls out your name, there\u2019s a certain point where you can identify who that is, or maybe you can identify that it\u2019s a male or female that is calling your name,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s information that\u2019s encoded in that call, but that information degrades over distance.\u201dTo conduct the study, Dr. Owen and her colleagues \u2014 including Ben Charlton, another San Diego institute researcher who has studied panda bleats \u2014 obtained recordings of giant pandas from Chengdu, China, during breeding season.

By placing recording devices throughout the bamboo, the researchers were able to capture and analyze the bleats from various distances.\u201cWe measured how far the transmissions were received as well as the different frequency components of those transmissions,\u201d said Dr. Owen.The ability to hear and respond to bleats could affect panda populations beyond simple reproduction, said Dr. Owen. Male pandas must often compete with one another to find mates, and the identifying information contained in a bleat can help them decide which ones to tangle with.\u201cIf you can ID an individual that you\u2019ve had a competitive interaction with, that\u2019s valuable information as to whether that\u2019s a bigger, tougher male than you are, and whether it\u2019s worth taking that risk,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are real tangible benefits to knowing who you\u2019re dealing with when you\u2019re out there.\u201dThe current study could help refine the efforts of conservationist trying to encourage pandas to breed within those dwindling habitats. \u201cEverything we learn about their habitat helps us better understand how its degradation may influence their biology and ecology,\u201d said Dr. Owen. \u201cIt definitely adds an important piece of information to the puzzle of panda communication.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Instagram Rose Into a Cultural Powerhouse", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstagram\u2019s co-founders, who resigned on Monday, presided over a company that boomed with help from technological advances and societal changes.When Justin Bieber posted on Instagram for the first time in July 2011, he did not enthrall his army of fans with a shirtless selfie or a meticulously planned photo shoot. Out of focus. Mundane scenery. Not particularly artful. No matter. These were the early days of Instagram, before smartphones included cameras that could produce higher quality images than the point-and-shoots of yore. Most celebrities now, some with tens of millions of followers, put far more care into what goes on the platform. Instagram has become central to their public images. The same goes for teenagers who just want to look cool, as well as everyone in between. Instagram was founded in 2010, but initially focused on location check-ins as an app called Burbn. Mr. Krieger and Mr. Systrom noticed that early Burbn users were heavily using the app\u2019s photo features, so they retooled it around sharing photos and changed the name. Within hours of Instagram\u2019s release, thousands of people had downloaded it. It passed one million users about two months later. In 2012, it had 40 million users. Now more than one billion people use it, and analysts expect continued growth. Instagram\u2019s concept was simpler than those of competing social networks. It offered a stream of photos \u2014 and later videos \u2014 that were more often than not pleasant or artful. There were no heavy news stories or invitations to download new apps mucking up feeds.While the growth was driven by everyday users, much of the app\u2019s cultural clout comes from its utility to celebrities, who also have quite an interest in putting their best foot forward. A-listers like Beyonc\u00e9 and Kylie Jenner announce pregnancies and births on the platform instead of magazine covers. Stars ensnared in scandal will post text or video statements and apologies before news sites can update their articles. But even those who have profited deeply from the platform say they need occasional respite. Selena Gomez, who at 143 million followers holds Instagram\u2019s largest audience, said on Monday that she was taking a break from social media. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg Taught Congress and Vice Versa", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWe are at a consequential juncture in the technology business and in society.A handful of tech giants have become the guardians of global speech, amplifying certain kinds of voices and limiting others according to their own bespoke, often opaque and shifting standards. Although these companies \u2014 Facebook, Google and Twitter above all \u2014 are now integral to just about every corner of our lives, they face little regulatory oversight in the United States. It was only after the last presidential election that lawmakers even began expressing interest in the companies\u2019 power.So when Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, took the hot seat in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, I worried we would spend the bulk of the time talking about conspiracy theories peddled by the provocateur Alex Jones. Surprisingly, that was not the case.A cynic might point out that the hearings arrived at few solutions to the thorny problems they raised. Yet in highlighting the complexities of their systems, Mr. Dorsey\u2019s and Ms. Sandberg\u2019s testimony helped underscore the difficulties lawmakers will face in figuring out ways to ensure that tech companies are guarding people\u2019s political freedoms and privacy while protecting their services from those who would spread misinformation and propaganda.Contrary to much of what is happening in Washington these days, Wednesday\u2019s tech hearings showed a political system earnestly wrestling with issues for which there are no easy answers. They also showed two companies, whether out of embarrassment or fear or brand management, seriously engaging with lawmakers\u2019 worries and guiding them though the thicket of issues involved.But what about the third company, Google? And what about the big question: Are these hearings leading toward anything like a workable tech-policy solution to regulating how tech companies operate?Let\u2019s try to answer them.Google is the world\u2019s largest digital advertising company, and it runs the world\u2019s largest search engine and video site, among lots of other things you use all the time. But it was represented in the Senate Intelligence Committee by an empty chair.The committee had asked for a top executive to testify \u2014 either Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder and the chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet, or Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google. Google instead offered its chief lawyer, Kent Walker, who it argued was better versed in the issues. That didn\u2019t fly with the committee, hence the spectacle of the empty chair.In a statement, Google said of offering up Mr. Walker: \u201cWe had informed the Senate Intelligence Committee of this in late July and had understood that he would be an appropriate witness for this hearing.\u201dOne worry among Twitter employees was that Mr. Dorsey would bow too far toward Republican lawmakers\u2019 trumped-up charges of bias against conservatives. He did not do that. What he did instead was more useful. In several answers, Mr. Dorsey explained the many ways in which Twitter had failed its users.My notes from the hearings are full of instances in which Mr. Dorsey admitted serious flaws. \u201cI believe if you were to go to our rules today and sit down with a cup of coffee, you would not be able to understand them,\u201d he said at one point.The candor seemed to work. Even some of the most skeptical lawmakers sounded impressed by Mr. Dorsey\u2019s willingness to engage. Representative Joe L. Barton, a Texas Republican who focused almost entirely on the theory that Twitter was limiting conservative voices, congratulated Mr. Dorsey on his appearance \u201cwithout subpoena, and sitting there all by yourself \u2014 that\u2019s refreshing.\u201dAt the heart of these hearings was a perplexing question, one that was rarely addressed: What power does Congress have to regulate how tech companies manage their services?Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 law that governs much of online conduct, tech firms enjoy broad immunity from liability stemming from what users post on their services. There\u2019s general agreement among people in tech that the law has been crucial to the internet\u2019s rise: Because they cannot be sued for defamation or libel for what people put online, companies like Facebook and YouTube were able to achieve planetary scale.Would it be a good idea, now that these companies are so big and powerful, to limit that kind of immunity? Should Congress try to wrest more control over how these companies manage their services \u2014 perhaps to gain transparency and maybe, in the way the Federal Communications Commission once did with television and radio, to ensure some kind of \u201cfairness\u201d in the way they affect political speech?A few lawmakers broached these ideas on Wednesday, but none wrestled with the central difficulties. Some of the thorniest involve the First Amendment, which prevents the government from dictating or censoring speech. Although tech companies, being private services, are free to limit any speech they want on their networks, it was unclear if Congress has any basis for requiring certain fairness or speech policies from them.\u201cI just don\u2019t think we\u2019ve begun to wrestle with the deep constitutional issues here,\u201d David Pozen, a constitutional law professor at Columbia Law School, said. He pointed out that tech companies themselves enjoyed a First Amendment right against the government\u2019s imposing rules on their services.\u201cThese are real, serious issues that some of us have been working on for a very long time, and they\u2019ve been stewing and ripening without resolution,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you can say, now that people are finally paying attention, that we are maybe stumbling toward some better understanding of what\u2019s involved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Other Biggest Problem in Washington ", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress is very weak \u2014 but the \u201cfirst branch\u201d has rejuvenated itself in the past, and can do so again. Mr. Drutman and Mr. Kosar are co-directors of the nonpartisan Legislative Branch Capacity Working Group.A supine Congress unable to hold a president accountable. Members who find the job miserable (except for the status). A persistent problem of understaffing and lack of policy expertise. For decades, Congress has faced these growing problems and others. The Trump era has thrown them into overdrive.But by the late 1960s, Congress again saw itself eclipsed, as the Johnson and Nixon administrations expanded that branch\u2019s power. Then as now, the internal politics of Congress were roiling the caldron of reform. Ambitious junior members were tired of a committee seniority system that kept them in second-class status and marginalized their ambitious policy ideas.Regrettably, Congress slowed investments in internal capacity and began to centralize internally in the 1980s. Under Democratic leadership, party leaders took power away from committees, and that process was turbocharged in 1995 by Speaker Newt Gingrich, who took control of selecting committee leaders and cut staffing levels by one-third.Congress has not yet recovered. In both chambers, but especially the House, there has been a steady brain drain of expert capacity out of Congress and into lobbying and the bureaucracy. And the centralization of power in Congress has weakened it as an institution and frustrated the rank and file as it swoops everything it does into the maw of zero-sum partisan gamesmanship in service of the next election.History suggests that Congress is likely to reform itself again and potentially soon. High levels of frustration among rank-and-file members and the likelihood that almost one-third of the House members after the 2018 will be in their first or second terms are familiar dynamics that have preceded reforms in the past.Members of Congress may not be dropping dead in their offices from overwork today, but they are quitting in droves. No wonder: Legislators must navigate a never-ending onslaught of partisan attacks, respond to the 24/7 media swirl and tirelessly fund-raise, all of which increases the risks of speaking their minds and reduces constructive opportunities to serve constituents and develop policy. On a really bad day, they have minutes to evaluate a 2,600-page bill before casting the votes demanded by party leadership. And as in the past, the executive branch is pushing the constitutional envelope, with today\u2019s legislators also burdened by the presidential \u201ccrazytown.\u201dCongress can collectively decide that the current arrangement is intolerable. Our legislature can reorganize itself in ways that privilege expertise, competence and cross-partisan compromise. But this will not happen unless entrepreneurial members with political courage step forward with proposals that will increase members\u2019 opportunities to put their talents to work on behalf of their constituents and their country. A Congress with capacity would have the staff with the technological chops to comprehend what government should do \u2014 if anything \u2014 about the big tech companies. A revived legislature could devote more energy to finding ways to repair the broken budget process, which has us on the path to trillion-dollar annual deficits. A \u201cCongress that could\u201d would shore up the public's confidence in the integrity of this autumn's elections by establishing a bipartisan review of the results.In the past, when being a rank-and-file member of Congress became as unpleasant and irrelevant as it is today, and when Congress had ceded this much authority to the executive branch, members of Congress took it upon themselves to change the institution. The framers counted on this kind of ambition countering ambition. Now the nation does as well.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "We Are Not the Resistance ", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "OpinionDonald Trump is the one who is pushing back against the new nation that\u2019s struggling to be born. Supported byOpinion ColumnistThis is Michelle Alexander\u2019s debut column. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, it seems there has been a new crisis roiling our nation nearly every day \u2014 a new jaw-dropping allegation of corruption, a new wave of repression at the border, another nod to white nationalism or blatant misogyny, another attack on basic civil rights, freedom of the press or truth itself. Invariably, these disturbing events are punctuated by Trump\u2019s predictable yet repugnant Twitter rants.Unlike the Tea Party, which was born after President Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration and which spawned a proliferation of well-funded, loosely affiliated right-wing groups determined to hijack the Republican Party and push it further to the right, the only common denominator for \u201cthe resistance\u201d today is a commitment to resisting Donald Trump \u2014 the man, not necessarily his mission.But the time may have come to take the downsides more seriously. Resistance is a reactive state of mind. While it can be necessary for survival and to prevent catastrophic harm, it can also tempt us to set our sights too low and to restrict our field of vision to the next election cycle, leading us to forget our ultimate purpose and place in history.The disorienting nature of Trump\u2019s presidency has already managed to obscure what should be an obvious fact: Viewed from the broad sweep of history, Donald Trump is the resistance. We are not.Harding was speaking about black movements for liberation in America, but the metaphor applies equally well to the global struggle for human dignity and freedom.The Guatemalan mother desperately fleeing poverty and violence in her home country stands at the border, young child in her arms, yearning for freedom no less than the American mother hundreds of miles away who puts her hands to the plexiglass in a prison visiting room, desperate to hug her child who sits quietly on the other side. The movements that have arisen to honor the dignity of both women \u2014 movements to end mass incarceration and mass deportation \u2014 are separate streams feeding the same river.Donald Trump\u2019s election represents a surge of resistance to this rapidly swelling river, an effort to build not just a wall but a dam. A new nation is struggling to be born, a multiracial, multiethnic, multifaith, egalitarian democracy in which every life and every voice truly matters. In recent years, we\u2019ve seen glimpses of this new nation at Standing Rock, in the streets of Ferguson, in the eyes of the Dreamers, in the voices of teenagers from Parkland and Chicago, as well as at L.G.B.T. pride celebrations, the Women\u2019s March and the camps of Occupy Wall Street. Confederate statues are coming down as new memorials and statutes are going up in Montgomery, Ala., and beyond, honoring victims of lynching as well as the courageous souls who fought for the abolition of slavery and the end of Jim Crow. For many, the election of Barack Obama to the presidency symbolized the imminent birth of this new America, and many whites feared their privileged status, identity and way of life would die in the transition. The reaction was swift and fierce. It shouldn\u2019t have been surprising.As the historian Carol Anderson documented in \u201cWhite Rage,\u201d every single advance toward racial justice in this country has been met with virulent, often violent, resistance. But the 2016 election was not about only race or gender. That perfect storm had been brewing for a long time, drawing strength from many political and economic forces and gathering speed as the pace of change accelerated.If we pause long enough and consider where we stand in relationship to the centuries-long quest to create a truly equitable democracy, we may be able to see that the revolutionary river that brought us this far just might be the only thing that could possibly carry us to a place where we all belong.Every leap forward for American democracy \u2014 from slavery\u2019s abolition to women\u2019s suffrage to minimum-wage laws to the Civil Rights Acts to gay marriage \u2014 has been traceable to the revolutionary river, not the resistance. In fact, the whole of American history can be described as a struggle between those who truly embraced the revolutionary idea of freedom, equality and justice for all and those who resisted.One might wonder whether it matters, in the end, whether we consider ourselves members of the resistance or part of the revolutionary river. Can\u2019t we be both?The answer, I think, is yes and no. Yes, of course, we can and must resist the horrors of the current administration \u2014 thousands of lives depend on us doing what we can to mitigate the harm to our fellow humans and the planet we share. But the mind-set of \u201cthe resistance\u201d is slippery and dangerous. There\u2019s a reason marchers in the black freedom struggle sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d rather than chanting \u201cWe Shall Resist.\u201d Their goal was to overcome a racial caste system \u2014 to end it \u2014 and to create a new nation, a Beloved Community. Similarly, those who opposed slavery didn\u2019t view themselves as resisters; they were abolitionists.Advertisement"}

We can accept it. That\u2019s not terrible for us,\u201d said Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of The Global Times, a state-run newspaper known for its nationalist tone.

Y. Liu, a private equity investor who sometimes advises the government, said the Chinese people were prepared to endure a protracted trade conflict.\u201cThe Chinese are more tolerant of pain because we have been poor for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cWealth has only arrived in the last decade.\u201dBut many others are worried, and some have urged the Chinese leadership to seize the moment and shift the economy even further toward open markets and private enterprise rather than allowing an inefficient state sector to dig in.\u201cA closed approach will lead to a decline in the rate of national competitiveness,\u201d wrote Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, in a recent paper. He warned that China risked returning to the stagnation it suffered in isolation during the Mao era.\u201cWhen Trump adopts a protectionist strategy, China should have an open door and force the state-owned enterprises to reform,\u201d Professor Yan added in an interview. But he said his advice was being ignored. \u201cI get no reaction.

The subject is important because the United States has long touted its alliances as key to its national strength generally and its ability to counter China\u2019s rise in Asia in particular.China enjoys significant advantages in the region. It is the largest trading partner of almost every country in Asia while President Trump has strained relations with allies around the world. Even Japan, America\u2019s most important ally in Asia, appears to be drifting closer to China as Mr. Trump threatens the nation with tariffs.In a rapprochement between the two Asian rivals, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is scheduled to travel to Beijing next month, the first visit to China by a Japanese leader since 2011.\u201cTrump said recently, \u2018Japan, you\u2019re next for tariffs,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Liu, the private equity manager. \u201cThank you, Donald Trump.\u201d\u201cI recall a topic hotly debated on line by young internet users: Who is really China\u2019s enemy?

China\u2019s enemy is itself.\u201dIn many ways, the Chinese political elite has been caught off guard by how quickly relations have deteriorated with the United States, which has long been a source of envy and inspiration for many Chinese as well as a leading destination for education and immigration.Chinese scholars often observe that new American presidents usually take a hard line against China but seek cooperation after realizing how the two nations need each other. President Trump has stunned them by defying that pattern.\u201cI personally feel surprised by the fact that Trump is taking such radical measures,\u201d said Mr. Hu, the newspaper editor. \u201cI initially thought it was a joke, but it turns out to be a real policy, putting tariffs on all these products.\u201dSome Chinese analysts have sought to explain the escalating conflict with the United States by focusing on the personal qualities of the nation\u2019s two leaders. Mr. Trump is a viewed as a fickle, transactional businessman who may retreat after the midterm elections in November. They note he has repeatedly spoken out against China\u2019s trade practices but said little about human rights or military issues.Mr. Xi, on the other hand, is said to have invested too much politically in his signature programs to back down under foreign pressure.\u201cPersonality matters in this relationship,\u201d said Wu Xinbo, the director of the American Studies Center at Fudan University. \u201cThe biggest problem is Trump\u2019s credibility.\u201dThough Beijing devotes tremendous resources to studying the United States, there seems to be little understanding that the hostility against China in Washington is bipartisan, that trade concessions alone may be insufficient and that many frustrated business leaders, once defenders of good ties with China, now favor tougher measures against it as well.Teng Jianqun, director of American studies at the China Institute for International Studies, said the government needed to accept the new reality and tell the Chinese public that the coming struggle could be the beginning of a long fight for the country\u2019s survival as a great power.\u201cWe should let our people fully know that this trade war is not a short-term contest,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a contest that will determine the future of the Chinese nation.\u201dLuz Ding contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now Damien Echols Will Teach You the Secrets of Magick ", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "After almost two decades on death row, this member of the West Memphis Three is touring America, teaching the rituals that set him free.Supported byAs a teenager in the mid-1990s, Damien Echols dabbled in Wicca and wrote love spells in his journal. When three 8-year-old boys \u2014 Stevie Branch, Michael Moore and Christopher Beyers \u2014 were found dead in the woods in West Memphis, Ark., police immediately focused their investigation on Mr. Echols and his friends Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley, Jr. They were pentagram-doodling, Metallica-listening nonconformists in their Bible Belt community, and they were charged despite the lack of any physical evidence tying them to the crime scene and a dozen witnesses placing them elsewhere.During the murder trial, prosecutors painted Mr. Echols as the ringleader of a satanic group that had murdered the boys in an occult ritual. Mr. Echols, who seems congenitally unable to be anyone other than himself, didn\u2019t do himself any favors on the stand. When the prosecutor asked if he read books by Aleister Crowley, \u201ca noted author in the field of satanic worship,\u201d Mr. Echols said no, then added, \u201cI would have read them if I saw them.\u201d In 1996, he was found guilty of the boys\u2019 murders and sent to Death Row. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Misskelley both received life sentences.Thanks to three HBO documentaries about the case, the convicted men became known as the West Memphis Three, and their cause found supporters throughout the country, including a number of high-profile celebrities such as Johnny Depp and Eddie Vedder.Mr. Echols had dropped out of school in the ninth grade, but he used prison as a kind of monastic retreat and an opportunity for self-directed study. He read about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the 19th-century occult group that counted Crowley, W.B. Yeats, Bram Stoker and Arthur Conan Doyle as members. He began practicing the Golden Dawn\u2019s highly choreographed rituals, tracing pentagrams in the air while invoking the names of angels. The Wicca of his youth soon seemed goofy and uninformed.At first, he questioned whether his rituals were just him playing games with his own mind. \u201cIs this really happening or is this just like my imaginary friend? But what else did I have to do all day?\u201d he asked. And then one day in his prison cell he saw an angel. It didn\u2019t have wings or a flowing robe; in fact, it looked like two large black triangles that somehow exuded a kind of intelligence. \u201cI understood why biblical angels always say right off, \u2018Be not afraid,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I never questioned it again.\u201dHis studies grew more intense as his life on Death Row became increasingly restricted. In 2003, Arkansas moved its Death Row inmates to a new supermax unit. Supermax prisons were mostly built in the 1990s as punitive custody for disruptive prisoners, and touted by tough-on-crime politicians as a place to sequester the worst of the worst. Inmates were kept in sealed rooms for 23 hours a day.Some states found their supermax prisons underpopulated \u2014 there weren\u2019t enough of the worst bad guys, apparently \u2014 while at the same time there were bed shortages in mainstream prisons, so they relocated other prisoners to the supermax units. Until 2003, Mr. Echols and his fellow Death Row inmates had been housed in cells with barred doors, which meant that they could see and talk to one another. \u201cThey were able to have relationships. They would pass books back and forth,\u201d Mr. Echols\u2019s wife, Lorri Davis, told me. \u201cThe supermax sealed them up in tombs.\u201dRituals helped keep Mr. Echols\u2019s mind and senses alive. \u201cBy the last two years, it was all I did. I slept very little,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would just eat and work out and do magick.\u201d That terminal \u201ck\u201d is there to distinguish Mr. Echols\u2019s practices \u2014 part of an occult spiritual tradition that incorporates Gnostic Christianity, Taoist energy practices and esoteric Judaism \u2014 from the cheesy pull-the-rabbit-out-of-a-hat illusion work that most people associate with the word magic.He developed his own rituals, spending hours summoning sense memories of the seasons until the gray world of the prison faded away. Every day, he and Ms. Davis \u201cwould dredge up as much energy as we could and program it with the intent of getting me out,\u201d Mr. Echols said. \u201cEventually I stopped thinking about the goal, and it became about the joy of doing it.\u201d Ms. Davis noticed the effect it had on him. \u201cEven the way he carried himself started to change,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe got his confidence back. He absolutely came alive.\u201dBeing released from prison turned out to be nearly as traumatic as being sent there in the first place. \u201cI was shattered, broke, devastated,\u201d he said. He said he thought he would be wrecked forever. He had a hard time reading maps and recognizing faces. If he tried to watch a movie, he\u2019d fall asleep within the first five minutes, as if his overstimulated brain were powering itself down. Although he\u2019d read four books a week in prison, now he found himself unable to focus enough to get through a paragraph. Prison had aged him rapidly: Even though he was only in his late 30s, his short-term memory was shot, his eyesight had degenerated and he suffered from arthritis. He was terrified to be alone, so Ms. Davis rearranged her schedule so they were basically never apart. While in prison, he\u2019d grown confident in his ability to shape reality; now he couldn\u2019t do magick for more than a few seconds. \u201cYou know like in \u2018The Secret\u2019 where people try to manifest a parking spot? Something that insignificant was all that I could do,\u201d he said. The terms of the plea deal meant that the West Memphis Three weren\u2019t eligible for wrongful conviction compensation. To earn money, he and Ms. Davis went on tour, promoting books and documentaries about the case, despite Mr. Echols\u2019s precarious physical and psychological state. (His memoir \u201cLife After Death\u201d was a New York Times best-seller; he and Ms. Davis are the co-authors of \u201cYours for Eternity: A Love Story on Death Row,\u201d a volume of their prison love letters, and the co-producers of \u201cWest of Memphis,\u201d a documentary about the case directed by Amy Berg.) The tours were grueling.Mr. Echols wanted to focus on the future, but his public persona revolved around the worst period of his life. \u201cEveryone thinks that time is so interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s just boring.\u201dOver the next several years, Mr. Echols slowly developed a community based around magick. He also became confident enough to explore the city on his own. New York City turned out to be a magic(k)al place. He found many locations and objects that felt charged with powerful energy: the Egyptian altar at the Met; St. John the Divine. He loved visiting Cleopatra\u2019s Needle in Central Park. \u201cPriests have been putting divine energy into it for centuries,\u201d he said. It was difficult to sustain an extended ritual practice in the small Harlem apartment he and Ms. Davis shared with their three attention-hungry cats \u2014 Baby, Spider Jenkins and Goswyn \u2014 but he managed.Mr. Echols recently came to Brooklyn, where, dressed entirely in black and with arcane symbols tattooed on most of his visible skin, he spoke before a rapt crowd at the Brooklyn Bowl. The day before, he\u2019d done seven and a half hours of magick, the most since he\u2019d been out of prison.\u201cI\u2019m 43 years old and for the first time in my life, I\u2019m actually happy,\u201d he said. Mr. Echols\u2019s teaching style is at once esoteric and earthy. He seems just as happy talking about quantum physics and ancient Mesopotamian gods as he is riffing on \u201cThe Karate Kid.\u201d\u201cThe point is not enlightenment,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat most people think of as enlightenment is a side effect of magick.\u201dWhether fans who loved him as a Death Row martyr will take to him as a spiritual leader is not yet clear. \u201cI\u2019ve followed Damien for a few years. The documentaries really inspired me,\u201d said Elaine Castillo, who drove six hours from Rochester to attend the class with her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about high magick, but I want to have an open mind.\u201dOutside afterward, a cluster of fans waited for Mr. Echols. Nearly everyone was dressed in black \u2014 \u201cschool colors,\u201d someone joked \u2014 and several had tattoos of esoteric symbols drawn by Mr. Echols. One of them, Kimberly Bichko, told me that she had seen Mr. Echols perform a guardian angel ritual at a gallery last winter. \u201cI thought that if this man could go through the hell he endured, maybe I would be able to put my own hell behind me,\u201d she said. Performing the ritual every day helped her with her PTSD. Another fan credited Mr. Echols with helping him stay sober.Mr. Echols was gracious and jokey with his fans, but the social interaction seemed to drain him. Afterward at dinner with friends, he seemed agitated and unfocused. He tried to explain how his immersion in magick was making it increasingly difficult to engage with the mundane realities of day-to-day life, including dinner party chitchat. His memory issues meant that an hour from now, he might not remember a word of this conversation. By tomorrow, he probably wouldn\u2019t remember that it had happened at all. \u201cI live completely in the present moment,\u201d he said, with some urgency. Ms. Davis watched him closely. \u201cDoes it seem terrible, the way I am?\u201d he asked, more than once. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not.\u201dA few days later, Mr. Echols and I visited the Cloisters, one of his favorite magickal sites. He seemed to have regained his equilibrium. We wandered among the tapestries and discussed Instagram witches. \u201cIt\u2019s for the better,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you talk about witches now and people think about Instagram, not Satanism, that lowers the danger level. At least it is not going to happen to anyone else.\u201dIn a room full of funereal figures, Mr. Echols paused to contemplate a wooden figure of a saint, and I waited for him to say something profound. \u201cThat guy\u2019s head looks like a Milk Dud,\u201d he drawled eventually. This is Mr. Echols\u2019s other mode, prankish and fond of dumb jokes. \u201cThe two things that bring me joy are magick and things that make me laugh,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to just let everything else go.\u201dThat\u2019s easier said than done, since the things he wants to let go of are also what brought him here. Without prison, he said, \u201cI would\u2019ve lived the life my parents did \u2014 dead end jobs, horrible health, not happy in their lives. Even when I was a kid I always thought, there\u2019s got to be more than this. But that was the world I knew.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "$100 Million in Cash Vanishes in Liberia, and Fingers Start Pointing", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAMAKO, Mali \u2014 Containers full of newly minted currency worth more than $100 million have gone missing in Liberia, setting off finger pointing and travel bans as officials puzzle over the mystery in one of the poorest countries in the world.Liberia does not have its own mint. Its currency, the Liberian dollar, is printed outside of the country with the approval of the Central Bank.The disappearance has caused public outrage in a nation that has long been dogged by corruption scandals. Blame for the missing money is being passed around, with Mr. Weah\u2019s opponents accusing him and his supporters blaming Ms. Sirleaf.Mr. Weah has not publicly commented on the disappearance, but it has dominated talk radio stations for days. Messages and memes have circulated on Liberian Facebook groups and social media.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge blow for us,\u201d said Satta F. Sheriff, a Liberian child rights advocate. \u201cIt sends a message that the system in Liberia is not working.\u201dThe plot thickened this week when the Ministry of Information issued a list of 15 \u201cpersons of interest\u201d who have been barred from travel.Among them was Milton Weeks, a former Central Bank governor who worked in Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s government and resigned in July. Also on the list was Charles Sirleaf, Ms. Sirleaf\u2019s son, who is deputy governor of the Central Bank in the Weah administration. He held the same post during his mother\u2019s tenure.Neither Mr. Weeks nor Mr. Sirleaf have commented on the travel bans.The disappearance was first reported by the news outlet Hot Pepper, which specializes in covering political scandals. The government, which initially denied that the money was missing, eventually confirmed that it could not account for the currency, and ordered an investigation.\u201cInitial findings indicate that the containers and bags of moneys allegedly arrived between November 2017, prior to the inauguration of the current government, and August 2018,\u201d the minister of justice, Frank Musah Dean, said in a statement on Monday.Mr. Dean said the \u201ccurrent administration was not informed about the arrival of moneys into the country.\u201dMs. Sirleaf quickly hit back, calling it unfortunate that the government of Liberia \u201cwould give false information that wickedly impugns the reputation of past officials and by extension the country itself,\u201d according to Front Page Africa.She said the Central Bank of Liberia had conducted an internal investigation that the current government has refused to release.Eugene Nagbe, the minister of information, and Mr. Dean did not respond to requests for comment.On Wednesday, officials said they would examine the flow of currency into Liberia from 2016 to 2018. They also said they had requested assistance from the United States Treasury Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the International Monetary Fund.Front Page Africa published what it said were internal government records documenting two containers of money that were collected by members of the Central Bank on March 31, months after Mr. Weah was inaugurated.Mr. Weah, who grew up in a slum in Monrovia and rose to international soccer stardom, pledged at the beginning of his term to slash his salary by 25 percent, in the face of what he said was a \u201cbroke\u201d government. He promised to create a \u201cpro-poor government\u201d and, like his predecessor, to crack down on corruption.John Morlu, an economist who was an auditor general in the Sirleaf administration, said he was not optimistic about change because of the deeply embedded culture of patronage. He describes Liberia\u2019s institutions as \u201cmakeshift.\u201d\u201cYou can have Jesus Christ heading all of these ministries, but if the president of Liberia is not serious, nothing happens,\u201d Mr. Morlu said.Some groups were planning marches in the coming days to try to hold the government accountable for the currency loss.Advertisement"}

On one wall, a half-dozen televisions will be tuned to CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and other major networks. A small paper sign with orange lettering taped to the glass door describes what\u2019s being built: \u201cWar Room.\u201dAlthough it is not much to look at now, as of next week the space will be Facebook\u2019s headquarters for safeguarding elections. More than 300 people across the company are working on the initiative, but the War Room will house a team of about 20 focused on rooting out disinformation, monitoring false news and deleting fake accounts that may be trying to influence voters before elections in the United States, Brazil and other countries.\u201cWe see this as probably the biggest companywide reorientation since our shift from desktops to mobile phones,\u201d said Samidh Chakrabarti, who leads Facebook\u2019s elections and civic engagement team. The company, he added, \u201chas mobilized to make this happen.\u201dAlready, foreign operatives have evolved their online influence campaigns to skirt the measures Facebook has put in place ahead of the midterms, said Priscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.\u201cIf you look at the way that foreign influence operations have changed these last two years, their focus isn\u2019t really on propagating fake news anymore,\u201d Ms. Moriuchi said. \u201cIt\u2019s on augmenting stories already out there which speak to hyperpartisan audiences.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder for companies like Facebook and Twitter, from my perspective, to find them now.\u201dFacebook invited two New York Times reporters into the War Room before it opens next week to discuss the work of the elections team and some of the tools it has developed to try to prevent interference. The company limited the scope of what The Times could see and publish out of a concern about revealing too much to adversaries who may be looking for vulnerabilities. The company said the War Room was modeled after operations used by political campaigns, which are typically set up in the final weeks before Election Day.The War Room is a \u201cproactive\u201d way to build systems in anticipation of attacks, Greg Marra, a product manager working on Facebook\u2019s News Feed, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday.One of the tools the company is introducing is custom software that helps track information flowing across the social network in real time, said Mr. Chakrabarti, who joined Facebook about four years ago from Google.These dashboards resemble a set of line and bar graphs, with statistics that provide a view into how activity on the platform is changing. They allow employees to zero in on, say, a specific false news story in wide circulation or a spike in automated accounts being created in a particular geographic area.The dashboards were first tested before of the special United States Senate election in Alabama in December. Without specifying the dashboards, Mr. Zuckerberg has said a new tool helped Facebook identify political interference more quickly in that election.Since then, Facebook has tested and redesigned the software during multiple elections worldwide. This month, before Brazil\u2019s presidential election, the company will introduce the newest versions of the dashboards, Mr. Chakrabarti said.Facebook created what it calls its elections and civic engagement team in 2007 to work with governments and campaigns on how they could use the social network most effectively. For a long time, the team numbered just a few dozen people in Silicon Valley; it expanded in 2013 to include members in other offices outside the United States.Since then, the team has mushroomed to its current size, augmented by other people at the company whose jobs involve some aspect of stopping election interference. Facebook has said each of its units \u2014 including Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 has been told to make election security a top priority when designing products.Mr. Chakrabarti meets several times a month with Facebook\u2019s top executives, engineers and product managers. The meetings often include Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer.Facebook decided this year to create a War Room so that a core group of engineers, data scientists, and executives could sit together in the same space before the midterms. They chose an empty conference room off the hallway that connects Building 20 and Building 21, a central point on Facebook\u2019s campus that is easy for employees to get to.Construction began a few months ago, and the room, with its whiteboard walls and clusters of long tables, is set to open for operations on Monday. It has been refitted with cables and internet boosters, and new wiring was installed for the monitors and other equipment.What happens in the War Room will be a \u201clast line of defense\u201d for Facebook engineers to quickly spot unforeseen problems on and near election days in different countries, Mr. Chakrabarti said. Many of the company\u2019s other measures are meant to stop disinformation and other problems long before they show up in the War Room.Once a problem reaches the War Room, the dashboards will be set to spot and track unusual activity, while data scientists and security experts take a closer look. Mr. Chakrabarti said the team was particularly on guard for posts that manifested \u201creal-world harm,\u201d and planned to remove posts that tried to disenfranchise voters by giving incorrect polling data or spreading hoaxes like encouraging people to vote by text message.\u201cThe best outcome for us is that nothing happens in the War Room,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything else we are doing is defenses we are putting down to stop this in the first place.\u201dAdvertisement"}

And last week, when Mr. Jones\u2019s suspension expired, he returned to the group triumphantly.\u201cMy 30-day Facebook ban is up!\u201d Mr. Jones announced.Mr. Jones built his Facebook audience on pages \u2014 the big public megaphones he used to blast links, memes and videos to millions of his followers. In recent months, though, he and other large-scale purveyors of inflammatory speech have found refuge in private groups, where they can speak more openly with less fear of being punished for incendiary posts.Facebook\u2019s fight against disinformation and hate speech will be a topic of discussion on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, when Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, will join Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, to testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u201cThey\u2019ve essentially empowered very large groups that can operate secretly without much governance and oversight,\u201d said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University\u2019s S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. \u201cThere may be harms and abuses that are taking place, and they can\u2019t see.\u201dAfter The Times sent screenshots to Facebook of activity taking place inside these groups, Facebook removed several comments, saying they violated the company\u2019s policies on hate speech. The groups themselves, however, remain active.A Facebook spokeswoman said the company used automated tools, including machine learning algorithms, to detect potentially harmful content inside private groups and flag it for human reviewers, who make the final decisions about whether or not to take it down. The company is developing additional ways, she said, to determine if an entire group violates the company\u2019s policies and should be taken down, rather than just its individual posts or members.Harmful activity does not appear to be more prevalent in secret groups, the Facebook spokeswoman said.Soon after, the company\u2019s algorithms began giving posts from groups higher visibility in users\u2019 news feeds. The largest Facebook groups \u2014 such as Pantsuit Nation, a progressive political group formed to rally Hillary Clinton supporters in the 2016 election \u2014 gained millions of members.Facebook\u2019s promotion of private groups encouraged like-minded people to cluster together. But it also meant that some users were seeing more posts from people whose opinions and interests they already shared, and it may have created echo chambers where polarizing behavior could flourish.One type of private Facebook group, known as a \u201cclosed\u201d group, can be found through searches. Another type, known as a \u201csecret\u201d group, is invisible to all but those who receive an invitation from a current member to join. In both cases, only members can see posts made inside the group.The private Infowars group is closed, was formed before Facebook took action against Mr. Jones and is billed as an \u201cunofficial\u201d fan group. New users must be approved by moderators and answer several screening questions, including \u201cWhat is the answer to 1984?\u201d (The correct answer, according to the title of one of Mr. Jones\u2019s books, is \u201c1776.\u201d)Since the public Infowars page was taken down, the private group has functioned as a makeshift home for fans of the site. Two remaining Infowars pages, along with profiles apparently belonging to Mr. Jones and others affiliated with Infowars, are listed as administrators, giving them a higher level of control of the group than moderators.Mr. Jones and several other administrators of the Infowars group did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cThe vast majority of groups on Facebook are probably the run-of-the-mill groups,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e DiResta, a researcher with Data for Democracy who studies online extremism. \u201cThe challenge is, how does the groups feature interact with the other features on Facebook that we know are causing radicalization, hate speech and genocide in certain places? Who is taking responsibility for looking at the negative externalities of this push to create communities?\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

But it is stubborn and adaptable.Opinion ColumnistATHENS \u2014 Gazing at the Acropolis the other day from an Athens rooftop, I was reminded of Samuel Beckett\u2019s words: \u201cEver tried. Ever failed. No Matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.\u201dTry again. Fail again. Fail better.It\u2019s important to put our current democratic travails in perspective. At its best, democracy is a culture that empowers free citizens to participate in shaping their fates. At its worst, it is a charade in which civic bonds erode, power accrues to the few, self-aggrandizement becomes the norm, and tolerance and restraint are consumed by the howling mob. Then the very word becomes a sham, a disguise deployed by autocrats like Vladimir Putin.The Parthenon exhorts us to be stubborn about the sacredness of truth.At the Athens Democracy Forum, hosted by this newspaper, I listened to the Greek foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, allude to \u201cundemocratic liberalism\u201d as a catalyst to the current wave of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d in places like Poland and Hungary. The voter is wise. Voters have been telling us something about failure these past several years. To ignore those failures \u2014 involving impunity, arrogance, inequality and remoteness \u2014 is to invite ruin.People think differently. Representative democracy provides a means to mediate these differences for the greater good. It depends on the recognition, not the trampling, of disparate views.Democracy in danger has become a buzzword. Let\u2019s not forget that Greece and South Africa, resilient through crises, and Malaysia and Indonesia, suggest otherwise. The human urge to be free is not about to die in the 21st century.But, yes, Western democracy is in upheaval. Of late, it has concentrated, but not spread, wealth, suggesting that it\u2019s no more than a vehicle for injustice.Technology, twin-souled like Goethe\u2019s Faust, has changed the world for good and ill. We like. We dislike. We follow. We unfollow. We broadcast our lives. We fall silent. Adrenaline surges. Status anxiety follows. Contemporary life is a restless experiment in global direct democracy. We are networked. Facebook has more than 2.2 billion monthly active users. So do we really need representative democracy? Is it not just a means for rich globalized insiders to control our lives?Yascha Mounk, a lecturer on government at Harvard University, said the anti-democratic fires raging should not be underestimated. Each civic act, he suggested, is a glass of water that may help extinguish the flames.Which brings me to President Trump, the flamethrower who makes headlines even by falling silent. A joke is making the rounds. When Putin and Trump met in Helsinki, Finland, they shook hands. \u201cI\u2019m Vladimir Putin, president of Russia,\u201d Putin said. \u201cI\u2019m Donald J. Trump, president of the United States,\u201d Trump said.\u201cOh,\u201d said Putin, \u201cwhat does the J stand for?\u201d\u201cJenius!\u201d said Trump.This is the Age of the Genius.The Genius has little time for democratic checks and balances. The New York Times is \u201cfake news.\u201d The Genius mocks the architecture of postwar stability underwritten by American power. \u201cAmerica First!\u201d he declaims. He believes in \u201cthe will of the people,\u201d a dangerous phrase, as Angie Hobbs, a British philosopher, noted.If Trump is a fascist, Marx was right: History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. I wonder.Certainly, it\u2019s easy to lose your bearings in the president\u2019s torrent of lies. It\u2019s easy to shrug. The ugliest chapters of history are littered with bystanders.So, what am I worried about? Truth, above all; please protect it. Arrogance, as in the overuse of the word populism, a word freighted with contempt. I worry about atomization, the reduction of human beings to extensions of their devices. I worry about the insidiousness of Trump\u2019s moral depravity. I worry about the value of America\u2019s word, the glue to alliances that have upheld the free world.Still, I am an optimist. Democracy is stubborn. It raises our gaze. It is the system that best enshrines the unshakable human desire to be free. Athens reminds us of that. America reminds us of that. It fails. It falls short of John Winthrop\u2019s \u201ccity upon a hill.\u201d It strives still to fail better.Perhaps you know the story of the old man on his deathbed who was approached by his children.\u201cDad,\u201d they say. \u201cWe were afraid to ask you but perhaps the time has come. Do you want to be buried or cremated?\u201dDemocracy will still surprise us.Advertisement"}

Who would think that I\u2019d be joining #MeToo at my age? I am lucky that many of the couples my husband and I saw when he was alive have kept me in their social circle. But one man, married to a good friend, has started kissing me full on the mouth and letting his hands roam when we meet. This is new. I wrote him a private email asking him to stop. He hasn\u2019t. I also learned that he does this to other women. What to do? I don\u2019t want to be ostracized by the group.ANONYMOUSI\u2019m so glad you wrote! Like many abusers, yours seems to have calculated your relative power and assumed he will get away with his nasty behavior. (I receive many letters from widows who are devastated when their social circles dump them after their husbands die.) I hear the echo of that fear in your letter, and I respect your desire to handle this quietly and without being blamed.But by ignoring your email, this guy has already proved that he doesn\u2019t care what you want. For starters, avoid all physical contact with him when you meet \u2014 just smile and say hello. It may feel awkward to you, but it probably won\u2019t be as noticeable to others as you suspect. (When he opens his arms to hug \u2014 or grope \u2014 you, walk on.)You could also take aim at his inappropriate behavior. A sharp \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d in front of his wife is probably all it will take to shut him down. Just promise me that you won\u2019t let this boor isolate you or keep you from seeing your friends.I volunteer for an organization that encourages staff to put their preferred pronouns in the signature line of their emails: she/her or they/their, etc. I am of two minds about this. I want to respect people\u2019s preferences, but I\u2019m not sure that this is the way to create a welcoming world. Using third-person plural pronouns (they/their) to refer to a single person causes confusion and calls undue attention to a person\u2019s gender identity at work. Advice?IVYCalling people by their correct names and pronouns isn\u2019t \u201ccreating a welcoming world,\u201d Ivy. It\u2019s a baseline for accuracy and respect. How would you feel about being called \u201che\u201d all day? If the binary gender system doesn\u2019t fit a co-worker, and the pronouns \u201cthey/their\u201d do, any other usage is inappropriate.Granted, this may take some practice. \u201cThey will be here at 2 p.m.\u201d may cause some surprise when only one person walks in. But I reject your contention that \u201cthey\u201d calls more attention to gender identity than \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe\u201d does. It\u2019s simply newer \u2014 and a small price to pay to get it right.Yesterday was my daughter\u2019s fourth birthday. We had a great time! One set of grandparents called us on FaceTime. They wished her a happy birthday. Then we ate cupcakes. I wondered why the other set of grandparents hadn\u2019t called. My daughter wanted to FaceTime them too, so we did. Pretty quickly, I realized they had no idea it was her birthday. My daughter even said: \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday.\u201d But they still didn\u2019t get it. I feel awful about this, and fear my daughter may have picked up on it. It\u2019s normal for grandparents to call on a child\u2019s birthday, right?ANONYMOUSMy mother occasionally forgot my birthday as an adult. And while it provided excellent ammunition for screaming matches, I never doubted her fierce love for me. Some people aren\u2019t good with dates. And FaceTime conversations among several adults and at least one small child can be hard to follow. These grandparents may still not know they missed your daughter\u2019s birthday.Why not call them privately and let them know (nicely)? They may feel terrible and try to make it up to your daughter. Or you can offer to give them a head\u2019s up next year, if their calendar system is not dependable.But the important thing is that your daughter had a great time. Remembering to call on a specific day is an expression of love, not a proxy for it. But if it\u2019s important to you, ask them to make an effort to celebrate your daughter\u2019s birthday next year, on FaceTime or otherwise.I was at a dinner party with a friend who has gotten heavier in the last year. At one point, she announced: \u201cYou can be thin, or you can be happy.\u201d I took this as a swipe at me. I am trim and work at it, and my friend knows this. Thoughts?ALANAYou ignore a primary fact of social life. Many of us are far too self-conscious to notice much about others. Your friend probably just wanted to explain her weight gain: The constant treadmill of diet and exercise was making her unhappy. So she loosened up. You aren\u2019t obliged to agree.

TUCSON \u2014 In February of 2012, I stood pregnant outside our Arizona farmhouse, staring at a wide desert sky pinpricked with stars. The baby had dropped and my belly was as hard as a stone. Near midnight, I labored inside the house in an inflatable kiddie pool with crayon-colored fish stamped on the sides. While I pushed and screamed my head off, their cartoon faces smiled back at me, and then my son slid out into the arms of my midwife. Two years later, the same midwife caught my second son, who surprised us all when he made his way out onto the floor of the bathroom. In the case of both of my children, the \u201cdocument\u201d that does not sufficiently support their citizenship is an original, official birth certificate with the seal. Yet the State Department is now requesting a slew of other evidence, including religious and health records created in the first year of birth, early school records, birth certificates from any older siblings and parents\u2019 tax, rent or employment records from the time of the birth. To live in the borderlands is to live on a seam, in a space where two things connect. In this place, we often witness the moments when obscure high-level policies collide with the lives of actual human beings. Here, noncitizens have been abused and exploited in horrific ways \u2014 families seeking asylum have been separated from one another, and migrants have been intentionally funneled into the most dangerous and remote parts of the desert, sometimes to their deaths. The denial of passports to those delivered by midwives in border states is the latest erosion of American citizens\u2019 rights in the misguided obsession to militarize and seal the United States-Mexico border. Rural residents must stop at border security checkpoints just to go to school or the grocery store. Tribal members are surveilled while participating in ceremonies and harassed while harvesting traditional foods. There are countless reasons I chose to give birth at home with a midwife. I was not a high-risk prenatal patient. I wanted autonomy \u2014 to walk around while in labor, not to be bothered by or restricted by machines or tubes, to eat something other than ice chips if I felt like it. We also lived in a rural area 90 minutes from the nearest hospital with a labor and delivery center, a distance that I imagined would be pure hell to travel while in labor. And I wanted to be able to crawl into my own bed at the end of it all, baby in my arms, and go \u2014 sort of \u2014 to sleep. My burden is not nearly that of others. I have access to a computer, the internet and a printer for collating six years of tax records, W-9s and rental agreements. I have a flexible job as a freelancer and unlimited cellphone minutes to sit on hold with government agencies. If I have to, I will pay an attorney to make sure my children get their passports.

When we were handed the Hillary Clinton email investigation in 2015, the bureau\u2019s deputy director said to me, \u201cYou know you are totally screwed, right?\u201d He meant that, in a viciously polarized political environment, one side was sure to be furious with the outcome. Sure enough, I saw a tweet declaring me \u201ca political hack,\u201d although the author added, tongue in cheek: \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out which side.\u201dAnd those were the good old days. President Trump\u2019s decision to order a one-week investigation into sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee, comes in a time of almost indescribable pain and anger, lies and attacks.We live in a world where the president routinely attacks the F.B.I. because he fears its work. He calls for his enemies to be prosecuted and his friends freed. We also live in a world where a sitting federal judge channels the president by shouting attacks at the Senate committee considering his nomination and demanding to know if a respected senator has ever passed out from drinking. We live in a world where the president is an accused serial abuser of women, who was caught on tape bragging about his ability to assault women and now likens the accusations against his nominee to the many \u201cfalse\u201d accusations against him. Most disturbingly, we live in a world where millions of Republicans and their representatives think nearly everything in the previous paragraph is O.K.In that world, the F.B.I. is now being asked to investigate, on a seven-day clock, sexual assaults that the president says never happened, that some senators have decried as a sham cooked up to derail a Supreme Court nominee, and that other senators believe beyond all doubt were committed by the nominee. If truth were the only goal, there would be no clock, and the investigation wouldn\u2019t have been sought after the Senate Judiciary Committee already endorsed the nominee. Instead, it seems that the Republican goal is to be able to say there was an investigation and it didn\u2019t change their view, while the Democrats hope for incriminating evidence to derail the nominee.Although the process is deeply flawed, and apparently designed to thwart the fact-gathering process, the F.B.I. is up for this. It\u2019s not as hard as Republicans hope it will be. F.B.I. agents are experts at interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow with additional interviews. Unless limited in some way by the Trump administration, they can speak to scores of people in a few days, if necessary. They will confront people with testimony and other accounts, testing them and pushing them in a professional way. Agents have much better nonsense detectors than partisans, because they aren\u2019t starting with a conclusion.

But F.B.I. agents know time has very little to do with memory. They know every married person remembers the weather on their wedding day, no matter how long ago. Significance drives memory. They also know that little lies point to bigger lies. They know that obvious lies by the nominee about the meaning of words in a yearbook are a flashing signal to dig deeper.Once they start interviewing, every witness knows the consequences. It is one thing to have your lawyer submit a statement on your behalf. It is a very different thing to sit across from two F.B.I. special agents and answer their relentless questions. Of course, the bureau won\u2019t have subpoena power, only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions. But most people will speak to them. Refusal to do so is its own kind of statement.Agents will summarize every witness encounter in a detailed report called a 302, and then synthesize all the interviews into an executive summary for the White House. Although the F.B.I. won\u2019t reach conclusions, their granular factual presentation will spotlight the areas of conflict and allow decision makers to reach their own conclusions.It is idiotic to put a shot clock on the F.B.I. But it is better to give professionals seven days to find facts than have no professional investigation at all. When the week is up, one team (and maybe both) will be angry at the F.B.I. The president will condemn the bureau for being a corrupt nest of Clinton-lovers if they turn up bad facts. Maybe Democrats will similarly condemn agents as Trumpists if they don\u2019t.

{"Headline": "Can Germany\u2019s Center Hold Against the Far Right?", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs anti-immigrant protesters march through city streets, the country\u2019s leaders can\u2019t even agree on basic facts. Ms. Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.BERLIN \u2014 Only a week after several right-wing marches took place in the eastern German town of Chemnitz, protesters took to the streets on Sunday night in K\u00f6then, a city of about 26,000 people located 90 miles southwest of Berlin. Again, video footage showed ugly scenes, including one group shouting, \u201cNational Socialism, now, now, now.\u201d As in Chemnitz, the protests in K\u00f6then were sparked by allegations that immigrants had killed a German citizen: In this case, they stemmed from the death of a 22-year-old man; the police have arrested two Afghan men suspected of having severely beaten and kicked the man, who subsequently had a fatal heart attack.No reasonable person expects that these marches are the beginning of a radical, dark turn in German society; sensationalist headlines aside, we are not experiencing another \u201c1933.\u201d And yet something is clearly happening \u2014 the country feels out of sync with itself, and reality. We see things happening but cannot agree on what to call those things, or what they might mean.It has been a whirlwind couple of weeks. In the early morning hours of Sunday, Aug. 26, a man named Daniel Hillig died in Chemnitz after being stabbed at a festival. The police have arrested a Syrian man and an Iraqi man on charges of homicide in the case; the Iraqi suspect had been denied asylum and should have been deported.Over the next week, right-wing groups organized several protest marches in the city, bringing thousands to the streets. Billboards with far-right slogans were on full display. Some protesters raised their hands in the Hitler salute. Counterprotesters appeared as well, but they \u2014 and at times even the police \u2014 were overwhelmed, except for a night when a free concert attracted 65,000 visitors. Dozens of people were hurt in clashes between the two sides.Organizers of the marches have paid lip service to keeping things peaceful. But on Aug. 27, in the middle of the protests, a group of about a dozen men attacked a Jewish restaurant in Chemnitz with bottles and stones. Several journalists, as well as members of a group of Social Democrats who had participated in the counter-demonstration in Chemnitz, report having been verbally and physically attacked; some say they were beaten and chased. Two videos spread by a far-left group via Twitter show a gathering of men yelling at two dark-skinned people in the middle of a road.As if all of this wasn\u2019t discomforting enough in itself, the political establishment appears hamstrung, unable to agree on how to respond. Chancellor Angela Merkel characterized the protests as \u201criots\u201d and \u201chunts\u201d against immigrants, while Michael Kretschmer, the minister-president of Saxony, where Chemnitz is, denied that there had been a mob at all. Alexander Gauland, the head of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, spoke of \u201cthree or four neo-Nazis\u201d mixing into otherwise \u201clegitimate protests.\u201dPerhaps even more than the fact of the protests themselves, the inability of the country\u2019s political leadership to agree on how to respond to violent extremism is frightening.It is one thing for people to disagree on what the protests mean; in this case, it seems they can\u2019t even agree on what has happened. There are strongly held views about how well Germany has dealt with the consequences of mass migration \u2014 that is normal and healthy. Now, though, it seems as though some people who disagree on the policy are choosing to also disagree on basic facts: Policymakers from the same party (but with different ideas about immigration) can look at the same video footage and the same police reports and claim to see different things.This is also the first time in recent memory a German government official has openly attacked the credibility of the news media and suggested that there was a misinformation campaign without giving any proof. While the Alternative for Germany has long campaigned against the \u201clying press,\u201d such allegations from a high-ranking civil servant within the elected government are most likely unprecedented.This is not to say that all sides are equally distorting the situation. It is true that in Chemnitz nobody was literally \u201chunted,\u201d and that the term Ms. Merkel used \u2014 \u201cpersistence chase\u201d \u2014 may technically be wrong. But the term \u201criot\u201d is accurate, and anyone who looks at the videos and reads eye-witness-reports will agree that these are \u201cmobs\u201d. And \u201cchasing\u201d seems to be a good word for one man following another, shouting \u201cLet\u2019s get him\u201d \u2014 a scene that one counter-protester claims to have experienced.The battle over what really happened in Chemnitz and K\u00f6then is not just a struggle over semantics or interpretations. It is an attack on reality and even more: on our belief in our ability to grasp reality. If the outcome of these few weeks is that we are free to describe reality in whatever way is convenient for us, then we are in truly frightening territory.The reason this is happening now is simple and complicated at the same time. It is almost comforting to ascribe these attacks to the usual political power struggles: Perhaps Mr. Maa\u00dfen knew he could say what he did because it was unlikely his boss, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, one of Ms. Merkel\u2019s political opponents, would rein him in. Maybe in his attempt to soft-pedal the protests, Mr. Kretschmer, the minister-president of Saxony, was just trying to curry votes ahead of a tough re-election race next year.Maybe. But then each episode in the ascent of the far right in Germany is marked by such quotidian accommodations. Mr. Seehofer and Mr. Kretschmer may justify their actions as keeping the true far right at bay, but such moves only push the door open wider. And the costs are already apparent. Fear-mongering and denigrating language have long become mainstream. Now undermining reality is no longer a taboo, either. The political establishment has started to play the populist game: smashing reality into bits of bias they can then use as ammunition in the struggle for power.To American readers, this may sound familiar.

{"Headline": "Watch Plants Light Up When They Get Attacked", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesScientists showed that plants are much less passive than they seem by revealing the secret workings of their threat communication systems.Plants have no eyes, no ears, no mouth and no hands. They do not have a brain or a nervous system. Muscles? Forget them. They\u2019re stuck where they started, soaking up the sun and sucking up nutrients from the soil. And yet, when something comes around to eat them, they sense it.And they fight back.How is this possible?\u201cPlants are not green animals,\u201d Dr. Gilroy says. \u201cPlants are different, but sometimes they\u2019re remarkably similar to how animals operate.\u201dThey applied glutamate, an important neurotransmitter that helps neurons communicate in animals.In these and about a dozen other videos, they used a glowing, green protein to trace calcium and accompanying chemical and electrical messages in the plant. And they watched beneath a microscope as warnings transited through the leafy green appendages, revealing that plants aren\u2019t as passive as they seem.The messages start at the point of attack, where glutamate initiates a wave of calcium that propagates through the plant\u2019s veins, or plumbing system. The deluge turns on stress hormones and genetic switches that open plant arsenals and prepare the plant to ward off attackers \u2014 with no thought or movement.One mechanism our cells share is fluctuating levels of calcium ions, which carry an electrical charge. In humans, this charge assists in controlling when your neurons fire messages. Changes in calcium ions make your heart beat or your muscles contract so you can get up and leave when something threatens you.With the help of glutamate, calcium ions can flow, carrying their signal through channels that open like floodgates when glutamate fits into these special receptor spaces, like keys in locks. These channels aren\u2019t quite the same as those in the mammalian nervous system, but they look very similar and probably worked similarly. They led Dr. Gilroy and his team to look into calcium ion flow.To make the action visible, the researchers engineered Arabidopsis plants, botany\u2019s lab rat, to make a protein originally from jellyfish that glows green under a microscope. This sensor, in this case, shines brighter when calcium levels increase.They also made plants that lack the glutamate-like receptor. In these, the fluorescent signal was weak:The real surprise was the speed. The plant reacted within a few seconds and transferred information from leaf to leaf in a couple of minutes \u2014 as long as they were connected through the vascular system. This is slower than your nervous system, but \u201cfor a plant biologist, that is booking it,\u201d Dr. Gilroy said.The plant also seemed to be able to sense the amount of damage, because when they crushed a leaf, the plant responded all over.:Wherever the calcium touched, the plant produced jasmonic acid, a defense and stress hormone, which they believe turns on genes that somehow activate a plant\u2019s chemical and physical defenses.Methyl-jasmonate, a product of jasmonic acid, for instance, floats through the air like a jasmine-scented perfume. But for insects, it can be unappealing or disrupt digestion and deter diners from return visits. Physical defenses may harden a plant\u2019s cell walls, too, making them tough to eat.But much is still a mystery.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to understand what the machinery is that makes the whole system work,\u201d Dr. Gilroy said.What isn\u2019t so mysterious is that plants and animals have a lot of the same problems. And while humans can deal with threats, plants can too.\u201cThey may even have to be better than us at sensing the environment because they don\u2019t have the luxury of getting up and leaving,\u201d Dr. Gilroy said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wittgenstein\u2019s Confession", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONELike Socrates, he knew that being honest with oneself is the most philosophical act of all. \u201cI have come to make a confession.\u201dIt was 1937 and Ludwig Wittgenstein had just arrived at the house of his Russian teacher, Fania Pascal, in Cambridge. He wanted to confess his role in an incident that had plagued his conscience for more than a decade.Confession, as most of us know, takes courage, especially when what you confess reflects regrettable behavior or an unpleasant character. It forces us to confront things hidden, from others and from ourselves. Facing up to self-deception also demands personal change.Wittgenstein, who is regarded by many as the greatest philosopher of the 20th century, was by most accounts a deeply sincere and unsparingly self-critical man who spent much of his life in a struggle with self-transformation. It is not surprising, then, that he saw the act of confession as a way of escaping self-deception.Despite the reverence Wittgenstein inspires in intellectual history, he remains an enigmatic figure. But a few biographical points are helpful here. In 1919, straight out of the Austro-Hungarian army, he trained to be an elementary-school teacher and taught in Austria from 1920 to 1926. Believing he\u2019d solved all the problems of philosophy in his soon-to-be-published \u201cTractatus Logico-Philosophicus\u201d (1921), his focus turned to self-improvement. Influenced by Tolstoy\u2019s romanticized vision of the self-cultivation developed by working and living among peasants, Wittgenstein began teaching in poor, rural villages.Or so goes Pascal\u2019s recollection of events. Ray Monk, the author of the acclaimed \u201cWittgenstein: The Duty of Genius,\u201d has expressed doubts about Pascal\u2019s recollection. He points readers to what he believes is a more reliable account of a related but separate incident, from Rowland Hutt, a friend of Wittgenstein\u2019s.Hutt recalls that Wittgenstein committed perjury by denying accusations in court following the \u201cHaidbauer incident.\u201d In 1926, a frail 11-year-old named Josef Haidbauer collapsed and fell unconscious after Wittgenstein hit him. Wittgenstein sent the class home, carried Haidbauer to the headmaster\u2019s office to be seen by the doctor, and fled. It\u2019s disputed whether Wittgenstein waited for the doctor or left immediately. Wittgenstein was exonerated; his colleagues defended him and he was even asked to continue teaching. But this episode marked the end of his career as a schoolteacher, as he didn\u2019t feel he could return. Whichever incident Wittgenstein confessed it seems that it was his dishonesty rather than his violence that most burdened his conscience.Ruminating over his confessions in 1937, Wittgenstein wrote:Last year \u2026 I pulled myself together and made a confession. This brought me into more settled waters \u2026 But now \u2026 I am not far from where I was before. I am cowardly beyond measure. If I do not correct this, I shall again drift entirely into those waters \u2026In a book of personal recollections of Wittgenstein by Pascal and others close to him, one of Wittgenstein\u2019s literary executors, the philosopher Rush Rhees, interprets \u201ccowardly beyond measure\u201d as a reference to Wittgenstein\u2019s difficulty of recognizing his own self-deception due to a \u201cfailure of will\u201d that \u201ccould be corrected only by courage.\u201d The courage required for confession helps to understand Wittgenstein\u2019s confessions as, to use Monk\u2019s metaphor, self-surgery to remove cowardice. Wittgenstein saw his dishonesty toward others as dishonesty toward himself. In those recollections Rhees also recalls that Wittgenstein worried, in a manner typical of his severe self-criticism, that he was a \u201cmonster.\u201d This criticism echoes a discussion about the authenticity of the philosopher in Plato\u2019s \u201cPhaedrus.\u201d Socrates admits he has failed to obey the Delphic injunction to know his own self and declares it \u201cabsurd to consider problems about other beings while I am still in ignorance about my own nature.\u201d And so Socrates investigates \u201cnot these things but myself, to know whether I am a monster.\u201d Wittgenstein\u2019s confrontation with his dishonesty, like the Delphic pursuit of self-understanding, was a pursuit of authenticity.Like Socrates, Wittgenstein saw philosophy as at least as much an exercise in self-honesty as an intellectual endeavor. In a 1931 remark among the collection of notes posthumously published as \u201cCulture and Value\u201d (\u201cVermischte Bemerkungen,\u201d 1977), Wittgenstein writes that philosophy\u2019s difficulty lies \u201cwith the will, rather than with the intellect.\u201d The same goes for confession. Wittgenstein didn\u2019t lack the insight to locate and define his own failings; rather, as Rhees says, Wittgenstein found it difficult to recognize that he had been behaving \u201cin a character that was not genuine \u2026 because he hadn\u2019t the will.\u201d To escape self-deception Wittgenstein needed to do \u201csomething that needed courage\u201d \u2014 to confess.Admitting wrongdoing and seeking forgiveness weren\u2019t Wittgenstein\u2019s main concerns; his concerns were escaping self-deception and changing himself. Confession fulfills this role because it requires courage and askesis \u2014 self-discipline. Wittgenstein\u2019s demands on himself were high: during his confession Pascal asked, \u201cWhat is it? You want to be perfect?\u201d \u2014 to which he proudly replied, \u201cOf course I want to be perfect.\u201dWittgenstein saw philosophy in a similarly ascetic way: \u201cWorking in philosophy,\u201d he wrote in 1931, \u201cis really more a working on oneself.\u201d Rhees writes that Wittgenstein expressed in various letters and personal notes that he wanted to be \u201crid of self-deception regarding his own failings and in this way lead a different life.\u201d The aim was to be a different person. \u201cA confession,\u201d Wittgenstein also wrote in 1931, \u201cmust be part of your new life.\u201dWittgenstein\u2019s confession is best understood as part of a spiritual means of self-development. Two thinkers he respected deeply probably influenced him: St. Augustine of Hippo and Tolstoy, both of whom conceive of confession similarly in their autobiographies. The ultimate purpose of Augustine\u2019s and Tolstoy\u2019s confessions, like Wittgenstein\u2019s, was ascetic: self-improvement through the catharsis and penance confession elicits.For these reasons, Wittgenstein relished knowing that on every night he stood a good chance of dying. In 1916 he wrote: \u201cYesterday I was shot at. I was scared! I was afraid of death. I now have such a desire to live.\u201d For \u201conly death,\u201d he also wrote in his war diaries, \u201cgives life its meaning.\u201d Although a coward by his own exalted standards, he was a hero by more conventional ones, testament to which are the medals he received for bravery.Wittgenstein\u2019s character is as difficult to get to grips with as his philosophy. G.E.M. Anscombe, considered by many to be the greatest philosopher of her generation, as well as another of Wittgenstein\u2019s literary executors and perhaps his best student, felt \u201cdeeply suspicious of anyone\u2019s claim to have understood Wittgenstein.\u201d But one thing we can understand about Wittgenstein is that he longed to change himself; and he saw confession as a means to fulfilling this.\u201cNothing is so difficult,\u201d Wittgenstein wrote in 1938, \u201cas not deceiving oneself.\u201d\u2019 His vision of the authentic self is perhaps always beyond reach, like the exemplars of authenticity with which he was familiar through the writings of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.Authenticity throughout the history of philosophy is often conceived of as an ideal to which we should aspire, but that doesn\u2019t prevent it being a useful means for self-improvement. Confession can help remove obstacles standing in the way of our becoming our authentic selves.If it can do that for Wittgenstein, it may do the same for us.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Facebook War: Libyans Battle on the Streets and on Screens", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCAIRO \u2014 When a new bout of fighting between rival militias engulfed the Libyan capital in recent days, badly shaking the fragile United Nations-backed government, some combatants picked up rifles and rocket launchers and headed into the streets.Others logged on to Facebook.As rockets rained on parts of Tripoli, hitting a hotel popular with foreigners and forcing the airport to close, and 400 prisoners escaped from a jail, a parallel battle unfolded online. On their Facebook pages, rival groups issued boasts, taunts and chilling threats \u2014 one vowing to \u201cpurify\u201d Libya of its opponents.Some \u201ckeyboard warriors,\u201d as Facebook partisans are known in Libya, posted fake news or hateful comments. Others offered battlefield guidance. On one discussion page on Thursday, a user posted maps and coordinates to help target her side\u2019s bombs at a rival\u2019s air base.\u201cFrom the traffic light at Wadi al Rabi, it is exactly 18 kilometers to the runway, which means it can be targeted by a 130 mm artillery,\u201d the user, who went by the handle Narjis Ly, wrote on Facebook. \u201cThe coordinates are attached in the photo below.\u201dBut Facebook, by far the most popular platform, doesn\u2019t just mirror the chaos \u2014 it can act as a force multiplier.On Wednesday, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, will defend the company\u2019s efforts to limit disinformation and hate speech before the Senate Intelligence Committee, where she will testify along with Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive.Still, illegal activity is rife on Libyan Facebook.The New York Times found evidence of military-grade weapons being openly traded, despite the company\u2019s policies forbidding such commerce. Human traffickers advertise their success in helping illegal migrants reach Europe by sea, and use their pages to drum up more business. Practically every armed group in Libya, and even some of their detention centers, have their own Facebook page.\u201cThe most dangerous, dirty war is now being waged on social media and some other media platforms,\u201d Mahmud Shammam, a former information minister, said last week as fighting ripped through the Tripoli suburbs. \u201cLying, falsifying, misleading and mixing facts. Electronic armies are owned by everyone, and used by everyone without exception. It is the most deadly war.\u201dFacebook helped Libyans unite in 2011 to oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, who for decades had forbidden people to buy fax machines or even printers without official permission.Even then, the platform was prone to abuse.\u201cThe social media echo chamber played out in deadly ways for them,\u201d said Fred Abrahams, an associate director at Human Rights Watch.Facebook\u2019s influence today is largely a product of Libya\u2019s dysfunction. The country has no central authority and most of its TV stations and newspapers are tied to armed groups, political factions or foreign powers like Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.Many Libyans spend long hours stranded inside their homes because it can be dangerous to go out. The electricity can be off for 12 hours a day. So they turn to Facebook to find out what\u2019s going on.\u201cThe phone might be the only thing that is working,\u201d said Jalel Harchaoui, a Paris-based analyst with North Africa Risk Consulting. \u201cPeople are traumatized after the years of fake news under Qaddafi. They thirst for truth.\u201dShe leapt into a car with her husband and children and drove to Tunisia, where they live in exile. \u201cWe literally left everything behind,\u201d she said by phone.In 2014, suspected Islamists in Benghazi shot dead two secular teenage activists, Tawfik Bensoud and Sami al-Kwuafi, after their names appeared on a hit list that circulated on Facebook.The fighting in Tripoli over the past week was the worst in years, leaving at least 47 people dead, including children, and over 130 wounded, according to health officials. At least 400 prisoners escaped from a jail on Sunday after inmates overpowered guards. The chaos poses a growing threat to the United Nations-backed unity government, which has declared a state of emergency in the capital.Online boasts and threats foreshadowed the fighting.Such ostentatious displays helped fuel resentments among rival groups seeking to share in the pie. They boiled over last week when a militia known as Kaniyat from a town called Tarhouna, 45 miles southeast of Tripoli, launched an assault on the capital.As Kaniyat\u2019s fighters engaged in artillery battles in the southern suburbs, it sought to tap into public anger by denouncing its rivals as the \u201cIslamic State of public money\u201d and promising to \u201ccleanse\u201d them from Libya.Libya\u2019s factions are motivated by more than what they see on Facebook, said Mr. Harchaoui, the analyst. But, he added, \u201cit can be the final straw.\u201dOn Monday afternoon, Facebook suddenly went down in Tripoli. The local internet provider, Libya Telecom and Technology, which insisted it had not blocked Facebook, said it was investigating.Facebook employs Arabic-language reviewers who weed out illegal and forbidden content on its Libyan pages \u2014 part of a global team that works in over 50 languages, the company says.\u201cWe work hard to keep Facebook safe and to prevent people from using our tools to spread hate or incite violence,\u201d the spokeswoman said. The company engages with academics and civil society groups to \u201cbetter understand local issues and context so we can take more effective action against bad actors on Facebook,\u201d she added.But Libyans are adept at circumventing such controls. Users often take screenshots of contentious posts, and redistribute them as images if the original text is removed by Facebook\u2019s moderators.On Monday, Facebook said it had removed those posts, as well as two other pages cited by The New York Times that advertised the services of human traffickers sending illegal migrants by boat to Europe. \u201cWe are investigating to understand why we didn\u2019t take action sooner,\u201d the spokeswoman said.Facebook has developed tools that scan for prohibited content, which human moderators can then remove. These programs flagged 85 percent of the \u201cviolent content\u201d that was removed or given a warning label in the first three months of 2018, the spokeswoman said. But the programs struggle to identify subtler violations such as hate speech or violent threats, which are mostly reported by everyday users. This can make removal slow, particularly in areas where locals may be less inclined to report the posts.In 2011, Facebook reflected the \u201cextraordinary\u201d opening up of Libyan society after four decades of dictatorship under Colonel Qaddafi, said Mary Fitzgerald, an independent researcher on Libya. \u201dEveryone was on Facebook. There was a very rambunctious conversation, and a lot of debate.\u201dBut as the years went on, the people driving the conflict began to \u201ctalk about how social media is one of their most important weapons,\u201d she said. That bred a deep ambivalence among many Libyans toward the media they consume so voraciously.\u201cSo many times over the past seven years,\u201d she added, \u201cI heard people say that if we could just shut down Facebook for a day, half of the country\u2019s problems would be solved.\u201dFollow Declan Walsh on Twitter: @declanwalsh.Declan Walsh reported from Cairo, and Suliman Ali Zway from Berlin.

{"Headline": "The Plot to Subvert an Election: Unraveling the Russia Story So Far", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "Police never identified who had hung the banners, but there were clues. The earliest promoters of the images on Twitter were American-sounding accounts, including @LeroyLovesUSA, later exposed as Russian fakes operated from St. Petersburg to influence American voters.The Kremlin, it appeared, had reached onto United States soil in New York and Washington. The banners may well have been intended as visual victory laps for the most effective foreign interference in an American election in history.For many Americans, the Trump-Russia story as it has been voluminously reported over the past two years is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics. What Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in charge of the investigation, may know or may yet discover is still uncertain. President Trump\u2019s Twitter outbursts that it is all a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary, have taken a toll on public comprehension.But to travel back to 2016 and trace the major plotlines of the Russian attack is to underscore what we now know with certainty: The Russians carried out a landmark intervention that will be examined for decades to come. Acting on the personal animus of Mr. Putin, public and private instruments of Russian power moved with daring and skill to harness the currents of American politics. Well-connected Russians worked aggressively to recruit or influence people inside the Trump campaign.To many Americans, the intervention seemed to be a surprise attack, a stealth cyberage Pearl Harbor, carried out by an inexplicably sinister Russia. For Mr. Putin, however, it was long-overdue payback, a justified response to years of \u201cprovocations\u201d from the United States.And there is a plausible case that Mr. Putin succeeded in delivering the presidency to his admirer, Mr. Trump, though it cannot be proved or disproved. In an election with an extraordinarily close margin, the repeated disruption of the Clinton campaign by emails published on WikiLeaks and the anti-Clinton, pro-Trump messages shared with millions of voters by Russia could have made the difference, a possibility Mr. Trump flatly rejects.As Mr. Trump emerged in spring 2016 as the improbable favorite for the Republican nomination, the Russian operation accelerated on three fronts \u2014 the hacking and leaking of Democratic documents; massive fraud on Facebook and Twitter; and outreach to Trump campaign associates.Consider 10 days in March. On March 15 of that year, Mr. Trump won five primaries, closing in on his party\u2019s nomination, and crowed that he had become \u201cthe biggest political story anywhere in the world.\u201d That same day in Moscow, a veteran hacker named Ivan Yermakov, a Russian military intelligence officer working for a secret outfit called Unit 26165, began probing the computer network of the Democratic National Committee. In St. Petersburg, shift workers posted on Facebook and Twitter at a feverish pace, posing as Americans and following instructions to attack Mrs. Clinton.On March 21 in Washington, Mr. Trump announced his foreign policy team, a group of fringe figures whose advocacy of warmer relations with Russia ran counter to Republican orthodoxy. Meanwhile, Unit 26165 was poring over the bounty from a separate attack it had just carried out: 50,000 emails stolen from the Clinton campaign\u2019s chairman.On March 24, one of the members of the Trump foreign policy team, George Papadopoulos, sat in the cafe of an upscale London hotel with a Russian woman who introduced herself as Mr. Putin\u2019s niece and offered to help set up a meeting between the Russian president and Mr. Trump. The woman and the adviser exchanged frequent messages in the weeks that followed. Today, Mr. Padadopoulos is unsure that those messages came from the person he met in the cafe.The Russian intervention was essentially a hijacking \u2014 of American companies like Facebook and Twitter; of American citizens\u2019 feelings about immigration and race; of American journalists eager for scoops, however modest; of the na\u00efve, or perhaps not so na\u00efve, ambitions of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. The Russian trolls, hackers and agents totaled barely 100, and their task was to steer millions of American voters. They knew it would take a village to sabotage an election.Russians or suspected Russian agents \u2014 including oligarchs, diplomats, former military officers and shadowy intermediaries \u2014 had dozens of contacts during the campaign with Mr. Trump\u2019s associates. They reached out through email, Facebook and Twitter. They sought introductions through trusted business connections of Mr. Trump\u2019s, obscure academic institutions, veterans groups and the National Rifle Association.They met Trump campaign aides in Moscow, London, New York and Louisville, Ky. One claimed the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton; another Russian, the Trump campaign was told, would deliver it. In May and June alone, the Trump campaign fielded at least four invitations to meet with Russian intermediaries or officials.In nearly every case, the Trump aides and associates seemed enthusiastic about their exchanges with the Russians. Over months of such probing, it seems that no one alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the foreign overtures.Whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates conspired with the Russians is a central question of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, who has already charged 26 Russians and won convictions or guilty pleas from the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; the former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and his deputy, Rick Gates; and from Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has pleaded guilty in a separate case.But none of the convictions to date involve conspiracy. There remains an alternative explanation to the collusion theory: that the Trump aides, far from certain their candidate would win, were happy to meet the Russians because they thought it might lead to moneymaking deals after the election. \u201cBlack Caviar,\u201d read the subject line of an email Mr. Manafort got in July 2016 from his associate in Kiev, Ukraine, hinting at the possibility of new largess from a Russian oligarch with whom they had done business.Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School and the great-granddaughter of the Soviet premier Nikita S. Khrushchev, said that what Russia pulled off, through creativity and sheer luck, would have been the envy of Mr. Putin\u2019s predecessors: puncturing the American sense of superiority and insisting on Russia\u2019s power and place in the world.\u201cThis operation was to show the Americans \u2014 that you bastards are just as screwed up as the rest of us,\u201d Professor Khrushcheva said. \u201cPutin fulfilled the dream of every Soviet leader \u2014 to stick it to the United States. I think this will be studied by the K.G.B.\u2019s successors for a very long time.\u201dDirect contactswith Russians byTrump officialsJUNE 16, 2015Trump announcescandidacyTime2016Russian socialmedia fraudRussianhackingDenials ofwrongdoing byTrump and associatesMAY 26, 2016Trump clinchesnominationNOV. 8, 2016Trump winselectionFederalinvestigation ofRussian meddlingJAN. 20, 2017InaugurationJANUARY2018SEPTEMBER2018Continuing\u2026JUNE 2015TrumpannouncescandidacyDirect contactswith RussiansTimeRussiansocial mediafraud2016RussianhackingMAY 2016Trump clinchesnominationELECTIONFederalinvestigationINAUGURATIONDenials ofwrongdoing byTrump and associatesJANUARY2018SEPTEMBER2018By The New York TimesSee the full timeline of events.The Russian leader thought the United States, and Hillary Clinton, had sought to undermine his presidency.The first Russian advance party was tiny: two women on a whirlwind American tour. Hitting nine states in three weeks in summer 2014, Anna Bogacheva and Aleksandra Krylova were supposed to \u201cgather intelligence\u201d to help them mimic Americans on Facebook and Twitter. They snapped photos and chatted up strangers from California to New York, on a sort of Russian \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d road trip for the era of social media.Even then, federal prosecutors would later say, the Russian government was thinking about the next United States presidential election \u2014 perhaps ahead of most Americans. Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova had been dispatched by their employer, an online propaganda factory in St. Petersburg, to prepare to influence American voters.But why did Mr. Putin care about the election, then more than two years away? He was seething. The United States, in his view, had bullied and interfered with Russia for long enough. It was high time to fight back.His motives were rooted in Russia\u2019s ambivalence toward the West, captured in the history of St. Petersburg, Russia\u2019s spectacular northern city and Mr. Putin\u2019s hometown. Peter the Great, the brutal but westward-looking 18th-century czar, had brought in the best Italian architects to construct Russia\u2019s \u201cwindow on Europe\u201d in a swamp.Czar Peter\u2019s portrait replaced Vladimir Lenin\u2019s in Mr. Putin\u2019s office when he took a job working for the city\u2019s mayor in the early 1990s. Twenty-five years later, the internet offered a different kind of window on the West \u2014 a portal that could be used for a virtual invasion.Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, had described the breakup of the Soviet Union as the \u201cgreatest geopolitical catastrophe\u201d of the 20th century, a remarkable statement from a man whose country experienced revolution, civil war, bloody purges and the deaths of 27 million people in World War II. Like many of his fellow citizens, Mr. Putin was nostalgic for Russia\u2019s lost superpower status. And he resented what he saw as American arrogance.With little evidence, Mr. Putin believed this American meddling helped produce street demonstrations in Moscow and other cities in 2011, with crowds complaining of a rigged parliamentary election and chanting, \u201cPutin\u2019s a thief!\u201dRequired fields are marked with an asterisk.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.And Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, cheered the protesters on. Russians, she said, \u201cdeserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted, and that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.\u201dAfter Russian troops seized Crimea and carried out a stealth invasion of Ukraine in 2014, relations grew openly hostile. American support for the new government in Kiev and condemnation of Russian behavior heightened Mr. Putin\u2019s rage at being told what he could do and not do in what he considered his own backyard.If Russia had only a fraction of the United States\u2019 military might and nothing like its economic power, it had honed its abilities in hacking and influence operations through attacks in Eastern Europe. And it could turn these weapons on America to even the score.By making mischief in the 2016 election, Mr. Putin could wreak revenge on his enemy, Mrs. Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, damaging if not defeating her. He could highlight the polarized state of American democracy, making it a less appealing model for Russians and their neighbors. And he could send a message that Russia would not meekly submit to a domineering America.Hence the two Russian women who toured the United States in 2014, keyboard warriors granted the unusual privilege of real-world travel, hitting both coasts, Illinois, Louisiana and Texas. At that point, according to a Russian document cited by the special counsel, Mr. Putin\u2019s intentions for 2016 were already explicit: to \u201cspread distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d\u201cWho is behind these provocations?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe know that among them are employees of official American institutions.\u201dThen something unexpected happened. Of the more than 20 major-party candidates running for the American presidency, only Mr. Trump had repeatedly expressed admiration for Mr. Putin as a \u201cstrong\u201d leader and brushed off criticism of Russia. Only he had little interest in the traditional American preoccupation with democracy and human rights. Only he had explored business interests in Russia for years, repeatedly pursuing a Trump Tower project in Moscow and bringing his beauty pageant there in 2013.\u201cDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow,\u201d the future candidate tweeted at the time, adding wistfully, \u201cif so, will he become my new best friend?\u201dIf Mr. Putin had been designing his ideal leader for the United States, he could hardly have done better than Donald Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cby a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.\u201dAs Donald J. Trump emerged as the favorite for the nomination, his campaign brought on aides tied to Russia.Mr. Trump had steamrollered his primary opponents in part by taking aim at Republican foreign policy orthodoxy. The post-9/11 wars were foolish and costly, he would often say at campaign events. America\u2019s allies were deadbeats and freeloaders, he told supporters, who cheered in agreement. Russia was not an existential threat, he said, but a potential ally in beating back terrorist groups.They took particular umbrage at Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about the Russian president, writing that his \u201cadmiration for foreign dictators such as Vladimir Putin is unacceptable for the leader of the world\u2019s greatest democracy.\u201dBut Mr. Trump was not cowed. He soon signed on new advisers and aides, including some who had been pushed to the fringe of a political party that had long lionized President Ronald Reagan for staring down Soviet leaders at the height of the Cold War.To the Kremlin, they must have looked like a dream team.Mr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, had long viewed Russia as a natural ally in what he saw as a \u201cworld war\u201d against radical Islam. In June 2013, when he was D.I.A. chief, he sat inside the imposing headquarters of the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, and chatted with officers. Two years later, he sat at Mr. Putin\u2019s elbow at a gala dinner in Moscow.Mr. Manafort, a longtime Republican lobbyist, had earned millions working for a pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine and had a history of business dealings with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminum magnate close to Mr. Putin. He was nearly broke when he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 \u2014 hired to help prevent a mass defection of convention delegates \u2014 and yet he offered to work on the campaign unpaid.Carter Page, a businessman who spent several years working in Moscow, was virtually unknown in Washington when Mr. Trump appointed him a foreign policy adviser. But the S.V.R., Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, knew who he was.In 2013, Mr. Page met in New York with a Russian spy posing as an attach\u00e9 at the United Nations and passed along energy industry documents in hopes of securing lucrative deals in Moscow.The F.B.I., which had been tracking Russian spies when Mr. Page came on the bureau\u2019s radar, determined that he had no idea he was meeting with a Russian agent.The new team was in place by the end of March, and Mr. Trump had a new message that was strikingly similar to one of Mr. Putin\u2019s most ardent talking points.\u201cNATO\u2019s not meant for terrorism,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cNATO doesn\u2019t have the right countries in it for terrorism.\u201dBy then, the Russian intelligence operation to intervene in the American election \u2014 including efforts to infiltrate and influence the Trump campaign \u2014 had begun.Mr. Papadopoulos, the 28-year-old campaign adviser, did not know this when he met in the cafe of the London hotel with Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cniece\u201d (he has no niece) and an obscure Maltese professor in late March. The academic had taken an interest in Mr. Papadopoulos when he joined the campaign.F.B.I. agents have identified the professor, Joseph Mifsud, as a likely cutout for Russian intelligence, sent to establish contact with Mr. Papadopoulos and possibly get information about the direction of the Trump campaign. He disappeared after his name surfaced last October, and his whereabouts is unknown. At one point he changed his WhatsApp status to a simple, if cryptic, message: \u201cAlive.\u201dProfessor Mifsud arranged an email introduction between Mr. Papadopoulos and a Russian foreign ministry official. The American also exchanged emails with Olga Polonskaya, the woman in the cafe. \u201cWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d she wrote in one message, and the two discussed a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump.Over time, though, Mr. Papadopoulos came to question whether the messages were actually from Ms. Polonskaya. The woman he had met in the cafe barely spoke English. The emails he received were in nearly perfect English.\u201cI even remember sending her a message asking if I\u2019m speaking to the same person I met in London because the conversations were so strange,\u201d he said during an interview this month.In late April, Mr. Trump gave his first major foreign policy address in the ballroom of a historic Washington hotel. Some of the speech was a familiar litany of Republican policy positions \u2014 hawkish warnings to Iran and pledges to be tough on terrorism. But midway through the speech, as Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States watched from the front seats, Mr. Trump pivoted and said the United States and Russia should look for areas of mutual interest.\u201cCommon sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility, must end, and ideally will end soon,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the signal to meet,\u201d Mr. Papadopoulos wrote in an email to his Russian foreign ministry contact that evening, meaning that Mr. Trump\u2019s favorable comments about Russia suggested he might be interested in meeting Mr. Putin.Just one day earlier, Professor Mifsud had told the campaign aide about a possible gift from Moscow: thousands of hacked emails that might damage Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy.It was a breathtaking revelation. But there was no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos \u2014 while ambitious and eager for advancement in the bare-bones campaign \u2014 passed the information along to anyone inside the Trump circle.More than two years later, Mr. Papadopoulos says he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of telling anyone in the campaign about the emails. He said he was supposed to have a phone call that day with Stephen Miller, a top campaign adviser, but it was postponed. If the two men had talked, Mr. Papadopoulos said, he might have shared the information.\u201cHow fate works sometimes, I guess,\u201d said Mr. Papadopoulos, who has been sentenced to 14 days in jail for lying to the F.B.I.As Mr. Trump continued to win primaries and vacuum up convention delegates late in the spring, the Russians made multiple attempts to establish contact with campaign officials.A Republican operative connected to the N.R.A. tried to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and a Russian central banker at an N.R.A. convention in Kentucky in May. \u201cPutin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d wrote the operative, Paul Erickson, in an email with the subject \u201cKremlin connection.\u201d \u201cEver since Hillary compared Putin to Hitler, all senior Russian leaders consider her beyond redemption.\u201dMr. Page, the foreign policy adviser, was invited to deliver the commencement address at the prestigious New Economic School in Moscow. That invitation now appears to have been an effort both to gain information about the Trump campaign and to influence it by feting Mr. Page in the Russian capital. Russian television that year was describing him as a \u201cfamous American economist,\u201d but he was an obscure figure in this country.At that time, the last American to give the commencement speech was Mr. Obama, who used the opportunity to criticize Russia for its treatment of Georgia and Ukraine.Mr. Page, though, criticized the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the United States and its NATO allies for lecturing Russia about bullying its neighbors, which were former Soviet republics, while the Westerners were taking \u201cproactive steps to encourage regime change overseas.\u201d During his time in Moscow, Mr. Page met with at least one top Russian official and numerous business leaders.And there was the now infamous June 2016 approach to Donald Trump Jr. by Russians whom he and his father had known from their days taking the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. The Russians met at Trump Tower in Manhattan with top campaign officials after promising damaging information on Mrs. Clinton.See the timeline of events that surround the Trump Tower meeting.What exactly transpired during the meeting is still a mystery, but it appears that the Russians pulled a bait-and-switch. They used the session to push for an end to the crippling economic sanctions that Mr. Obama had imposed on Russia.Donald Trump Jr. has said how disappointed he and other campaign advisers were that they didn\u2019t get what the Russians had promised. The campaign\u2019s reaction to the Russian attempts to discredit Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was not to rebuff them or call law enforcement \u2014 it was to try to exploit them.Experts who have studied Russian operations for decades see the catalog of contacts and communications between Russians and Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers as a loosely coordinated effort by Russian intelligence both to get insight into the campaign and to influence it.\u201cThe Russians aren\u2019t reckless, and I don\u2019t see them going through with this effort without thinking they had a willing partner in the dance,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. officer who served as the spy agency\u2019s station chief in Moscow.By midsummer 2016, the Russian contacts sounded alarms inside the F.B.I., where agents had received a tip about Mr. Papadopoulos and puzzled over Mr. Page\u2019s Moscow visit. The bureau sent a trusted informant to help understand what was happening: Stefan Halper, a former Nixon and Reagan adviser and professor at Cambridge University, reached out to Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos under false pretenses.American officials have defended Professor Halper\u2019s work, saying the use of such a confidential informant is routine in a counterintelligence investigation. Mr. Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have called him something different: a \u201cspy\u201d sent by the Obama administration to infiltrate the campaign.Eventually, Mr. Trump would use such episodes as a foundation for his view that America\u2019s law enforcement agencies had been aligned against him from the beginning \u2014 ammunition for a looming war with the \u201cdeep state.\u201d This idea would consume Mr. Trump after he became president, feeding his sense of grievance that the legitimacy of his victory was under attack and shaping his decisions as he tried to blunt the widening Russia investigation.The long-promised \u201cdirt\u201d the Russians had on Mrs. Clinton would soon be made public. Three days after the Trump Tower meeting, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, appeared on a British Sunday television show.He said that his website would soon be publishing a raft of emails related to Mrs. Clinton. And he said something at once ominous and prescient: \u201cWikiLeaks has a very big year ahead.\u201dUsing a hacker persona, Russian military intelligence officers began to reveal documents stolen from the Democrats. A website made its splashy debut three days later, presenting a jaunty hacker who called himself Guccifer 2.0. He had broken into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer network, Guccifer said, offering as proof a selection of purloined documents.\u201cHere are just a few docs from many thousands I extracted when hacking into the DNC\u2019s network,\u201d Guccifer wrote on June 15. \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks,\u201d he added \u2014 which seemed to explain Mr. Assange\u2019s boast.Russian intelligence had worked fast. Just the day before, D.N.C. officials and their cybersecurity contractor, CrowdStrike, had announced that Russian hackers had penetrated the committee\u2019s computer network.Overnight, Russian military intelligence officers set up the website and created the Guccifer persona to counter the D.N.C. accusations. Guccifer \u2014 a name borrowed from a real Romanian hacker \u2014 was presented as a jovial Romanian, a \u201clone hacker,\u201d who in his posts wanted to make one thing very clear: He had nothing whatsoever to do with Russia.Yet the Guccifer gambit would prove remarkably effective at creating doubt about Russia\u2019s responsibility for the hack. Republican operatives working on congressional campaigns emailed \u201cGuccifer\u201d and received hacked documents relevant to their races. For journalists, the claims of the supposed \u201clone hacker\u201d made the role of Russian intelligence seem to be a disputed allegation rather than a proven fact.See the timeline of hacking that led to the indictment.The agency, now called the Main Directorate but often referred to by its former abbreviation, the G.R.U., proved agile, brazen and not terribly discreet \u2014 the same pattern it would show two years later in the nerve-agent poisoning in England of its former officer, the defector Sergei V. Skripal.The hacking might have drawn little attention had the G.R.U. stopped there, simply stealing emails to peruse for intelligence clues. But the Russians\u2019 decision to leak the emails to undercut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy was a huge escalation.The Russian officers\u2019 political skills proved equal to their hacking expertise. They deftly manipulated a long list of Americans and Europeans, many of whom embraced Guccifer\u2019s tall tale and took seriously the claim that the other Russian false front, DCLeaks.com, was run by American \u201chacktivists.\u201dBut the Russians\u2019 masterstroke was to enlist, via the Guccifer persona, the help of WikiLeaks. Neither of the Russians\u2019 websites, Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks.com, had much reach. But WikiLeaks had a large global audience. Its editor, Mr. Assange, shared Mr. Putin\u2019s hatred of Mrs. Clinton and had a soft spot for Russia.Mr. Assange assisted with the subterfuge. He repeatedly denied that he\u2019d received the documents from Russia; whether he was really taken in by the \u201cGuccifer\u201d ruse is uncertain.\u201cThat was just a robbery, I believe, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d the interviewer said. \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m suggesting that our sources take risks,\u201d Mr. Assange said \u2014 and then declined to say if Mr. Rich was a source.Unknown to the feuding Democratic delegates, a cyberdrama had been playing out in secret for weeks, as CrowdStrike experts tried to root out the Russian hackers who had penetrated the D.N.C. and its sister organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Robert S. Johnston, a lead investigator for CrowdStrike, said the Russian hackers, uniformed officers of military intelligence, were \u201clike a thunderstorm moving through the system \u2014 very, very noisy.\u201dCrowdStrike had begun watching the Russians in April, asking D.N.C. staffers to keep quiet about the intrusion. \u201cWe only talked over Signal,\u201d an encrypted text and call service, said Mr. Johnston, a former Marine and veteran of the United States Cyber Command who is now chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Adlumin. Only by following the hackers for several weeks could CrowdStrike be certain it had found the Russians\u2019 tools and blocked their access.But somehow, possibly by intercepting communications inside the D.N.C. or the F.B.I., which was investigating the breach, the G.R.U. officers learned they had been spotted. On May 31, two weeks before the public disclosure of the hack, Ivan Yermakov, a G.R.U. hacker who had used American-sounding online personas \u2014 \u201cKate S. Milton,\u201d \u201cJames McMorgans\u201d and \u201cKaren W. Millen\u201d \u2014 suddenly began searching online for information about CrowdStrike. He sought to find out what the cybersleuths knew about the Russians\u2019 main tool, a nasty piece of malware called X-Agent, the indictment noted.After that, the spy-versus-spy contest escalated. \u201cWe knew it was the Russians, and they knew we knew,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cI would say it was the cyber equivalent of hand-to-hand combat.\u201dThe candidate favored by the Russians alternated between denying their help and seeming to welcome it. On June 15, the day after the D.N.C. hack was disclosed, the Trump campaign pitched in with a novel idea to deflect blame from the Russians: The D.N.C. had somehow hacked itself.But at other times, he appeared to accept that Russia was responsible.\u201cThe new joke in town,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on July 25, \u201cis that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should have never been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.\u201d\u201cBecause we know the ideas of Mr. Stevenson, we in our hearts all favor him,\u201d Khrushchev said in a message passed on by the Soviet ambassador. \u201cCould the Soviet press assist Mr. Stevenson\u2019s personal success? How?\u201dMr. Stevenson declined the offer, in language that reflected the broad American political consensus about foreign election interference. \u201cI believe I made it clear to him,\u201d Mr. Stevenson wrote, \u201cthat I considered the offer of such assistance highly improper, indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned.\u201dRussia did not deliver on Mr. Trump\u2019s request for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. But it had obtained something just as useful: 50,000 emails of John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, stolen via a phishing attack by the G.R.U. Roger Stone, a political operative and longtime Trump friend, seemed to have advance word. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Aug. 25, it would soon be \u201cPodesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201dBut WikiLeaks withheld the Podesta emails for months after receiving them from \u201cGuccifer\u201d in June, evidently waiting for the right moment to have the biggest impact on the race. The time came on Oct. 7, amid two blows to the Trump campaign.See the timeline of events that surround the release of the emails.And then came a potentially lethal disclosure for the Trump campaign: the shocking \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in which Mr. Trump bragged of groping and sexually assaulting women. The candidate desperately needed to change the subject \u2014 and that was the moment WikiLeaks posted the first of thousands of Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails.They were invaluable for political journalists, offering embarrassing comments from staffers about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shortcomings and the full texts of her highly paid speeches to banks and corporations, which she had refused to release. WikiLeaks assisted by highlighting interesting tidbits in yellow.\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d had said \u201cbehind closed doors,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, that terrorism was \u201cnot a threat\u201d; that she had \u201ca great relationship with the financial industry\u201d; that ISIS might infiltrate groups of refugees coming to the United States; that a politician needed to have \u201cboth a public and private position\u201d on policies; and on and on.The quotes were taken out of context, of course, and subjected to the most damaging interpretation. But they seemed to offer a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s hidden views.For the last month of the campaign, in daily releases that kept the Clinton team on the defensive, WikiLeaks delivered the Russians\u2019 gift. If the July D.N.C. dump had been an explosion, the October series was more like unrelenting sniper fire. Whether the timing was decided by the Russians or by Mr. Assange, it proved devastatingly effective.Russian trolls, using fake accounts on social media, reached nearly as many Americans as would vote in the election.David Michael Smith, a Houston political scientist and activist, spotted the alarming call on Facebook. A group called Heart of Texas was suddenly urging Texans to come at noon on May 21, 2016, to protest a 14-year-old Islamic center in downtown Houston.\u201cStop Islamization of Texas,\u201d the post declared, with a photo of the Islamic Da\u2019wah Center, which it called a \u201cshrine of hatred.\u201d It invited protesters to prepare for battle: \u201cFeel free to bring along your firearms, concealed or not!\u201d\u201cWe immediately asked, \u2018What the blank is the Heart of Texas\u2019?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Smith, who started calling friends to organize a counterprotest.Months later, he would find out.Heart of Texas, which garnered a quarter-million followers on Facebook, was one of 470 Facebook pages created 5,000 miles from Houston at the Internet Research Agency, the oddly named St. Petersburg company that would become the world\u2019s most famous manipulator of social media. The two Russian employees who had visited Texas during that 2014 American tour, Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova, evidently had returned home with big ideas about how to exploit the emotional chasms in American politics and culture.Just as the Russians\u2019 Guccifer character had reached out to American activists, journalists and WikiLeaks, the Russian online trolls understood that their real political power would come from mobilizing Americans. The Russian company\u2019s formula was simple: tap into a simmering strain of opinion in the United States and pour on the fuel.Consider the Texas protest. After the Russians put up the \u201cStop Islamization\u201d Facebook post, several dozen like-minded Texans added their own incendiary comments. \u201cAllah Sucks,\u201d wrote one, adding a threat to kill any Muslim who tried to visit him. Another wrote of the Islamic center, \u201cNeed to Blow this place up.\u201dA dozen yelling white supremacists turned out for the protest, at least two of them with assault rifles and a third with a pistol. Others held Confederate flags and a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d banner.Houston police managed to keep them away from a much larger crowd of counterprotesters \u2014 some of whom had responded to a second Russian Facebook call. In a blatant attempt to create a confrontation, another Internet Research Agency page, this one called United Muslims of America, had asked people to rally at exactly the same time and place to \u201cSave Islamic Knowledge.\u201dThe event had no lasting consequences, though clearly it could have ended in tragedy. Still, it demonstrated that young Russians tapping on keyboards in 12-hour shifts could act as puppet masters for unsuspecting Americans many time zones away.When Facebook first acknowledged last year the Russian intrusion on its platform, it seemed modest in scale. The $100,000 spent on ads was a trivial sum compared with the tens of millions spent on Facebook by both the Trump and Clinton campaigns.See the timeline of events that shows Russia\u2019s social media campaign.Oct. 6 18,634 tweetsTweets spike on Oct. 6, the day before the Obama administration formally accuses the Russian government of hacking.

The St. Petersburg trolls tapped the power of Silicon Valley for their stealth intervention in American democracy.The Russian troll operation had gotten its start two years before, focusing at first on government targets closer to home.In 2014, Vitaly Bespalov, then 23, finished a journalism degree in the Siberian city of Tyumen and signed on as a \u201ccontent manager\u201d at the Internet Research Agency, which looked vaguely like a digital marketing firm and offered a relatively generous salary of $1,000 a month.Mr. Bespalov was surprised to discover that his job was to write or swipe stories to post on counterfeit Ukrainian websites, spinning the conflict there to fit the Russian government\u2019s view. He had to be sure always to use the word \u201cterrorists\u201d for the Ukrainian fighters opposed to the Russian invasion that was tearing the country apart.\u201cMy first days on the job I was in shock \u2014 I had no idea what kind of an operation this was,\u201d Mr. Bespalov said in a recent interview while vacationing in Ukraine: his first visit to the country about which he had written so many bogus stories.He was put off by the company\u2019s work but said he chose to stick around for several months, in part to study its operations. \u201cIt was very monotonous and boring,\u201d Mr. Bespalov said. \u201cIt seemed that almost no one liked this work. But almost nobody quit, because everyone needed the money.\u201dSoon he began hearing about a new, secretive department inside the St. Petersburg company that was recruiting English speakers to focus on the United States.If Mr. Trump was borrowing the hacked emails from the Russians for his stump speeches, the online trolls in St. Petersburg returned the favor, picking up the candidate\u2019s populist rhetoric. Even pages that seemed nominally hostile to him often worked in his favor: \u201cWoke Blacks\u201d critiqued Mrs. Clinton for alleged hostility to African-Americans; \u201cUnited Muslims of America\u201d showed her with a woman in a head scarf and a slogan \u2014 \u201cSupport Hillary, Save American Muslims\u201d \u2014 that seemed aimed at generating a backlash.The Russians managed to call a dozen or more rallies like the one in Houston, sometimes paying unwitting American activists for their help via money transfer. The same method may have been used to get the bridge banners of Mr. Putin and Mr. Obama hung.Facebook, reluctant to step into the divisive politics of the Trump presidency, did not acknowledge the Russian intrusion until nearly a year after the election, asserting that Russia had chiefly aimed at sowing division. A closer look suggested a more focused goal: damaging Mrs. Clinton and promoting Mr. Trump.Many of the Facebook memes portrayed Mrs. Clinton as angry, corrupt or crazed. Mr. Trump was depicted as his campaign preferred: strong, decisive, courageous, willing to shun political correctness to tell hard truths. The Russian operation also boosted Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who had dined with Mr. Putin in Moscow, to draw votes from Mrs. Clinton. It encouraged supporters of Mr. Sanders to withhold their votes from Mrs. Clinton even after he endorsed her.The impact is impossible to gauge; the Internet Research Agency was a Kremlin fire hose of influence wielded amid a hurricane of a presidential election. Christopher Painter, who had served under President George W. Bush at the Justice Department and as the State Department\u2019s coordinator for cyberissues from 2011 to 2017, said the propaganda flood and the leaked emails certainly affected the vote. But no one can say whether it made the difference in an election decided by the tiniest of margins, fewer than 100,000 votes in three states.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how much voter suppression it caused, discouraging people from coming out,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how many votes it changed.\u201dHe added that \u201cpeople don\u2019t like to admit they\u2019ve been fooled\u201d \u2014 hence the strenuous efforts from Mr. Trump and his supporters to deny or dismiss the significance of the Russian interference.A case in point would be Harry Miller, a devoted Trump supporter in Florida who was paid to organize a rally in which a woman portraying Mrs. Clinton sat behind bars on the back of his pickup truck. It turned out that the people who had ordered up the rally, \u201cMatt Skiber\u201d and \u201cJoshua Milton,\u201d were pseudonyms for Russians at the Internet Research Agency, according to the Mueller indictment.But don\u2019t tell that to Mr. Miller. Contacted via Twitter, he insisted that he had not been manipulated by Russian trolls.\u201cThey were not Russians, and you know it,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote, adding, \u201cIf you don\u2019t then you are the one snookered.\u201dThe president has created doubts about the investigation and an affinity for Russia among his supporters.The White House statement released at 7:21 p.m. on May 17, 2017, was measured, even anodyne. Reacting to the news that Mr. Mueller had been appointed special counsel for the Russia investigation, the statement quoted Mr. Trump saying that he was \u201clooking forward to this matter concluding quickly,\u201d and that in the meantime he would be fighting \u201cfor the people and issues that matter most to the future of our country.\u201dExactly 12 hours and 31 minutes later, early in the morning without his staff around him, he told the world what he really thought.It had been little more than a week since the president had fired his F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, but the \u201cRussia thing\u201d wasn\u2019t going away. Now the president was up against someone who could become even more formidable \u2014 a careful, tenacious former Marine whose stewardship of the F.B.I. during the Bush and Obama years had been praised by Washington\u2019s establishment.Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct was to fire Mr. Mueller, but he settled for a different strategy. He has used all his power to try to discredit the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Revelation upon revelation about Russian encounters with Trump associates has followed in the months since Mr. Mueller was appointed, intensifying the fear in the White House. Mr. Trump has used his Twitter pulpit to repeatedly assault the Mueller inquiry, and has made scathing remarks at rallies about claims of Russian interference. \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax, O.K.?\u201d he told a Pennsylvania crowd last month. The attacks have had an impact on how Americans view the country\u2019s national security apparatus, how they view the Russia story, even how they view Russia itself.See the full timeline of Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated denials and attacks.The strategy has helped sow doubts about the special counsel\u2019s work in part because Mr. Mueller and his prosecutors only rarely go public with the evidence they have been steadily gathering in secret interviews and closed-door sessions of a grand jury.During a period of 146 days over this year \u2014 between the Feb. 16 indictment of the Internet Research Agency operatives and the July 13 indictment of Russian intelligence officers \u2014 Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was effectively silent. The president was not, sending at least 94 tweets that denied he had been involved in \u201ccollusion,\u201d called the Russian interference a \u201choax\u201d or labeled the Mueller investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dIndictment of Internet Research Agency operativesIndictment of Russianintelligence officersAprilJulyOct.AprilJulyJan. 2017Jan. 2018Jan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018Indictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesAprilIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJulyIndictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018AprilJulyJan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018Indictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesAprilIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJulyBy July, one poll showed that 45 percent of Americans disapproved of how Mr. Mueller was handling the investigation, a 14-point increase from January. The shift was even more dramatic among Republican voters: from 49 percent to 78 percent. More recent polls, conducted since the indictment of the G.R.U. officers and Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction, have shown a reversal of the trend.The president\u2019s aides hardly make a secret of their goal to discredit the investigation before a jury of the public. There is little expectation that Mr. Mueller would ignore Justice Department guidelines and try to indict a sitting president, so Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers see Congress and impeachment as the only threat. Turn the public against impeachment, the thinking goes, and Congress is less likely to act.\u201cMueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game,\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s omnipresent lawyer, told The New York Times last month, without citing any data to buttress his assertion.\u201cSo I think we\u2019ve done really well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my client\u2019s happy.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s frustration with the Russian investigation is not surprising. He is right that no public evidence has emerged showing that his campaign conspired with Russia in the election interference or accepted Russian money. But the inquiry has buffeted his presidency, provoked concern that his attempts to thwart the investigation amount to obstruction of justice and fed his suspicion that the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies \u2014 what he calls \u201cthe deep state\u201d \u2014 are conspiring against him.The desire of the president to make deals with Mr. Putin, and the longstanding skepticism of the intelligence community about Russian intentions and actions, might have made a clash inevitable. But Mr. Trump appears to have had success in persuading some Americans that the spy and law enforcement agencies are corrupt and hyperpartisan. He has scrambled alliances that solidified over decades, including the Republican Party\u2019s reflexive support of the national security agencies. A president in open war with the F.B.I., once inconceivable, is now part of the daily news cycle.Mr. Trump began laying the foundation immediately after he won the presidency, when he questioned the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings that Russia had disrupted the election, and likened America\u2019s spies to Nazis. Since taking office, he has worked with partners in Congress to cast the agencies as part of an insurgency against the White House.It continued in July, when he stood next to Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and declared that he trusted the Russian president\u2019s assurances that Moscow was innocent of interfering in the 2016 election.\u201c\u2018We have found nothing to show collusion between President Trump & Russia, absolutely zero, but every day we get more documentation showing collusion between the FBI & DOJ, the Hillary campaign, foreign spies & Russians, incredible.\u2019\u201dThe reshuffling of alliances has seeped into the media, where the president\u2019s reliable allies have been joined by voices on the left to dismiss the Russia story as overblown. They warn of a new Red Scare.On Fox News, the network where Sean Hannity fulminates nightly about Mr. Mueller and his team, the journalist Glenn Greenwald, a founder of the left-leaning news site The Intercept and a champion of government whistle-blowers, has appeared regularly to dismiss revelations about the investigation and decry officials \u201cwilling to leak, even at the expense of committing crimes,\u201d in order to damage Mr. Trump.Multiple frenzied television segments and hyped news stories have given credence to the concerns of Mr. Greenwald and others about a 21st-century McCarthyism. And critics of the \u201cdeep state\u201d were given powerful ammunition after the release of text messages between two F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, that revealed their animosity toward Mr. Trump. The pair, who were involved in a romantic relationship at the time, have been skewered regularly on Mr. Hannity\u2019s show as the \u201cTrump-hating F.B.I. lovebirds.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s glowing words about Mr. Putin and Russia have created a new affinity for Russia \u2014 in particular its social conservatism and toughness on terrorism \u2014 among Mr. Trump\u2019s most devoted supporters.During a period of myriad accounts about Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the last election, the percentage of Republicans who view Mr. Putin favorably has more than doubled (from 11 percent to 25 percent), according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. Democrats are now far more likely than Republicans to see Russia as a threat. An October 2017 poll showed that 63 percent of Democrats and just 38 percent of Republicans said they saw \u201cRussia\u2019s power and influence\u201d as a significant threat to the United States.Once again, Mr. Trump has flipped the script in the party of Reagan: A country that was once seen as a geopolitical foe is now embraced by many Republicans as a bastion of Christianity and traditional values.Michael McFaul, ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that despite the country\u2019s relative economic and military weakness, Mr. Putin had often played a poor hand deftly. \u201cAcross many dimensions, Putin is using all kinds of instruments of power,\u201d he said.\u201cIt feels to me,\u201d the former ambassador said, \u201clike he\u2019s winning and we\u2019re losing.\u201dOn July 16, the president woke early in Helsinki, hours before he was to sit face to face with Mr. Putin. The meeting came three days after Mr. Mueller indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers. Once again, Mr. Trump dashed off a tweet.\u201cWe agree.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.

{"Headline": "A Wise Man Leaves Facebook ", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKevin Systrom, a founder of Instagram, wasn\u2019t a \u201cteam player.\u201d That was exactly what the company needed. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. This week, Facebook lost an executive who, in a better and different world, might one day have taken the helm of the social networking giant.This might seem like business as usual in Silicon Valley. Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, when it was a wee thing, and helped it surpass a billion users. Fighting over control of tech companies is commonplace, and executive shuffles happen all the time. At Facebook alone in the last two years, the founders of WhatsApp, the messaging product, left amid disagreements over the placement of advertising. So too much of the team that founded the Oculus, Facebook\u2019s virtual reality project, as well as a conga line of other founders of start-ups the social media giant has swallowed whole. They all essentially took the money and ran (usually to luxury yachts in Fiji).But what happened with the Instagram guys is different. A pair of extraordinarily talented entrepreneurs \u2014 who multiple sources said very much wanted to stay at Facebook, who have a gift for making great products and whose jewel-in-the-crown unit was driving the future of the entire Facebook ecosystem \u2014 had worked hard to make their creation a huge success and had remained at the company for six years already. This is not typical in tech, which is a credit to Facebook.But then they became so irked by their boss that they up and left without any warning.\u201cIn a perfect world, they wanted to continue to build and were not bored at all,\u201d said one person with knowledge of the situation. \u201cBut they were frustrated by an inability to take it to the next level.\u201dFrustrated indeed. Mr. Systrom returned on Monday from a parental leave and his first act was to quit. Think about that. While some inside Facebook are trying to spin the narrative that he\u2019d spent his time away deep in contemplation and simply decided that six years was enough, that\u2019s not the true motivation.Those new changes included: Severe cutbacks ordered by Mr. Zuckerberg in how much Instagram was promoted on the main Facebook platform; a long fight over whether Instagram should offer a robust video TV service that would have competed with another on Facebook; the feeling that Instagram was understaffed compared to other less successful initiatives like Oculus; management restructurings that were perceived as moving Instagram down the pecking order; and, most of all, a growing perception that Instagram\u2019s success, especially among young audiences, was somehow hurting the main platform.\u201cWe grew them and now it was time to change the way they operated as things changed\u201d said one person close to Facebook\u2019s top management, echoing a common sentiment.Perhaps. But alienating Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger this way was a mistake, and their departure a bad sign in what has been a year of bad signs for Facebook. It needs those guys now more than ever.Mr. Systrom especially could have helped Mr. Zuckerberg, who, after years of sizzling success, has recently presided over a series of missteps and management snafus. The company is facing Russian meddling, fake news, bot-mania, privacy screw-ups and even tragic deaths due in part to the way the platform was designed and has been used.Oh, and Alex Jones, so much vile Alex Jones.While it\u2019s good to be king \u2014 and Mr. Zuckerberg is that, controlling every aspect of the company from its many units to its board, as the controlling shareholder \u2014 it\u2019s not easy. Without the Instagram founders there, it will be so much harder.Mr. Systrom and Mr. Krieger were dubbed by some at Facebook as not \u201cteam players.\u201d Inside the freakishly cohesive culture of the company, they were considered an irritant.That\u2019s a shame, since that\u2019s exactly what Facebook needs. Which is to say, people willing to challenge the groupthink that for too long included a stubborn resistance to admitting and addressing the company\u2019s flaws.Mr. Systrom wasn\u2019t afraid to do that. When tech executives don\u2019t like a thing I have written, I typically get a call full of gnashing teeth and why-are-you-so-mean plaintiveness. But when I recently declared on Instagram that I was sick of Instagram and had major issues with the service, Mr. Systrom texted and asked me why. It was neither a suck-up nor did he try to debate me.So, I told him: It\u2019s performative; it makes people feel badly, even if it\u2019s beautiful; it has turned into a brag book of strivers; it is a museum and not a place to connect; it has stolen too many of its ideas from Snapchat. That said, I saw the good side, too, and wanted him to make it easier to find the many delightful things, like photographers and funny people, that made the platform joyful.Unlike other hot-house-flower zillionaires I cover, this criticism did not slay Mr. Systrom. Maybe I am setting a low bar, but I admire him for being someone who can always take it, and that quality will be sorely missed at Facebook.Even more important, unlike Mr. Zuckerberg, who in a recent podcast with me was unable to articulate how he felt about the high price society had paid for his success, Mr. Systrom is reflective and self-critical about the challenges that social media faces and the damage that it has done.That was the case at a recent talk I had with him at a hopelessly hip coffee place in San Francisco, where I was left with one thought: He should be the chief executive of Facebook.One thing he said seemed particularly wise, so I asked him if I could put it on the record, and he agreed.It would be nice if he was still in the room to articulate that to powerful people like Mr. Zuckerberg. But now, just like that, he\u2019s not.Advertisement"}

The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.America shouldn\u2019t be in the coup business. Period.It\u2019s a relief, then, to learn that the Trump administration chose not to aid rebellious leaders in Venezuela seeking to overthrow President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But it\u2019s worrisome to think that President Trump and his advisers made the right call for the wrong reason \u2014 lack of confidence in the plotters to succeed in a risky operation rather than principled concern about intervention.Given the turmoil in Venezuela, it is not unreasonable for American diplomats to meet with all factions, including mutinous military officers, to learn their thinking. For instance, who would be in charge in a political transition process? What kind of government do they aim for? But holding multiple meetings with the plotters begins to look like collaboration. The news was bound to leak out, as it has. For much of the past century, the United States compiled a sordid history in Latin America, using force and cunning to install and support military regimes and other brutal thugs with little interest in democracy. Gunboat diplomacy in the early 20th century saw American Marines invading Cuba, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and elsewhere to set up governments of Washington\u2019s choosing.A vanishing few of these interventions came to anything that could be considered a good end.Here\u2019s the right way to put pressure on Venezuela\u2019s regime: Mr. Trump and other leaders need to keep trying to encourage a transition deal by tightening targeted sanctions on Mr. Maduro and his cronies who undergird an autocratic, corrupt system. Cuba, which is dependent on Venezuela for oil and has close relations with Mr. Maduro, should be encouraged to use its leverage. Mr. Trump and other leaders also need to coordinate and expand assistance for Venezuela\u2019s suffering people.It\u2019s heartening that the White House sent a diplomat to the meetings, rather than a C.I.A. officer, which would have been a more incendiary signal. Clearly a diplomatic path is better than having the United States meddle in yet another country, an enterprise certain to fail miserably. As a result, although democracy has spread to most governments in Latin America over the past quarter-century, few people or leaders in the region would protest if Mr. Maduro were forced out. It\u2019s difficult to be optimistic about Venezuela, which many experts predict will collapse into anarchy. Still, backing a coup would also make it harder for Americans to advocate credibly on behalf of democracy around the world, an effort that is already compromised by President Trump\u2019s own trampling of democratic norms at home, and his enthusiasm for foreign tyrants.Advertisement"}

Two running themes throughout the ceremony \u2014 prompting speculation long before the night kicked off \u2014 were the growing role streaming services have played in recent years and the intensifying push for diversity in casting and directing.This year, Netflix led the pack with 112 nominations and ended HBO\u2019s 17-year streak as the most nominated platform. In the end, Netflix and HBO called it a tie; both came away with 23 Emmys each. HBO claimed the top prize when \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d won for best drama. But it was Amazon that won for best comedy series for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d one of five awards the show received at the ceremony.Notably, this year the Emmys boasted the most diverse group of nominees in its history \u2014 as those who watched the program were reminded a number of times. \u201cYes indeedy, one step closer to a black Sheldon,\u201d joked Kenan Thompson of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d referring to the lead character in \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201dComedians and presenters throughout the evening were quick to mock premature back-patting on inclusion and sexual harassment.

{"Headline": "What Happened to Fan Bingbing, China\u2019s Most Famous Actress?", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Fan Bingbing is arguably the most famous actress in China, a prolific star who has made the leap to international fame with roles in the \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cX-Men\u201d franchises. She appeared in Cannes in May to promote a coming spy blockbuster with Jessica Chastain, Marion Cotillard, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Lupita Nyong\u2019o.She has more than 62 million followers on China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter, Weibo, and appears in ads for products around the world \u2014 from vitamins in Australia to lipstick by Guerlain, the watches of Montblanc and the diamonds of De Beers.Now she is missing.Ms. Fan, who turns 37 on Sunday, has dropped out of public view for more than three months \u2014 the victim of a sudden and precipitous fall from grace.Her disappearance has been greeted with concern among fans and fear among her counterparts in the industry. It has fueled a flurry of rumors of personal rivalries and political intrigue, even at the pinnacles of power in Beijing, though few concrete facts.That so little is known about someone so famous in China \u2014 even whether she is in detention, or in hiding \u2014 says much about the murky intersection of politics and business, entertainment and celebrity.\u201cShe\u2019s like collateral damage,\u201d Hung Huang, a critic and publisher, said.Ms. Fan\u2019s disappearance appears to be related to a government investigation into tax evasion in the film business, but she has not been charged with any crime, and no officials have confirmed that she is even under investigation. Few who know her, or the industry, believe it is simply a matter of paying taxes, though. And the damage to her reputation \u2014 and perhaps her livelihood \u2014 has already been done.The film\u2019s release, originally scheduled for August, has also been delayed until October, though whether that is linked to her situation remains unclear. (The name in Chinese is \u201cDa Hong Zha,\u201d which, inauspiciously for any movie, can mean \u201cThe Big Bomb.\u201d)Another film in which she had a role, a sequel of an animated motion-capture film, also was delayed in June and has not yet been rescheduled. Raymond Zhou, an independent film critic, claimed in an interview that Ms. Fan\u2019s role had been edited out.A promotional video Ms. Fan recorded for De Beers, posted on YouTube on May 24, amounts to one of her last public appearances.In it, Ms. Fan describes how her parents sent her to music school as a child and wanted her to be a teacher, though she decided as a teenager to pursue an acting career. (She compares cutting a diamond for jewelry to the process of making a film.)\u201cWomen today are very powerful,\u201d she says, \u201cthey take control of their work and career, and in the meantime take care of their families.\u201dThe practice of having dual contracts \u2014 known as \u201cyin and yang\u201d contracts \u2014 is widespread in many industries in China as a way to avoid taxes, but Mr. Cui\u2019s accusation prompted the State Administration of Taxation to announce a broad inquiry into the entertainment industry.Its announcement did not mention Ms. Fan, but included this warning: \u201cIf violations of tax laws and regulations are found, they will be handled in strict accordance with the law.\u201dMr. Cui later retreated from his initial accusations, saying he did not mean to target Ms. Fan. His ire appeared to be directed as much toward the director of \u201cCell Phone,\u201d Feng Xiaogang. Mr. Cui previously had accused him of slander because the plot \u2014 in which a prominent television anchor has an affair with an assistant, played by Ms. Fan \u2014 bore striking, though he said inaccurate, parallels to Mr. Cui\u2019s own career. A person at Mr. Cui\u2019s office said he was no longer making any statements on the matter.Efforts to reach Ms. Fan or a spokesman in recent weeks proved unsuccessful.Officials declined to comment on the status of the investigation, or whether Ms. Fan has since become a focus of it. An official with the Public Security Bureau in Wuxi, the city near Shanghai where her studio is based, refused to comment on whether the bureau had, as rumored, taken over the case.\u201cThe situation is that we all speak with one voice from top to bottom: that is that we don\u2019t accept interviews and we have no comment,\u201d the official said.Until now, at least, a partnership with Ms. Fan has been a prize for international luxury companies. She is a regular sight at red carpets and fashion shows around the world, and has a well-documented love of Louis Vuitton, Valentino and Chopard.Luxury brands, though, tend to be careful with China, because their biggest growth is in Asian markets.Montblanc, a German accessories brand that has worked with Ms. Fan since April, confirmed that it had terminated her contract. The company praised Ms. Fan as \u201cthe quintessential modern woman\u201d when it brought her on in the spring.De Beers, the diamond company, has had a long relationship with Ms. Fan, who wore De Beers jewelry at the Cannes Film Festival this year. On Wednesday, she was missing from company web pages. After inquiries about the removal, she reappeared.Jeff Trexler, associate director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University, said displays of conspicuous wealth are seen as an affront to the message being promoted by the Chinese government: that everyone in the country is rising upward on an economic wave.\u201cThe more wealthy your spokespeople are, the greater the risk is,\u201d he said.Companies also worry that if they upset the Chinese government by continuing to promote someone who has fallen from favor, as Ms. Fan appears to have, they might suffer in a variety of ways, from taxes audits to obstacles opening new stores.When it comes to the entertainment industry, which is heavily censored in China, the authorities appear to be particularly sensitive to the influence stars can have \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 on public opinion.Ms. Hung, the critic, said the investigation clearly had been intended to send a message about celebrity excess \u2014 and perhaps even about tax evasion. She noted the often-cited idiom \u201cto kill a chicken to scare the monkey,\u201d and said even the uncertainty around Ms. Fan\u2019s case would have a chilling effect.\u201cIt makes people more nervous,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen it is unclear what is going on.\u201dJonathan Ansfield, Claire Fu, Olivia Mitchell Ryan, Iris Zhao and Zo\u00e9 Mou contributed research.

{"Headline": "Leadership, Laughter and Tariffs", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAre trade wars \u201cgood and easy to win\u201d? Not when you\u2019ve alienated the whole world.Opinion ColumnistThere are so many issues breaking right now that it\u2019s hard to keep track \u2014 and focusing on any one leads to feelings of guilt about neglecting the others. But it\u2019s worth remembering that the Trump trade war still seems to be on track, and important to have a sense of its effects.The view within the Trump administration is, of course, that \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win.\u201d Where does this view come from? Actually, it involves two propositions.First, it takes the mercantilist view under which trade as a zero-sum game in which whoever sells more wins. Because the U.S. runs a trade deficit, we\u2019re losers, and anything that reduces that trade deficit is good.Second, it takes for granted the proposition that precisely because the U.S. exports less to other countries than we buy in return, a trade war will hurt them more than it hurts us, reducing U.S. imports more than it reduces U.S. exports.Now, anyone who looks at the actual effects of international trade knows that the first proposition is wrong: trade isn\u2019t just about selling stuff, it\u2019s about getting better, cheaper stuff both to consume and to use as inputs in production. But you might assume that at least the second proposition is true: a round of tariff retaliation should reduce foreign exports to the U.S. more than it reduces U.S. exports to the rest of the world, simply because those foreign exports are bigger to start with.Let\u2019s be clear: these are the results of models, not actual experience, and could be wrong. But it\u2019s still worth asking why the modelers are getting this result. The short answer is the phenomenon known in the field as \u201ctrade diversion.\u201dFor simplicity, think of the world as three economies: America, China, and Europe. Both the ECB and the BOE are assuming scenarios in which America raises tariffs on China and Europe, with China and Europe retaliating. But China and Europe don\u2019t raise tariffs on each other.Such a scenario gives both foreign consumers and foreign producers a lot of options to diversify away from America. Chinese producers, facing U.S. tariffs, can sell more to Europe instead; Chinese consumers, instead of paying tariffs on goods imported from America, can seek substitutes from Europe. The story for Europe is the same. But U.S. consumers and businesses won\u2019t have comparable flexibility.The difference in ability to switch partners means that both U.S. exports and U.S. businesses that depend on imported components etc. will be hit harder for any given level of tariffs than their counterparts abroad.But why assume that it\u2019s a unilateral U.S. trade war against everyone? Because that\u2019s what is happening. The Trump administration has isolated America on many fronts, and trade policy is very much one of them. Under different leadership, America and Europe might be working together to put pressure on China over things like intellectual property, but given who\u2019s actually in charge, we\u2019re on our own.As Trump just found out at the U.N., the world is literally laughing at us. And it certainly doesn\u2019t trust us, in fact is looking for ways to cut us out of various loops. This matters for a lot of things \u2014 and trade war, it turns out, is one area where go-it-alone will be costly.Advertisement"}

This is a pattern of widespread and gross violations of the power a man of God has over a child, and of cover-ups stretching from Pennsylvania and Boston to every corner of the United States and the world. How have so many pedophiles been allowed into the priesthood? How could so many bishops have so consistently looked the other way or worse, paid off victims or foisted predatory priests on unsuspecting parishes elsewhere? Many explanations have been offered: the all-male priesthood and the celibacy imposed on Catholic priests; the elitism, careerism and clericalism of the church hierarchy; the lack of transparency or accountability among bishops.That is essential. Pope Francis has made strides in changing the culture of the papacy and in making the Catholic Church more inclusive, and he seems now to have grasped the gravity of the sickness afflicting the church. But for what is sure to be a defining struggle of his papacy, he will need to look beyond the cardinals, prelates and priests \u2014 indeed beyond himself \u2014 for answers and solutions.Any credible effort at reforming the clerical culture of the church, restoring trust, instituting accountability and eradicating the cancer of sexual abuse will require the full participation of experts, prosecutors, victims and many others outside the clergy and the church \u2014 women as well as men.

Good rules create healthy markets.Mr. Ryu is the chief executive of Guidewire Software.These are polarized times. Yet for business leaders across the political spectrum, there is one area of troubling consensus: a contempt for government\u2019s ability to regulate effectively.As both a chief executive and a citizen, I believe the ideology behind this agenda gambles with the foundation of our prosperity.The Silicon Valley flavor of this ideology holds that success in business flows from intelligence and hard work. It seems preposterous that fumbling bureaucrats could understand what we do, let alone presume to limit our freedom of action.Like most chief executives, I sometimes chafe under the rules that govern a public company. But I have also come to recognize the limits of corporate self-governance and to appreciate the regulatory environment we have.My company serves companies that provide auto, home, business and workers' compensation insurance. Because insurers collect premiums up front in exchange for a promise to pay for future losses \u2014 a promise documented in a dense legal contract \u2014 regulation is necessary to protect people from misunderstanding what they are buying and to limit the risk that insurers will go bankrupt when their policyholders need them most. Most insurance executives I\u2019ve met value this regulation because it prevents market-destroying behavior by insurers charging prices far below true rates of loss.Regulations correct for \u201cexternalities,\u201d where market forces alone would lead to the destruction of unpriced shared goods, such as clean water and air. Anti-predatory lending laws and disclosure rules for mortgages protect consumers from exploitation. Regulations can curtail the ability of one person\u2019s risk-taking to cause collective losses. This kind of \u201casymmetric risk-taking\u201d was the root cause of the 2008 financial crisis. And regulations should guard against monopolies that undermine competition. These rules often arise as correctives to a disaster: the Great Depression, Three Mile Island, thalidomide, the global financial crisis. We should heed those lessons, not burn them down in a fit of Jacobin rage or wave them off with wishful thinking about self-regulation.As consumers and citizens, we need companies to succeed because they provide the best products and services \u2014 not because they dump the most pollution in our water, most skillfully exploit our personal information, or are the best at avoiding pension obligations. When a democracy fails to protect people from these depredations, authoritarianism grows in appeal. And the capitalists among us should realize we have the most to lose in the long run: an economic system in which we are rewarded for maximizing our growth and profits. Advertisement"}

That could force him to assume a different position at Tesla. It could also affect his other companies, SpaceX and the Boring Company, were they to go public, and potentially harm their ability to raise money from investors.Andrew\u2019s take:Mr. Musk will want to prove that his intent wasn\u2019t to mislead investors, probably by demonstrating that he had real conversations to take the company private. But his intent is almost beside the point. He can be found guilty simply for being \u201creckless.\u201d And na\u00efvet\u00e9 isn\u2019t a defense.This is turning into a sad story for Tesla\u2019s employees, investors and ultimately everyone who has followed Mr. Musk\u2019s efforts to transform the auto and energy industries.The data suggest that companies still feel confident enough about the economy to strike big deals. Much of this year\u2019s activity was driven by giant takeovers like Walt Disney\u2019s acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox and T-Mobile\u2019s proposed acquisition of Sprint.What remains to be seen is whether trade wars and other economic sandbags will weigh down the M.&A. run.In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors, one of the world\u2019s largest fund managers, pushed companies to put more women on corporate boards. FactSet has crunched the numbers, and there\u2019s a long way to go:\u2022 Companies in the Russell 3000 stock index with no female board members declined to 18 percent, from 23 percent.\u2022 Companies in which women hold 15 percent of the board seats or less decreased to 47 percent, from 58 percent.\u2022 The boards of 22 companies are equally split between men and women, while women make up the majority at 14 companies, up from five.\u2022 Just 5 percent of companies in the index are led by women, unchanged from March 2017.The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds.

It\u2019s tempting to focus instead on the pressure building on Trump from multiple sources: the Mueller investigation, Paul Manafort\u2019s cooperating with Robert Mueller, Michael Cohen\u2019s guilty plea, the wins of progressive Democratic candidates, falling poll numbers. It\u2019s tempting to think Trump\u2019s finished, even if he\u2019s already been pronounced politically dead countless times.Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, is right to tell Democrats to stop \u201cpounding away at business.\u201d The Democratic Party is long on anger but short still of a winning message. It\u2019s a big mistake for Democrats to have allowed founding American myths of can-do optimism and self-reliance to become the exclusive preserve of Republicans. A unifying Democratic candidate from the heartland could claw them back.Saving the planet is important work. But an exclusive focus on environmentalism that ignores working people\u2019s immediate needs can easily look like elitist indifference.

But on this signature issue, the Democratic Party is widely seen as the author of a policy that failed low-wage Americans. Again, this looks like elitist indifference.Colcord calls himself an \u201cultraconservative Democrat.\u201d He supported Trump\u2019s tax cuts for businesses but hated the tax cuts for the wealthiest, and he says the biggest reason he\u2019s a Democrat is growing income inequality, an issue Republicans dismiss. He believes strongly in Roe v. Wade, having witnessed a 13-year-old giving birth when he was an intern in a hospital (\u201cThat really set my feelings\u201d). He can\u2019t stand Trump\u2019s lies. He thinks that the country desperately needs immigration \u2014 some Colorado farms can\u2019t find workers, thanks to Trump \u2014 and that Trump\u2019s proposed wall is a crazy waste of money.At the same time, he\u2019s disillusioned with a party that can\u2019t find a political idiom comprehensible to Americans around him.

{"Headline": "The Big Myth About Teenage Anxiety ", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRelax: The digital age is not wrecking your kid's brain. Dr. Friedman is a psychiatrist. We hear a lot these days that modern digital technology is rewiring the brains of our teenagers, making them anxious, worried and unable to focus.Don\u2019t panic; things are really not this dire.So what\u2019s behind the idea that teenagers are increasingly worried and nervous? One possibility is that these stories are the leading edge of a wave of anxiety disorders that has yet to be captured in epidemiological surveys. Or maybe anxiety rates have risen, but only in the select demographic groups \u2014 the privileged ones \u2014 that receive a lot of media attention.[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]But it\u2019s more likely that the epidemic is simply a myth. The more interesting question is why it has been so widely accepted as fact. One reason, I believe, is that parents have bought into the idea that digital technology \u2014 smartphones, video games and the like \u2014 are neurobiologically and psychologically toxic. If you believe this, it seems intuitive that the generations growing up with these ubiquitous technologies are destined to suffer from psychological problems. But this dubious notion comes from a handful of studies with serious limitations.But, once again, these studies cannot tell us whether the brain abnormalities are the result of excessive internet use, or a pre-existing risk factor for it.No surprise there. If I scan your brain while showing you whatever it is that turns you on \u2014 sex, chocolate or money, say \u2014 your reward pathway will light up like a Christmas tree. But that hardly means you are addicted to these things.The real question is whether digital technology can produce the enduring changes in the brain that addictive drugs do. There is little evidence that this is the case. And while an alcoholic deprived of his drink can go into life-threatening withdrawal, I have yet to see an adolescent in the emergency room with smartphone withdrawal \u2014 just a sullen teenager who wants his device back.Considering all this, why do so many parents still insist that their teenager has a problem with anxiety? I fear that it reflects a cultural shift toward pathologizing everyday levels of distress.Some would argue that young people today are more worried because the world is now in a more parlous state, what with intense competition for college and the lingering effects of the Great Recession, among other factors. Sure, but then that anxiety is an appropriate response to life\u2019s challenges \u2014 not a disorder. I got a clue when, for the first time a few years ago, I received a phone call from the mother of a teenage patient. She was concerned that her son was unhappy in the wake of a breakup with his girlfriend and asked me to call him to \u201ccheck on him.\u201dSince there was nothing more than a vague worry about his unhappiness \u2014 a perfectly normal response to romantic disappointment \u2014 I told her that he could always contact me if he needed to.Since then, I have received similar calls from parents worried about their teenagers\u2019 ability to handle everyday adversity \u2014 for example, underperforming on a high-stakes exam or failing to get a summer job. These well-meaning parents are conveying to their kids that their emotional responses to difficult but ordinary experiences are not to be taken in stride, but viewed as something needing clinical attention. The truth is that our brains are both more resilient and more resistant to change than we think. The myth of an epidemic of anxiety disorder rooted in a generation\u2019s overexposure to digital technology reveals an exaggerated idea about just how open to influence our brains really are.Yes, our brain has evolved to learn and extract critical information from the environment, but there are limits to neuroplasticity. Even when we are young and impressionable, our brains have molecular and structural brakes that control the degree to which they can be rewired by experience (and these tighten as we age). This is a good thing; without these limits, we would be at risk of overwriting \u2014 and losing \u2014 accumulated knowledge that is critical to our survival, to say nothing of our identity.It\u2019s good to keep in mind that the advent of new technology typically provokes medical and moral panic. Remember all those warnings that TV would cause brain rot? Never happened. The notion that the brain is a tabula rasa that can be easily transformed by digital technology is, as yet, the stuff of science fiction. So don\u2019t assume that there\u2019s something wrong with your kid every time he\u2019s anxious or upset. Our teenagers \u2014 and their brains \u2014 are up to the challenges of modern life.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can You Spot the Deceptive Facebook Post?", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "Advertisement\nFacebook, Twitter and Google executives have been invited to testify in Washington on Wednesday about foreign influence campaigns and disinformation online ahead of the midterm elections in November.The problem has been far reaching. Over the summer, Facebook announced the discovery of hundreds of fake pages and user accounts on its site. Some pages appeared to specifically target Americans with divisive messages, using the same tactics that Russian operatives did to influence voters during the 2016 presidential campaigns.The latest influence campaigns also imitated posts by legitimate pages and groups on Facebook that advocate political beliefs, making it difficult to tell what was a genuine post and what was not. Let\u2019s compare some to see if you can tell the difference. Spoiler: It isn\u2019t easy.\u201cResisters\u201d was a fake account that Facebook removed in July. \u201cFeminist News\u201d is a real Facebook page, as far as we can tell. (We asked Facebook to confirm the examples of real accounts used here are in fact authentic, and were told there was no apparent reason to suspect otherwise.)The Resisters page existed for more than a year and described itself as \u201conline and offline feminist activism against fascism,\u201d according to Facebook and researchers at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which analyzes disinformation online and works with Facebook.Although Facebook has still not tied this page to Russia, the language used in its posts and several other factors suggest a connection. For one, a Russian account that Facebook removed in 2017 had been set as an administrator of the Resisters page, though \u201cfor only seven minutes,\u201d Facebook said. Before being shut down, a Russian account had also shared an event created by the Resisters page with its followers.Facebook removed the event page before the rally, and informed 3,200 users who either expressed interest in the counterprotest or said they would attend about the suspicious activity behind it.\u201cAztlan Warriors\u201d was part of an influence operation, and \u201cAztec Mayan Inca Native Warriors\u201d is a real Facebook page.The Aztlan Warriors and Brown Power pages both addressed issues around immigration and colonialism, often relying on historical references. Here\u2019s an Aztlan Warriors post from July, and a Brown Power post that Facebook took down in 2017:Like the Resisters page, the Aztlan Warriors page also corresponded to the name of a Twitter account, \u201c@warriors_aztlan,\u201d that was recently identified as part of Russia\u2019s influence operation. That account, according to archives, posted tweets with similar sentiments about immigration.\u201cMindful Being\u201d was part of an influence operation, and \u201cRevolutionary Self-Care\u201d is a real Facebook page.The Mindful Being page existed for only two months before Facebook removed it. The page mainly focused on innocuous topics like health and well-being, though some of its posts challenged the media and the pharmaceutical industry, suggesting it was laying the groundwork to tread into more controversial content.According to information collected by the Atlantic Council before the page was shut down, however, Mindful Being did on at least one occasion employ a tactic common among the Russian pages. The text in the post below was wholesale copied and pasted from an article on the website Gaia.com.Russian pages frequently plagiarized in this way, possibly to get around the language barrier that gave them away in other posts.\u201cBlack Elevation\u201d was part of an influence operation, and \u201cBlack Excellence\u201d is a real Facebook page.Black Elevation was the largest of the fake pages Facebook shut down at the end of July, with nearly 140,000 followers. The group targeted activists fighting for racial equality in the United States.Like the Resisters and Aztlan Warriors pages, Black Elevation had a corresponding Twitter account, @black_elevation, that was identified this year as part of a Russian influence operation.Mimicking groups like Black Lives Matter to sow divisions among Americans is a well-known strategy of Russian influence operations. Hundreds of the Facebook ads bought by Russian trolls, removed from the social network last year and released by Congress in May, were clearly meant to incite racial tension.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it was a false page,\u201d said Carla Cubit, an activist in New York who had shared the page\u2019s Facebook events on her Twitter account. \u201cIt seemed legitimate.\u201dHow did you do?Images from Facebook, the Atlantic Council and CongressAdvertisement"}

But, this theory goes, they mistake a bright artificial source like an electric light for moonlight and alter their flight path in such a way that they spiral toward or circle the artificial source instead, often with fatal results. Another theory is that a very bright light creates the appearance of a dark area around it and that the moths are flying into that apparent dark space, perhaps to hide there. Others have proposed that the bright light dazzles the moths or temporarily blinds them, or that certain wavelengths mimic a food source or potential mate.

But when the news site called neighbors, they were told that an elderly woman lives in the apartment and that no men were among her visitors.The website also reported evidence that Mr. Boshirov was cited for two traffic violations a few days apart in July 2015. But the case numbers for the two enforcement proceedings did not match typical sequences, and two public databases that would normally include traffic violations did not list the infractions.Mr. Boshirov\u2019s pages on Facebook and VKontakte, a Russian social media site, identify him as a graduate of Moscow State University\u2019s geography department who specialized in land hydrology and worked at Headway, a Moscow company that operates a system for monitoring drug purchases. The only photo on his Facebook account, uploaded in October 2014, shows a view of Old Town Square in Prague.After Mr. Boshirov was charged in the nerve agent attack, Ms. Chopivskaya was inundated with inquiries and chose to delete him from her friends list. She said she did not recognize the man in the photograph released by the British authorities.A news channel on the messaging service Telegram reported that the email address used to register Mr. Boshirov\u2019s Facebook page was associated with an account on Moy Mir, another social media website. That account, according to the Telegram news channel, Chudesa OSINT, had subscribed to a group called Men\u2019s Club and downloaded a game called Zombie Fight, all typical online activities.The Moy Mir account was active even after the poisonings last spring, with the most recent login registered on July 19.Less is known about Aleksandr Petrov, a common combination of name and surname for Russians.According to the flight manifests, Fontanka reported, he was born on July 13, 1979. The site found that someone with that name and birth date worked at Microgen, a state-owned Russian pharmaceutical company specializing in vaccines. But when contacted by RT_Russian, a Telegram channel associated with the state television channel RT, this Aleksandr Petrov said it was a case of mistaken identity, as he had never traveled to London.Fontanka reported that the passports the two men used to fly to Britain had numbers suggesting they were issued no earlier than 2016, and flight records show that from September 2016 to March 2018, they visited between them five European cities: Amsterdam, Geneva, London, Milan and Paris.According to the website, Mr. Petrov and Mr. Boshirov both had return tickets for two different Moscow-bound flights, and took the one that left from London earlier.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin, said Russia had nothing to do with the poisonings. So far, he said, \u201clegal basis\u201d was lacking for Russia to investigate the charged men, because there had been no official request from Britain.\u201cIf they see no point, we can only regret this,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Retreats on Publicizing Body Count of Militants Killed in Afghanistan", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Taking a page from Vietnam War propaganda, the American military in Afghanistan has been widely publicizing body counts of Taliban and Islamic State fighters killed in battle. Officials described the practice, which began in January, as part of an apparent strategy to rally White House support for remaining in the conflict.In roughly three dozen statements, the military announced the deaths or wounding of more than 2,500 enemy fighters. The media releases were posted online, where they could have been seen by at least hundreds of thousands of internet followers, including on Facebook and Twitter.On Thursday morning, in response to questions from The New York Times, the practice abruptly stopped.The body counts served as a grisly contrast to other metrics that paint a grimmer reality of the war effort \u2014 including high attrition rates in the Afghan military and the loss of territory to Taliban militants.In one example, the military headquarters in Kabul announced that at least 1,700 enemy fighters had been killed or hurt in 90 operations over a three-week period in late June and early July.\u201cThe results seen on the battlefield are obvious,\u201d Maj. Gen. Andrew Poppas, the chief of operations for the American-led campaign in Afghanistan, said in the July 21 news release.He said Afghan security forces \u201ctake the fight to the enemy and continue to remove all who oppose them at every turn.\u201dTop Pentagon officials have flatly said they oppose using body counts as a way to drum up public \u2014 and political \u2014 backing for the 17-year war that President Trump has repeatedly threatened to leave.As recently as last year, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis openly disagreed with using body counts as propaganda.\u201cYou all know of the corrosive effect of that sort of metric back in the Vietnam War,\u201d Mr. Mattis told journalists after declining to release the number of Islamic State fighters killed in an enormous American bombing in April 2017 in eastern Afghanistan. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has stayed with us all these years.\u201d\u201cFor many years, we have not been calculating the results of warfare by simply quantifying the number of enemy killed,\u201d Mr. Mattis said.It is not clear who decided to start publicizing the enemy body count in Afghanistan this year. Col. Rob Manning, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Thursday it was done to highlight \u201cthe ever-increasing capabilities\u201d of Afghan security forces. The \u201cdefensive progress\u201d of the Afghans, Colonel Manning said in a statement, \u201cdemonstrates that terrorists cannot win militarily.\u201dCurrent and former Defense Department officials said the propaganda campaign appeared to be part of a larger strategy to convince Mr. Trump of gains in the war \u2014 and the military power invested in it.But even Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., who at the time was the commander of American forces in Afghanistan, in November called the accounting of enemy casualties \u201cnot an effective way of communicating what\u2019s going on the battlefield.\u201dIn a statement emailed to The Times early Thursday, Col. David M. Butler, a spokesman for the American-led mission in Afghanistan, said the military will occasionally \u201chighlight the application of violence.\u201d\u201cWe realize strikes, body counts, and leaders removed from the battlefield are not decisive on their own and we don\u2019t claim they are,\u201d Colonel Butler said in the email. \u201cThis command is going to refrain from publishing this type of information unless absolutely necessary to provide context in extenuating circumstances.\u201dThere are roughly 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan \u2014 including 4,000 that were added under Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy. Most of the forces are restricted to advising roles behind the front lines. As a result, estimates of dead militants are difficult to verify, according to three military officers familiar with the process.When not accompanied by American forces, Afghan troops have in the past overestimated the number of enemy combatants killed in firefights.A military document obtained by The Times concluded that airstrikes carried out by the Afghan Air Force in September 2017 resulted in enemy casualty estimates that \u201cappear to be inflated.\u201d It noted that two of the six strikes purported to have killed 135 militants \u2014 an unusually high amount.American combat operations officially ended in Afghanistan in 2014, when the mission shifted to training and advising local security forces. During the last two years of the Obama administration, the United States military generally avoided publicizing the number of militants killed during operations.Rare exceptions \u2014 a total of four mentions of dead militants in 2015 and 2016 \u2014 were included in reports about civilian casualties and, in one case, a high-profile hostage rescue.\u201cThe removal of such a large group of Taliban fighters in one day is a tangible example of Afghan and U.S. cooperation using intelligence and operations to spoil Taliban plans,\u201d Brig. Gen. Otto Liller, the deputy commanding general of a Special Operations Task Force, said in the Sept. 12 release.But American military officials acknowledge that the running tally risks alienating regional allies while inspiring more people to turn against the United States.\u201cThe body count figures are troubling because it shows our utter lack of strategy,\u201d said Jason Dempsey, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \u201cIt\u2019s just showing activity for activity\u2019s stake.\u201dAn early sign of the renewed public relations campaign in the war came days after Mr. Trump took office in January 2017.At the time, a special operations unit deployed to Afghanistan was told to prepare for a number of missions that had been deemed too risky by the Obama administration. The commander of the unit, according to one American commando who was at the briefing, said the operations were meant to show Mr. Trump what they were capable of achieving in Afghanistan.By early February, the Special Operations unit was ready to attack a compound that likely housed Abdul Hasib, then the so-called emir of the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan. But General Nicholson canceled the raid after the death of a Navy SEAL in Yemen \u2014 and the negative press that followed, said the commando, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the secretive mission.General Nicholson has since left Afghanistan and did not respond to requests for comment. An officer who is familiar with the incident did not dispute the reasoning for the scrubbed mission.That same month, the United States dropped a 21,000-pound GBU-43/B \u2014 the so-called mother of all bombs \u2014 on an Islamic State cave complex in Nangarhar province. The former Defense Department official said that was seen as the start of a ramped-up public relations campaign under General Nicholson\u2019s command.At the American military\u2019s direction, the Afghan government released the number of Islamic State fighters who were killed in that strike.Helene Cooper contributed reporting and Annie Daniel contributed research.Advertisement"}

It may be September, but the weather is still taking cues from summer. Just the other day, the temperature in my neighborhood had already spiked to 90 by breakfast time, and I was glad I had stocked up at the farmers\u2019 market. I didn\u2019t even want to go outside.When it\u2019s that hot, I hardly feel like cooking \u2014 a rarity for me \u2014 or at least I don\u2019t feel like cooking very much. But since I had a load of cherry tomatoes and a basket of sweet peppers, it was the perfect time to make this bright, light and satisfying dish.Bell peppers and other sweet peppers \u2014 like Corno di Toro and many other varieties of every hue \u2014 arrive at the market same time as long-awaited flavorful tomatoes (also multicolored), in late summer, right now. Their pairing here seems preordained.At the market, look for the most colorful assortment of tomatoes and peppers possible. Cut the sweet peppers into small dice (the size of confetti) and the cherry tomatoes into halves (chopped larger tomatoes would work as well), then toss them with extra-virgin olive oil and red-wine vinegar, a touch of garlic and a pinch of red-pepper flakes. Once dressed, the mixture can sit around for an hour or more, which means you don\u2019t have to rush.When the spirit moves you, boil water and cook the pasta. Lately, I\u2019m fond of skinny capellini and spaghettini. They taste marvelous when twirled on a fork laden with the marinated tomato-pepper mixture, but nearly any other pasta shape would be fine.Mound the pasta in a low, wide salad bowl or pasta-serving bowl. Give it a little sprinkle of salt and final drizzle of oil. Serve it plain or with add-ons, like crumbled ricotta salata cheese. I like a handful of crunchy seasoned bread crumbs, and a lot of basil leaves, or maybe a combination of chopped parsley, mint and marjoram.Consider it a celebration of both the end-of-summer harvest and the seemingly endless sweltering days we\u2019ll be wishing for by and by.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the Democrats Rise Above?", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a lot of pressure on their coalition coming from within.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.As the Democratic electorate has bifurcated along economic and racial lines, intraparty tension is rising.The countychanged its paradigm about whom the special schools should serve: not the students with the highest abilities across the county, but rather, those students who are outliers at their neighborhood schools, with fewer than 20 peers with similar abilities.The new policies are not universally welcome. As Goldstein writes,The changes have left some parents, mostly Asian and white and living in the county\u2019s more affluent areas, anxious. They worry their children will be excluded from selective programs, or that the level of instruction at the magnet schools will fall as students are accepted from lower-performing elementary schools.At the same time, Kimberly Petrola, a teacher at Fox Chapel Elementary School in Germantown, one of the local Centers for Enriched Studies, told Goldstein:It\u2019s good for the community to see that the gifted students are not just the typical students that you think of when you think of gifted and talented. Anybody from any diverse background can be gifted.The prestigious high schools make 5,000 admissions offers to incoming ninth-graders. Yet, this year just 172 black students and 298 Latino students received offers. This happened in a city where two out of every three eighth-graders in our public schools are Latino or black.This may seem like only an educational issue, but the political ramifications are significant.Let\u2019s take a look at another divisive issue that Democrats have struggled to address.Virtually every prospective Democratic presidential candidate has singled out the broader problem of inequality as one of the most serious facing the country.All this, and we haven\u2019t even gotten to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.What would once have been an attractive solution to the problem of inequality, increasing taxes on the rich, now poses a potential problem for a Democratic Party that has made huge gains among the affluent.Who are the prime beneficiaries of surging incomes at the top? Simple answer: predominately high-income Democratic professionals in technology, finance and law who now outnumber Republicans in presidential voting in the top income brackets.Who, in turn, are the losers in an economy where the top 20 percent gains far more than those at the bottom, whose wages have hardly budged? Service workers, who are disproportionately people of color.A majority of those at the bottom, with annual household incomes under $30,000, backed Clinton over Trump, 51-43. So too did the economic winners: those making more than $100,000 a year. Voters from households making $100,000 to $199,999 annually voted 50-44 for Clinton; among those making $200,000 to $249,999, she won 56-41; at the very top, those making $250,000 or more, Clinton won by a landslide margin, 62-34.In other words, reviving the high tax rates of the past is no longer a clean shot for the Democratic Party.Income inequality and school reform both point to another core Democratic problem: the party can, and does, win elections, but it struggles when it is in power because it faces competing policy demands. Those policy demands often pose zero-sum choices for rival constituencies: what one group gains, another loses.This was apparent at the start of the administrations of both President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama.Clinton and Obama were elected alongside solid Democratic congressional majorities. The top priority for each president was universal health care, an initiative disproportionately beneficial to low-income minorities.Within two years of taking office, support for health care reform collapsed for both Obama and Clinton.The first off-year congressional elections in the two administrations, in 1994 and 2010, were Republican wave elections \u2014 spurred in part by public opposition to health care reform \u2014 that swept out Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. Those two outcomes stymied both Clinton and Obama and limited their ability to govern. They had hit the wall that often confronts Democratic policymakers: race.By 1994, however, as the benefits of the Clinton proposal to racial and ethnic minorities became more widely known, the numbers were reversed. A plurality of whites, 41 percent, said health care should be provided privately, as opposed to the 32 percent who still supported government health insurance.There was a clear precedent for the opposition Clinton and Obama encountered on health care that goes back to the mid-1960s, when the issue of civil rights (and white racism) knocked the support out from under the liberal New Deal coalition.In 1956, 1958 and 1960, before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, solid majorities of whites ranging from 54 to 56 percent agreed that jobs and a good standard of living were the responsibility of the federal government. By 1968, that figure fell to 27 percent.For the period extending roughly from 1970 to 2008, many of the nation\u2019s racial and economic conflicts pitted Democrats on the left against Republicans on the right.Since then, with the growth of an educated, culturally liberal class of Democratic voters, the partisan aspect of these conflicts has changed. In addition to a struggle between the two parties, a struggle has emerged between the two wings of the Democratic Party.Americans in the top fifth of the income distribution \u2014 broadly households with incomes above the $112,000 mark \u2014 are separating from the rest. This separation is economic, visible in bank balances and salaries. But it can also be seen in education, family structure, health and longevity, even in civic and community life.Reeves calls for sacrifice from the liberal elite, himself included, because \u201cmuch of the criticism of our class is true.\u201d\u201cRight now,\u201d he goes on to argue,there is something of a culture of entitlement among America\u2019s upper middle class. It is about time those of us in the favored fifth recognized our privileged position. Some humility and generosity is required.The problem with Reeves\u2019s argument, of course, is that many of the white and Asian parents in reliably liberal New York and Montgomery County are not prepared to compromise the education of their own children, as they see it, in support of a social goal, no matter how laudable.Nor are well-to-do Democratic homeowners from the West Coast to Westchester County willing to risk a decline in property values by opening their communities to affordable housing.The \u201cmy gain is your loss\u201d problems of the Democratic Party are further complicated by research showing that as inequality has grown, support for liberal redistribution policies has declined.The authors described the \u201cmost important message\u201d flowing from their analysis as \u201chigh and low-income groups respond in remarkably similar ways to shifts in economic inequality.\u201dI emailed Kelly to ask if he had developed additional interpretations of the findings since the article was published.Kelly emailed back thatAmong those with inegalitarian racial attitudes, higher levels of inequality are associated with somewhat less support for redistribution. That relationship is reversed for those who are racial egalitarians, with these folks more supportive of redistribution when inequality is higher. Economic inequality and racial attitudes work in tandem with each other. Where there is racism, rising inequality undermines support for redistribution.In other words, race and racism help mold the views of many Americans toward inequality and income and wealth redistribution.The authors, Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren, both economists at Harvard, and Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, of the Census Bureau, found that between 1989 and 2015Hispanic Americans are moving up significantly in the income distribution across generations because they have relatively high rates of intergenerational income mobility. In contrast, black Americans have substantially lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to large income disparities that persist across generations.Their adverse finding \u201cremains true even among children born to parents in the top 1 percent,\u201d Chetty and his collaborators write: Indeed, a black child born to parents in the top quintile is roughly as likely to fall to the bottom family income quintile as he or she is to remain in the top quintile; in contrast, white children are nearly five times as likely to remain in the top quintile as they are to fall to the bottom quintile.Despite their pessimism, Chetty and his co-authors offer a ray of hope. \u201cThe black-white gap,\u201d they write,is significantly smaller for boys who grow up in certain neighborhoods \u2014 those with low poverty rates, low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among low-income blacks. Black boys who move to such areas at younger ages have significantly better outcomes, demonstrating that racial disparities can be narrowed.To create such an environment for even a modest percentage of poor black families, the financial, cultural and social commitment of resources would be huge. Such a commitment might include a willingness to frame the argument in terms of pressing more explicitly and strenuously for a focus on this target: that \u201cwhite and black Americans are roughly equal in their economic and social resources\u201d \u2014 a goal that Chetty, Hendren, Jones and Porter argue is linked to \u201cfather presence,\u201d however unpopular such stands are in segments of the liberal community.Despite the tremendous costs and political obstacles of such a large initiative, this objective \u2014 making the economic lives of white and black Americans \u201croughly equal\u201d \u2014 should command more serious attention from Democrats if they want to restore and strengthen a liberal coalition that will have staying power over the long term.Advertisement"}

It was heartbreaking to watch \u2014 as heartbreaking, in its way, as her testimony itself. There she was, recounting before a national audience her memory of being sexually assaulted in high school by President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, an experience that she said left her traumatized, shaken; some 30 years later she found it so unignorable that she was discussing it with a therapist. (It had rendered her sufficiently claustrophobic, she noted, to make her install a second front door to her home.) Yet her instinct, at every step of the way, was to be transparent, eager, almost agonizingly conciliatory. And it started almost the moment she began to speak.\u201cI\u2019ll lean forward,\u201d she told Chuck Grassley, the committee\u2019s chairman, when she discovered she couldn\u2019t bring the microphone closer. \u201cIs this good?\u201dIt was. \u201cI will do my best to answer your questions,\u201d she continued, \u201cand would request some caffeine.\u201dI am not sure the Senate Republicans were quite prepared for how guileless Blasey was. Nor, do I suspect, was Mitchell, whose trap-laying style seemed designed for a witness everyone assumed would be far more canny or polished. (\u201cI just realized I said something inaccurate,\u201d was one of the phrases Blasey repeated over and over again, trying to help.) She was so without guile that she seemed to regard Mitchell as an ally, a means to tell her story, not even registering the prosecutor\u2019s insinuation that her fear of flying was less than real. (\u201cCorrect, unfortunately,\u201d she said, confirming that many of her hobbies and family obligations required taking airplanes.)When Grassley asked her, after over an hour of proceedings, if it was true she wanted a break, Blasey looked uncertain. \u201cI \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2019m used to being collegial, so ...\u201d she answered.And that\u2019s just the point. This reflex \u2014 to get along, to be the A student, to accommodate and ingratiate \u2014 is one with which many, if not most women, can relate. There was an unbearable poignancy to Blasey\u2019s nervousness, an implicit apology in her performance, one that combined a deep wish to be taken seriously with a sincere desire to get things right. What seemed anathema to her was failing \u2014 getting the facts wrong, wasting everyone\u2019s time.She went out of her way to make the distinction between being mocked and being used. To her, this mattered.Blasey has said that what haunts her most from the night of her encounter with Brett Kavanaugh is him clamping his hand over her mouth, stifling her attempt to scream for help. But 30-odd years later, Blasey answered with a literal metaphor of her own. She may have been ingratiating, yes. But she also leaned in. She bent her head toward the microphone and told her story.Advertisement"}

Does Anyone Care?", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDrained by farmers and divided by treaty, America\u2019s second-longest river is running dry.Mr. Parker is the author of \u201cLone Star Nation: How Texas Will Transform America.\u201dEL PASO \u2014 One of North America\u2019s great rivers is dying.Stretching nearly 1,900 miles from the Colorado Rockies to the salty Gulf of Mexico, the Rio Grande has been the stuff of Southwestern lore, sustained entire cultures and nourished wildlife in an otherwise unforgiving part of the planet.Downstream, wrote the historian Paul Horgan in his book on the Rio Grande, \u201cGreat River,\u201d published in 1954, \u201cThe river at Presidio came among willows, cottonwood, lilacs, mountains with attendant clouds, emerald green fields and pink sand, through a sweetness in the air made from all these together.\u201d Some Native Americans called the river P\u2019soque, or big river. The Spanish named the lower stretch Rio Palmas, for its thickets of palms.As the centuries marched on, so did the Rio Grande\u2019s names and uses. The Spanish farmed corn, chick peas and sweet onions while watching bald eagles snag five-pound fish from the water. After independence, Mexico named it the R\u00edo Bravo, or fierce river. American settlers in the Southwest called it the Rio Grande, and operated paddle wheelers on its southern stretches.But with the turn of the last century came hydroengineering across the arid American West. Colorado, New Mexico and Texas divvied up the water with a compact in 1938; the United States and Mexico followed, in a 1944 treaty. Life-giving water was reduced to mere debits and credits in an accounting ledger. Ever since, the river has been tamed, dammed, channeled and diverted into aqueducts, canals and ditches. The American humorist Will Rogers liked to call the Rio Grande \u201cthe only river I know of that is in need of irrigating.\u201d I grew up on this river; to this day, my mother\u2019s neighbors still open a rusty metal gate to flood their yards with muddy irrigation water. And presto: Lawns, orchards and alfalfa bloom in the sandy, alluvial soil.This year\u2019s near disappearance took people by surprise. By late spring, snowmelt water was so sparse that around Albuquerque, where it runs near dry, sandy beds revealed where fish had clustered, awaiting their deaths. Hikers were horrified. \u201cIt was just sad,\u201d said John Fleck, who directs the water program at the University of New Mexico. \u201cIt was just so sad.\u201dTo the north, the tiny silvery minnow, an endangered species that nourishes larger fish, is on the verge of disappearing even in the imported water, with just 5 percent of its historic population. For nearly 200 miles, from Fort Quitman, Tex., to the Rio Grande\u2019s confluence with the Conchos, the tributary that is the sole source of water for the southern portion of the river, the river is largely dry and devoid of aquatic life. The history of the Southwest is replete with tragic river stories. The Gila River, for one, rises as a New Mexico trout stream but disappears from its historic course into the concrete canals of Phoenix. But the Colorado River \u2014 once so overused that it no longer reached the Sea of Cortez \u2014 now, thanks to decades of conservation and smart water policies, pushes through a forest of reeds to the sea again.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described an aspect of the Yukon River. It originates in Canada; it does not run wholly in the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Is Brett Kavanaugh?", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byContrary to what supporters say, he\u2019s no originalist. Ms. Bazelon is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine. Mr. Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.In theory, originalism gives judges a method for transcending politics by interpreting the Constitution based on its meaning when it was ratified in 1788 or later amended. Since the 1970s, originalism has been both an animating principle and a marketing success for conservative jurisprudence. Fairly or not, conservatives have used it as a cudgel against liberal judges, attacking them for inventing new rights to protect minorities, political dissenters and criminal suspects. Its selling point has been its claim to neutrality. But Judge Kavanaugh hasn\u2019t earned his originalist badge. It\u2019s being fixed to him to mask the fact that as an appeals court judge, he relentlessly pressed forward a Republican agenda favoring business and religious interests.To a pure originalist, this is an incoherent mixing of methodologies. Any ruling that departs from the original meaning should be thrown out. Judge Kavanaugh has called for no such thing. Instead, he has proudly said that he\u2019s a textualist, which means that he gives primacy to the ordinary meanings of the words of a statute, or the Constitution itself. Textualists steer away from other sources of meaning, like legislative history. Conservatives have often touted textualism for its neutral deference to the legislature. Three of the court\u2019s conservative members \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 lay claim to textualism as a guiding principle. But textualism doesn\u2019t serve as an overarching theory for conservative jurisprudence. Textualist interpretation can produce liberal as well as conservative interpretations of statutes. And because ambiguous phrasing in laws leaves judges with choices to make, it doesn\u2019t put much of a restraint on judges. As Judge Kavanaugh has said, quoting the liberal-moderate Justice Elena Kagan, \u201cWe are all textualists now.\u201d This means that textualism offers neither a clear dividing line from liberals nor the historical gravitas of originalism.If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be only one dyed-in-the-wool originalist left among the justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas \u2014 who is also, at 70, the oldest member of the court\u2019s conservative wing. The court\u2019s other leading originalist, Antonin Scalia, died in 2016. This shift away from originalism is a window into the conservative movement\u2019s priorities as it prepares to lock in a five-member Supreme Court majority. Originalism is no longer the powerful tool it once was for advancing a conservative jurisprudence. Nor is there founding-era evidence for some of the new anti-regulatory doctrines the court has begun to accept. In the past few decades, conservatives put considerable energy into attacking the administrative state. The most radical idea is that regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency lack the authority to issue regulations; a more modest version is that they can do so only if Congress is crystal clear about it. In his opinions and other writings, Judge Kavanaugh has pushed this theme as well.With five reliable members, the court\u2019s conservative wing will be in a position to accomplish much, and for the most part it will be easier to achieve its goals without originalism. Expect a reappearance, however, when it comes time to reconsider the constitutional right to abortion access established in Roe v. Wade. With that important exception, originalism has largely served its purpose and can be cast away. An earlier version of this article misspelled the given name of a Supreme Court justice.

{"Headline": "The Art of Winemaking on the Cheap", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "The PourYoung producers with little money and no vineyards face obstacles in building their businesses, but with maximum effort it can be done.Supported byNAPA, Calif. \u2014 How do you make a small fortune in the wine business? Start out with a big one.Yes, it\u2019s an old joke, but that does not diminish its essential truth. To live the mythical good life as a wine producer is excruciatingly difficult, unless you start out with a lot of money, inherited vineyards or both. Particularly in California. Especially in Napa Valley. He is based here in the city of Napa, but few of his wines are entitled to the Napa Valley appellation. Until recently, Mr. Lockwood never made a Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon, the wine for which Napa is most famous. He could not afford to buy the grapes, which he said sold last year for an average of $7,500 a ton.Instead, he patrols the fringes, buying chardonnay grown in the Heron Lake Vineyard, just over the border from Napa County in Solano County \u2014 the wrong side of the tracks. Consequently, the grapes are much less expensive than Napa fruit, and their appellation, Wild Horse Valley, has none of the built-in selling power that comes with being able to put Napa Valley on the label. Nonetheless, Heron Lake, on a stony hillside of shallow volcanic soil, produces excellent fruit that dovetails with Mr. Lockwood\u2019s taste for fresh, intense, textured wines that are expressive at low levels of alcohol, generally under 14 percent and frequently under 13 percent. His 2014 Heron Lake chardonnay is pure and deep, with rich herbal and mineral flavors. A 2016 Heron Lake pinot noir is pale and alive in the glass, full of gorgeous stony flavors and a sort of restlessness that will require a couple of years to calm down. In 2017, Mr. Lockwood also made a pinot noir ros\u00e9 from the vineyard, which was wonderful but did not conform to any of the popular notions of ros\u00e9. In color, it was more of a light maraschino than a pale salmon. On the palate, it expressed itself more through texture and subtle rocky flavors than fruit.Aside from Heron Lake, Mr. Lockwood also buys chardonnay from Calaveras County, tempranillo from Amador County, cabernet sauvignon from Fort Ross-Seaview on the Sonoma Coast (an area widely thought to be too chilly for cabernet) and small amounts of syrah and chardonnay from the Haynes Vineyard in Coombsville, in the southeastern corner of Napa Valley. Casting such a wide net for grapes is not unusual for a producer in Mr. Lockwood\u2019s position.\u201cIt\u2019s challenging in California, but also sort of the norm among my peers,\u201d he said, as we sampled a few wines in the dining room of his house in the suburban Alta Heights section of Napa, which also doubles as his tasting room. As we drank, Amy Lockwood, his wife, showed him a mock-up of a possible wine label she was designing before darting off to pick up London, their 5-year-old daughter.The 2015 Haynes syrah is wonderfully savory \u2014 both salty and peppery, tasting of olives and smoked meats \u2014 yet graceful rather than fierce. In his last vintage while at Failla, Mr. Lockwood produced 400 cases. This year, he expects to have 2,400 cases, which may be the limit of what Enfield can do under its current configuration. \u201cI have to decide whether I want to stay small and keep it a one-man show or grow it into a proper business and hire an employee or two,\u201d Mr. Lockwood said. He is conscious, however, that the more he grows, the more administrative work may intrude on what he loves to do: work in the vineyards and the cellar. \u201cI enjoy the physical work,\u201d he said. \u201cI got into the work because I didn\u2019t want a desk job.\u201d Complicating his decision is the fact that this year Mr. Lockwood took charge of farming the 10-acre Heron Lake vineyard. The owners were otherwise planning to sell it, and taking responsibility for the vineyard was the only way to ensure a supply of fruit. He has also taken charge of a one-acre, dry-farmed, organic cabernet sauvignon vineyard on Hennessey Ridge in the Vaca Mountains on the east side of Napa Valley, and finally has had the chance to make Napa cabernet.\u201cThe whole point is to learn,\u201d he said. The two cabernets he makes are similar in spirit yet entirely different. The 2015 Sonoma Coast cabernet, from the Waterhorse Ridge Vineyard, just seven miles from the Pacific, is lean and refreshing, with aromas of flowers and herbs. It\u2019s a tribute to the freshness of classic Bordeaux, with none of the lush flavors associated with California cabernet. It will be released in September.I tasted a barrel sample of the 2017 Hennessey Ridge cabernet. It was just 12.2 percent alcohol, but had none of the herbal flavors of its Sonoma Coast sibling. That wine was similarly energetic, but the flavors were red fruit and flowers, a Napa cabernet with finesse.Simultaneously, he was developing an interest in woodworking. After college, he moved to Taos, N.M., to work in a furniture shop. A co-worker was constructing his own mandolin and, Mr. Lockwood said, he became obsessed with building instruments.But one day a winemaker, David Mahaffey, came in the shop. He was an amateur woodworker who was building himself a guitar and wanted to trade wine for woodworking tips.From there, Mr. Lockwood was hooked. He left guitar-making after three-and-a-half years, worked the harvest at Littorai in 2007, spent a year in Argentina, then joined Failla in 2008.While Mr. Lockwood is gratified at the reception the Enfield wines have received, he fears he will never have the opportunity to own a vineyard himself, and wonders about his future.\u201cHonestly, I spend so much time trying to make this thing a business that I don\u2019t have a lot of time to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the wine industry: we\u2019re all kind of maxed out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m writing this as an open letter to a handful of readers, distressed by the general state of our politics and disgusted by what they see on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, who have the financial means to influence the outcome of elections in November and the course of the country in 2020.My pitch is simple: The next time you meet a candidate asking for your money, start the conversation with two questions. First: \u201cWhen did you last change your mind on a significant political, economic or social issue, and why?\u201d Second (if the candidate is already in politics): \u201cWhen did you vote with the other side?\u201dYou already know that the ability to change one\u2019s mind is a crucial mark of intelligence and maturity, whether in business or politics. You also know that at least some amount of partisan and ideological heterodoxy is good for the soul \u2014 and essential for democracy. Otherwise, what were the tributes to John McCain all about?Why is that? In person, many of you are nuanced, balanced and sane in your overall political outlook, irrespective of whether you lean left or right. The problem is that you tend to care mainly about specific policy outcomes \u2014 killing the Iran deal, say, or acting on climate \u2014 and you\u2019re willing to swallow your misgivings about the other stuff, like Donald Trump\u2019s character or the Democrats\u2019 Sandernista tendencies.Sacrificed in the bargain is much concern about the tone of campaigns, the rules of politics, the process of policymaking, and ordinary considerations of collegiality and respect.Let me ask you to think hard about the increasing cost of that bargain. A president who rages like King Lear on the heath because an op-ed in The Times was mean to him. Senate Democrats who cheerfully turn a Supreme Court confirmation hearing into a carnival show while they audition for the Democratic nomination. The collapse of regular order. The vanishing filibuster. The constant threat of government shutdowns. The ceaseless campaign that always comes at the expense of governance. The administrative state on which we increasingly rely to run things because elected officials can\u2019t. The rush to the exits by the more honorable public servants.This is the politics of maximum polarization and total paralysis, waged with the intensity of the Battle of the Somme and yielding about as much ground. Right now, you\u2019re contributing to this. Stop.There\u2019s an alternative. Split more of your money between the parties. Fund candidates with proven or potential cross-party appeal. Help out politicians with scores below 100 percent from the N.R.A. or the Sierra Club. Set up a PAC \u2014 call it SanePAC or NotNutsPAC \u2014 to help candidates facing primary challenges from the further-right or further-left. Expand the reach of purple America at the expense of deep red or deep blue.There are political leaders who fit that description today: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan in blue-state Maryland; Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in purple-state Colorado and Republican Gov. John Kasich in purple-state Ohio; Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen in red-state Tennessee. Plenty of other names. You could contribute by securing their base and amplifying their national profile.For many of you, professional and personal success has not meant getting everything you want. It\u2019s about knowing the difference between what\u2019s essential and what you can live without. What\u2019s essential today is a healthier political culture, not a temporary policy win.

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren on Big Banks and the Democratic Party: 5 Takeaways", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts positioned herself as an alternative to the standard-bearers of the Democratic Party, refusing to classify herself within the party during an hourlong interview on Thursday.And while she brushed off a question asking if she was running in 2020, she offered a glimpse into what such a platform could hold.Here are the takeaways.As speculation mounts over whether Ms. Warren will enter the presidential race in 2020, she was asked where she sees herself within her own party.She argued that her economic views \u2014 like raising the minimum wage, expanding Social Security and regulating big banks \u2014 are ones that most Americans share. She places herself \u201cright in the middle of America,\u201d she said.\u201cHow I see this is, this is a lot less about political parties and a lot more about where America is,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThere are issues on which we are divided. I understand that. But on these core economic set of issues, America is a progressive country.\u201dIs it unfair to argue that she has shifted her views compared with where she had initially established herself within the larger party?\u201cThis is who I\u2019ve been all along,\u201d Ms. Warren said.Ms. Warren was withering in her criticism of Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s former chief economic adviser.\u201cWhat he did was help Goldman Sachs,\u201d she said, adding that the tax overhaul that he helped push through last year saved corporations billions of dollars.What angered Ms. Warren the most, she said, was imagining the response of the American people.\u201cIs he working for us,\u201d she imagined someone thinking, \u201cOr is he working for Goldman, or is he just working for himself?\u201dMs. Warren said that she had spoken to the Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer \u2014 who is said to be considering a presidential bid in 2020 \u2014 and told him she did not support his efforts to impeach the president. Instead, she is intent on protecting the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.The investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s election interference \u201chas resulted in more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas already,\u201d she said.\u201cI want protection for the special prosecutor,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time Donald Trump starts tweeting again or attacks someone else in government, I get very worried about the special prosecutor.\u201dWhat Congress could do, Ms. Warren said, is pass a law that says the special counsel cannot be fired by the president.\u201cOnce the investigation is completed,\u201d she said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll know what we have in front of us.\u201dAs tech giants like Facebook and Apple come under continued scrutiny by Congress, Ms. Warren weighed in on the subject, stating that the issue was more about their anti-competitive business models and less about \u201cbreaking up\u201d big companies.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick one business or the other,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting a huge competitive advantage from being a platform provider because of all this information you\u2019ve been scraping, then we no longer have competition going on.\u201dMs. Warren, who has been the target of the president\u2019s name-calling on Twitter, offered a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s taunts.\u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t going to change. But he\u2019s not going to change me, either,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the fights I\u2019m in and I\u2019m going to stay in them. But I stay in them not because of him, I stay in them because of the people and the urgency I feel in this moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Chances are that a household now has a mixture of bulb types \u2014 incandescent, compact fluorescent (CFL) and light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs \u2014 and each has a different start-up process.The speed they switch on depends on the type of bulb and the intervening mechanisms like transformers, ballasts and drivers that may be present.With an old-fashioned incandescent bulb, the current goes at full strength directly to the tungsten filament, which very quickly heats up to the temperature that produces visible light.In a compact fluorescent bulb, actually a tube twisted into the shape of a bulb, a burst of current is needed make the initial electrical collection. Then the gas within the tube is heated to a temperature high enough to fluoresce and emit light. In old-fashioned fluorescent lights, a separate device called a ballast provides the surge, then damps down the current to a steady voltage that will not quickly burn out the light. With LED bulbs, many have built-in mechanisms called drivers to gradually transform the current to the voltage needed to light up the bulb, as well as a resistor to keep it at a constant level thereafter. There is a significant delay while the driver does its initial work. The time lapse may increase if the bulb is connected to a dimmer switch, which only some LED bulbs are equipped to work with.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Viral Videos Are Replacing Pricey Political Ads. They\u2019re Cheaper, and They Work.", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are not the stories that candidates usually turn to the camera and open up about in ads.One talked about her father\u2019s violent temper and how she once watched him throw her mother through a plate glass door. Another recalled watching his brothers struggle to find steady work because of their criminal records. A third spoke of suffering a decade of sexual abuse as a child.The wave of female, minority and outsider candidates that is breaking cultural barriers and toppling incumbents in the Democratic Party is also sweeping aside a longstanding norm in campaigns: That the public image of politicians \u2014 especially women \u2014 should be upbeat, uncontroversial and utterly conventional.For many of these Democrats who were running against better-financed rivals, the breakthrough moment came after they got personal in relatively low-cost videos that went viral, reaching millions of people. Using documentary-style storytelling, which can last for several minutes, candidates have found a successful alternative to the traditional model of raising huge sums of money that get spent on expensive, 30-second television commercials.The videos are chiefly intended as ads, but they also served a fund-raising purpose. For a fraction of the cost, these videos can help to spread a candidate\u2019s story in a way that is easily shareable and can inspire donations.In the housing project where she was raised, says Ms. Hayes, who was named National Teacher of the Year in 2016, \u201cpeople are strong, but they aren\u2019t supposed to run for Congress.\u201d\u201cIf Congress starts to look like us, no one can stop us,\u201d she says.Republican candidates this year have been using their own personal, sometimes primal, approach \u2014 though with far different messages and audiences in mind. They have largely stuck to the 30-second commercial format rather than the narrative videos, however.If the Republicans are appealing overtly to Trump supporters and conservatives, many Democrats are trying to telegraph a sense of shared struggle and life experience, while making the explicit assertion that a government cannot adequately represent the people it is supposed to serve unless its servants look like and live among the people.\u201cI have stayed, on purpose, in close proximity to the hurt, acutely uncomfortable so that I\u2019ll never grow complacent in tackling these inequities,\u201d she says.\u201cWe knew we would be outraised and outspent, without a doubt,\u201d said Sarah Groh, Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cSo when it was a question of how do we deploy our resources we looked at where our voters were consuming their information. Social media is a big part of that. And I know we definitely got a bump with each of those videos.\u201d\u201cI remember making the promise to myself that I wasn\u2019t going to make my mom cry like that,\u201d Mr. Gillum says. \u201cShe was going to cry because she was happy.\u201dStrategists say that messages of empowerment are especially potent today because many voters on the left are eager to see more women, minorities, young people and outsiders in government positions.\u201cPeople are broadening their definitions of what political leaders can look like,\u201d said Teddy Goff, a co-founder of the agency Precision Strategies, a Democratic consulting firm, and President Barack Obama\u2019s former digital director. \u201cA political leader,\u201d he added, \u201ccan be a 17-year-old from Parkland, Fla., or a 28-year-old who was a bartender until last year.\u201dThe candidates who have upset the Democratic field this year come with a diversity of life experience that includes losing children to gun violence, undergoing gender reassignment surgery and escaping war-torn nations.The use of viral videos by first-time candidates to challenge assumptions around who should run for office was used early on by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old New Yorker who upset a powerful incumbent congressman in a Democratic primary this summer. It was one of the first races in this election season to signal the disconnect many liberals feel from their leaders.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s video came out of a three-person firm called Means of Production in Detroit. Its producers were galvanized by frustration at Democrats after the 2016 election and wanted to shift their know-how in advertising and public relations into creating \u201cpropaganda for the working class,\u201d said Nick Hayes, 21, one of the firm\u2019s founders. Mr. Hayes was producing ads for carmakers and foam cup sellers before he met Naomi Burton, 29, at their local Democratic Socialists of America meeting. They founded the company together.It was expensive to produce at $50,000, but ended up being a fantastic gamble. It helped her campaign raise $1 million as viewers were drawn to her heroism and a compelling depiction of someone \u201cwho bumped up against the system and changed it for the better,\u201d said Cayce McCabe, a senior vice president at Putnam Partners.People also took notice because Ms. Hegar did not look anything like the pearl-wearing politicians that play to part. In the opening shot of her and her family sitting down for a meal, the viewer sees a tattoo peeking out from under the sleeve on her right arm.\u201cA lot of Democrats, for years, have been supporting and voting for candidates who didn\u2019t always say exactly what they believed, didn\u2019t always show their authentic, true selves,\u201d said Mr. Goff, the Democratic consultant.\u201cTo look around, not just at Trump, but at who\u2019s been winning elections,\u201d he said, \u201ca lot of us have started to think: Why don\u2019t we say what we mean?\u201dAn earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a comment made by Jahana Hayes, a House candidate from Connecticut.

But on Wednesday, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, revealed a number that was almost as startling. She told the Senate Intelligence Committee that from October to last March, Facebook deleted 1.3 billion fake accounts. In other words, an alarming portion of those more than two billion users \u2014 more than the company had publicly acknowledged \u2014 were fake.That number should prompt tough questions from Facebook users and advertisers. How many fake accounts were there before Facebook instituted this aggressive defense in 2017? What sort of sites are these \u2014 political propaganda or attempted advertising fraud? What countries do these accounts come from? How can anyone \u2014 advertisers, investors or Facebook users concerned about its role in our culture and democracy \u2014 trust the integrity of the Facebook experience?Facebook\u2019s latest \u201ctransparency report\u201d states that fake pages account for only 3 percent to 4 percent of monthly active users at any given time. How can 1.3 billion accounts account for only 3 percent to 4 percent of 2.2 billion users? The answer is that such pages are going up faster than Facebook can swat them down. Ms. Sandberg wants us to see this as success. A number so large must mean Facebook is doing something right. Facebook\u2019s machines are determining patterns of origin and content among these pages and quickly quashing them. Still, we judge exterminators not by the number of roaches they kill, but by the number that survive. If 3 percent of 2.2 billion active users are fake at any time, that\u2019s still 66 million sources of potentially false or dangerous information. One thing is clear about this arms race: It is an absurd battle of machine against machine. One set of machines create the fake accounts. Another deletes them. This happens millions of times every month. No group of human beings has the time to create millions, let alone billions, of accounts on Facebook by hand. People have been running computer scripts to automate the registration process. That means Facebook\u2019s machines detect the fakes rather easily. (Facebook says that fewer than 1.5 percent of the fakes were identified by users.)Ms. Sandberg did not tell the committee in open session how those fake accounts are geographically distributed or what purpose they serve, assuming that Facebook has that information. She included the number in a section of her comments called \u201ccombating foreign election interference and advancing election integrity,\u201d but beyond that, she offered no evidence that these fake accounts had anything to do with elections. Ms. Sandberg sets a high standard for her company. \u201cOur adversaries are determined, creative, and well-funded,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cBut we are even more determined \u2014 and we will continue to fight back.\u201d It would be better if she had been more modest. She should lower expectations and declare that there is nothing Facebook can do to exterminate all the pests. With 2.2 billion profiles in more than 100 languages, even a small error rate can wreak havoc. With algorithms amplifying content that generates passionate responses, the crazy conspiratorial stuff will always rocket around Facebook faster and farther than the thoughtful condolence or the cute pictures of golden retrievers. And with that powerful advertising system, Facebook will always be the platform of choice for dishonest or hateful parties. Facebook has put impressive effort into reforming itself around the margins. But considering the harm that Facebook has caused \u2014 sharing user data with unauthorized third parties, spreading propaganda that sets off ethnic violence, hosting attacks on elections around the world \u2014 exterminating most of the pests is not good enough. Stopping all of them is impossible. Facebook is too big to govern and too big to fix. We might just have to accept that.

That\u2019s until they abruptly shrink back into the holes they\u2019ve burrowed in the sand. The eels seem to be unique among fish. They are capable of swimming free, which they do to change burrows. But mostly, they live sessile lives, anchored in their narrow burrows even when they emerge to feed, like tethered snakes striking at zooplankton too small to see. In the Red Sea, they live in colonies of hundreds or even thousands, from shallow waters of 13 feet or so, to depths of 180 feet. When they rise from the sand en masse, their appearance can seem like something from a science fiction movie. But what has recently captured the interest of scientists is what they do once much of their body is waving in the current.The remote cameras were necessary because, Ms. Khrizman said, \u201cThe eels are very shy.\u201dFree swimming fish that stay at a specific site to feed don\u2019t do well in stronger currents because if they turn sideways the current will push them. So in working to stay in one spot, they use energy and miss out on feeding opportunities.The shape makes the drag four times less than it would be if they didn\u2019t reshape their bodies.

{"Headline": "Nike Returns to Familiar Strategy With Kaepernick Ad Campaign", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNike has long relied on controversy in marketing an image of edgy youthfulness. The company had Charles Barkley declare that he was not a role model and Tiger Woods remind people that some country clubs would turn him away because of his skin color. It dressed the tennis player Andre Agassi in jean shorts.In an era rife with divisive political discourse, most major public companies try to avoid taking stances that could make customers angry, particularly when rabid social media campaigns can cast any decision into a larger social statement. Yet Nike has signed Mr. Kaepernick, perhaps the most divisive American athlete of his generation, to a lucrative new contract and will produce branded apparel with his name and image.In 2016, Mr. Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism, police brutality and social injustice, and a handful of other players followed suit, kneeling, locking arms or raising their fists during \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d President Trump turned it into a political fight through a series of critical tweets and public statements about how the protesting players should be fired.Nike\u2019s strategy risks alienating countless consumers who believe the national anthem protests that Mr. Kaepernick began are disrespectful. Shares of Nike on Tuesday were down $2.60, or more than 3 percent, though it is unclear how much of that could be blamed on Mr. Kaepernick or other market forces.However, it could pay off among Nike\u2019s base of young customers and fans, according to analysts, and signals that political stances could be seen as winning issues by some brands. Nearly two-thirds of individuals who wear Nike in the United States are under 35 years old, and are much more racially diverse than the baby boomer population, said Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the NPD Group.\u201cI think Nike went into this absolutely knowing what they were doing, with the intention that some people would be offended,\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cBut the people buying their products, whether they are a millennial or a Gen Z consumer, those consumers want their brands to take visible, social positions, and this is an opportunity for Nike to do just that,\u201d he added.Still, the timing of the partnership with Mr. Kaepernick caught many industry veterans, as well as the N.F.L., off guard. For more than a year, Nike has virtually ignored Mr. Kaepernick and declined to use him in any of its marketing campaigns, even though he has been under contract to the Oregon-based company since 2011.The new partnership comes months after Nike extended its agreement with the N.F.L. to provide on-field uniforms for all 32 of the league\u2019s teams. On Monday, when asked if Nike had informed the N.F.L. about the campaign beforehand, a Nike spokeswoman said that \u201cColin is not currently employed by an N.F.L. team and has no contractual obligation to the N.F.L.\u201dThe N.F.L. did not address the campaign Monday, then released a statement Tuesday in which it said, \u201cThe social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action.\u201dPresident Trump was quiet on Twitter, but The Daily Caller published an interview with Mr. Trump late Tuesday in which he said Nike sent a \u201cterrible message\u201d in making Mr. Kaepernick one of the faces its campaign, and noted that the company was a tenant of his and paid \u201ca lot of rent,\u201d referring to its Niketown store on East 57th Street in New York. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized players, team owners and the N.F.L. for not forcing players to stand for the national anthem, framing the players\u2019 acts of protest against racism and police brutality as unpatriotic and disrespectful.The N.F.L. has struggled to manage the criticism. It enacted a new rule requiring players to stand during the national anthem or to remain in the locker room, then put the rule on hold after several owners said they would not penalize players and the N.F.L. Players Association vowed to challenge it.Nike, though, has a history of pushing headfirst into of-the-moment debates, whether through a sleek, socially pointed advertisement, or with the provocative clothing and shoes its superstar athletes wear.\u201cNike from Day 1 has really been a brand that has stood up to and stood for things that were important to them and important to their athletes, so I think there\u2019s a little precedence there,\u201d said Mary Scott, a president at UEG, a sports, entertainment and lifestyle marketing agency.Last year, as a part of Black History Month, Nike released a campaign titled \u201cEquality\u201d that featured LeBron James, Serena Williams, Kevin Durant and others. When French Open officials announced this summer that Ms. Williams\u2019s black catsuit would no longer be permitted attire on the tournament\u2019s courts, Nike tweeted in response, \u201cYou can take the superhero out of her costume, but you can never take away her superpowers.\u201dIn the end, there might be two simple explanations for Nike\u2019s move: money and attention. Mr. Kaepernick\u2019s jersey was among top 50 in sales during the second quarter of 2017, even though he was not on an N.F.L. roster.\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time we talked about a Nike campaign?\u201d Ms. Scott said. \u201cThey have so many that are so great. But there seems to be a pointed effort around this that we might not have seen in a while, especially around really hot-button topics that now the world, not just the sports world, are really grappling with.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Long Year of #MeToo on Capitol Hill", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat it feels like to have to prep your boss for the Kavanaugh hearings.Ms. Peterson is a reporter in Washington. On Wednesday, a small group of senior Democratic Senate aides met to discuss strategy as hearings into the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh devolved into politicized chaos over decades-old sexual assault allegations. Partway through the meeting, someone asked whether Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor in California who has accused Mr. Kavanaugh of attempted rape at a high school party, was planning to testify. According to two sources who were present, an aide began describing the retaliatory threats Dr. Blasey has experienced since coming out publicly. \u201cShe\u2019s a real person,\u201d the aide said. Then she started weeping \u2014 and other women in the room choked up as well, in a long moment of charged silence.Despite what the country thinks of Congress, Senate staff members are also real people. (I know, I\u2019m married to someone who used to be one; none of his direct co-workers are quoted in this story.) They walk marble halls conferring with senators, their bosses. They try to make sure that if someone does have to ask a woman under oath about the defining trauma of her life, it is at least done with some sensitivity. That hearing everyone spent the week fighting over? They\u2019ll have to fill the water glasses and print out the name cards. And female Senate aides must also process a nation\u2019s sexual trauma after a year spent making sense of their own.Last week, I spoke with a number of female midlevel and senior Senate staff members on both sides of the aisle. Nearly all described the Kavanaugh hearings as uniquely wrenching.The past year has brought some validation to female Senate aides. \u201cWe never thought there would be any kind of accountability, so to see it happening feels like you can finally exhale,\u201d Ms. Keefe said, speaking about the general #MeToo movement. But the scrambling over Judge Kavanaugh has reawakened old traumas while creating some new ones.It\u2019s not just the daily stress of filtering, as one aide described them to me, the \u201chorrible\u201d calls to Senate offices, including threats of rape against the young women answering the phones. For Democratic women, there\u2019s also a simmering outrage over Republican treatment of Dr. Blasey. Republican staff members, meanwhile, reported feeling angry that Democrats have co-opted the #MeToo movement to advance what they believe is a politicized agenda with little to do with actual victims. \u201cThe whole thing is a little frustrating for me,\u201d said a senior aide to a Republican Judiciary Committee member, describing her sense of being torn between an instinct to believe women and also a conviction that the politics of #MeToo are being used as a weapon.Although female aides have historically banded together in mutual support, putting gender above politics, several women told me that camaraderie is currently strained to nonexistent. Democratic women also described a new disgust with Republican male colleagues and a renewed urgency to bring more women into leadership roles. Britt Peterson is a contributing editor at Washingtonian magazine.An earlier version of this story incorrectly described Maura Keefe\u2019s employment history. She has worked on Capitol Hill since the 1990s, not in the Senate.An earlier version of this article misstated Christine Blasey Ford's profession. She is a professor of psychology, not sociology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What China Can Teach the U.S. About Artificial Intelligence ", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVisionary research is no longer the most important element of progress.Mr. Lee is a venture capitalist and former artificial intelligence researcher.Every technology goes through an age of discovery and an age of implementation. During the age of discovery, the critical work takes place in research laboratories, where scientists make the breakthroughs that move the field forward. During the age of implementation, the technology reaches a point of practical utility and begins spilling out of the lab and into the world.Over the past decade, I\u2019ve watched firsthand as the field of artificial intelligence has transitioned from one phase to the other. The 1980s and 1990s were a period of discovery in A.I., one that I participated in through my research on speech recognition at Carnegie Mellon University and Apple. More recently, I participated in the implementation phase through my work as the head of Google China and as an early investor in the Chinese mobile internet.This movement from discovery to implementation marks a significant shift in A.I.\u2019s center of gravity \u2014 away from the United States and toward China. The age of discovery relied heavily on innovation coming out of the United States, which excels at visionary research and moonshot projects. The country\u2019s freewheeling intellectual environment, unparalleled network of research universities and traditional openness to immigrants (such as myself) have for decades made it an incubator for big ideas in A.I.A.I. implementation, however, plays to a different set of strengths, many of which are manifested in China: abundant data, a hypercompetitive business landscape and a government that actively adapts public infrastructure with A.I. in mind. China also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products. This process, which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge, has driven the market capitalization of many Chinese tech companies far beyond that of the American peers they were once accused of \u201ccopying.\u201dVisionary research will always be important to A.I., which means that China still has much to learn from the United States. But as practical implementation increasingly becomes the name of the game, the United States now has much to learn from China, too.What emerges from these enormous data flows is a multidimensional picture of each Chinese user, which allows A.I. companies to better tailor their services. Silicon Valley companies are working on similar products, but the data at their disposal is largely limited to online activities: Google searches, YouTube views, Amazon purchases and Facebook likes.With regard to its competitive business ecosystem for A.I., China\u2019s advantage is frequently mischaracterized by Western analysts who view Chinese technology as built largely on intellectual property theft. This misunderstanding reflects a difference in cultural attitudes over a perfectly legal form of copying: imitating a successful business model and then tweaking it.In Silicon Valley, there is substantial stigma attached to imitating the business models or features of other companies. Doing so violates the \u201cthink different\u201d ethos associated with innovators like Steve Jobs. The result is that pioneers often go unchallenged for long periods, allowed to dominate the industry even though they don\u2019t explore or exploit all of their technology\u2019s possibilities.In contrast, Chinese entrepreneurs have few qualms about imitating what works. Once a concept is proved to have traction, dozens or even hundreds of other companies rush into the industry, setting off a ferocious fight for survival. The result is analogous to natural selection in evolution: All the companies start from the same branch on the family tree, but they make mutations in their product or business model to gain an edge. The companies with tweaked products that work well survive and grow, while businesses that are slow to adapt perish.You can see this clearly in how the sharing economy developed in China. After companies like Uber and DiDi proved the viability of ride sharing, China\u2019s start-up world tried out every possible iteration of it: shared basketballs, shared umbrellas, shared bicycles, shared mobile phone chargers. Most of these efforts died quickly, but those that survived \u2014 including a handful of the strongest shared-bike start-ups \u2014 turned into multibillion-dollar companies and revolutionized urban transport in just a couple of years.Finally, there is the question of the Chinese government\u2019s support of A.I. In the simplistic story often told in the United States, Chinese bureaucrats in the central government pick winners among the companies, load them up with enormous subsidies and then protect them from foreign competition. But this account fundamentally misunderstands how the Chinese government is encouraging A.I. implementation.The Chinese government understands that as A.I. moves from affecting the purely digital world to the physical one, public infrastructure and institutions will have to change. If we want autonomous cars to reduce accidents, we may need to embed sensors in our roads. If we want A.I.-powered diagnosis to spot cancer earlier, we may need hospital administrators to develop data-sharing agreements that protect privacy while also allowing research to be conducted. These are decisions that entail a degree of risk for public actors, particularly in a highly combative political environment where every misstep becomes fodder for the opposition.In declaring A.I. to be a top national priority, Beijing has sent a signal to local officials that they will be rewarded for fostering this kind of A.I. infrastructure. The Chinese model isn\u2019t based on top-down orders or limitless subsidies; it\u2019s based on encouraging local officials to make the changes needed in their area so that private A.I. companies can develop products that can actually be used.Am I arguing that China now has the recipe for A.I. success? Not at all. The fact that the field is shifting from discovery to implementation does not mean that discovery no longer matters. Indeed, with many problems in A.I., it is unclear which approach is best.Consider an A.I.-powered product like fully autonomous vehicles. Technology companies in both countries are still feverishly chasing the dream of the large-scale deployment of cars that drive themselves far better than any human could. Who wins this race is likely to depend on whether the main obstacle turns out to be a matter of core technology or simply execution details. If it\u2019s technical \u2014 major improvements in core algorithms \u2014 then the advantage goes to the United States. If it\u2019s implementation \u2014 smart infrastructure or policy adaptation \u2014 then the advantage goes to China.At this point, we don\u2019t know which it will be, but we do know that each country can improve its odds of success by learning from the other\u2019s strengths. Chinese researchers, start-ups and A.I. companies should let their imaginations run a little wilder, placing long-term bets that give them a chance of breaking new ground rather than playing catch-up. At the same time, American companies should embrace the less glamorous business of relentlessly developing variations on a proven concept. And American policymakers could move away from a hands-off stance toward A.I., looking instead to actively adapt the nation\u2019s physical structures and public institutions to better mesh with new technology.If both countries can make these shifts in perspective, then what might look like a zero-sum battle for A.I. supremacy between China and the United States will begin to resemble something totally different: an opportunity to learn across cultures and collectively advance the global project of building A.I. that improves human lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microwave Weapons Are Prime Suspect in Ills of U.S. Embassy Workers", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDoctors and scientists say microwave strikes may have caused sonic delusions and very real brain damage among embassy staff and family members.\u201cEverybody was relatively skeptical at first,\u201d he said, \u201cand everyone now agrees there\u2019s something there.\u201d Dr. Smith remarked that the diplomats and doctors jokingly refer to the trauma as the immaculate concussion.Strikes with microwaves, some experts now argue, more plausibly explain reports of painful sounds, ills and traumas than do other possible culprits \u2014 sonic attacks, viral infections and contagious anxiety.Scientists have known for decades that the brain can perceive some microwaves as sound.TEMPORALLOBECochleaEardrumTEMPORALLOBECochleaEardrumTEMPORALLOBECochleaEardrumBy The New York Times | Sources: Allan H. Frey; Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAsked about the microwave theory of the case, the State Department said the investigation had yet to identify the cause or source of the attacks. And the F.B.I. declined to comment on the status of the investigation or any theories.The microwave idea teems with unanswered questions. Who fired the beams? The Russian government? The Cuban government? A rogue Cuban faction sympathetic to Moscow? And, if so, where did the attackers get the unconventional arms?\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility,\u201d he said at his kitchen table. \u201cIn dictatorships, you often have factions that think nothing of going against the general policy if it suits their needs. I think that\u2019s a perfectly viable explanation.\u201dWhile radio broadcasting can employ waves a mile or more in length, microwaves range in size from roughly a foot to a tiny fraction of an inch. They\u2019re seen as harmless in such everyday uses as microwaving foods. But their diminutive size also enables tight focusing, as when dish antennas turn disorganized rays into concentrated beams.\u201cThey had me visiting the various labs and discussing the problems,\u201d including the neural impacts of microwaves, Mr. Frey recalled. \u201cI got an inside look at their classified program.\u201dFurtively, globally, the threat grew.Washington, too, foresaw new kinds of arms. Russia, China and many European states are seen as having the know-how to make basic microwave weapons that can debilitate, sow noise or even kill. Advanced powers, experts say, might accomplish more nuanced aims such as beaming spoken words into people\u2019s heads. Only intelligence agencies know which nations actually possess and use such unfamiliar arms. The basic weapon might look like a satellite dish. In theory, such a device might be hand-held or mounted in a van, car, boat or helicopter. Microwave arms are seen as typically working over relatively short distances \u2014 across the length of a few rooms or blocks. High-powered ones might be able to fire beams across several football fields, or even for several miles. Rex W. Tillerson, who was then the secretary of state, said the embassy\u2019s staff had been targeted deliberately. But he refrained from blaming Cuba, and federal officials held out the possibility that a third party may have been responsible.In his paper, he said high-intensity beams of microwaves could have caused the diplomats to experience not just loud noises but nausea, headaches and vertigo, as well as possible brain-tissue injury. The beams, he added, could be fired covertly, hitting \u201conly the intended target.\u201dA dish antenna could fit easily into a small van. In closing, she argued that \u201cnumerous highly specific features\u201d of the diplomatic incidents \u201cfit the hypothesis\u201d of a microwave attack, including the Frey-type production of disturbing sounds. But Mr. Zaid, the Washington lawyer, who represents eight of the diplomats and family members, said microwave attacks may have injured his clients. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of na\u00efve to think this just started now,\u201d he said. Globally, he added, covert strikes with the potent beams appear to have been going on for decades. \u201cThat is a very good question,\u201d Mr. Palmieri replied. But addressing it, he added, would require \u201ca classified setting.\u201d\u201cBased on what I know,\u201d he remarked, \u201cit will remain a mystery.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Maybe America Can Now Learn the Truth", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThank you, Jeff Flake.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Maybe, from this last-minute initiative to seek out the truth, Americans will wrest some new hope that their elected representatives can come to care about something more than political advantage. Though that\u2019s a pretty big reach. Republican leaders gave the F.B.I. just one week to gets its work done. And the Judiciary Committee, of which Mr. Flake is a member, continued to embarrass itself on Friday, voting on strict partisan lines to approve the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh. Under less corrupted circumstances, a thorough investigation would have begun as soon as the charges against Judge Kavanaugh arose, and long before any vote, allowing the committee to hear from principal witnesses, so senators could assess their credibility and press them for details that could corroborate one story or another.But, with the sudden and welcome exception of Mr. Flake, the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have not shown any interest in getting to the truth. They\u2019ve been most notably unwilling to subpoena Mark Judge, Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s high-school friend and a named witness in two of the allegations against him. On top of all this, Mr. Judge has written a memoir, \u201cWasted,\u201d about his struggles with teenage alcoholism, which includes a character named \u201cBart O\u2019Kavanaugh,\u201d who drank to the point of throwing up and passing out. When Judge Kavanaugh, who has admitted that he sometimes drank too much, was asked by the committee whether O\u2019Kavanaugh was him, he dodged the question before suggesting that the memoir was \u201cfictionalized.\u201dFirst, the people making the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh have been in support of an investigation from the start. Judge Kavanaugh and those defending him have not. Only Mr. Flake\u2019s intervention made it happen. That should tell you who cares about getting to the truth.Second, the Republicans\u2019 resistance to bringing in the F.B.I. was only one of the many ways that they have tried to ram Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation through with minimal vetting. They also refused to let Democrats and the public see more than 90 percent of the documents related to Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s time as staff secretary to President George W. Bush, which could shed light on whether he was honest with the Senate about his role in that administration. In general, Mr. McConnell and his colleagues have run this process as though they are terrified of what might happen if the American people actually find out anything about Judge Kavanaugh.Third, nothing the F.B.I. does can erase the travesty of Thursday\u2019s Judiciary Committee hearing.During Dr. Blasey\u2019s stunning testimony \u2014 which was \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201cvery compelling\u201d even to President Trump, who had previously said her allegations were false \u2014 the committee\u2019s 11 Republican members, all men, sat stewing in silence while a female sex-crimes prosecutor did their dirty work for them. But when Judge Kavanaugh appeared, they were his loyal courtiers, apologizing profusely and raging about the \u201cunethical sham\u201d Democrats were perpetrating.Judge Kavanaugh has enjoyed the kind of rewards that privilege, brains, hard work and loyal party service can supply, but he is not entitled to this Supreme Court seat. It belongs to the American people, and the court\u2019s legitimacy depends on citizens seeing it as striving to transcend naked partisan politics, rather than wallowing in them as Judge Kavanaugh did at Thursday\u2019s hearing.Republicans have been hungering for a solid conservative majority on the court for decades, and now, at last, they have it in reach. But in their unprincipled rush to lock in that majority \u2014\u00a0regardless of the truth, whatever it may be \u2014\u00a0the senators have shamed themselves and the institution they serve, and they are at risk of inflicting profound damage on the court they are so desperate to control. May this pause allow everyone the time to recover their senses. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Capitol Hill Ralph Club", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBrett Kavanaugh faces his moment of truth in a town that doesn\u2019t care about truth.Opinion ColumnistWASHINGTON \u2014 I never thought it could be as brutal.The same Republican gargoyles who once tore Anita Hill limb from limb knew they had to tread gingerly, with women at the barricades. They outsourced the estrogen to \u201ca female assistant,\u201d as Mitch McConnell called Maricopa County sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell.And race, which scorched the Hill-Thomas hearings, was not a part of this excruciating face-off. Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh were summoning memories of summer days in the very white, very cosseted country club, prep school world of suburban Washington.But, shockingly, it was more brutal.Not only because the sexual transgression Blasey was describing was more savage. But also because Kavanaugh simply adapted Clarence Thomas\u2019s playbook of raging against the machine. Thomas\u2019s fury was white-hot. Kavanaugh\u2019s, weepy. But the pitch was the same.\u201cThis is a circus,\u2019\u2019 Thomas seethed in 1991.\u201cThis is a circus,\u2019\u2019 Kavanaugh seethed on Thursday.Kavanaugh echoed Thomas\u2019s martyrdom, claiming he was being \u201cdestroyed\u201d by partisans conspiring to dig up dirt. He charged that Democrats were conducting a \u201cgrotesque and coordinated character assassination\u201d because of their anger about President Trump\u2019s ascent and their desire for revenge after his own seamy work helping Ken Starr in his pervy pursuit of Bill Clinton.It was a cri de coeur custom-made for the age of Trump \u2014 and custom-designed to please Trump himself: entitled white men acting like the new minority, howling about things that are being taken away from them, aggrieved at anything that diminishes them or saps their power.Thomas prevailed over Hill because of that lava flow of anger. The senators were frozen, Pompeii-style, as he cried racism to snatch the mantle of victim.Hill\u2019s aloof, dispassionate description of Thomas\u2019s harassment, and her preternaturally cool reaction to all the lurid slanders hurled at her, left the senators skeptical that she was telling the truth; shouldn\u2019t a wronged woman show more emotion? Six years later, when Hill wrote a book, the law professor explained that, as the youngest of 13 from a rural Oklahoma family, she had had years of practice in \u201cbeing impervious to and immobile in the face of hurt.\u201dHill\u2019s mother was left to express the emotion that her daughter reined in; when the Senate confirmed Thomas to the Supreme Court, the mother snapped, \u201cThe dirty rascals.\u201dHill seemed so poised and polished at 35, you had to remind yourself that she was a less-assured 25-year-old personal assistant when Thomas spewed his talk about bestiality and porn stars\u2019 anatomies. But there was no need to remind people Thursday that the dignified professional woman at the witness table was describing something from 36 years ago.The Palo Alto psychology professor laced her testimony with scientific terms like \u201csequelae,\u201d \u201cnorepinephrine\u201d and \u201chippocampus.\u201d But it was easy to visualize the 15-year-old in the 51-year-old with the girlish voice and guileless air as she repeatedly pushed a blond strand of hair out of her face, smiled nervously and tried oh so hard to please everyone. Her emotions, including panic, seemed close to the surface.The pentimento of the teenage Blasey made her seem achingly vulnerable. Like Hill, she had a purity to her manner and story that was luminous, an impressive contrast to all the dark obfuscations, self-serving political maneuvering and petty deceptions around her.The nominee whom Ted Cruz defended as \u201ca boring Boy Scout\u201d became a sneering portrait of privilege denied.When Amy Klobuchar, citing her father\u2019s alcoholism, asked if Kavanaugh had ever blacked out from drinking, he snapped back, \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 have you?\u2019\u2019Jeff Flake was so unnerved by the blast of opposition to his decision to vote for Kavanaugh that he led a scheme to get a week\u2019s delay to have the F.B.I. investigate.So we will finally drag Mark Judge, the man named by Blasey as the third person in the room that night, out of his beachfront hide-out. If the Republicans wanted to discern the character of who they\u2019re putting on the court, rather than simply solidifying the conservative majority, they would already have subpoenaed Judge and anyone else who could provide clarity.The hope that the F.B.I. will save the day may be misplaced. In the case of Anita Hill, agents were deployed by Republicans to help smear her.Even if Kavanaugh is confirmed, he already seems warped by this experience \u2014 just like Thomas was, when he went onto the bench as a very angry and bitter man.But at least we have a few more days to pretend to look for the truth.Advertisement"}

Or that the country is bitterly divided over Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership. Or even that his party might well lose the House to an opposition hellbent on his downfall.The dilemma \u2014 which he does not fully grasp \u2014 is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.I would know. I am one of them.To be clear, ours is not the popular \u201cresistance\u201d of the left. We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous.But we believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic.The root of the problem is the president\u2019s amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making.Although he was elected as a Republican, the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives: free minds, free markets and free people. At best, he has invoked these ideals in scripted settings. At worst, he has attacked them outright.In addition to his mass-marketing of the notion that the press is the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d President Trump\u2019s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic.Don\u2019t get me wrong. There are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more.But these successes have come despite \u2014 not because of \u2014 the president\u2019s leadership style, which is impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.From the White House to executive branch departments and agencies, senior officials will privately admit their daily disbelief at the commander in chief\u2019s comments and actions. Most are working to insulate their operations from his whims.Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.\u201cThere is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next,\u201d a top official complained to me recently, exasperated by an Oval Office meeting at which the president flip-flopped on a major policy decision he\u2019d made only a week earlier.The erratic behavior would be more concerning if it weren\u2019t for unsung heroes in and around the White House. Some of his aides have been cast as villains by the media. But in private, they have gone to great lengths to keep bad decisions contained to the West Wing, though they are clearly not always successful.It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what\u2019s right even when Donald Trump won\u2019t.The result is a two-track presidency.Take foreign policy: In public and in private, President Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia and North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied, like-minded nations.Astute observers have noted, though, that the rest of the administration is operating on another track, one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly, and where allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals.This isn\u2019t the work of the so-called deep state. It\u2019s the work of the steady state.Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until \u2014 one way or another \u2014 it\u2019s over.The bigger concern is not what Mr. Trump has done to the presidency but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility.We may no longer have Senator McCain. But we will always have his example \u2014 a lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue. Mr. Trump may fear such honorable men, but we should revere them.There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first. But the real difference will be made by everyday citizens rising above politics, reaching across the aisle and resolving to shed the labels in favor of a single one: Americans.The writer is a senior official in the Trump administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why the Senate Must Seek the Truth", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt is impossible to justify the lack of a neutral investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. Ms. Bazelon is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine.Twice as a reporter, I\u2019ve interviewed women who have accused men of sexual assault and the men they accused. In both cases, the women looked me in the eye and told me about how they\u2019d been raped, and then the men looked me in the eye and told me they\u2019d never raped anyone. All four people spoke with force and emotion. In the moment, I wanted to believe each one. It\u2019s uncomfortable to imagine that someone who seems wholly sincere is not. It\u2019s confusing \u2014 it seems unfeeling \u2014 to turn away from someone who makes a vehement claim of truth.If you watched Thursday\u2019s hearing, in particular Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s opening statement and Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s, maybe you know what I mean. So then what? As a reporter, I looked for corroborating evidence as a means of assessing each person\u2019s veracity. What else could I find out, and how did their accounts stack up against that? This is how investigators do their work. They find out as much as they can about the surrounding circumstances. Then it\u2019s up to judges to weigh the facts and decide which account is most credible.Judge Kavanaugh didn\u2019t sound as if he was thinking like a judge. His partisan attack on Democrats wasn\u2019t judicial, in any sense of the word. His approach to evidence wasn\u2019t either.We also have more than Dr. Blasey\u2019s word. Years ago, she talked about this assault, and named Judge Kavanaugh, with her husband and her therapist, and at a later time, she told a few close friends. They back her up on this. One memorable detail from her testimony has the ring of truth, in its specificity: Her assault came up in couples therapy with her husband because the traumatic memory triggered anxiety and claustrophobia, and that made her insist on adding a second front door to her house, to his understandable confusion. This is not the kind of fact a person makes up.Judge Kavanaugh refused to open another door that would allow the public, and the Senate, to reconcile these accounts of accusation and denial. He ruled out the possibility that he could not remember assaulting Dr. Blasey because he blacked out or was otherwise incapacitated by drinking. He was just as adamant about categorically denying the other sexual misconduct he has been accused of by two other women.If you\u2019re thinking like a judge aiming to discover the truth, it\u2019s also hard (impossible?) to justify the lack of a neutral investigation and the absence of other witnesses, beginning with Mark Judge, the friend of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s, whom Dr. Blasey says saw and participated in the assault, but not ending with him.The task of a judge or a Supreme Court justice is to seek the truth. The most important qualities for the job are probity and veracity. Nobody was on trial at the Senate Judiciary Committee. But only one person \u2014 Judge Kavanaugh \u2014 was asking to be elevated to the highest court in the land.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Steve Lohr, a tech reporter for The Times, and I tend to focus on the effects of technology beyond Silicon Valley. No question, the Valley is a wellspring of innovation and home to the ascendant digital corporate giants, both feared and admired. But it\u2019s just a sliver of the $20 trillion American economy.Technology is only a tool in service of greater ends, and those ends presumably extend beyond creating billionaires and enriching investors. The larger agenda, in economic terms, includes growth, productivity, living standards and jobs.Let\u2019s take one of those economic ingredients \u2014 jobs.Forecasts of technology\u2019s impact on jobs run the spectrum from apocalyptic to sanguine, depending largely on the pace of progress in artificial intelligence. But there is a consistency to the serious research on the coming course of automation: In the near term, occupations are more likely to be transformed by digital technology than destroyed by it.The work of the future, it seems clear, is going to be digitally inflected. Software skills are increasingly essential to every field. Most tech workers no longer work in the tech industry, and that trend is accelerating.These efforts are typically not far along yet, but the ones that seem to work best are collaborations \u2014 public-private partnerships that also involve nonprofit organizations and educational institutions.A new project adopting the collaborative model was announced this month in New Haven. The goal, said Gov. Dannel Malloy, is \u201ccultivating the tech work force talent of tomorrow.\u201d The new venture aims to double the number of software engineering graduates in Connecticut over the next several years.Its educational partner is a college-alternative start-up, the Holberton School. Founded in 2015 in San Francisco, Holberton offers a two-year program to create software engineers. Its graduates now work for companies like Apple, IBM, Dropbox and Tesla. The school charges no tuition, but graduates who get jobs pay the school 17 percent of their salaries for three years.After the Connecticut announcement, I caught up with Holberton\u2019s founders, Julien Barbier and Sylvain Kalache, both alumni of Silicon Valley companies. Their school is designed around projects and peer learning with mentors, but no formal teachers.Technical skills are only part of the program. Writing white papers, project reviews and public speaking are also emphasized. Critical thinking, teamwork and learning to learn are the higher-order skills.Technology changes too fast, Mr. Barbier said, for expertise in a particular set of software tools to be a lasting asset in the labor market.\u201cIn two years, you do learn a craft that is in demand,\u201d said Mr. Barbier, Holberton\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut this is really about self-learning. If you can train yourself, you\u2019re never going to obsolete.\u201dIn San Francisco, Holberton has enrolled a total of 300 students since it opened its doors two years ago and, with added space, hopes to bring in 1,000 students a year before long. At the New Haven school, which begins next year, Holberton plans to start with 30 to 50 students and then expand rapidly.Its model has made encouraging progress. But the big question for all the experiments intended to prepare people for the future of work is whether anything can scale up to the size of the challenge that America faces.Some tech stories of note this week:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Deafening Silence of Colin Kaepernick", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "The former star is using social media savvy, and a total lack of interviews, to control the narrative of protests in the N.F.L.Supported byIt was Kaepernick who, as a quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, sat then, after consulting a military veteran, started kneeling during the national anthem before N.F.L. games in 2016. He said he wanted to raise awareness of racism, social injustice and police brutality against \u201cblack people and people of color.\u201dHe was soon joined in that protest by Eric Reid, a former teammate who was also by his side the other night at the Open. Their protest, which other players have continued even as Kaepernick and Reid have not been signed by any teams, continues to stir debate online, divide fans and the league owners, captivate celebrities and athletes and motivate President Trump to persistently tweet his anger over it. \u201cI feel like that was a really powerful statement to a lot of other companies,\u201d she said.But Kaepernick, through it all, has kept his own voice largely out of those debates. As he works his way through a grievance against the N.F.L., accusing it of colluding to keep him out of a job, he has employed a savvy use of Twitter and other social media platforms, along with the occasional carefully staged public appearance, to make his points. And by all indicators most people are getting the message loud and clear.In November 2017, with the reality setting in that teams were not going to sign him despite his having led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance after the 2012 season, GQ named Kaepernick the magazine\u2019s Citizen of the Year. The issue was executed with Kaepernick\u2019s permission and assistance, and he posed for photographs, but he declined to be interviewed. Kaepernick stayed true to that public silence as he filed a grievance against the league. Over the course of the 2017 season, Kaepernick let others point out the fact that, statistically, he was a superior option to nearly every team\u2019s backup, and several teams\u2019 starters. It wasn\u2019t until April, when he accepted Amnesty International\u2019s Ambassador of Conscience award, that he publicly discussed, in any meaningful way, the protest, what it means to him and what life is like without a team. The speech, delivered in the Netherlands, lasted just over seven minutes.He expressed concern that Reid had paid the same price he had for the protest and he sought to emphasize the original rationale of his protest: \u201cAs police officers continue to terrorize black and brown communities, abusing their power, and then hiding behind their blue wall of silence, and laws that allow for them to kill us with virtual impunity, I have realized that our love, that sometimes manifests as black rage, is a beautiful form of defiance against a system that seeks to suppress our humanity. A system that wants us to hate ourselves.\u201d Kaepernick\u2019s ability to remain in the public spotlight \u2014 and at the heart of the N.F.L.\u2019s protests \u2014 stems largely from his use of social media, where an audience in the millions follows him on multiple platforms and tracks his public appearances. That so much of his message is delivered through the words of others only served to amplify Kaepernick\u2019s personal posts of support to the Miami Dolphins players Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson, both of whom knelt during the anthem before a preseason game last month. He did not post, or even retweet, in support of Miami\u2019s Robert Quinn or Philadelphia\u2019s Jenkins, both of whom raised a fist during the anthem. Last week, an arbitrator denied the N.F.L.\u2019s request to have Kaepernick\u2019s collusion complaint dismissed. The news of the decision was announced on social media by Kaepernick\u2019s lawyer, Mark Geragos, and it was declared by many to be a significant step in Kaepernick\u2019s ability to remain a thorn in the N.F.L.\u2019s side, even if the bar for winning his case is fairly high. Kaepernick\u2019s message is focused. His voice remains silent.Ken Belson and Ben Rothenberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Your DNA Is Still Uncharted Territory", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatterScientists are focusing on a relatively small number of human genes and neglecting thousands of others. The reasons have more to do with professional survival than genetics. You have a gene called PNMA6F. All people do, but no one knows the purpose of that gene or the protein it makes. And as it turns out, PNMA6F has a lot of company in that regard.Most of our other genes have been almost as badly neglected, the subjects of minor investigation at best. A tiny fraction \u2014 2,000 of them \u2014 have hogged most of the attention, the focus of 90 percent of the scientific studies published in recent years.A number of factors are largely responsible for this wild imbalance, and they say a lot about how scientists approach science.Researchers tend to focus on genes that have been studied for decades, for example. To take on an enigma like PNMA6F can put a scientist\u2019s career at risk.\u201cThis is very worrisome,\u201d said Lu\u00eds A. Nunes Amaral, a data scientist at Northwestern University and a co-author of the new study. \u201cIf the field keeps exploring the unknown this slowly, it will take us forever to understand these other genes.\u201dA gene may come to light because scientists encounter the protein it encodes. At other times, the first clue comes when scientists recognize that a stretch of DNA has some distinctive sequences that are shared by all genes.But giving a gene a name doesn\u2019t mean you know what it does.Consider a gene called C1orf106. Scientists found it in 2002 but had no idea of its function. In 2011, researchers found that variants of this gene put people at risk of inflammatory bowel disease. Yet they still had no idea why.In March, a team of researchers based at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., solved the mystery. They bred mice that couldn\u2019t make proteins from C1orf106, and found that the animals developed leaky guts. Researchers noticed that something was wrong with the study of human genes as early as 2003. Just a small group of them attracted most of the scientific attention.Genetics has changed dramatically since then. Scientists now have a detailed map of the human genome, showing the location of just about every gene on the human genome, and the technology for sequencing DNA has become staggeringly powerful.Recently, Dr. Amaral and his colleagues checked to see if researchers had broadened their focus by analyzing millions of scientific papers published up to 2015. Our knowledge about human genes, the team found, remained wildly lopsided.Not only did Dr. Amaral and his colleagues document the ongoing imbalance, they tested 430 possible explanations for why it exists, ranging from the size of the protein encoded by a gene to the date of its discovery.It was possible, for example, that scientists were rationally focusing attention only on the genes that matter most. Perhaps they only studied the genes involved in cancer and other diseases.That was not the case, it turned out. \u201cThere are lots of genes that are important for cancer, but only a small subset of them are being studied,\u201d said Dr. Amaral.Just 15 explanations mostly accounted for how many papers have been published on a particular gene. The reasons have more to do with the working lives of scientists than the genes themselves.For example, it\u2019s easier to gather proteins that are secreted than ones that stay trapped inside cells. Dr. Amaral and his colleagues found that if a gene creates a secreted protein, that gene is much more likely to be well studied.It\u2019s also easier to study a human gene by looking at a related version in a mouse or some other lab animal. Scientists have succeeded in creating animal models for some genes but not others.Genes that are studied in animal models tend to be studied a lot in humans, too, Dr. Amaral and his colleagues found.A long history helps, too. The genes that are intensively studied now tend to be the ones that were discovered long ago.Some 16 percent of all human genes were identified by 1991. Those genes were the subjects of about half of all genetic research published in 2015.One reason is that the longer scientists study a gene, the easier it gets, noted Thomas Stoeger, a post-doctoral researcher at Northwestern and a co-author of the new report.\u201cPeople who study these genes have a head start over scientists who have to make tools to study other genes,\u201d he said.That head start may make all the difference in the scramble to publish research and land a job. Graduate students who investigated the least studied genes were much less likely to become a principal investigators later in their careers, the new study found.\u201cAll the rewards are set up for you to study what has been well-studied,\u201d Dr. Amaral said.\u201cWith the Human Genome Project, we thought everything was going to change,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd what our analysis shows is pretty much nothing changed.\u201dIf these trends continue as they have for decades, the human genome will remain a terra incognito for a long time. At this rate, it would take a century or longer for scientists to publish at least one paper on every one of our 20,000 genes.That slow pace of discovery may well stymie advances in medicine, Dr. Amaral said. \u201cWe keep looking at the same genes as targets for our drugs. We are ignoring the vast majority of the genome,\u201d he said.Scientists won\u2019t change their ways without a major shift in how science gets done, he added. \u201cI can\u2019t believe the system can move in that direction by itself,\u201d he said.Dr. Stoeger argued that the scientific community should recognize that a researcher who studies the least known genes may need extra time to get results.\u201cPeople who do something new need some protection,\u201d he said.Dr. Amaral proposed dedicating some research grants to the truly unknown, rather than safe bets.\u201cSome of the things we would be funding are going to fail,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when they succeed, they\u2019re going to open lots of opportunities.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Australia Wants to Take Government Surveillance to the Next Level", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new bill will help its intelligence agencies circumvent encryption. And what starts Down Under won\u2019t necessarily stay there.Ms. O\u2019Shea is a human rights lawyer who is writing a book about technology and politics.SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 A state\u2019s capacity to spy on its citizens has grown exponentially in recent years as new technology has meant more aspects of our lives can be observed, recorded and analyzed than ever before. At the same time, much to the frustration of intelligence agencies around the world, so has the ability to keep digital information secret, thanks to encryption. We should all be worried, because it\u2019s not just criminals or terrorists who use encryption, but every one of us. We use encryption to buy things online, manage our finances, and communicate personally and professionally. Hospitals, transportation systems and government agencies use encrypted data. Creating tools to weaken encrypted systems for one purpose weakens it for all purposes. If Australia succeeds in doing so, it could be your bank account or your medical records that are compromised in the end.The government has been quick to claim that this is not a back door, and the bill prohibits requests to companies to create \u201csystemic\u201d weaknesses. But this prohibition is ambiguous, and the reporting and accountability safeguards are minimal. The truth is that there is simply no way to create tools to undermine encryption without jeopardizing digital security and eroding individual rights and freedoms. Hackers with bad intentions will do their utmost to take advantage of any such tools that companies are forced to provide the government. Seemingly in response to such criticisms, the bill in Australia prohibits the government from preventing a company from repairing such a vulnerability. But this is cold comfort: The N.S.A. didn\u2019t need to prevent Microsoft patching the problem because Microsoft didn\u2019t even know it existed. The WannaCry attack illustrates how intelligence agencies prioritize their own interests. If we give state agencies more power to build tools to circumvent encryption, not only do we expose ourselves to the risk that they can be stolen, we are forced to trust that these agencies will behave responsibly. The evidence to date suggests the opposite. The same is true today. The Australian government is testing the limits of our democracy by seeking to empower the surveillance state, and what it learns will have implications globally. We need to take a stand against this power grab by state agencies, and reject the idea that encrypted communications undermine security. Quite the opposite: They are complementary. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Highly Recommend Joining This Cult", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI am slashing my spending and rethinking my bourgeois ways. You should, too. Contributing Opinion WriterLet me tell you about the cult I have joined: the cult of thrift. The indoctrination started gently, with a podcast here, a YouTube video there, about minimalism, debt-free living, frugality, decluttering, zero waste.Then, before I knew it, I was listening to an American evangelical Christian named Dave Ramsey telling me in his Tennessee drawl that \u201cthe borrower is slave to the lender\u201d and that I need to get \u201cgazelle intense\u201d and live on \u201crice and beans, beans and rice\u201d to get out of debt, be \u201cweird\u201d by having a paid-off house.Now, having chugged the Kool-Aid, I am slashing my spending and rethinking my bourgeois ways. Bargain grocery shopping has become a sport. I make soups from scratch and serve casseroles made from cheap cuts of meat. Instead of taking the kids to expensive museum exhibitions to learn about nature, we are spending time in nature. Instead of dance classes, we dance. I am buying less wine, and when I do, it is supermarket wine. Dyeing my hair less, and when I do, using supermarket dye.These are messages relevant to our times, with reports in August that United States household debt reached a new peak of $13.3 trillion, an increase of $454 billion from the previous year. In Australia, we have some of the highest levels of household debt in the world, and with no sign of a big increase in wages any time soon, many Australians are having to learn to rein in their profligate ways.In many respects the modern cult of thrift \u2014 with its broad coalition of self-help gurus, former tech bros, evangelicals, financial educators and frugal moms \u2014 is a technologically led echo of the thrift movement of the early 20th century, with many of the same strengths and shortcomings. I feel this most keenly when listening to hardworking callers to \u201cThe Dave Ramsey Show\u201d who are in credit-card debt because of a lack of health care. And in many, many cases, callers speak of college debt from doing exactly what society told them they were supposed to do to get ahead.But with these limitations in mind, there is still much to admire about the cult of thrift, especially when the message is directed toward those with good incomes rather than unfairly applied to people living in poverty. There has long been potential for connection across the cultural and political spectrum on this issue \u2014 and the benefits of thrift go beyond the benefits to the individual. Our culture provides too few emotional payoffs for not spending money. All around us there are carefully designed messages telling us to spend. Letters arrive at our homes \u201cinviting\u201d us to apply for credit cards. Instagram offers us images of people with nicer vacations and trendier clothes and more photogenic food, which can make us dissatisfied with our own. So it is nice to know there are some corners of social media where someone will get excited about the idea of not upgrading your car, not using a credit card.I am thinking here of Facebook groups dedicated to budgeting and saving, and YouTube channels like Fun Cheap or Free, where Jordan Page, a Mormon mom of five, with another baby on the way, gets super excited about sharing her budget grocery hauls. Or the blog and YouTube channel of the Australian financial adviser Canna Campbell, who offers a glamorous vision of a life of minimalism and saving while still carrying a nice purse. When you see other people doing it, not spending feels more like a creative challenge connected to a sense of purpose, rather than deprivation.And after four months of learning from the thrifty and living more frugally, the unexpected consequence is that it has not just reduced my spending but has also improved my quality of life and satisfaction with life. Less time shopping for new consumer durables to bring into the house means more time enjoying and caring for the things we already have. More time is spent doing rather than acquiring, cutting flowers from the garden rather than buying them from a shop, cooking from scratch rather than ordering takeout.I am recognizing and appreciate my privilege in being wealthy enough to live well and still save, rather than feel dissatisfied by what a tiny percentage of the global population has that I do not. The experience has not been so much one of going without pleasure as about savoring each moment of pleasure rather than racing on to the next one.This approach is important, not just for personal satisfaction but also for politics. When professionals on relatively high wages in wealthy countries complain that they cannot get ahead and life is too expensive, they are not speaking in solidarity with the poor \u2014 they are actually insulting the poor. If we want to tackle inequality, those in higher income brackets must understand that they have the power to live within their means, that they have more than enough, not only to support themselves but to give more to others in the form of taxation or philanthropy.And the same goes for tackling environmental damage. The environment will not be saved by a consumerist mind-set in which the developed world rapidly throws out its consumer products to replace them with brand-new, more-energy-efficient consumer products, as if the environment can be saved by a fleet of shiny new Priuses bought on credit.I still have a long way to go in reducing my consumption. As my journey continues I plan to seek inspiration from people who have less than me rather than people who have more.

They\u2019re space junk. Specifically, rocket parts: the fuselage, fuel containers and highly toxic spent boosters of missiles launched from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, a Cold War-era base in the Arkhangelsk Oblast more than 200 miles to the south that is one of the most active launch sites on earth.\u201cMy curiosity was very strong,\u201d said Mr. Petralla, 37. \u201cI was fascinated by these villagers. I was interested to understand why the inhabitants of the area, despite being aware of the high toxicity of these pieces of rocket, especially the propellant heptyl, highly carcinogenic, go to recover them in the tundra.\u201dAs his portfolio, \u201cCosmodrome,\u201d illustrates, collecting a striking piece of garden art is the least of the reasons residents trek through icy tundra for space trash.\u201cI discovered that for them, in such an extreme territory, it is a great fortune to be able to recover these objects,\u201d he said. \u201cTo build boats and sleds, above all to be able to fish in summer and hunt in winter. The dural, metal that covers the outer part of the rockets, is very resistant.\u201dThe boats residents make from space rockets are called racketa. They provide lifelines in the spring and summer, when, each year, the villages flood and moving from place to place is a day\u2019s work. \u201cThere are no bridges,\u201d Mr. Petralla said, \u201cand it can take up to 10 hours to move from one village to another.\u201dIn the winter, the area\u2019s breathtaking landscape is more accessible \u2014 frozen rivers make good roads \u2014 but the temperature is forbidding, as low as minus 35 Celsius. It was hard to shoot pictures, Mr. Petralla said, and arduous work for villagers foraging space parts.In the 1990s, when Russia increasingly began using the Plesetsk Cosmodrome to launch navigation, weather and military satellites, the trend in racketa and other space waste took off. Since Russia plans to increase its launches from Plesetsk to 44 percent of its total by 2020, Mr. Petralla said, there will be plenty of rocket material for residents to salvage in the future.That means plenty more spent boosters with heptyl, which NASA, in contrast, recovers immediately from the Atlantic Ocean.

When we asked 4,035 working-class voters in battleground races to name an elected official who was fighting for them, the top response was not a Republican or a Democrat. It was \u201cno one.\u201d That goes a long way toward explaining why debates among political elites about the strategic direction Democrats must take to win in 2018 and 2020 continue to miss the point. Should Democrats pursue moderate or liberal policies? Should they persuade white working-class voters or mobilize a diverse base? These arguments feel utterly irrelevant to the daily choices of working-class voters.Carol, and tens of millions of working people just like her, harbor a deep skepticism that politicians of either party can deliver any kind of meaningful change for them. Our current politics fail to engage working people in a conversation about what matters to them and to draw connections between their lived experience and the reason they should cast a ballot in the first place.Working-class people share common anxieties about their economic security. Like Carol, they see few solutions from the politicians in either party seeking their vote.Darren, a white voter in his mid-40s who lives in Philadelphia, said that \u201cwe mean nothing\u201d to politicians. \u201cRegular people don\u2019t have money.\u201dWorking-class voters like Darren, a longtime Democrat who voted for Mr. Trump, aren\u2019t ideological; they\u2019re fed up and politically adrift. Persuadable voters like Darren and pessimistic Democrats like Carol are looking for politicians with tangible solutions to help the majority of Americans who have been left out of the country\u2019s growing prosperity.A voter in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District \u2014 where Conor Lamb won a special election this year \u2014 said, \u201cI care about right here,\u201d as he pointed to his feet on his doorstep. \u201cTell me what they\u2019re going to do right here.\u201dFor Democrats, simply turning up the volume on political communications through these same channels has not quelled the distrust or broken through. My organization has found that we can get so much more with a different approach: Start where the voters are.First, our experience running a large-scale, year-round field canvass reveals a somewhat obvious truth. Beginning the conversation by asking, \u201cWhat matters to you?\u201d instead of telling voters what should matter to them gets a more receptive audience.Next, when we introduce new information by telling voters about something they don\u2019t know rather than telling them that what they think they know is wrong, you can see the light come on.Elaine, 70, a white Trump voter in Grove City, Ohio, told us she watches Fox News \u201cin the morning till I go to bed.\u201d Yet when we told her about our push to raise wages and improve working standards, something clicked for her. She shared that her adult children are struggling with low pay and poor benefits.We can\u2019t assume voters like Elaine, Darren and Carol will pull the lever for a progressive in 2018. For this approach to be successful, it must be grounded in more than anecdote and observation. We need evidence that\u2019s produced by clinical research about what changes minds.The recipe is simple: credibility derived from listening, compelling solutions, new information that breaks through and thoughtful analytics. And it works with working-class swing voters and disaffected Democrats equally.Winning back the confidence of these voters is essential for gaining control of Congress and for building strength in the states ahead of redistricting fights after 2020.Putting a check on the White House in 2018 won\u2019t fix what\u2019s broken. Radically changing how voters perceive their own agency in relation to politics will. Follow this recipe and progressives can win and govern for a generation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ancient drawing was unearthed in Blombos Cave, which is about 200 miles east of Cape Town. Archaeological deposits at the site date from 70,000 to 100,000 years ago during the Middle Stone Age. Inside the cave, scientists have uncovered Homo sapiens\u2019 teeth, spear points, bone tools, engravings and beads made from seashells.Luca Pollarolo, a research fellow at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, was cleaning some artifacts excavated from the site in 2011 when he stumbled across a small flake, measuring only about the size of two thumbnails, that appeared to have been drawn on. The markings consisted of six straight, almost parallel lines that were crossed diagonally by three slightly curved lines.\u201cI think I saw more than ten thousand artifacts in my life up to now, and I never saw red lines on a flake,\u201d said Dr. Pollarolo. \u201cI could not believe what I had in my hands.\u201dUsing a microscope, a laser and a scanning electron microscope, they determined that the marks were on top of the rock and that they were made from red ocher, a type of natural pigment that was often used to make prehistoric cave paintings. In fact, ancient humans in the Blombos Cave were making ocher paint as far back as 100,000 years ago.\u201cThen we had to determine how did they make those lines?\u201d Dr. van Niekerk said. \u201cWere they painted or drawn on?\u201dThey recreated ocher paint, then fashioned a wooden stick into a brush and made strokes on stone flakes comparable to the specimen. They also made an ocher crayon and drew lines. They then compared the paint markings and crayon markings with what they had seen on the artifact.They determined that the ancient crisscross pattern was a drawing, not a painting, made with an ocher crayon tip that most likely measured only about 1 to 3 millimeters in thickness.That distinction between a painting and drawing is important, according to Dr. Henshilwood, because ocher paint batches can dry. That makes it less useful than an ocher crayon used by an ancient human whenever she or he wanted to make symbols without going to the trouble of mixing up paint.Dr. Henshilwood and his team also showed that the red lines were drawn onto a smooth surface. That indicated that the flake was once a part of a larger stone that the prehistoric humans may have used to grind ocher. They also showed that the original red lines most likely stretched past what was seen on the stone flake before the grindstone was broken.They cannot say with certainty what the purpose of the drawing was and whether it was mere doodling or if it held some greater meaning. But they have their conjectures.\u201cI\u2019m convinced they are more than just random marks,\u201d said Dr. Henshilwood. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely a symbol and there\u2019s a message there.\u201dThey also believe the drawing was made by a member of our species, and not some other hominin, because they have only found Homo sapiens remains in the cave.\u201cUp to now, we didn\u2019t know that drawing was part of these ancient Homo sapiens\u2019 repertoire,\u201d Dr. van Niekerk said.Dr. Henshilwood said that similar criss-cross and hash mark patterns have been found engraved in pieces of ocher found in the cave. The latest finding, he said, provided further evidence that early humans in Africa used symbols and abstract thinking across a multitude of methods, including drawing, painting, engraving and jewelry making.If the drawing was on a stone flake that was once part of grindstone used for making ocher, she would have liked to have seen the researchers perform additional experiments that replicated activities other than drawing in order to demonstrate that the ocher marks weren\u2019t made unintentionally while grinding ocher into powder.Dr. d\u2019Errico countered, saying that grinding ocher for powder would have left large red spots on the flake, and not the very thin red lines that they see on their artifact.While the debate remains unsettled, the researchers have given the artifact, originally called G7bCCC-L13, a new name, drawn from a much more modern symbol.\u201cWe are nicknaming it \u2018#L13\u2019 since we\u2019re in 2018 and everything has hashtags,\u201d Dr. van Niekerk said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Kavanaugh Accusation Is Dangerous for the Pro-Life Movement", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRepealing Roe will be a hollow victory if the anti-abortion cause is hitched to a party that\u2019s seen as anti-woman. Opinion ColumnistThis line, from Luker\u2019s book \u201cAbortion and the Politics of Motherhood,\u201d neatly encapsulates a longstanding pro-choice charge against the pro-life movement. As much as opponents of abortion claim to care about the killing of the unborn, the argument goes, in reality abortion restriction is a means to a different end: The restraint of women\u2019s choices, the restriction of their sexual freedom, their subordination to the rule of fathers and husbands and patriarchy writ large.At the same time the abortion-rights movement was linked in its early days to a distinctive form of upper-class WASP paternalism \u2014 in which legal abortion was sold as a means of helping upper-class \u201cgood girls\u201d out of trouble while keeping the undesirable fertility of other classes and races in check. And from Hugh Hefner\u2019s early abortion-rights advocacy to a certain style of predatory male feminism today, support for legal abortion among men has often carried a strong whiff of self-interest, with feticide as a get-out-of-responsibility-free card for caddish men.Which is why the allegation of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh represents a uniquely dangerous moment for a pro-life movement that has spent decades working toward the goal of a fifth Supreme Court vote to amend or overturn Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh may be innocent. The allegation against him is plausible but not nearly as dispositive as the cascade of #MeToo claims that have felled other prominent men. If it is false, the work of a faulty or disoriented memory, then he is in a legitimately terrible position, with a lifetime\u2019s reputation for probity at stake and no clear way to clear his name. Which is why the accuser cannot shirk testifying publicly, as her lawyer suggested last night, and expect her claims to keep him from the Supreme Court.Which, to be clear, sometimes has a point. False rape accusations against privileged-white-male targets (the Duke lacrosse team, the imaginary Haven Monahan at the University of Virginia) are real enough, and the style of anti-rape policies on college campuses really has gone too far in traducing the rights of accused men.A Trumpified conservatism, though, will necessarily struggle to acknowledge any of this, because of what it would suggest about Trump\u2019s own fitness for his office. And such a conservatism \u2014 much-more-heavily male than the Reagan or Bush G.O.P., organized around the fears and grievances of prominent men, and seemingly indifferent to the legitimacy of certain kinds of female anger \u2014 will end up defining all its constituent parts, all its causes and concerns, as subordinate to the defense of male impunity.This includes the pro-life movement. Even if it wins its long-desired victory at the high court and more anti-abortion legislation becomes possible, a pro-life cause joined to a party that can\u2019t win female votes and seems to have no time for women will never be able to achieve those legislative goals, or at least never outside a very few, very conservative states. And having that long-awaited victory accomplished by a male judicial appointee confirmed under a cloud of #MeToo suspicion seems like a good way to cement a perception that\u2019s fatal to the pro-life movement\u2019s larger purposes \u2014 the perception that you can\u2019t be pro-woman and pro-life.This points to a conclusion that\u2019s certainly unfair to Kavanaugh if he\u2019s innocent, but nobody ever said that politics would be fair. If his accuser testifies publicly and credibly, if her allegation isn\u2019t undermined by a week of scrutiny and testimony, if it remains unprovable but squarely in the realm of plausibility, then all the abortion opponents who were supporting him should hope that his nomination is withdrawn \u2014 with, ideally, a woman nominated in his place.That would be a political gamble in its own right, of course, and one that the Trump White House will take only under duress. But if Kavanaugh is a qualified judge, no judicial nominee is indispensable. And for a movement that risked so much to make these nominations possible, there is no reason to compound that risk unless this nominee can find a way to decisively persuade the country, however unfair that burden may seem, that he did not treat Christine Blasey Ford with the cruelty alleged this week.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.This is dirty politics, nearly as sleazy as it gets. Days before voting Thursday in Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s primary race for re-election, the New York State Democratic Committee has sent voters a campaign mailer falsely accusing his challenger, Cynthia Nixon, of being \u201csilent on the rise of anti-Semitism.\u201d It says she supports the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel over its treatment of Palestinians. She does not. It accuses Ms. Nixon of opposing tax-supported funding of yeshivas, the private religious schools attended by many of New York City\u2019s Orthodox Jews. She has never said that.\u201cWith anti-Semitism and bigotry on the rise, we can\u2019t take a chance,\u201d the mailer reads. \u201cRe-Elect Governor Andrew Cuomo.\u201dThis is the lowest form of politics, and the most dangerous, exploiting the festering wounds and fears along ethnic and religious lines.Sorry, Mr. Cuomo, but that strains credulity.Mr. Cuomo dominates the state Democratic Party. It acts ethically or abominably at his direction, or at the very least, with his campaign\u2019s blessing.The committee no doubt sent this garbage in the cynical hope that it would prove effective with ultra-Orthodox Jews, who generally vote as a bloc, making them a sought-after constituency for New York politicians.Geoff Berman, executive director of the state Democratic organization, said Saturday on Twitter that the mailer was \u201ca mistake and is inappropriate and is not the tone the Democratic Party should set,\u201d saying it wouldn\u2019t happen again. Sunday, he went further, saying the group would \u201cwork with the Nixon campaign to send out a mailing of their choosing to the same universe of people.\u201dEven if that were possible so late in the campaign, it\u2019s not enough. Mr. Cuomo has an obligation to personally apologize and condemn these outrageous attacks. Voters deserve to hear Mr. Cuomo describe Ms. Nixon as a worthy opponent who abhors anti-Semitism. He should make sure that message gets to ultra-Orthodox voters ahead of Thursday\u2019s elections. And he should fire the party official who came up with the idea for the flier.State Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat who hasn\u2019t endorsed a candidate in the primary, said in a statement released by the Nixon campaign on Sunday: \u201cI am doubly offended and aghast that my party organization would produce and mail such a false, damaging attack on Ms. Nixon and then watch the governor and key staff act surprised they had done this. Shameful.\u201d Given all the ethical lapses in Mr. Cuomo\u2019s administration, of which he has also pleaded ignorance, this smear is appalling. It is the kind of cynical behavior that detracts from Mr. Cuomo\u2019s often-impressive ability to govern. If he is not careful, it could make voters think they have no choice but to vote for someone else.Mr. Cuomo deserves a third term because of his potential to lead. He should stop squandering that potential now. To be sure of it, New York Democrats need to turn out in large numbers on Thursday to support every reform-driven candidate possible \u2014 for the Legislature, for attorney general, even for party committees. They can teach Albany a lesson it won\u2019t soon forget.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Are You Calling a \u2018Harringtonite\u2019? ", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat Michael Harrington, once America\u2019s most famous socialist, would think about his political descendants.Mr. Isserman is the author of \u201cThe Other American: The Life of Michael Harrington.\u201dSometime in the early spring of 2016, as Bernie Sanders began racking up primary victories in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, I found myself wondering what the impact would be on a group that I belong to, Democratic Socialists of America. Since its founding in 1982, the organization had been stuck at about 6,000 members, and by 2016, many were, like me, middle-aged or older, mostly white and male.Critics in the political center and right have struggled to respond to this swerve to the left, but one common response has been: This is not your father\u2019s (or grandfather\u2019s) D.S.A. \u2014 which is to say it is not well mannered, slightly tweedy, even academic. It is not, in other words, Michael Harrington.There\u2019s no question that Harrington was a decent man. But setting aside the dubiousness of The Wall Street Journal channeling the thoughts of a long-deceased democratic socialist, Harrington was anything but the meek, elbow-patched caricature that people on the right \u2014 and even in some of the hard-left factions within the D.S.A. itself \u2014 imagine. In fact, a better understanding of Harrington\u2019s career and ideas tells us a lot about the future of today\u2019s re-energized democratic socialists.Born in St. Louis in 1928, Harrington moved to New York in 1949, where soon after he joined the socialist movement. By the 1960s, his political views were grounded in two core principles: First, that in the label \u201cdemocratic socialist,\u201d the two words merited equal emphasis, and that it was, indeed, impossible to have genuine socialism without democracy. And second, that democratic socialists should function as the \u201cleft-wing of the possible\u201d in American politics, committed to coalition-building around common goals with progressives outside their own ranks, including the labor, civil rights, environmental and feminist movements, as well as the liberal wing of the Democratic Party.But that was later. In the 1950s, Harrington was young, brash and impatient with elders in the socialist movement. Feeling cut off from real impact on American society in an era hostile to any form of radical expression, he was sustained by the satisfactions of left-sectarianism, the kind of sandbox revolutionary posturing that the sociologist Daniel Bell (himself a socialist in his youth) described as \u201cthe illusions of settling the fate of history, the mimetic combat on the plains of destiny, and the vicarious sense of power in demolishing opponents.\u201d At one forum in New York City in the mid-1950s on the future of socialism, Harrington haughtily accused the editors of the left-wing journal Dissent, the event\u2019s sponsors, of seeking to \u201cconvert college sophomores into exhausted old men.\u201d (The principal \u201cexhausted old\u201d editor of Dissent, Irving Howe, was in his mid-30s at the time, not quite eight years Harrington\u2019s senior.)As Harrington grew older, he tired of the dank self-righteousness and sharp-elbowed polemical style of left sectarianism. How one argues, Harrington came to understand, was as important as what one argued. Writing in 1962 in Dissent, where he was now an editor, he warned radical elders not to react too hastily when they heard students in the nascent New Left espousing na\u00efve or wrongheaded views about, say, the Castro regime in Cuba. Those views \u201cmust be faced and changed,\u201d he wrote, but \u201cthe persuasion must come from someone who is actually involved in changing the status quo\u201d and \u201chas a sympathy for the genuine and good emotions which are just behind the bad theories.\u201dFamously and unfortunately, within a few months, Harrington proceeded to ignore his own better instincts, denouncing the founders of the new campus group Students for a Democratic Society for espousing what he regarded as insufficiently anti-Communist views (a fair criticism of the group in the later 1960s, when I was a member, but way off the mark in 1962). He almost immediately regretted the blunder, but the damage had been done. As he wrote a quarter-century later, he had been guilty of \u201crude insensitivity to young people struggling to define a new identity, and of treating \u201cfledgling radicals trying out their own ideas for the first time as if they were hardened faction fighters.\u201dFew of today\u2019s new D.S.A. members, three decades after Harrington\u2019s death, are \u201chardened faction fighters.\u201d They have been described as \u201cnondenominational socialists,\u201d in search of a political community of like-minded activists, more concerned with practical results than ancient political feuds, all of which is to their credit. But, like their predecessors in previous radical generations, including the young Michael Harrington, some will be drawn, at least for a time, to whatever policy and doctrine seems to promise the greatest personal sense of moral purity. There are newly organized caucuses within D.S.A. that seek to push the organization further leftward, in directions antithetical to the Harrington tradition. Indeed, in some quarters of D.S.A., \u201cHarringtonite\u201d has become a term of abuse, used to demean people who emphasize practicality and compromise. Amid all the promising signs of growth, youth, energy and imagination, the old familiar tensions between a politics of the possible and a politics of pretend combat on the plains of destiny have re-emerged.These tensions came to the fore in a recent debate within the New York City chapters of D.S.A. over whether or not to endorse Cynthia Nixon\u2019s campaign for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in New York.

Another, \u201cSnow from Yesteryear,\u201d by Irina Korina of Russia, is an assemblage of giant inflatable sculptures subverting the national pride Austria feels in the beauty of its landscape.At the time, Mr. Schlingensief\u2019s \u201cPlease Love Austria\u201d project created a furor in Vienna and beyond. Now its Swiftian edge can be enjoyed in the peace of an empty gallery (at least, that was the case on Tuesday afternoon).\u201cIt\u2019s not a market thing,\u201d he said of the gallery collaboration. \u201cIt\u2019s just one more step towards strengthening Vienna as a city of contemporary art.\u201dOn Wednesday, however, at the opening of the Vienna Contemporary fair, Mr. Janda quickly sold two small lyrical mixed-media works by the admired Croatian artist Mladen Stilinovic, who died in 2016. Priced at \u20ac12,000 each, they were bought by a Swiss collector.\u201cIt\u2019s a local fair. That\u2019s why I like it,\u201d said John Austin, co-founder of Austin Desmond, a gallery specializing in 20th-century art, based in London. \u201cYou see things you\u2019d never see at international fairs. You make discoveries, particularly from Eastern Europe.\u201dMr. Austin, like several other visitors at the opening, was attracted to the booth of A.C.B. Gallery, based in Budapest. A.C.B. was showing Bauhaus-influenced enamel abstracts from the 1960s and \u201970s by Ferenc Lantos and Sandor Pinczehelyi, Hungarian artists associated with the neo-avant-garde \u201cPecs Workshop\u201d group. These were priced at between \u20ac12,000 and \u20ac30,000, but as yet unsold, according to Rona Kopeczky, the gallery\u2019s co-artistic director.Last year, Vienna Contemporary attracted about 29,000 visitors. The liberal-leaning art world, or at least a section of it, will always show up to a well-organized fair in a destination city such as Vienna, as it will to openings of serious exhibition shows and prestigious festivals, such as Steirischer Herbst.The challenge these events face is to get the rest of the world to show up. Or even the rest of Austria.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Mayor Kills Alligator on Video, Complaints Roll In", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJudy Cochran got revenge on Monday for her beloved miniature horse that mysteriously vanished at her Texas ranch three years ago. She lodged a single bullet from a Winchester .22 Magnum rifle between the eyes of the prime suspect \u2014 a 12-foot, 580-pound alligator.Ms. Cochran, 73, is accustomed to the local spotlight. She is the mayor of her small town, Livingston, and serves on the board of a local bank and a hospital. But she wasn\u2019t used to the international attention she received this week for killing the gator.\u201cThere are all these negative comments at me personally,\u201d Mayor Cochran said Thursday morning.Since then, Ms. Cochran said she had received at least a dozen phone calls at her home and office. Most callers are positive, she said, but some have been vicious, even threatening.The complaints: Why did you have to kill it? Why didn\u2019t you relocate the alligator? One woman promised to start a petition to impeach her. And many other people have called the Livingston City Hall to complain about her, she said. And then she read nasty online comments about her on news stories.On Wednesday night, Mayor Cochran prayed about the ordeal and decided it was best for her, as well as the City of Livingston, to stop talking about shooting the gator. She did not want the negativity to reflect poorly on the city she loves.\u201cI\u2019m tough,\u201d said Ms. Cochran, who ran unopposed in May. \u201cI can handle it.\u201dShe stopped answering phone calls and only answered a reporter\u2019s call on Thursday after hearing part of the voice mail. \u201cI\u2019m done talking,\u201d she said.But then Ms. Cochran went on to say that the bulk of the negative responses were factually wrong. She had a permit from the state to shoot the alligator, which is allowed where she lives, Polk County, during a hunting season this year from Sept. 10 to 30. Before her permit was approved, a state wildlife biologist surveyed her ranch, as required by law, she said.Her story went viral with help from a video posted on Facebook. In the video, which was taken offline on Thursday, Ms. Cochran steadied the rifle while standing on the edge of a pond on her ranch. Her son-in-law next to her pulled the gator to the water\u2019s surface with a rope.\u201cNana, you better hit him good, because that\u2019s that horse-eater,\u201d the son-in-law, Scott Hughes, told her before she shot. \u201cGet him right behind the brain.\u201dSome of the responses accused Ms. Cochran of abusing the alligator by tying a rope around it. But Ms. Cochran noted on Thursday that the alligator did not have a rope around it and that it was a line with bait, reportedly a dead raccoon. This is a standard way to hunt alligators; she compared it to catching a fish.Despite the criticism, Ms. Cochran said she was glad she killed the alligator. After all, she believes it ate her prized miniature horse.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Do Christians Fit Into the Two-Party System? They Don\u2019t", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe historical Christian positions on social issues don\u2019t match up with contemporary political alignments.Mr. Keller is the founder of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York.What should the role of Christians in politics be? More people than ever are asking that question. Christians cannot pretend they can transcend politics and simply \u201cpreach the Gospel.\u201d Those who avoid all political discussions and engagement are essentially casting a vote for the social status quo. American churches in the early 19th century that did not speak out against slavery because that was what we would now call \u201cgetting political\u201d were actually supporting slavery by doing so. To not be political is to be political.The Bible shows believers as holding important posts in pagan governments \u2014 think of Joseph and Daniel in the Old Testament. Christians should be involved politically as a way of loving our neighbors, whether they believe as we do or not. To work for better public schools or for a justice system not weighted against the poor or to end racial segregation requires political engagement. Christians have done these things in the past and should continue to do so.One is that it gives those considering the Christian faith the strong impression that to be converted, they need not only to believe in Jesus but also to become members of the (fill in the blank) Party. It confirms what many skeptics want to believe about religion \u2014 that it is merely one more voting bloc aiming for power.Another reason not to align the Christian faith with one party is that most political positions are not matters of biblical command but of practical wisdom. This does not mean that the church can never speak on social, economic and political realities, because the Bible often does. Racism is a sin, violating the second of the two great commandments of Jesus, to \u201clove your neighbor.\u201d The biblical commands to lift up the poor and to defend the rights of the oppressed are moral imperatives for believers. For individual Christians to speak out against egregious violations of these moral requirements is not optional.However, there are many possible ways to help the poor. Should we shrink government and let private capital markets allocate resources, or should we expand the government and give the state more of the power to redistribute wealth? Or is the right path one of the many possibilities in between? The Bible does not give exact answers to these questions for every time, place and culture.I know of a man from Mississippi who was a conservative Republican and a traditional Presbyterian. He visited the Scottish Highlands and found the churches there as strict and as orthodox as he had hoped. No one so much as turned on a television on a Sunday. Everyone memorized catechisms and Scripture. But one day he discovered that the Scottish Christian friends he admired were (in his view) socialists. Their understanding of government economic policy and the state\u2019s responsibilities was by his lights very left-wing, yet also grounded in their Christian convictions. He returned to the United States not more politically liberal but, in his words, \u201chumbled and chastened.\u201d He realized that thoughtful Christians, all trying to obey God\u2019s call, could reasonably appear at different places on the political spectrum, with loyalties to different political strategies.Another reason Christians these days cannot allow the church to be fully identified with any particular party is the problem of what the British ethicist James Mumford calls \u201cpackage-deal ethics.\u201d Increasingly, political parties insist that you cannot work on one issue with them if you don\u2019t embrace all of their approved positions.This emphasis on package deals puts pressure on Christians in politics. For example, following both the Bible and the early church, Christians should be committed to racial justice and the poor, but also to the understanding that sex is only for marriage and for nurturing family. One of those views seems liberal and the other looks oppressively conservative. The historical Christian positions on social issues do not fit into contemporary political alignments.The Gospel gives us the resources to love people who reject both our beliefs and us personally. Christians should think of how God rescued them. He did it not by taking power but by coming to earth, losing glory and power, serving and dying on a cross. How did Jesus save? Not with a sword but with nails in his hands.Timothy Keller, founder of the Redeemer Presbyterian churches in New York City, is the author of \u201cProdigal Prophet: Jonah and the Mystery of God\u2019s Mercy,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.Advertisement"}

A furrowed brow and flailing arms were all we had to go on. The grimacing, the way the patient flung his head from side to side \u2014 all of it signified an unvoiced anguish. We tried talking, listening, morphine. His agitation only grew.All cancers have the power to ravage a body, but each assails in distinctive ways. One of the particular cruelties of a cancer of the tongue is its capacity to deprive a person of speech.Some of us thought he must be suffering from terminal agitation, a state of heightened anxiety that sometimes develops as the end of life draws near. But the junior doctor on the team, Nicholas, was convinced that we could unlock the source of our patient\u2019s distress and volunteered to stay behind in the room.When I re-entered the room, the reclining chair that the patient \u2014 a tall, angular man in his 80s \u2014 had been thrashing around in had been turned to face out onto the garden and the double doors were open wide. Now he sat calmly, transfixed by the trees and sky. All he had wanted was that view.For a decade, I have worked as a doctor in Britain\u2019s National Health Service. We are an overstretched, underfunded health service in which too few doctors and nurses labor with too few resources, struggling to deliver good care. Burnout among staff is endemic, so much so that it threatens to stifle the kindness and compassion that should be the bedrock of medicine. But then there are the moments when helping someone is easy: Just nature is enough.Before I specialized in palliative care, I thought the sheer vitality of nature might be an affront to patients so close to the end of life \u2014 a kind of impudent abundance. And yet, in the hospice where I work, I am often struck by the intense solace some patients find in the natural world.I met Diane Finch, a patient, in May, on the day her oncologist broke the devastating news that further palliative chemotherapy was no longer an option. She was 51. From that point on, her terminal breast cancer would run its natural course, medicine powerless to arrest it.\u201cMy first thought, my urge, was to get up and find an open space,\u201d she told me on that first meeting. \u201cI needed to breathe fresh air, to hear natural noises away from the hospital and its treatment rooms.\u201d At first she fought to preserve herself digitally, documenting every thought and feeling on her computer before they, and she, were lost forever. But one day, as she was typing frantically, she heard a bird singing through her open window.\u201cWhen you come to the end of your life, you get the sense that you don\u2019t want to lose yourself, you want to be able to pass something on,\u201d she told me later. \u201cWhen I had whole brain radiotherapy, I felt as though something had dropped out, as if everything I said needed to be saved. It was all running away from me. \u201cSomehow, when I listened to the song of a blackbird in the garden, I found it incredibly calming. It seemed to allay that fear that everything was going to disappear, to be lost forever, because I thought, \u2018Well, there will be other blackbirds. Their songs will be pretty similar and it will all be fine.\u2019 And in the same way, there were other people before me with my diagnosis. Other people will have died in the same way I will die. And it\u2019s natural. It\u2019s a natural progression. Cancer is part of nature too, and that is something I have to accept, and learn to live and die with.\u201dMs. Finch recorded a song based on the peace she felt listening to the bird song, and it was enough to bring her some relief from what \u2014 up to that point \u2014 had been almost feverish efforts at self-preservation. Another patient, whom I admitted in July with about a week to live, was mostly concerned that I keep the windows open, so that he could \u201ckeep on feeling the breeze on my face and listening to that blackbird outside.\u201d I rushed to make sure of it.\u201cThings are both more trivial than they ever were, and more important than they ever were, and the difference between the trivial and the important doesn\u2019t seem to matter. But the nowness of everything is absolutely wondrous,\u201d he told an interviewer.People often imagine hospices to be dark and dismal places where there is nothing left to experience but dying. But what dominates my work is not proximity to death but the best bits of living. Nowness is everywhere. Nature provides it.Advertisement"}

It undulates up to a dead mackerel on a stick, thoughtfully lowered by scientists from the surface, and snaps its jaws.This is a species of snailfish, and it\u2019s never been seen before by human eyes. Snailfish look like fat, short eels and live all over the ocean, from shallow rock pools to the deepest trenches. This one, named the blue snailfish by its discoverers, lives at the bottom of the Atacama Trench, a great gash in the ocean floor nearly five miles deep off the coast of Chile and Peru.The group from Newcastle University that observed it winched a lander, including a camera, the dead mackerel and other gear down into the depths this spring. Now the group has announced at this week\u2019s Challenger Conference for Marine Science that they also discovered two additional species of snailfish, called for now the pink and purple snailfishes.The snailfish of the deep ocean is a strange beast. For one thing, it\u2019s quite mushy.\u201cThe tissue is almost entirely gel,\u201d said Thomas Linley, a research associate at Newcastle University who worked on the project. \u201cThey are really supported by the water around them.\u201dTheir teeth and the tiny bones in the inner ear are the hardest parts of their bodies, and bringing snailfish up from the depths can feel like an exercise in futility. Without the pressure of the water and the chill of the deep ocean, they appear to melt on reaching the surface.\u201cThey fall apart at like the molecular level,\u201d Dr. Linley said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ghost thing that\u2019s disappearing in front of your eyes.\u201dThat makes it all the more exciting that the team managed to trap a purple snailfish. They have kept the body in a carefully controlled environment for further study.The discoveries confirm a hunch the team had that if you look in any given deep ocean trench, there will be at least one new species of snailfish.So far, the same group has discovered the Mariana snailfish and the ethereal snailfish in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, and there is a specialized snailfish species in Kermadec Trench in the South Pacific as well.This may be because shallow-water snailfish gain adaptations that let them thrive in the deepest ocean, where they have plenty of prey. But then, because of these physiological changes, the fish find themselves unable to rise to higher levels to leave, and thus are never seen by humans.\u201cIt\u2019s a good choice to make, but it\u2019s quite a commitment. It\u2019s buying rather than renting,\u201d said Dr. Linley of adapting to trench living.The group has yet to publish a paper on these new findings, but they are working to document the purple snailfish specimen in greater detail. Photographs and CT scans of the body come first, as it is so fragile.\u201cWe\u2019re really taking our time, because we\u2019ve only got one,\u201d Dr. Linley said.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of the headline with this article misstated the color assigned to a new species of snailfish. As the article correctly described, it is pink, not red.An earlier version of this article misstated how scientists lowered camera and other gear in the Atacama Trench. The equipment went into the trench in a free fall, it was not lowered on a cable.Advertisement"}

Just ask Alison Roman. (She asks her butcher.)One of the most cherished relationships I\u2019ve developed since moving to my new neighborhood in Brooklyn is with the butchers at my local meat shop. They\u2019re always happy to see me, sneak me a snack of whatever cured meat they\u2019re slicing, and offer me the best, most honest opinion when it comes to what type of meat I should be buying. Ever hear of \u201cthe right tool for the right job\u201d? Well, there\u2019s also a right steak for the right dish. A good butcher will help you find it. After taking it home, searing it and realizing it was almost better than the expensive steak I usually spring for, I felt as if my butcher and I were in on a secret \u2014 an affordable, delicious secret, usually known only to small, charming bistros and neighborhood restaurants. Now, every time I walk into the shop, I like to ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite cut of steak today?\u201d \u2014 especially if they happen to be out of hanger steak (which they can sometimes be: There\u2019s only one per animal, making it a more exclusive cut). This is how I was introduced to other supertasty, affordable cuts that could be seared and served rare, like boneless short ribs (no braise required), thicker pieces of flank (avoid thinner pieces, which can overcook) and bavette (the bottom part of the sirloin).These cuts will vary, depending on where you live, the type of butcher shop or meat counter in your area, and general availability. It may seem obvious, but opening up the conversation and talking to an actual human not only got me out of my rut of buying the same two types of steak over and over again; it also provided me with expert tips that definitely made me a better cook.If it\u2019s a new cut I\u2019m bringing home, I like to season it simply, with nothing more than kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to truly assess its unadulterated steak flavor. From there, I give it the faux-bistro treatment with a garlicky salsa verde and a bowl of almost-too-salty potato chips, which one could argue are essentially weeknight French fries. (That means you just made steak frites.)For the salsa verde, I love using dark leafy greens, like kale, mustard greens or Swiss chard. I find that resting a seared piece of steak on a bed of these hearty leaves wilts and softens them into submission, almost as if you had quickly saut\u00e9ed them. Also great are the juices from the meat that season the salsa verde, creating a deeply savory, meaty sauce that tastes like you spent way more time on it than you did. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Last Butterfly", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Eastern monarch is in trouble, and this is the time to help (no science degree needed).Contributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 A monarch butterfly\u2019s chrysalis is one of the most beautiful things in nature. Bright emerald green and flecked with gold, it is an exquisite jewel that contains within it an even more exquisite promise. The day before a monarch emerges, its chrysalis turns dark, almost black, but if you hold a light up to it, you can see the shape of vivid orange wings inside. The wings are lined with black veins like stained-glass windows in a cathedral. They are still tightly folded, but they hold, in miniature, the shape of an adult butterfly\u2019s wings. At this stage, it\u2019s possible to tell the butterfly\u2019s gender even before it emerges from the chrysalis, just by looking at the thickness of those black veins framing the folded wings.As a species, the Eastern monarch \u2014 an iconic butterfly that migrates 3,000 miles every year \u2014 is in serious trouble. A changing climate is part of the problem, imperiling the monarch\u2019s Mexican wintering grounds and spawning extreme weather events that can destroy millions of migrating butterflies. And pesticide drift can poison caterpillars even when they aren\u2019t the targeted pest. Monarch caterpillars are never targeted, in fact, because monarchs are important pollinators that don\u2019t eat crops or damage gardens. Their caterpillars eat only milkweed, which was once ubiquitous along American roadsides and in the margins between fields on small farms. The biggest danger to the monarch butterfly is the disappearance of milkweed because of habitat destruction and the widespread use of herbicides, like Roundup, by both commercial farms and state highway departments. Raising monarchs inside a climate-controlled family room is a fascinating hobby, but it isn\u2019t the way to save the species. The butterflies I released this year, even combined with the thousands and thousands of butterflies released by dedicated monarch stewards across the country, will make little difference in a population still so far short of sustainable numbers. What the monarch needs to survive is more milkweed.And there was plenty of room to double that number, particularly if more people planted milkweed in their own backyards and flower beds. \u201cIn many ways, if you plant it, they will come,\u201d Dr. Lewis told NPR. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful, almost-instant gratification that people feel and are empowered by in order to make a difference.\u201dI had to try several varieties before settling on two that require no coddling or care at all. Ultimately the monarchs did come and lay eggs in my garden. Each monarch female lays as many as 500 eggs in her short lifetime because, as with most insects, survival depends on profligacy. Monarch caterpillars can fall prey to predators, parasites and diseases, but if there\u2019s enough milkweed to sustain them, at least some of the caterpillars will ultimately survive to form a chrysalis.By last week, I had released 10 healthy monarchs, but I had yet to see a butterfly emerge from its chrysalis. It is an amazing thing to watch a caterpillar egg hatch (the baby so tiny it takes a magnifying glass to be sure a hatching is actually taking place), and it is equally amazing to watch a full-grown caterpillar spin and contort as it shrugs off its skin and forms a chrysalis. But the miracle of all miracles has to be the emergence itself, and it happens so quickly it\u2019s easy to miss.Finally, last Monday, with the very last chrysalis of the year, I saw it. What a gift it was to watch a monarch butterfly break through its shell, crawl out, and unfold its wings. What an unutterable gift to watch as its proboscis unfurls, to watch as its delicate legs cling to the spent chrysalis, as fluid fills its wings and it begins to take on the shape of the most recognizable butterfly in the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lasker Awards Given for Work in Genetics, Anesthesia and Promoting Women in Science", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe coveted prize was awarded to a Scottish veterinarian, two scientists who championed an overlooked protein and a pioneering researcher who helped advance the careers of other women.The awards are given by the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation and carry a prize of $250,000 for each of three categories. They are sometimes called the \u201cAmerican Nobels\u201d because 87 of the Lasker recipients have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.He developed the drug propofol, now a widely used anesthetic that has transformed surgery.Dr. Glen, the recipient of the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, is only the second veterinarian to win a Lasker in 73 years, according to the foundation.A pharmaceutical career was an unlikely path for Dr. Glen, but the fact that he was interested in anesthesia was no surprise: for years, he had taught the subject to students at Glasgow University\u2019s veterinary school. \u201cI was anesthetizing dogs, cats, horses \u2014 whatever animals came around,\u201d Dr. Glen said in an interview. Once he used anesthesia on a pelican to fix its beak.In lab tests on mice, he and his colleagues discovered that one of the company\u2019s existing compounds, propofol, seemed to work as well as thiopentone but wore off quickly, without the hangover effect of the earlier drug. Propofol was approved in 1986 in the United Kingdom and in the United States three years later. The drug, known as the \u201cmilk of amnesia\u201d because of its milky consistency, has since been used by hundreds of millions of patients and is credited with leading to the rapid expansion of outpatient surgery because patients recover so quickly.\u201cIt was never intended to be used in that way,\u201d Dr. Glen said. But of the drug\u2019s broader success, he said, \u201cI\u2019m delighted that it has become so widely used.\u201dShe became a champion of women in her field and trained nearly 200 future scientists.Dr. Steitz, the recipient of the Lasker-Koshland Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science, said winning the award is particularly significant because it signals how far she has come since her days as an undergraduate lab technician in the early 1960s. \u201cWhen I started out being excited by science \u2014 but seeing that there weren\u2019t any women scientists \u2014 I thought I had no prospects whatsoever,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThe one thing that I really wanted was to have the respect of my peers for the scientific contributions I made, and for my participation in the scientific community.\u201dOne of her biggest discoveries was particles made up of RNA molecules and proteins, known as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, or snRNPs for short. They\u2019re scattered throughout cells and among other things, they help cut messenger RNA into pieces, some of which get pasted back together. This process, called splicing, is essential to the process of making proteins from genes. This discovery led to an entire new field of research in cell biology.Of the 360 papers that have come from her laboratory, 60 do not include her name, \u201ca gesture of generosity that reflects her belief that students and postdoctoral fellows who work completely independently should be allowed to publish on their own,\u201d according to the Lasker foundation\u2019s citation.In an interview, Dr. Steitz downplayed this detail. She said in her early days running her own lab, she frequently left her name off papers because she was following in the scientific tradition she had learned as a young researcher. As for her role as an activist, \u201cI sort of feel a little embarrassed by that, because there are so many women that have done so much more,\u201d she said. What she has done, she said is to be \u201ca good citizen and try to help women and other underrepresented people to fulfill their potential.\u201dThey took a new look at a protein once considered the \u201cpacking material\u201d of DNA.\u201cI went into the field thinking, everyone\u2019s working on gene activity, I want to work on packing material,\u201d Dr. Grunstein said in a video produced by the Lasker foundation. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go the direction everyone else was going in.\u201dWhat Dr. Grunstein and Dr. Allis discovered is that, in fact, histones play a crucial role in turning genes on and off, which allows each cell to do its assigned task. The two worked separately, Dr. Grunstein focusing on genetics, and Dr. Allis on biochemical processes.While their award is for basic science, the practical implications for their discoveries are profound. \u201cMistakes in setting this up seem to be very clearly causing cancer,\u201d Dr. Allis said in the video.Drug developers used the evolving understanding of histones to come up with new treatments, including to treat cancer, such as Zolinza, sold by Merck. More are in the pipeline. \u201cIt\u2019s spawned really a whole new area of potential therapies in humans, and that\u2019s pretty rewarding,\u201d Dr. Allis said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brett Kavanaugh and the Limits of Certainty", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy revisiting the political scandals of the 1990s should temper partisanship today.Opinion ColumnistIt\u2019s still possible that we will get more decisive clarity in the question of whether the young Brett Kavanaugh was a predator and would-be rapist, and whether the older Brett Kavanaugh is a perjurer today.Perhaps a third or fourth accuser will come forward bearing stories that have more corroboration and less haze around them than the accusations published in The New Yorker \u2014 whose thinness, tacitly acknowledged in the piece itself, have so far mostly persuaded conservatives that this is all a partisan smear.Perhaps there are witnesses from the early 1980s we have yet to hear from, who can either confirm Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s story or make the case for another explanation for her memory of trauma.Perhaps something revelatory will happen in the hearings when Blasey and Kavanaugh get to offer their accusations and defense.But it\u2019s also quite possible that what we know now is roughly what we\u2019ll know when all of this is over. In which case we can expect that normal people (probably a third of our increasingly deranged country, and shrinking fast) will maintain a radical uncertainty about Kavanaugh\u2019s guilt and innocence, while everyone else \u2014 the professional partisans, the political junkies, the Extremely Online, the kind of people who read newspaper op-eds \u2014 will bear a powerful certainty, a nearly-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt conviction, about who\u2019s lying and who\u2019s telling the truth.I\u2019m going to talk briefly about why such certainty can be misguided, without talking about any of the details of the Kavanaugh case. Instead I\u2019ll talk about the two great sex-and-politics tangles of my adolescence, the Bill Clinton and the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill scandals.I grew up with Northeastern liberals, went to high school with Northeastern liberals, attended college with Northeastern liberals, and so most people that I knew in my teens and 20s maintained two firm convictions: Bill Clinton was just a consensual philanderer railroaded by awful puritanical Republicans, and Hill was obviously telling the truth and Thomas was obviously a pornography-obsessed sexual harasser.At the same time from late adolescence onward I identified as a conservative, wrote as a conservative in college and hung out with conservatives in Washington, which meant that I was frequently in worlds where Clinton was regarded as a predator and likely rapist who deserved to be impeached and where Thomas\u2019s innocence and Hill\u2019s duplicity were articles of faith.I\u2019m sorry that this sounds so preachy, but something can be preachy and still true.But then it\u2019s also true that in other cases, the perspective of decades doesn\u2019t make one side\u2019s certainty crumble, doesn\u2019t lead to a re-evaluation, because the evidence available just isn\u2019t dispositive enough to make that happen.But in fact only one of those three women, Angela Wright, was actually alleging harassment; the second was confirming that Wright had told her that Thomas hit on her, the third was alleging generally that Thomas created a sexualized atmosphere at work \u2014 a claim contested by 12 other female witnesses who had worked with him. And Wright was not a particularly credible witness. Even Mayer and Abramson conceded that \u201cher files contained ample ammunition for anyone trying to embarrass her,\u201d including a checkered workplace history in which she was fired by a congressman\u2019s office, resigned from a State Department job and immediately accused her boss of racism, and then was fired by Thomas himself for poor performance, after which she reportedly told a friend that she was \u201cpissed\u201d and wanted \u201cto get him back.\u201dWhich doesn\u2019t mean that she was necessarily lying when she claimed Thomas had made persistent and sometimes lewd advances; it just means that she was not some slam-dunk, Hill-vindicating witness, but someone whose testimony would have raised lots of reasonable doubts.But does all of this add up to a clear vindication of Thomas? No, I don\u2019t think so. There were weaknesses in Hill\u2019s testimony but no clear motive for such a dramatic fabrication, Mayer and Abramson found witnesses from Thomas\u2019s workplace who had heard about the famous \u201cpubic hair on a Coke\u201d can line that he denied uttering, there was plausible testimony as well hearsay that he had a pornography habit of some sort \u2026 I could go on.My own sense, when I wade back into the \u201che said, she said\u201d detail, is that neither of their testimonies were entirely believable, and that there\u2019s some missing piece of the story that may never come to light. But that\u2019s pure supposition, rather than something that I would stake myself to with any sort of certainty.Again, I apologize for the lecturing tone. Now back to your corners for the hearings.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pinterest Is a Unicorn. It Just Doesn\u2019t Act Like One.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ben Silbermann does not enjoy being interviewed. He isn\u2019t a fan of speaking at tech industry conferences. Nor does he like sitting for glossy magazine portraits. He doesn\u2019t think he should have to explain Pinterest, the web service that allows people to save images to virtual pinboards, to anyone other than those who want to use it.That is the case even in the last couple of years, when Pinterest and Mr. Silbermann, its co-founder and chief executive, could have been shouting the company\u2019s virtues from the rooftops.Its peers, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been drowning in toxic harassment, fake news and Russian disinformation campaigns. Critics have denounced social media-induced anxiety and addiction.Pinterest, by Mr. Silbermann\u2019s design, is the opposite: the web\u2019s last bastion of quaint innocence. Having de-emphasized its social media elements years ago, Pinterest aims to be a safe and happy place for inspiration, self-improvement and salted caramel cookie recipes. It also rejects Silicon Valley\u2019s typical unicorn formula of moving fast, breaking things, chasing growth at all costs and bragging about every victory.But the reserved, slow and steady approach has long frustrated some investors and employees, who believe that it has neutered growth, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with or for the company. Many of those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the company\u2019s private affairs.Matt Novak, a partner at All Blue Capital, said his firm was trying to sell its stake in Pinterest, which the firm acquired on the secondary market, because it had not lived up to its potential.\u201cIf they don\u2019t keep up, they very quickly become prehistoric,\u201d said Mr. Novak, who would not disclose the size of his firm\u2019s stake in Pinterest.And yet despite Mr. Silbermann\u2019s approach \u2014 or maybe because of it \u2014 the company is worth $12.3 billion and growth is accelerating. In the past week, the company crossed a new milestone \u2014 250 million monthly active users. Those users have pinned 175 billion items on 3 billion virtual pinboards. The company is on track to top $700 million in revenue this year, a 50 percent increase over last year, according to a person familiar with the company. There is wide speculation that it will go public next year.If Pinterest continues its trajectory, it could change the narrative of what it takes to build a successful company in Silicon Valley, a meaningful feat at a time that the start-up world is seeking new templates for leaders. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll serve as another example of wasted potential, or worse, a cautionary tale.\u201cI tell them, \u2018You have to tell your story, especially now,\u201d said Scott Belsky, an entrepreneur who was an early investor in Pinterest.Mr. Belsky said, \u201cHe is so comfortable being misunderstood and underestimated.\u201dWhen Mr. Silberman was asked about his limited public profile in a recent interview, he noted with a hint of exasperation that he was right there, talking to me for this article.\u201cThat\u2019s something!\u201d he said.Tech companies usually reflect the personalities of their founders. Mark Zuckerberg infused Facebook with a \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d hacker mentality. Uber\u2019s founder, Travis Kalanick, pushed a \u201ctoe-steppin\u2019\u201d and \u201chustling\u201d culture at Uber.Mr. Silbermann, 36, grew up in Des Moines in a family of doctors and assumed he\u2019d also go to medical school. But his first encounter with high-speed internet, at Yale in 1999, changed his mind. \u201cYou could find your people there and really explore inside yourself,\u201d he said.He has tried to instill that same thinking at the company. Pinterest values \u201cknitting,\u201d a term its employees use to describe collaboration among groups. \u201cWe believe innovation happens when disciplines knit,\u201d the company\u2019s website says.In the beginning, when Pinterest was desperate to hire engineers as quickly as possible, Mr. Silbermann screened potential hires for their values before even considering their technical skills.Mr. Silbermann is someone who \u201cmeasures twice, cuts once,\u201d said Rick Heitzmann, a managing director at FirstMark Capital and early investor in Pinterest.\u201cPerfectionist doesn\u2019t overstate it,\u201d said Jeff Jordan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Pinterest board member.Pinterest\u2019s offices in San Francisco display the sort of cutesy, self-referential bric-a-brac that\u2019s common at start-ups \u2014 a giant statue of a pushpin made of Legos, a Pinterest surfboard. But Mr. Silbermann\u2019s demeanor is serious and reserved. In conversation, he listens carefully and responds with earnest sincerity, qualifying statements as his own opinion, rather than declaring them as facts.He also doesn\u2019t focus on Pinterest\u2019s image in the business world. Instead, he dedicates an outsize amount of time to meeting with Pinterest users, going on six tours a year and holding weekly lunches at Pinterest\u2019s offices. That\u2019s a meaningful time commitment for the chief executive of a 1,500-person organization.If Pinterest addresses the needs and desires of its users, he said, \u201cthe business will take care of itself.\u201dPinterest has always confounded Silicon Valley insiders. Its first users were not teenagers \u2014 the typical early adopters of digital services \u2014 but Midwestern women. And Mr. Silbermann and his co-founder, Evan Sharp, were not engineers, a prerequisite for many venture capital investors.\u201cFrom the beginning, this company did things differently from how most storybook Silicon Valley companies have operated,\u201d said Jeremy Levine, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, Pinterest\u2019s largest shareholder.The business case was simple and powerful: It was a shopping mall disguised as a mood board that held its users\u2019 aspirations, unearthing pure and unfiltered commercial desire. \u201cYou can draw a direct line from those interests to a commercial opportunity or retail category,\u201d said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at eMarketer.But just as the company began selling ads in 2014, user growth stalled and it wasn\u2019t clear why, according to multiple people familiar with the company. The company disagreed that growth had stalled, arguing that it had \u201cslightly slowed.\u201dExecutives on Pinterest\u2019s \u201cgrowth\u201d team proposed spending $50 million a year to acquire users through marketing, a common tactic for web companies. Other executives argued that the company should court celebrities and pay influencers to share content on Pinterest, similar to YouTube\u2019s premium content program.Mr. Silbermann opposed both, according to people familiar with the decision. He preferred what he called \u201cquality growth.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a natural rate at which you can scale a company that\u2019s healthy,\u201d Mr. Silbermann said. So Pinterest stuck to its knitting.Not everyone was sold on the message. Even by the standards of start-ups, where employee turnover is common, the number of executives leaving Pinterest has been notable in recent years. Since 2015, the company lost people who ran media partnerships, operations, finance, growth, engineering, brand, product, tech partnerships, marketing, corporate development, communications and customer strategy, along with its general counsel and president. Jamie Favazza, a Pinterest spokeswoman, said, \u201cTurnover is natural at high-growth start-ups, but we\u2019ve built a strong team of leaders for the long-term.\u201dSome former executives argue that the company should have hired salespeople faster. Several ex-employees say morale would have been better if Pinterest had taken big swings on hype-worthy cutting-edge tech, like Snap\u2019s camera-embedded sunglasses, introduced in 2016.But those glasses, called Spectacles, became a costly punch line. And unlike most of its money-losing start-up peers, Pinterest, with $1.5 billion in venture backing, has flirted with breaking even in recent quarters, according to the company.What Pinterest\u2019s critics identify as negatives (conservative decision-making, less urgency, squandered opportunities), its supporters cite as positives (bullets dodged, wasted time avoided).As a result, conversations about Pinterest tend to raise fundamental questions about the nature of success in Silicon Valley.\u201cI want to believe that more thoughtful, slower growth is better,\u201d said Tracy Chou, a former Pinterest engineer. \u201cBut the examples that are very visible seem to suggest that really aggressive growth wins, at least in the near term.\u201dInvestors and former executives say that Pinterest has rallied in the past year under a new chief operating officer, Francoise Brougher, and a new head of sales, Jon Kaplan, both formerly of Google.Pinterest\u2019s founders \u201chave this look in their eye like this is working now,\u201d said Mr. Belsky, the early investor.The company has accelerated growth in users, up 27 percent over last year. More than half of all users now come from international markets. That change happened after the company realized it needed to promote local content, not what was popular in the United States, to new users in each region. (British users did not respond to American Crock-Pot recipes, it turns out.)Revenue growth is also picking up, which Mr. Kaplan attributed to having the right measurement data to show brands that ads on Pinterest are effective. The company has hired more salespeople, introduced more ad options and refocused on small- and medium-size advertisers. It is preparing to start selling ads in non-English speaking countries, starting with France.The company is even trying to raise its profile a little bit, hiring a new chief marketing officer and coming up with a new marketing plan to emphasize the service\u2019s benefits. Ms. Brougher said she, like Mr. Silbermann, prefers to under-promise and over-deliver. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t always work well in the tech world,\u201d she said.Mr. Silbermann said, \u201cIn technology, people are very, very fast to declare something a winner or loser, like, \u2018That\u2019ll never work,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019ll take over the world.\u2019 The truth is always somewhere in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Kavanaugh Accusations Mean for Red-State Democrats", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThings just got a lot more complicated for Joe Manchin.I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s that simple. Assuming Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is not withdrawn and the Republicans continue to fight for him, these three Democrats and possibly one or two others will still find themselves in a tough position. In fact, if a couple of Republicans defect from Judge Kavanaugh, these Democrats will be in an even tougher spot than before. Imagine this hypothetical. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, the two Republican senators who are under the most pressure to oppose confirmation, decide to do so. That takes Judge Kavanaugh down to 49 votes. Game over.Except maybe not. At that point, Republicans, far from accepting defeat, will surely start aiming fire at the three Democrats. Their opponents will taunt them about Judge Kavanaugh on the campaign trail. Right-wing money will pour in to their states for pro-Kavanaugh (and pro-Trump) TV ads. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, will let this play out and may schedule the vote for as late as he can \u2014 mid-October, even late October \u2014 to make the Democrats sweat.That will constitute enormous pressure on the red-state Democrats. If they sense their opponents are gaining steam, they may well think: Why should I cast a vote that\u2019s going to cost me my seat? Especially when even if we defeat Judge Kavanaugh, we\u2019re just going to get someone else who\u2019s every bit as conservative?If one of them moves to a pro-Kavanaugh position, it\u2019s likely that all three will move. Here\u2019s why. There is a standing agreement among minority parties in the Senate that in such situations, no one wants to be the 50th vote. The lone senator who provides the 50th vote can be blamed and reviled. But if all three move together, then one of them can\u2019t be singled out as having cast the dreaded 50th vote. This is one big reason there are so few 50-to-50 votes in the Senate. In fact, when one side sees it has lost, a couple other senators who can afford to cast the vote will often join in to give their colleagues cover.Beginning to see how this works?Now imagine a second scenario. Imagine that Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski vote no, but this time they are joined by two other Republicans, Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee. Now, Judge Kavanaugh is down to 47 votes. And more important, the air will be out of his balloon, emotionally. At that point, I think the three Democrats will be fully off the hook.If all this is maddening to you, I can\u2019t say I blame you. Why don\u2019t they just do the right thing?Well, sure. But here it gets more complicated still. What\u2019s the right thing?The Democrats, say the experts, now have a chance of recapturing control of the Senate. Their candidates are looking good in Nevada and Arizona and are competitive in Tennessee and even Texas.That majority would hinge on winning three of those four seats. But it would also depend on red-state senators like Mr. Donnelly, Ms. Heitkamp and Mr. Manchin holding theirs. Voting against Judge Kavanaugh might jeopardize that.In the long run, what\u2019s better: the Democrats helping to confirm Judge Kavanaugh and winning a majority, or standing firm against him but remaining the minority?Many would say it doesn\u2019t have to come down to those two choices, and they\u2019re right. All this is unknowable. In the Democrats\u2019 dream world, they defeat Judge Kavanaugh, win the majority, block the Republicans from getting a nominee through in the lame-duck session and then keep the seat open for two years. That could happen, too!Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "H.I.V. Drugs Cost $75 in Africa, $39,000 in the U.S. Does It Matter? ", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesIn the United States, pharmaceutical companies have built a system which supports high costs for H.I.V. drugs. But that may be starting to change.First of two articlesThe high cost of drugs contributes to this failure. Our big problem in America is that too many people with H.I.V. don\u2019t know they have it. Drugs can\u2019t solve that. It requires humans \u2014 to find people, win their trust, bring them into the health care system and help them deal with other issues (such as substance abuse) so they can handle getting tested. \u201cWe have a trade-off,\u201d said Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner for disease control in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. \u201cNew York City and New York State are a bit of a wonderland \u2014 we\u2019re resourced very well compared to other places. But even we have limits to what we can do \u2014 because of spending on drugs.\u201d\u201cWhenever I hear that, I pretty much have a seizure,\u201d said Dr. Daskalakis. \u201cThat we are going to be able to scale up all over the world is amazing. But in the meanwhile, people in the U.S. have problems staying on medicines because of our crazy system.\u201dThe crazy system exists because until very recently, there has been virtually no price competition in H.I.V. drugs. But we are seeing the first attempts to control the galloping cost of treating H.I.V.UnitedHealthcare, one of the biggest insurance companies in America, is experimenting with a different way to control costs. Beginning this fall, it will encourage patients it covers to choose a less expensive H.I.V. therapy. In its My ScriptRewards program, patients who choose the cheaper H.I.V. regimen will have no co-pay or co-insurance costs, and can get $500 in gift cards to use for other health care expenses.Why now? \u201cThere are new options in the market,\u201d according to Lida Etemad, who is vice president for pharmacy management services at UnitedHealthcare. \u201cThere are recommended regimes at a lower cost than we\u2019ve seen.\u201dShe\u2019s talking about new drugs from Mylan \u2014 the generic manufacturer that achieved infamy for the $600 EpiPen in 2016. Mylan is the world\u2019s biggest manufacturer of generic H.I.V. drugs. This year the company brought out three new H.I.V. medicines in the United States, with prices pegged at 40 percent below the equivalent brand-name drugs.Mylan also makes three-drug combos, Symfi (equivalent to Atripla, which costs $32,000) and lower-dose Symfi Lo. At 40 percent less, the two Symfi combinations cost $19,200.\u201cLower cost\u201d is relative \u2014 obviously, these prices are pretty far from $75. But generic competition slashes prices only when there are many competitors. The usual price drop with the first generic is small \u2014 15 percent or less. (The Mylan drugs are not technically generics, because they are new single-pill combinations of existing generic drugs, not exact copies of existing drugs.)The United States spends about $20 billion a year on H.I.V. drugs. Anil Soni, the head of global infectious diseases for Mylan, said that if generics and lower-cost H.I.V. medicines \u2014 made by Mylan and other companies \u2014 were incorporated into treatment regimens, America could save between $3 billion and $5 billion, with about $1 billion of that savings accruing to Medicare and Medicaid.Mr. Soni has experience in public health unusual for a drug company executive. He was the chief of staff to the first leader of the Global Fund and later chief executive of the Clinton Health Access Initiative. At Mylan, he negotiated the agreement to supply the $75 therapy in low-income countries.Someone might say: Let\u2019s prescribe both generics and we\u2019ll save $18,000 off the cost of Truvada!The same is true for Mylan\u2019s three-drug combos. The cost of the three generic drugs in Symfi and Symfi Lo is $12,000. Prescribing those individual drugs instead of Atripla would mean taking three pills instead of one \u2014 and saving $20,000.No one has.Pharmaceutical companies have built a system in which no one in a position to limit costs wants to do so.The federal panel on antiretroviral guidelines now does include references to drug costs, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a guidelines panel member. \u201cBut the first-line regimens recommended still favor the absolute best \u2014 and often most expensive \u2014 drugs available. It\u2019s \u2018if this were my dad, what would I want him to have?\u2019\u201d she said.Insurers should care about price. But it\u2019s hard for them to refuse to cover a recommended drug, and they can pass their costs along in the form of higher premiums.Taxpayers should care about price; after all, health care represents 18 percent of the national economy. But the industry has proved too powerful.Drugmakers have designed a system in which parties that would otherwise campaign for cheaper drugs actually have an interest in high prices. For example, clinics that serve H.I.V. patients also, perversely, benefit from high prices. Their pharmacies can buy drugs at Medicaid prices. But if a patient has commercial insurance, they can bill the insurer at commercial prices.Most important are the distorted incentives for patients. Super-organized, savvy patient groups all over the world banded together to make H.I.V. medicines affordable in poor countries.But in the United States, virtually no one on antiretrovirals has to pay for them. For those without private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, the Ryan White AIDS Drug Assistance Program steps in. No other disease has such a program.If patients have high out-of-pocket costs, such as co-pays and co-insurances, makers of brand-name H.I.V. drugs help patients. (Mylan is doing this, too, with its new drugs.) It\u2019s smart business \u2014 small payments that increase sales of very expensive drugs.Generic medicines don\u2019t normally come with co-pay assistance. So patients could end up paying more out of pocket for a $1,000 generic than for a $30,000 brand-name drug. Along with the inconvenience of multiple-pill regimens, this is a big reason generics aren\u2019t much used.Mr. Horn believes things are changing. \u201cCost considerations are becoming considerable factors in H.I.V. care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s high time. We\u2019re on the cusp of something.\u201dThat something, however, carries perils, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a complex patchwork in place. We want to make sure everybody continues to have access to prescription drugs and services.\u201dNext week: I\u2019ll report on how some places have been able to keep H.I.V. drug costs in check while doing right by patients.

{"Headline": "The Credit Crunch and the Great Recession (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBen Bernanke argues that it was mainly about finance. I have (friendly) questions.Opinion ColumnistOK, this is weird. There\u2019s an economic dispute underway about the causes of the Great Recession \u2014 but that\u2019s not what\u2019s weird. What\u2019s so strange in these days and times is that it is being carried out among well-informed people who actually look at data and argue in good faith. Hey, guys, don\u2019t you know that sort of thing went out a couple of decades ago?This isn\u2019t quite a head-on debate, since Bernanke is mainly focused on the first year or so after Lehman, while both Baker and I are more focused on the multiyear depressed economy that lasted long after the financial disruption ended. (Bernanke\u2019s measures show the same spike and fast recovery as other stress indexes.) But there\u2019s still a clear difference.Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be at the Brookings panel where Bernanke\u2019s paper is discussed. But maybe I can raise the big question I have about his conclusions.What Bernanke does is, as I see it, a kind of reduced-form analysis, identifying factors in the credit markets and using time series to estimate their impact on output. What Baker does, and I largely follow, is more of an accounting-based structural analysis: look at the components of aggregate demand, and ask what their behavior seems to imply about causes. In principle, these approaches should be consistent.My problem with Bernanke\u2019s paper, on a first read, is that I don\u2019t quite see how that consistency can work. Specifically, I have trouble seeing the \u201ctransmission mechanism\u201d \u2014 the way in which the financial shock is supposed to have affected actual spending to the extent necessary to justify a finance-first account of the slump.Let me focus specifically on investment, which is what you\u2019d expect a credit crunch to depress \u2014 and which did indeed plunge in the Great Recession. First, there was the housing bust, which led to a huge decline in residential investment, directly subtracting around 4 points from GDP:So can we attribute this decline to credit conditions? If so, why did residential investment remain depressed five years after credit markets normalized?Meanwhile, there was also a sharp decline in nonresidential, i.e., business investment:But this decline was only about the same size as the decline in the early 2000s slump \u2014 which, admittedly, was partly because of the collapse in telecom spending, but still. And it seems pretty easy to explain simply by the accelerator effect: business investment always plunges when the economy is shrinking, which it was doing mainly because of the housing bust.So when I look at these two key drivers of the Great Recession and subsequent depressed period, I don\u2019t see an obvious role for financial disruption. Bernanke\u2019s VARs tell a different story; but I generally don\u2019t trust VARs unless I can relate them to phenomena we see from other perspectives.Could Bernanke be right while Baker and I are wrong? Of course. But I really, really want to see the transmission mechanism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Crazy Poor Middle Easterners", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Middle East could prosper if it would put its past behind it.Opinion ColumnistI greatly enjoyed the movie \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d because, beyond the many laugh lines, it reminded me of an important point: Rich Asia has gotten really rich \u2014 not because it doesn\u2019t have political, tribal, ethnic and religious differences like other regions, but because in more places on more days it learned to set those differences aside and focus on building the real foundations of sustainable wealth: education, trade, infrastructure, human capital and, in the most successful places, the rule of law. Most of Asia became prosperous not by discovering natural resources but by tapping its human resources \u2014 men and women \u2014 and giving them the tools to realize their potential. It got me thinking that if someone were to do a similar movie about the Middle East it could be called \u201cCrazy Poor Middle Easterners.\u201d Because, with a few exceptions, this region has never been a bigger mess, had more people fighting over who owns which olive tree, had more cities turned to rubble by rival sects and missed its potential so vastly. The region of the world that should be naturally rich has made itself poor by repeatedly letting the past bury the future and the region that is naturally poor has made itself rich by letting the future bury the past.Now President Trump says he wants to get out of the Middle East. But America\u2019s real choices there are not stay or go, but be smart or dumb. And Trump has been dumb. He\u2019s subcontracted order-making there to our allies Israel and Saudi Arabia and his pal Vladimir Putin. So now Trump is getting a lesson, as we speak, in what happens when America writes blank checks to allies and pals \u2014 who share some of our interests but also have extreme impulses of their own \u2014 and abdicates real diplomatic leadership.Let\u2019s go to the videotape. Iran has far overstretched itself, extending its malign military and religious influence into Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, where it has reportedly partnered with the Alawite/Shiite regime of Bashar al-Assad to engage in the ethnic cleansing of Sunnis from regions of Syria to be replaced by Shiites. It\u2019s an ugly, ugly business.Israel\u2019s prime minister has smartly built a relationship with Putin over the last three years \u2014 with tens of meetings and phone calls \u2014 to ensure that Israel\u2019s Air Force can operate against Iran in Syria and that Russia keeps the Iranians away from the Israeli border. But even with that, and even though the Israelis have so penetrated Iranian units that Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards land supply planes full of missiles in Damascus at 6 p.m. and Israel blows them up by 8 p.m. \u2014 the Iranians keep trying to turn Syria into a forward missile base against Israel.And on Tuesday, Russia\u2019s Air Force bombed Idlib Province \u2014 the last major gathering center for Islamist anti-regime rebels in Syria and the hundreds of thousands of Sunni refugees who have fled the regime\u2019s poison gas and other attacks.Trump tweeted: \u201cPresident Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don\u2019t let that happen!\u201dAnd what is Trump\u2019s team doing in Israel? First it moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem \u2014 giving the right-wing Israeli government of Bibi Netanyahu a long-coveted prize \u2014 and asked for nothing in return.Trump could have told Bibi that he would move the embassy but only in return for Israel halting all settlement-building beyond the West Bank blocks in the densely populated Arab areas that would likely be put under Palestinian control in any peace deal. That might have actually advanced the peace process. Instead, the U.S. gave up one of its most valuable diplomatic assets free. How foolish was that?Trump thinks he can just keep bludgeoning the Palestinians and never ask Israel to do anything hard and prevent things from getting any worse. Well, yes, they can get worse. The Palestinian Authority can collapse \u2014 and as feckless and corrupt as it may be, if it goes, it will be hard to rebuild; Israel would have to provide all the governance in the West Bank at a huge cost. To repeat: Democracy is not on the agenda in Saudi Arabia, but social, economic and religious reform is. M.B.S.\u2019s government for the first time just appointed women to several key municipality leadership jobs. Considering the hugely damaging role that Saudi Arabia played in the Arab Muslim world, when, post-1979, it began to aggressively spread its puritanical form of Islam \u2014 which helped to seed 9/11 \u2014 the idea that the kingdom has a leader today who might begin to shift Sunni Islam onto a more open and moderate path, one that would isolate radical Islamists and strengthen moderates everywhere, is a huge U.S. interest to nurture. Lately, though, M.B.S. has undertaken a series of ill-considered steps that are hurting him, Saudi Arabia and us. M.B.S. has a few very extreme advisers who keep telling him to follow the \u201cChina model\u201d \u2014 China asserted itself in the South China Sea, the world complained, China responded to get lost, and eventually the world backed down. So when Canada mildly criticized a Saudi Arabian human rights abuse, M.B.S. went nuclear on Canada and virtually broke off relations. It was an absurd overreaction. Saudi Arabia is not China. It needs friends. It needs to be more Dubai than Shanghai \u2014 more soft power, less bullying.Interestingly, last August, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai \u2014 one of the wisest men in the region \u2014 put out a series of tweets that caught many eyes in Saudi. One said the Arab world had \u201ca management crisis, not a crisis of resources. Look at China and Japan \u2026 where they are now, even without natural resources. There are countries that possess oil, gas, water and human capital but lack development and even cannot provide basic services, such as roads and electricity, to their people.\u201dWhatever good publicity M.B.S. got for letting women drive was undermined by his arresting Saudi women driving activists on charges of being related to some anti-Saudi groups in London. Seriously, is Saudi Arabia really threatened by women driving activists? And the Saudi-U.A.E. war in Yemen has been so badly botched by incompetents in the Saudi Air Force that they are now being accused of possible war crimes. The future stability of the whole Arab Gulf depends on the reform process in Saudi succeeding; it\u2019s that important. But it can\u2019t succeed without significant investments by foreigners and Saudis to create a more vibrant and diverse private sector that can offer decent jobs to all the young Saudis, men and women, coming out of universities at home and abroad. M.B.S. remains popular with many of them, but if they can\u2019t find jobs, the religious extremists in Saudi Arabia will find many recruits among them. With so many things that M.B.S. has done in recent months, on the advice of old guard security types around him, he has put politics and security issues ahead of the need to attract investors and talent and ministers ready to take chances and tell him the truth. Each action may have been individually justifiable, but taken together they suggest that he\u2019s lost the plot; he\u2019s creating more uncertainty than respect.And it shows. Bloomberg reported on Aug. 17: According to research by Standard Chartered, in the first quarter of 2018 Saudi Arabia \u201csaw $14.4 billion in outward portfolio investment into foreign equities, the largest surge since 2008.\u201d Bad sign.Trump and his team don\u2019t understand: The U.S. can\u2019t just subcontract order-making in the Middle East to Israel, Russia and Saudi Arabia and write them blank checks. Their leaders actually need us to draw redlines for them, too, so they can tell their own hotheads and extremists, \u201cHey, I am with you \u2014 but the Americans won\u2019t let me do that.\u201dBeing the reality principle, balancer and honest broker has been a U.S. role since the 1970s. If we abdicate it, we\u2019ll just end up creating more crazy poor Middle Easterners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Quebec Election Looms but a Traditional Issue Doesn\u2019t: Independence", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMONTREAL \u2014 Rosalie Pelchat is typical of the younger generation of Quebecers here. She switches effortlessly from French to English. She spends hours each day surfing Facebook or watching Netflix in the language of Shakespeare.And, like many of her generation, she is uninterested in fighting for an independent Quebec.\u201cWe don\u2019t feel the same insecurity about language as our parents\u2019 generation did,\u201d Ms. Pelchat, a 17-year-old science student, said in the cafeteria at Coll\u00e8ge de Maisonneuve, a Francophone college. \u201cWe are better off economically in Canada and open to the world. Talk of independence is a total turnoff.\u201dAs Quebecers prepare to go to the polls on Oct. 1 in provincial elections, the polarizing issue of whether the province should secede from Canada has been sidelined for the first time in decades. It underscores how the culture wars of the past have shifted in this Francophone province where language and culture are deeply bound up with identity.Instead of focusing on Quebec\u2019s independence, the campaign has been dominated by talk of education, health care and, especially, immigration. The center-right party is trying to appeal to Quebecers by proposing that the province\u2019s autonomy be preserved by limiting immigration and imposing a \u201cvalues test\u201d and a \u201cFrench language test\u201d on newcomers.Even the nationalist, independence-seeking Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has vowed that it would not hold a referendum on independence until after 2022, a tacit acknowledgment that the subject, at least for now, is not a vote winner.For the younger generation, aspirations of becoming a Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Bill Gates appear to have pushed the constitutional preoccupations of the past to the background.In a more than two-hour debate among party leaders this month, the independence issue barely registered while the leaders clashed over Mr. Legault\u2019s proposals to expel immigrants who fail to pass a French language test after three years in the province.\u201cIf you look at what is happening in Spain, we see powers being stripped away from Catalonia, whereas in Quebec, the province has mastered more and more areas of decision-making,\u201d Mr. Cardinal said. \u201cThe fight for independence is no longer seen as worth fighting for.\u201dIt is hard to overstate how far attitudes in Quebec have changed.The province was ceded to Britain in the 18th century, but Francophones can trace their roots to 17th-century French settlers who sailed up the St. Lawrence River. During the heady years of the 1970s and early 1980s, Quebec was bubbling with agitation for independence. In those years, Francophones who spoke French in public could still be heckled with \u201cSpeak white!\u201d or English.But the balance of power gradually shifted after the governing Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois passed Bill 101 in 1977, a measure requiring that French be the language of government, the courts and commerce. Fearful that the country could be ripped apart, dozens of companies, including the Bank of Montreal, moved their headquarters to Toronto.The first referendum on whether Quebec should secede from Canada was in 1980; the \u201cno\u201d side won by nearly 20 percentage points. Then, in 1995, Quebecers voted by a tiny majority, 50.58 percent, to remain in Canada.By that time, Bill 101 had been in force for nearly 20 years. Though the law may have unnerved many investors, it engendered feelings of cultural confidence, Mr. L\u00e9ger said, making many Quebecers feel more secure living in English-majority Canada.Still, however much the issue has faded from the debate, secession is supported by a vocal minority.If an independent Quebec was able to keep the nearly $60 billion in taxes it sent each year to the federal government, he contended, Quebecers would, on the whole, be better off.\u201cCanada has far more cultural similarities with the United States than Quebec has with Canada,\u201d he said in fluent English. \u201cBut Canada wouldn\u2019t want to merge with the U.S. and have the U.S. decide its destiny. In the same manner, we don\u2019t want Quebec to be subordinate to Canada.\u201d\u201cLook at NAFTA negotiations: We have to beg Justin Trudeau, who\u2019s in thrall to big business, to keep Quebec\u2019s interests in mind on agriculture and environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could better safeguard Quebec\u2019s interests if we were independent and had our own seat at the table.\u201dBut even those seeking independence acknowledge that independence-seekers are faltering.M\u00e9lissa G\u00e9linas, 32, a postdoctoral student in Indigenous studies at Montreal\u2019s Concordia University, studied in Britain and Toronto, loves Margaret Atwood and prides herself on speaking excellent English. She also dreams of an independent Quebec.\u201cWe are a nation of Francophones in North America that can function quite well on its own,\u201d she explained before quickly adding: \u201cRealistically, I don\u2019t think it will happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Cash Better for Poor People Than Conventional Foreign Aid? ", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFIXESU.S.A.I.D., the American foreign aid agency, is conducting a trial that measures the impact when poor people abroad are simply given money with which to decide what\u2019s best for themselves.Mr. Gunther reports on global issues that include poverty and development aid. In Matinza, a village in eastern Rwanda, Esther Nyirabazungu, a 63-year-old widow, lives with her son, daughter and two grandchildren in a hut with a dirt floor and no electricity or running water. Her life is hard, but not as hard as it was before she received six monthly cash donations worth about $100 each, with no strings attached, from a United States government trial program.Her family had been malnourished, so Ms. Nyirabazungu first bought corn, soybeans, sorghum and a small amount of beef with her newfound funds. Then she purchased four goats, which cost between $28 and $46 each, and two chickens, which cost about $5 apiece. The goats had babies, which she now sells for cash to buy more food. \u201cThe life I was living before and the life I am living now are very different,\u201d she told me when I visited. \u201cMy kids are now eating eggs. They now eat meat. We were sleeping on the floor. Now we have a mattress.\u201d This is the first time U.S.A.I.D. has funded programs that simply give people cash, experts say, and they believe it is also the first time any funder has used cash as a tool to help determine which other programs work and which do not.\u201cCash transfers are not currently a big part of the global aid package, but perhaps they should be,\u201d said Daniel Handel, an official with the American aid agency who proposed the experiment when he was an economic growth officer in Rwanda. Now based in Washington, Mr. Handel, 39, is a senior adviser on aid effectiveness, a job that was created for him.\u201cThere\u2019s increasing evidence to suggest that unconditional cash transfers to ordinary citizens are one of the fairest, most cost-effective and most impactful ways to alleviate poverty and stimulate economic growth,\u201d said Diana Ohlbaum, a former U.S.A.I.D. official.The results of the early studies matter less than the fact that U.S.A.I.D. is willing to challenge its own assumptions about what works. \u201cIf GiveDirectly helps to shift even a small portion of institutional spending from less-cost-effective programs to cash transfers, it would be a major accomplishment,\u201d Ms. Tuna said.In an interview, Ms. Glassman said that \u201cmost programs and policies are not being evaluated rigorously.\u201dFounded in 2009 by four graduate students in economics at Harvard and M.I.T., GiveDirectly has big ambitions: It aims to reshape international giving by using cash as a kind of \u201cindex fund\u201d of development against which actively managed interventions can be measured. In the NPR story, Paul Niehaus, a founder of GiveDirectly, said: \u201cWe would like to see organizations make the case that they think they can do more good for the poor with a dollar than the poor could do for themselves.\u201d A report provided by Catholic Relief Services lists the program\u2019s accomplishments: 37,887 households served, 14,854 improved latrines constructed, 6,388 farmers provided with small livestock and 3,159 villages in which community health clubs were established. But these are \u201coutputs\u201d and not \u201coutcomes,\u201d Alemayehu Gebremariam, a Catholic Relief official in Rwanda, acknowledged. \u201cOur impact is expected at the end of the five years.\u201dTwo development economists, Craig McIntosh of the University of California at San Diego and Andrew Zeitlin of Georgetown University, designed the comparison study. Innovations for Poverty Action, a United States-based nonprofit with offices in Rwanda, carried out the research, hiring local staff members to interview 2,788 households. U.S.A.I.D., Innovations for Poverty Action, GiveDirectly, Catholic Relief Services and the economists all declined to comment on the results.Some people argue that a second advantage of cash is philosophical. Mr. Niehaus, of Give Directly, said: \u201cThe basic question is, is it better for us to figure out how to spend this money, or is it better to let poor people decide?\u201d There are, of course, limits to what cash can do. \u201cCash is far from a silver bullet,\u201d Ms. Glassman, of the Center for Global Development, said. \u201cCash won\u2019t provide roads, hospitals or primary health care clinics.\u201d Marc Gunther is a journalist based in Bethesda, Md., who reports on foundations and nonprofits.

Not everyone comes up with a Who or Beatles on the first try \u2014 not even the Who and the Beatles.Mr. Knopper, a contributing editor for Rolling Stone, is the author of \u201cAppetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age.\u201dLast year I sang in a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll cover band called Smaldone Faces. It was the best name of any band I\u2019ve ever been in, even though we had to constantly explain it to people. (So did the Ramones, at first, I kept saying.) We were based in northwest Denver, and a notorious mob family from the \u201950s and \u201960s, the Smaldones, used to run this neighborhood. Our drummer, Bret, and I came up with the play on words with the British rockers Small Faces in a flash of inspiration one night before practice.Not everybody lands on a Who or Beatles on the first try \u2014 they were once called the High Numbers and the Quarrymen, respectively, and who knows how history might have turned out if they hadn\u2019t switched? My new band is struggling to find a name. Sid Delicious is our bassist\u2019s preference, but a few people have staked out that name on Twitter and Instagram. Our guitarist suggested Red Mollusk Sect, because we cover Blue Oyster Cult, but it\u2019s too hard to say. I asked Rod the drummer if we could be Children of Rod. Get it? Because his name is Rod and he has kids? \u201cNo,\u201d Rod said. With Smaldone Faces, we Photoshopped an electric guitar onto an old image of the family patriarch Clyde Smaldone and used the \u201cGodfather\u201d font for our fliers and Facebook page. It was a fun marketing shtick until I received an unexpected message from a bald, big-bearded, mixed-martial-arts fighter who said he was a Smaldone relative and was not amused by our use of his family name and likeness. He called us \u201ccheesy little [expletives]\u201d and added: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what my family endured.\u201dThe band expressed dismay that our mere existence could hurt someone. Also, none of us wanted to see the scary MMA guy storm into the club in the middle of a show. Bret suggested we rename ourselves Cheesy Little [Expletives], but nobody could envision that on a marquee. We were back to jawing and fretting and emailing about a name.One of our singers suggested the Dive Five. I said, \u201cWho would come to see us if they think we\u2019re playing a dive?\u201d I favored puns. My friend Michael suggested the Mini Van Morrisons. \u201cNo,\u201d the band said. It was a shame. The name Smaldone Faces had landed us our first real gig, when the singer in Super Phoenixes (another great name) asked us to open for them at the Tennyson\u2019s Tap club in Denver without even hearing our music.I recruited a few ringers for the discussion. As a longtime Colorado-based music journalist, I\u2019m friendly with the punk hero Jello Biafra, who is from Boulder, and found myself one night on a Denver restaurant patio with him and Ruyter Suys, the guitarist from Nashville Pussy. Who could pass up the opportunity to solicit band-name advice from members of the Dead Kennedys and Nashville Pussy? At first they were unenthusiastic. But they got into it. Ruyter suggested Greatest \u2026 and a dirty word that rhymes with Hits. She also favored Biodad. And Ryan\u2019s Mom. And, since we were on a legendarily seedy stretch of Colfax Avenue, the Col \u2014 well, you see where this is going.Jello said he\u2019d been trying for years to get a Denver band to name itself [Expletive] the Broncos, which I agreed was inspired, but not quite right for an eager-to-please cover band. He spewed out a few more, mostly unprintable, then quickly tired of the exercise. I took these back to the ex-Smaldone Faces. They rejected all of them. They also rejected the dozens of so-so names I proposed: Secret Compartments and Big Swinging Richards and Smash 45s and Denver Boots. Without a name, we had no identity. The band soon went in a different direction and (longer, sadder story) I quit.Picking a band name is an act of creative sorcery. When you happen upon a great one, it seems obvious, but getting to it relies on your collective ingenuity, chemistry and communication. Kurt Cobain found Nirvana by endlessly doodling names like Cold and Wet, the Mandibles and Fecal Matter; Led Zeppelin was a fast choice after the Who\u2019s Keith Moon declared that was how they would go over.

{"Headline": "We Were Making Headway on Global Poverty. What\u2019s About to Change?", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe writers are the founders of the Gates Foundation.Do you think the number of poor people in the world has gone up or down in the past 25 years?This question is an excellent conversation starter because practically everybody answers it incorrectly. Primed by depressing and shocking headlines, most people assume that poverty has increased. Some people say it has held steady. Almost none are aware that in fact, more than a billion people have overcome poverty just since the turn of the millennium.But it\u2019s not guaranteed to continue. In fact, progress against poverty is in jeopardy. According to current projections, the number of people in extreme poverty will stagnate at over 500 million. In the worst-case scenario, it could even start going back up.Why has the world arrived at this crossroads? The answer is the unfortunate intersection of two demographic trends.First, as extreme poverty disappears from many places, including China and India and, increasingly, many countries in Africa, it gets more and more concentrated in the most challenging places in the world. Poverty is especially stubborn in a group of about a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa marked by violent conflict, severe climate change, weak governance and broken health and education systems. More and more, extreme poverty will be a feature of life only where people\u2019s opportunities to overcome it are brutally limited.This dual phenomenon of persistent poverty in fast-growing places explains why, by 2050, more than 40 percent of the extremely poor people on the planet are projected to live in just two countries: the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria.The good thing about projections, though, is that they are based on the status quo. We don\u2019t believe in the status quo. We believe that people, when given tools and opportunity, can defy the odds. This is especially true of young people, because they are determined to lead a better life than their parents have and eager to follow new ideas and new technologies where they lead. What will it take to help all these young people change the future of their countries? We can learn from what has worked in the past: investments in people, especially their health and education, and in innovation.In general, leaders prefer to spend money on things like roads, ports and bridges, because the impact is immediate. When they strengthen health and school systems, the results, from an economic point of view, come decades later. The effect of investments in science and technology is even more delayed.In India, innovation is leading to remarkable change. The 1960s best seller \u201cThe Population Bomb\u201d predicted that \u201cfamine and food riots\u201d would \u201csweep\u201d across the country. What actually swept across India were new agricultural techniques and technologies, and now Indian farmers get almost four times the amount of wheat from the same piece of land as they got 50 years ago.The challenge now is for today\u2019s poorest, fastest-growing countries to make the same kinds of investments. If they can\u2019t, if their futures resemble their recent pasts, then the world will get poorer. But if they can, we could see extreme poverty disappear from the earth. Even though the projections we\u2019re talking about are in the distant future, the time to act is now. Investing in health and education is especially urgent at this precise time in the history of sub-Saharan Africa because of the region\u2019s youth boom. The children who can transform the continent have already been \u2014 or are about to be \u2014 born. It will be up to them to lead the innovation their societies need: to transform subsistence farms into profitable small businesses, to provide a bank account for every adult on their mobile phones, to eradicate malaria and other neglected diseases.Our foundation\u2019s mission is to help all people lead a healthy, productive life. In some ways it is going to be even more difficult to deliver on that promise in the future than it was in the past. Fortunately, recent history shows that progress is possible, even under what experts used to consider impossible circumstances. It also provides a very specific blueprint for how we can work together to create it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stable After Attack, Brazilian Candidate May See Political Fortunes Rise", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO \u2014 The front-runner in Brazil\u2019s presidential election, Jair Bolsonaro, was in a serious but stable condition on Friday, recovering from near-fatal stabbing amid predictions that the attack will lift his standing and ratchet up tensions in the most uncertain vote in years.After emergency surgery to repair perforations to his intestines and an abdominal vein at a local hospital, he was transferred on Friday to Albert Einstein Hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo.Mr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, is a deeply polarizing figure, at once the most popular and most reviled candidate in a presidential race that remains splintered just weeks before the Oct. 7 vote.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s injuries could force him to sit out the next week or two in the hospital, but there was widespread agreement on Friday that the stabbing was likely to extend his lead.\u201cThis plays straight into his message: the security issues, the violence and the need to address those issues,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThere are still a lot of undecided voters. It might be that a number of them now say \u2018Bolsonaro is our guy.\u2019\u201d\u201cI prepared myself for a moment like this because you run risks,\u201d he said, before asking, \u201cCould it be that human beings are so bad? I\u2019ve never done anything bad to anyone.\u201dThe attack has already scrambled the strategy of his adversaries, who condemned the violence, canceled campaign events in solidarity and pulled ads that targeted Mr. Bolsonaro.Wall-to-wall coverage of the attack and interviews with two of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s sons, who are also running for office, have already vastly increased his presence on prime time television. This will offset his paltry 15 seconds of free television campaign time and small share of public campaign financing \u2014 both a result of his failure to make alliances with major political parties.A suspect in the attack, Ad\u00e9lio Bispo de Oliveira, was arrested at the scene on Thursday. Police said they believed he may be mentally unstable, but the fact that he belonged to the left-wing PSOL party for seven years until 2014 has fueled speculation among Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s followers of a conspiracy.Many Brazilians view Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, as a kind of Brazilian Trump \u2014 a political outsider who shoots from the hip. He wants to make it easier to own guns, and easier for police to shoot criminals.\u201cJair Bolsonaro is stronger than ever and ready to be elected president of Brazil in the 1st ROUND!\u201d he posted on Twitter.Brazil\u2019s markets rose after the attack, as investors also bet that voters will now rally around a candidate they view as more market-friendly than many of his rivals.But concern grew that competing political camps could step up verbal attacks at a delicate time for Brazil\u2019s democracy, which emerged from two decades of military dictatorship in the mid-1980s.\u201cThe next days should be used by the campaigns, including Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s, to calmly reflect on the what the next steps will be,\u201d M\u00edriam Leit\u00e3o, a columnist for O Globo, cautioned on Friday.The stabbing was just the latest instance of the violence that has roiled Brazilian politics. Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco was killed on March 14 after assailants fired on her car. Days later, buses participating in a campaign caravan with Mr. da Silva were shot at in southern Brazil.\u201cIf the answer is more radicalization, the climate will get worse and more dangerous in the weeks that separate us from the polls,\u201d Ms. Leit\u00e3o wrote.Advertisement"}

This is not glamorous,\u201d writes Ellen Barry, a Times correspondent based in London. \u201cBut it is basically a good thing. It makes us better.\u201dThis challenge is amplified by the internet and social media, which makes our journalism available in every pocket of the world and enables those we write about to read our coverage immediately.We have asked some of our most senior correspondents \u2014 Jack Healy in Colorado, Ellen Barry in London and Hannah Beech in Bangkok \u2014 to reflect on how they grapple with these challenges.Please share your thoughts, feedback and questions for our journalists in the comments.The queso did me in.Clearly, there was a dip. And it was me.This was an important reminder. The people who live in places to which we travel to report stories know the secrets, language and pulse of their hometowns. I don\u2019t. But to tell the stories unfolding across the country \u2014 the tale of the scandal or the murder, the election or the natural disaster \u2014 reporters have to capture the essence of a place for two competing audiences. Our stories have to make sense to readers who have never heard of Immokalee, Fla., or Kit Carson, Colo. And they have to ring true for people who have lived there forever. Most national reporters for The Times don\u2019t live in New York or Washington. We\u2019re in Miami, Seattle, Denver, Los Angeles, Boston, Kansas City \u2014 arrayed around the country to be closer to the people and stories we cover. Being close helps. But every new town you visit is a new world to understand.I start by banishing clich\u00e9s and vague descriptions. \u201cHardscrabble, down-and-out, fading\u201d \u2014 into the garbage. I think long and hard before talking about palm trees, trailer parks or cornfields to illuminate a place. The view through my windshield is only a shard of the story. I live in the nuanced specific.And whatever else, I no longer say queso.In the 1990s, when I lived in Moscow and first reported from overseas for an American newspaper, it was rare to get feedback from the people you were writing about.After an interview, you would promise to send the person you had interviewed a copy of your piece when it was published, happily close your notebook and set off to write. You were free as a bird: By the time the article appeared, and was sent to Moscow through a mail service, and then made its final journey to the person, it was weeks old, hardly worth a phone call, let alone a letter to the editor. In most cases, it wouldn\u2019t make it that far. Now, engaging a vast audience is an institutional obsession. Our coverage cannot be chin-stroking and scholarly; we have to wade in. Especially if we take a point of view, the people we\u2019re writing about read our pieces instantaneously, look for inaccuracies and tell us we\u2019re full of baloney. This is not glamorous. It regularly makes my stomach flip over from anxiety. But it is basically a good thing. It makes us better.In 2013, I was barred from Myanmar for more than a year because of a story I had written about Buddhist extremists targeting the Rohingya and other Muslims in the country. Hundreds of Burmese, including Buddhist monks, took to the streets of Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s commercial capital, to protest the article. There was even a small demonstration in Midtown Manhattan. On social media, then newly launched in Myanmar, thousands of comments labeled me a polemicist, a racist and a secret Muslim. My children\u2019s names were published online, as was my residential address.The reaction on social media, this time from Rohingya advocates, was once again heated. I was labeled a polemicist, a racist and a secret Buddhist.As in 2013, there were more than a few anonymous threats of rape. As journalists, we pick our stories. Every act of addition and omission shapes a narrative. Foreign correspondents have, perhaps, a greater responsibility because we can serve as the lens through which an outside audience views another country. Entire histories and cultures are distilled into a few hundred words, even if they are part of a larger body of work about each place.Yet people, no matter where they live, are not easily cleaved into Manichaean halves of good and bad. Genocidal generals can treat their children or pets with great humanity. Victims of ethnic cleansing can beat their wives.History is messy, especially the first draft that newspapers are supposed to record. And now, with social media, reporters are part of the story as never before. At times, the crush of online commentary seems to focus less on the issue at hand \u2014 genocide, White House ethics, the dining scene in London \u2014 and more on the intent of the writer.Holding journalists to account is important. But it shouldn\u2019t be at the expense of a truth that is often complicated and contradictory.In some countries on my beat, foreign correspondents bear an additional responsibility: We can write what local reporters cannot because of censorship or political pressures. Yet far from being viewed as independent arbiters, Western reporters, in particular, can be seen as emissaries weighted with all sorts of baggage: colonialism, capitalism, rich-country-ism. Yes, we do all come with our own prejudices and preconceptions. We need to expand our notion of our audience because lots of people in lots of countries read The Times. But in other cases, the truth is the truth, no matter who reads it. Two of my articles catalyzed fury from forces that are deeply opposed to one another. Both Muslims and Buddhists from Myanmar felt that I had maligned and disrespected them. Outside of the mathematical realm, two negatives don\u2019t equal a positive. But I think that this anger from both sides, even if it stung me, probably helped in shaping a more complete, more human picture of the tragedy in Myanmar. And telling that story, no matter how topsy-turvy, is what we\u2019re supposed to do.Now it\u2019s your turn.

{"Headline": "A Teacher Made a Hitler Joke in the Classroom. It Tore the School Apart.", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "A few students gasped; others exchanged surprised looks or laughed nervously. Instantly aware that his stab at Mel Brooks-style parody hadn\u2019t landed, Frisch lowered his arm and tried to explain himself, telling his students that it used to be common to make fun of Nazis. Only recently, he said, had such jokes become taboo. He resumed the lesson, and the weird moment seemed to be over.News of the incident spread quickly. A student mentioned it to Friends\u2019 director of diversity and inclusion, Jason Craige Harris, who in turn told the dean of co-curricular programs, Leitzel Schoen. The following day, Schoen called the school\u2019s principal, Bo Lauder, catching him on a plane to visit a sick relative in Alabama. Lauder decided that Frisch should stay home until the school figured out what to do.Over the following days, Lauder heard from dozens of parents. Many expressed support for a teacher they considered a pillar of the Friends community. Others said they thought the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d gesture inexcusable, a few going so far as to say that if Lauder did not take action, they would withdraw their children from the school. At a meeting with administrators about the incident in late February, members of the high school\u2019s Parents Association said that keeping Frisch would send the message that the school didn\u2019t take anti-Semitism seriously. Another parent told Lauder that this was not the first time Frisch had said or done something inappropriate.Twelve days after the \u201cHeil Hitler,\u201d Lauder and several members of the school\u2019s board called Frisch in for a meeting at the school. To resolve the situation, they said, Frisch had to go. They gave him a choice: He could either resign or be terminated. It was Lauder\u2019s hope that Frisch would decide to resign and accept a settlement that would include a severance package and a nondisclosure agreement. After nine days of failed negotiations, Frisch chose instead to be fired. With the backing of the Friends Seminary Teachers\u2019 Association \u2014 Friends is one of only a handful of private schools in New York City whose faculty is unionized \u2014 he opened a grievance process against the school, arguing that he had been wrongfully terminated. He would have the chance to argue his case for reinstatement at an arbitration hearing scheduled to take place near the end of summer.Lauder sent a letter to teachers, parents and alumni on March 9, hours after the school emptied out for spring break, informing them of the news. He described the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d salute and alluded to \u201cother equally inappropriate and troubling actions\u201d that had surfaced since the incident, without providing any details about them. \u201cWhen I made the decision, I knew it could cause the ceiling to come crashing down,\u201d Lauder told me. \u201cBut I had to act on what I thought would be best for the school and the students.\u201dPedagogy at the high school level is inherently personal. But when the lines of appropriate discourse are continually being redrawn, it is also inherently risky. The job of high school teachers is to impart knowledge and deliver measurable results, which requires finding a way to reach, and ideally even inspire, their students. \u201cHow would you keep the attention of 15 teenagers and bond with them?\u201d one Friends teacher texted me, insisting on anonymity because of a school policy that discourages teachers from speaking to the media without permission. \u201cYou MUST joke and be yourself and connect with them on their terms. It\u2019s the only way to be good at this.\u201dFrisch\u2019s former students describe him as eccentric, nerdy, prone to lengthy classroom digressions about his stamp collection, dinosaurs or childhood snow days spent sledding. Any teacher who spends three decades in the classroom, speaking extemporaneously for hours on end to a roomful of teenagers, is going to have awkward moments. Frisch might have had more of them, and they may have been a bit more awkward. But that was how he connected, and it was perhaps a way of connecting that is no longer possible. \u201cEverybody knew this guy was off \u2014 weird behavior, quirky,\u201d said one parent who, fearing retribution against her child, insisted on anonymity. \u201cMaybe in the \u201970s that would have been O.K., but not when you\u2019re paying $45,000 a year in tuition.\u201dWhat can teachers say or do now? Who gets to decide when they\u2019ve gone too far and how severe the punishment should be? As the spring semester went on, the history of Friends Seminary made these questions especially charged. Located on East 16th Street, on a quiet, elm-shaded block that dead-ends at Stuyvesant Square Park, the school was opened in 1786, at a time when America\u2019s Quakers, having fled religious persecution in England, were helping to shape a more tolerant set of founding principles for a new nation: The Bill of Rights was modeled after the original Pennsylvania charter, which was drafted by a Quaker, William Penn.Friends\u2019 original intent was to provide a \u201cguarded education\u201d to Quaker children. There were to be no frivolous pursuits: only reading, writing, basic arithmetic and Bible study. Like other Quaker schools, Friends eventually opened its doors to the general population and broadened its educational mission, while aspiring to remain true to Quaker values like equality, simplicity and community, and to the overarching Quaker duty to build a better society. As it evolved, the school\u2019s proximity to Greenwich Village made it a popular choice for artists, writers and liberal activists. The pacifist and perennial Socialist Party presidential candidate Norman Thomas sent his daughter to Friends; Eleanor Roosevelt and John Lennon spoke to students in its 19th-century red-brick Quaker meetinghouse, which still serves as the primary gathering space for assemblies, musical performances and the school\u2019s weekly Quaker \u201cmeetings for worship.\u201d Every night, a common area off the school\u2019s lobby is transformed into a 14-cot homeless shelter run by members of the nearby Quaker congregation with the help of faculty and parent volunteers; on Fridays, the school\u2019s second graders make baked goods for its residents.In recent years, the demographics of the school have shifted with those of the city. As the rich have grown richer, couples who would once have left for bigger houses and better schools in the suburbs when they had children are now simply buying bigger apartments and sending their children to private schools. There aren\u2019t enough seats in the historically more desirable uptown institutions \u2014 Spence, Dalton, Trinity \u2014 to meet demand; and for families who live in neighborhoods like the Village, TriBeCa or Battery Park, Friends is a much more convenient option. Friends now sees itself as a competitor to these schools, and in some respects, it has become indistinguishable from them.For much of the school\u2019s history, its finances were precarious, in part because Quakers frown on hoarding wealth. Lauder has tapped into the new money flowing into the school, courting wealthy families at private dinners and fund-raising events. Tuition has more than doubled since Lauder\u2019s arrival. In 16 years, he has increased the school\u2019s endowment to $30 million from $4 million, and raised $47 million for a $72 million renovation that is halfway to completion: The school is gutting three townhouses, connecting them to its main building and adding new floors and a rooftop greenhouse. This year, its annual auction, which once took place in a nearby church and featured homemade quilts, was held in the ballroom of a luxury hotel and included an Ellsworth Kelly painting and a screening party at Soho House with the actor Kyle MacLachlan.Most Quaker schools incorporated independently years ago. But until recently, Friends and the organization that oversees Manhattan\u2019s Quaker community, the New York Quarterly Meeting, were essentially a single entity. Last year, they finally separated, the culmination of a protracted, often contentious legal process. Under the final agreement, Friends became a long-term tenant of the Quakers and now pays the Quarterly Meeting roughly $1 million a year in rent, or about a third of market rate. Friends also committed to following a detailed set of principles in order to remain a Quaker school, a status that is central to its brand appeal.Even before Frisch\u2019s termination, there was a feeling among some in the Friends community \u2014 parents, teachers and especially alumni \u2014 that in its race to keep pace with a changing city, the school was losing touch with the Quaker ethos that had long distinguished it. Perhaps inevitably, the fight over Frisch\u2019s termination became a proxy battle in this larger war: Frisch was the only Quaker teacher in the high school. What is more, the manner in which the school fired him bore little resemblance to the Quaker decision-making process, which calls for the participation of the entire community in open dialogue. \u201cWhat has made Friends a special school is the Quaker values, and that\u2019s what has been broken in this process,\u201d says Jacques Lilly, a longtime Friends parent. \u201cWhat do you have if you don\u2019t have those? You\u2019ve got a nice, second-tier, expensive New York City private school. Why don\u2019t you send your kids to Brearley instead?\u201dWord of the firing spread quickly over spring break, and when classes resumed in late March the school erupted in protest. Students were angry that they had no voice in the process and that the school had not shared with them any details of the other \u201cequally troubling incidents\u201d that informed its decision. They staged a sit-in that spilled out of Lauder\u2019s office and into the hallway outside and walked out of meetings for worship carrying protest signs: \u201cFree Ben Frisch,\u201d \u201cMake Friends Quaker Again,\u201d \u201cBo Chi Minh.\u201d Students wore \u201cBring Back Ben\u201d buttons around campus and reflected on the case in classroom essays, applying the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi to Frisch\u2019s situation and comparing the fight on his behalf to the Dakota Pipeline protest at Standing Rock. In a commencement address, the senior Benjamin Levine offered a thinly veiled critique of the administration: \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier and simpler to decide someone is racist or ignorant or na\u00efve \u2014 or anti-Semitic \u2014 than to engage in the messy work of trying to communicate and understand when conflicts arise.\u201dAlumni took to an unofficial Friends alumni Facebook page to express their anger and disappointment, producing long threads about the dangers of speech codes, about the history of Jewish humor as a means for dealing with tragedy, about the transformation of Friends \u201cfrom a haven of progressivism, compassion and common sense into a corporate, \u2018liberal\u2019 and truly luxe institution.\u201d Twenty-six former teachers and administrators, including Lauder\u2019s predecessor as principal, signed a public letter calling for Frisch\u2019s immediate reinstatement. Philip Schwartz, a popular English and Latin teacher who retired in 2014 after 48 years at Friends, wrote a letter to the school, asking that his name be removed from its list of emeritus faculty members. He accused Friends of \u201ccapsizing into the swamp of political correctness\u201d and observed that \u201ca dialogue of reconciliation and tolerance no longer seems to be our Quaker core value.\u201dAnd yet as the protests gathered momentum, they started to present their own challenge to the spirit of dialogue and tolerance. The overwhelming majority of students, teachers and alumni disapproved of Frisch\u2019s firing, while those who did believe that the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d was unforgivably offensive or were inclined to respect the administration\u2019s decision to withhold details of a sensitive employment decision kept their opinions to themselves. For some, the fight for free expression had become repressive in its own right.In April, the co-editors of the school newspaper, Camilo Durr and Maeve Woollen, showed Lauder a draft of a special issue about the Frisch controversy. Lauder passed it on to Will Hopkins, the interim head of the upper school, and Erica Jones, the dean of students. The administrators expressed disappointment that none of the articles were sympathetic to the school. Hopkins encouraged Durr and Woollen to include a wider range of opinions, suggesting that they go beyond the newspaper staff and solicit articles from the broader community. After a couple of weeks, the editors started to think the administration was just stalling. \u201cThey said later that they supported us, but it was clear from the atmosphere that they didn\u2019t want the issue to come out,\u201d Durr told me. After attending an emotional, communitywide Quaker meeting about Frisch at the meetinghouse, he and Woollen emailed PDFs of the paper to the student body, faculty and administration. Both editors were removed from their jobs: \u201cdigital misconduct\u201d was the charge. \u201cI felt like they walked away from the community process,\u201d Hopkins told me.New York\u2019s Quaker community, which numbers about 500, was furious about the school\u2019s treatment of a longtime member. They came together at their various meetinghouses around the city to draft \u201cminutes of concern\u201d about the firing, asking the school to explain how its handling of Frisch\u2019s case was consistent with Quaker values and calling instead for \u201crestorative justice,\u201d a process whereby perpetrators, victims and community members meet to collectively decide how to repair the harm caused by an offense. \u201cI have never seen such unity among Quakers,\u201d Charles Brainard, an 85-year-old lawyer and worshiper at the Friends meetinghouse, told me. \u201cBo is just a very ambitious guy, and he was out to build this primo school, and I don\u2019t think that truth sank into many Quakers until Ben Frisch was fired.\u201dLauder is unapologetic about his aspirations for Friends. He said that he undertook the current renovation specifically to bolster the school\u2019s appeal to the city\u2019s best private-school students, even though it required him to spend much more time than he would have liked talking to bankers about the school\u2019s asset-to-debt ratio and in lawyers\u2019 offices negotiating the separation from the Quakers. But he also told me that he believes he has strengthened the school\u2019s commitment to its Quaker heritage: During his tenure, Friends created its own Center for Peace, Equity and Justice, which hosts an annual Peace Week, with guest speakers like Chelsea Clinton and the Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs.At the end of what had been a very tumultuous school year, the board \u2014 half of which is appointed by Quakers and otherwise includes an assortment of parents and alumni \u2014 sent out a letter to the community expressing its confidence in Lauder. But his support among much of the faculty seems shaky at best: The teachers\u2019 union recently sent the trustees a letter signed by 72 of its 96 members (18 abstained) describing morale as \u201cperilously low\u201d and saying that they felt \u201csilenced or scolded\u201d by Lauder and were \u201closing faith in his leadership.\u201dLauder said his job has changed immeasurably since he arrived at Friends. \u201cStarting now in my 17th year, I feel like I was Mr. Rogers in Year 1,\u201d he told me. He is now trying to juggle the demands of running a competitive and pricey Manhattan private school with an institutional culture that empowers community members to not only raise their voices but to expect to be heard. The school\u2019s Quaker identity calls for it to be faithful to its progressive tradition, but in the new age of identity politics, it is not always easy to know what the right stance on a particular issue should be. Just a few months before the Frisch incident, some 20 parents had raised questions about the scheduled speaking engagement of a visiting scholar, Dave Zirin, a sportswriter for the Nation magazine and a Friends alumnus who had been critical of Israel in his writings. In 2012, there were heated objections to a musical performance in the meetinghouse by Gilad Atzmon, an Israel-born saxophonist and self-described \u201cproud, self-hating Jew\u201d who has written that Palestinians were \u201cbrutally ethnically cleansed\u201d and suggested that if Israel starts a nuclear war with Iran, \u201csome may be bold enough to argue that Hitler might have been right after all.\u201d The Harvard Law School professor emeritus and noted gadfly Alan Dershowitz publicly criticized Friends \u2014 and Lauder personally \u2014 for refusing to cancel the appearance.Lauder did not consider the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d episode a close call. \u201cPersonally, I was appalled,\u201d he told me. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine, even as a joke \u2014 and I grew up watching \u2018Hogan\u2019s Heroes\u2019 \u2014 that in a class that had nothing to do with history or World War II or Nazism or teaching German language that an incident like that could happen.\u201d I asked Lauder why he felt he needed to go so far as to fire Frisch. \u201cOne of our pledges is to make all of our students feel safe,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd that is something that I take very, very seriously.\u201dThat no one has accused Frisch of being an anti-Semite was beside the point: His invocation of the Nazi salute in a classroom full of high school students, regardless of his intentions, was enough to end his career. On today\u2019s campus, words and symbols can be seen as a form of violence; to many people, engaging in a public debate about the nuances of their power is to tolerate their use. \u201cI asked one of our lawyers, \u2018How can I do this in a more Quakerly way?\u2019\u2009\u201d Lauder told me. \u201cAnd he just looked at me and stated the obvious: There is no way to make a firing a Quakerly event.\u201dFor months, rumors circulated about what Frisch\u2019s \u201cequally troubling incidents\u201d might be. Now the school presented two witnesses, both former Friends students, to describe them. One remembered Frisch sarcastically telling a classmate of hers who had gotten a math problem wrong that he should \u201cgo outside and kill himself.\u201d The other testified that Frisch had stroked her upper arm with his finger in the classroom in a way that made her feel uncomfortable and that he had moved his chair so close to hers during a tutoring session in the math-department office that their bodies were touching. (Frisch\u2019s lawyer asked her if she was aware that he wore hearing aids.) The witness had dismissed the incidents at the time but was reminded of them when she was contacted by the school\u2019s diversity director, Harris, who led the Frisch investigation. Frisch, who first learned about the claims after his termination, denied ever having told a student to kill himself and said that he had no memory of the inappropriate touching that had been described.Frisch\u2019s lawyer called a member of the February pre-calculus class who has since graduated, Josie Girand, to testify about the \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d incident. She recounted Frisch\u2019s actions and described her reaction to them, acknowledging that it was an awkward moment, but adding that she hadn\u2019t thought it was a big deal at the time. When Frisch\u2019s lawyer asked Girand if anyone she knew had been offended by the gesture, the school\u2019s lawyer objected.The hearing, which was closed to the public \u2014 I had to rely on secondhand accounts \u2014 lasted a little more than five hours. The arbitrator will decide in the coming weeks to uphold the termination or to order the school to reinstate Frisch.Frisch enjoyed an exalted status at Friends that flowed from his years of service to the school and, above all, his Quaker faith. Every year, he helped lead a three-day retreat for graduating seniors at Powell House, a Quaker conference center in upstate New York, where he would tell outgoing students that even though they were leaving the school, the doors of the meetinghouse would always be open to them. Even as the controversy over his firing was unfolding, a brief tribute to Frisch was on display in the school\u2019s lobby \u2014 alongside one to the civil rights leader Bayard Rustin and another to William Penn \u2014 written by a Friends first grader, part of a class project honoring important Quaker activists.Frisch would not discuss the two other claims, but we spoke at length about the \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d Frisch said he was embarrassed, both by the fact that he had made the gesture in the first place and by his subsequent failure to recognize the seriousness of such a lapse in judgment. But he was also surprised by the school\u2019s reaction to it. \u201cI trusted while I was at Friends that because of my long-term commitment to the school, that as I need to change to meet the changing dynamics of the classroom, the school would help me learn and provide the support I needed to make those changes,\u201d he told me.Advertisement"}

And, as if in direct rebuke to Mr. Trump, the group called for new and tougher state and local regulations to stop methane leaks from oil and gas wells and municipal distribution systems.

{"Headline": "Losing Touch, Finding Intimacy", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydisabilityI had come to believe I was unable to break through my physical disability. I was wrong. Ms. Jameson is a fine artist and writer living with multiple sclerosis. Ms. Monahon is an artist and writer. One of my oldest friends is here to visit. For as long as we\u2019ve known each other, we\u2019ve been in sync, weaving in and out of each other\u2019s lives and reaching milestones together. We married our partners around the same time, went through law school and medical school at the same time, got pregnant with our sons in unison and lived as neighbors for years. Although we have visited each other frequently, time has slowly gotten away from us. I haven\u2019t seen her in more than a year. She gingerly lies down on the sofa while I sit nearby. She isn\u2019t looking good. Thinner than I\u2019ve ever seen her, weak and in pain. \u201cHow are you?\u201d I ask. \u201cWell, I have cancer,\u201d she says plainly. She changes the subject, not feeling the need to linger on her recent prognosis or to specify that it is terminal. All I want to do is hold her hand, rub her shoulders and tell her how much she means to me with a firm, loving touch. I stay distant from her, unable to move. I imagine stroking her hair or giving her a pillow to feel more comfortable, but I cannot do anything. Our conversation ebbs, flows, then trickles into silence; there is not much more to say. She rests her hands on her stomach, where she holds the most pain. Five years ago, I would have bridged this silence with a gentle hug or touch. But I am stuck, immobile, unable to express my thoughts and feelings. I don\u2019t allow myself to cry as we say our goodbyes.When I lost the use of my hands, I lost my love language. I have multiple sclerosis, which has resulted in the loss of the use of my limbs. My disease progresses so slowly that I am caught by surprise when I can no longer do something. Little did I know I have been losing my range of motion by a fraction of a centimeter every day. Nerve by nerve, I lost the use of my legs, arms, wrists, hands, pointer finger, thumb.I can\u2019t tell you when exactly I became a quadriplegic, only that I know I am now a part of the club. My paralysis limits me down to my fingertips. I can\u2019t operate my wheelchair, can\u2019t hold a coffee cup, let alone someone\u2019s hand \u2014 I can\u2019t actively touch in any way. Like a fortress, my wheelchair is both impossible to leave and difficult to enter. If others want to reach out and touch me, it can be intimidating to make the first move. It feels like there is a thick pane of glass separating me from the outside world, and because of my physical disability, I begin to believe that I am powerless to break through.But I feel the loss of touch as if it were a limb that has been severed from my body, an invisible, open wound I painstakingly cover up each day. I am hyper-aware of the moments when words are not enough. When touching someone\u2019s hand is the only way I can truly communicate my feelings. When I can\u2019t greet someone familiar by warmly placing my hand on their shoulder. Or when I know someone is sad, and it\u2019s not appropriate to talk about what\u2019s wrong; I can\u2019t reassure them affectionately. It is like not being able to breathe. This loss, in combination with the guilt I feel when I grieve it, is overwhelming. I resign myself to the idea that I will never experience consensual, nourishing, intimate exchanges of touch in everyday life.It is in this state of numbed resignation that an unexpected crack forms in the thick glass that has been separating me from \u201cnormal\u201d people: A ray of light that reveals a world of intimacy I have been overlooking.As he settles back into his chair, I feel lightheaded. By increasing the volume of my voice, he had turned up the very essence of \u201cme.\u201d The fact that he cared so much to hear me. That he took the time to learn how to connect with me.I had rediscovered intimacy, without touch.After that day in the coffee shop, intimate moments emerged from the fabric of my everyday life. I began to notice how friends, loved ones and total strangers could make me feel visible and whole in completely mundane ways. Appreciating them took my breath away: that someone driving my wheelchair is making love to me, that someone kneeling to my eye level is giving me a gentle caress, that someone feeding me is a joint experience of pleasure and tenderness.Within the mundane there are beautiful surprises, too. On a busy day, before work, my husband pauses his morning routine to make me a poached egg, his specialty. Something he wants to make for me \u2014 I didn\u2019t ask. A friend tries to feed me a cookie. He does it \u201cwrong\u201d at first, but the process of figuring out the best way is like an intricate dance. Over the holidays, a family member puts on Handel\u2019s \u201cMessiah,\u201d music that I love and everyone else in the family finds annoying. They usually refuse to put it on, but this morning they play it just for me, blasting it so that I can hear the music through my bedroom wall.I savored these moments, and as I did I was propelled and empowered by them. I realized I could play an active role \u2014 I could give as well as receive. So I took my intimacy into my own hands, even though I am still grieving what I cannot do. I leave base camp behind and begin my slow, labored ascent; the fluid, open concept of intimacy spurs me onward.I have always loved food. I muster the courage to ask someone to join me for a luxurious, two-hour pastry-eating session. We take the time to savor every crumb of a single pastry, eating at the same pace together, and I feel honored, loved.I start seeing myself in others: I am a part of a tribe. Wheelchair users, people with multiple sclerosis, the elderly with canes and walkers, people struggling with aphasia or spinal cord injury. The list goes on and on. We are everywhere. I lock eyes with a 90-year-old man in a crowded elevator. He tips his hat to me with a warm smile. I see a woman with a mobility aide in the street and we grin at each other, comrades. Neighbors. Strangers. Visible, invisible.I poke fun at my own disability, creating humor where there was once shame. When I\u2019m drinking water, I have no way to stop, so when someone cracks a joke I laugh and spit water down my front. It\u2019s humiliating, but hysterically funny at the same time. I have a damp front more often than not.I now know intimacy can be everywhere. Moments I\u2019ve noticed, received, created. You and I are sharing an intimate moment right now \u2014 because if you\u2019ve gotten this far without turning away, you are a part of that exclusive tribe of people who truly see me.But eventually, my quest for intimacy brings me back to the beginning. To touch.My good friend is back to visit. We are trying to see each other more often \u2014 with less time left, it\u2019s only natural. She lies on the sofa, and I verbalize all that I kept inside last time \u2014 how badly I want to stroke her hair, squeeze her hand, sit next to her. She smiles appreciatively, but moves the conversation along, not one to linger in the spotlight. She directs the conversation back to me. We talk a bit more, and emboldened by my confession, I ask her if she would take my hand, if it isn\u2019t too painful to move. Slowly, she sits up, and my caregiver rolls my chair as close to her as possible. She extends her hand, resting it in mine. We look at each other and breathe.Advertisement"}

He has made fighting political corruption and rampant crime the cornerstones of his campaign, vowing to drain the swamp, give the police more freedom to kill criminals, and make it easier for civilians to own arms.Mr. Bolsonaro was already leading the polls when his candidacy got an unexpected bump this month: He was stabbed in the abdomen at a campaign rally and rushed to the hospital with serious injuries.The candidate has been trying to connect with women, with mixed results. In an emotional video recorded before he was attacked, he teared up when he described reversing his vasectomy. He did it, he said in the video, to make his wife happy because \u201cwomen largely find fulfillment in having children.\u201dMany viewers took offense.\u201cI am a woman.

Mr. Ansari, in jeans and a red plaid shirt, responded by saying Charleston was \u201creally one of my favorite places,\u201d before beginning a comedy set testing out new material.He added: \u201cI continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture. It is necessary and long overdue.\u201dSeveral other conversations with audience members at the Charleston Gaillard Center yielded similar results. Some didn\u2019t know why Mr. Ansari had been absent from public life, and the ones who did said they were not concerned.Blake Devereux, 32, who followed Mr. Ansari\u2019s television work, was unaware of the article, and her boyfriend, Rich Lavecchia, 58, hadn\u2019t heard of Mr. Ansari, period. But Mr. Lavecchia said that on an Uber ride to the theater, his driver had told him about the allegations.\u201cMind blown,\u201d Ms. Devereux said.At the same time, he made it clear to ticket holders that he did not want jokes from the show to leave the theater. An email went out to audience members Tuesday morning advising them that \u201call cellphones and smart watches will be placed in a lockable pouch,\u201d and that \u201cuse of performance materials\u201d was prohibited. This isn\u2019t unusual for comedians working out new material \u2014 this show was titled \u201cWorking Out New Material\u201d \u2014 but comedians typically hone new bits at smaller clubs, not in front of more than a thousand people.Sydney Rebarick, a 26-year-old special education teacher, and her cousin Jade Ward, 39, made the two-hour drive from Myrtle Beach.

He was his familiar, high-energy, frenetic self, frequently shifting pitches in his voice and playing different characters. Amid jokes about music he was too old to understand and interracial dating, he did not address the accusations.

And in less than three years, ToloNews and its parent media company have lost 11 staff members to bombings. A minibus carrying workers home was targeted by a bombing in January 2016, killing seven.A native of Kabul, Mr. Faramarz went to school in Turkey and earned a scholarship to study in Kazakhstan.

A ToloNews employee said that when he walked outside to deliver the news, it seemed that Mr. Ahmady\u2019s father, Noorullah, could immediately tell that his son had not survived. Before the employee spoke, Noorullah asked him not to say a word. He said he didn\u2019t need to hear. He walked away, into the distance, and asked to be left alone for a while.Atiqullah, the uncle, said that just two weeks ago he had attended the burial of another of his nephews, a police officer killed in a Taliban attack.\u201cI feel that I am asleep and all this is a nightmare,\u201d the uncle said. \u201cI want someone to wake me up and say everything is O.K.\u201dAt ToloNews on Wednesday, the staff was in shock after the bombing.

But the 9/11 Tribute in Light has come up with a solution. Drs. Farnsworth and Horton are scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.Looking specifically at radar data for Lower Manhattan, we found that the Tribute in Light attracted bird densities at up to 150 times their normal levels on seven of nine Sept. 11 nights from 2008 to 2016 when weather conditions allowed for observation. We estimate that those light beams altered the migratory behavior of more than 1.1 million birds over those seven nights, putting them at risk of collision.So, how to avoid disaster? New York City Audubon has positioned trained volunteers armed with binoculars on the roof of a parking garage in Battery Park City, at the base of the tribute, to monitor aggregations of birds in the tribute light beams. If densities exceed more than 1,000 birds or if a bird is found dead, the lights are shut down to allow the birds to disperse. On the morning of Sept. 12, 2015, the lights on the National 9/11 Memorial & Museum were repeatedly turned off and on.

I feel the nurse betrayed her patient, acted unprofessionally and preyed on my father at a vulnerable time. I despise her! This has caused a huge rift with my father. What to do?ANONYMOUSYour feelings are running hot right now, and understandably so, after your loss. But you make several claims without giving any factual basis for them. (That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have bases, only that you didn\u2019t share them with us.) Let\u2019s unpack this situation carefully.Nurses generally owe a duty of care to their patients \u2014 here, to your mom during treatment, but not after her death, or to her next of kin. Still, like you, I\u2019ve had loved ones who were helped by hospice and palliative care nurses. In our worst moments, they can become like members of the family. That may be a big factor in why you feel so betrayed.Still, while I understand your distress, you haven\u2019t made a case for the nurse behaving unprofessionally toward your mom or preying on your dad. (If you have details, contact the hospital.) The circumstances of this relationship, especially the timing, are not great. But unfortunately we don\u2019t get a deciding vote on how and when people fall in love.That leaves your question: \u201cWhat to do?\u201d Feel your feelings! And talk to someone about them, whether that\u2019s a friend, a social worker or a grief counselor. Right now, it may not be possible for you and your father to console each other. But I hope you will in time. And I\u2019m really sorry for your loss.This spring, my boyfriend and I moved in together to our dream apartment in a beautiful brownstone. Everything has been perfect \u2014 except for one small hiccup. Every few days, our ground-floor neighbor, who enters the building at street level, puts a bin of unwanted household goods on our stoop: old toys, used cans of paint, trophies, etc. (Passers-by can take them if they want.)But we\u2019ve worked hard not to step around trash every day, so we started moving the bin off our stoop and onto the sidewalk next to it. When we came home from work \u2014 you guessed it! \u2014 the bin was back. My boyfriend asked our neighbor to keep the bin on the sidewalk to prevent our tripping over it. But he refused and said we are being O.C.D. What should we do?ANONYMOUSOh, my dear brownstone dweller, I\u2019m sorry that it took a nasty downstairs neighbor to teach you an important life lesson: Nothing is perfect. Ever. These bins (of junk) constitute safety hazards and possibly city or fire code violations whether your neighbor places them on the sidewalk or on your stoop.You tried to address the situation directly and failed. Turn this matter over to your landlord. (Neighborly disputes are part of the job description.) But don\u2019t give up until the bins are gone. If dried-up quarts of paint have any value, your neighbor should donate them to charitable organizations. Otherwise they\u2019re just litter, or the beginning of a personal injury suit.Since I was a teenager, my mother has highlighted the careers of brides in wedding announcements in the newspaper and left them around for me to find. Now that I\u2019m an adult, she sends me photos of the bios she finds relevant. She has good intentions, but her suggestions tend to be far-flung and unhelpful. I\u2019ve also been successful in figuring out my career on my own. How do I ask her nicely to stop?G.K.Not to be a troublemaker, but I interpret your mother\u2019s behavior differently. Given that her total frame of reference is the wedding section, isn\u2019t it more likely that she\u2019s highlighting careers she thinks may be more compatible with (imminent) marriage than yours? (Or maybe not.) Just say, \u201cMom, I know you mean well. But your vows-inspired career advice feels like criticism of my choices. I\u2019m happy in my work and not looking for a change. So, no more wedding announcements, O.K.?\u201dI began attending a large group meditation to cope with some major life events. My day job requires lots of social interaction, so the meditation is a welcome escape. But for several weeks, a man I don\u2019t know seeks me out when I arrive. He then tries to strike up conversations with me by asking questions about my life and work. How can I signal that I\u2019d rather be left alone?E.O.How would you feel about the truth, delivered kindly to a fellow meditator? \u201cYou know, my job requires a lot of talking. So, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019d like to use the time before meditation to prepare quietly. Thanks!\u201d That should do the trick.Advertisement"}

Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusation against Brett Kavanaugh needs to be seriously investigated.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Whatever becomes of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s process for considering him has been a mockery from the start \u2014 a mockery of lawmakers\u2019 constitutional responsibility and of the ideal that the court should be anything more than a political trophy.The bulk of the blame lies with Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, and his fellow Republicans, who have abused their power by refusing to let their colleagues and the American people see over 90 percent of the documents relating to Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s critical years in the federal government. Judge Kavanaugh sullied the proceedings himself by testifying, under oath, in ways that were at best misleading, about his role in several high-profile actions taken by the George W. Bush administration, where he worked in the White House counsel\u2019s office and as staff secretary to the president.Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, is also now facing legitimate questions, over her handling of the sexual-assault allegation against Judge Kavanaugh that she received this summer but held back, based on a request for confidentiality, until it was leaked to the news media last week.Now the committee has a chance to partly redeem itself, by allowing a thorough investigation and then holding an open hearing to address Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s accusation against Judge Kavanaugh about a night while they were in high school.Republicans complain that this is nothing but a Democratic plot to derail Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination by delaying any vote until after the midterm elections. (If anyone knows about unjustly delaying Supreme Court confirmations, it\u2019s Senate Republicans.) Well, Democrats no doubt would prefer to delay a vote. And now that that\u2019s out of the way, can we please focus on what really matters here? What matters is that Dr. Blasey has made a serious, specific and credible allegation. Sure, Democrats may want to investigate that claim fully. But so should anyone concerned about protecting the Supreme Court\u2019s integrity, not to mention the reputations of both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey.Yet Mr. Grassley has rejected calls to involve the F.B.I. and offered to hear only from Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh themselves, even though there are numerous people who might be able to shed light on what may have happened on the night in question. First among these is Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s high school friend Mark Judge, who Dr. Blasey said was in the room where she said the assault occurred, and who has given shifting answers about his recollections.Certainly there\u2019s no statute of limitations preventing the committee from weighing allegations of attempted rape against a nominee to a lifetime seat on the highest court in the land. Besides, since Judge Kavanaugh has flatly denied the accusation, his honesty now \u2014 not as a teenager \u2014 is at issue.But so far, Senate Republicans seem more concerned with getting Judge Kavanaugh confirmed than in getting to the truth of the accusation against him. Republicans know that their Senate majority is at risk on Nov. 6, and they want to seize their chance to give the court a solid right-wing majority for years to come.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Merkel to Blame for Brexit?", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHer mixed messages on labor mobility and refugees drove Britain away. Now she has a chance to fix things.Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit.HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 Angela Merkel is the chancellor of Germany, not the prime minister of Britain, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that she played a critical, if indirect, role in Britain\u2019s 2016 vote to leave the European Union. If not for her decision not long before the vote to allow for uncontrolled mass immigration into the heart of Europe, the pro-Brexit forces might have lost. Remember that, like President Trump\u2019s election that same year, Brexit was dismissed as an impossibility, until it happened. But unlike in the United States, Europe has not done much in the way of asking what happened, and why.In late 2015, the Leave campaign started putting up placards which showed the exodus of refugees from Syria and other countries through the Balkans, and adorned them with slogans like \u201cBreaking Point\u201d and \u201cTake Back Control.\u201d With Ms. Merkel declaring an open-door policy, the message hit home for millions of worried Britons and Europeans. Not coincidentally, it was around this time that support for Brexit began to tick up.If members of the chancellor\u2019s government recognize her complicity, they don\u2019t show it. Ms. Merkel\u2019s diplomats in Berlin treat the looming farewell of the second-biggest economy in the European Union as if it were merely another tiresome bureaucratic process that needs to be handled according to the treaty rules. If they consider the bigger picture at all, it is to think of ways to scare off other union members from following Britain\u2019s lead.There is, in other words, a near total lack of strategic thinking in the face of the most severe blow the European Union has ever suffered. Britain is not just another member, something officials in Berlin tell themselves repeatedly. Its exit will remove a good part of the union\u2019s international clout. London is not just a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, it has significant military and diplomatic forces, as well as Europe\u2019s best intelligence service. And, as a frequent outlier on European Union debates, it was always an important dissenting voice at the table in Brussels. Strangely, while other member states listened (often grudgingly) to Britain while it sat at that table, they are paying no attention to the message being sent by its departure. Britain is leaving because too many of its people became unhappy with one of the union\u2019s governing principles, namely the free movement of workers. In a healthy, functioning organization, such a departure would lead the remaining members to revisit that principle. This is especially true if other member states have exempted themselves from that rule in the past.A bit of background: When the European Union took in 10 mostly central European states in 2004, the German government sought the right to restrict free movement of laborers for a period of up to seven years. Ms. Merkel, then the opposition leader, thought those restrictions did not go far enough to protect the German labor market against an feared influx of low-wage workers from Poland and the Czech Republic. The government should have installed an even \u201cbetter protection mechanism,\u201d Ms. Merkel insisted in spring 2005.Britain\u2019s prime minister at the time, Tony Blair, did nothing of this sort; he left his country\u2019s borders open to internal immigrants from every member state, old or new. As a result, over the next decade, around two million people from Central and Eastern Europe migrated to Britain. While they integrated well into the labor market, the influx strained public services like schools, health care and transport.In other words, Germany has no excuse not to lead a period of union-wide introspection into its own failure to keep Britain in the group, and whether the union should revisit its principles in light of that failure. The union is not just lacking in vision, its hardball approach to Brexit is likely to backfire. Has anyone in Berlin or Paris thought about the consequences of an economic downturn in Britain after a Brexit, or, much worse, after a \u201chard,\u201d no-deal Brexit that could entail a customs barrier across the English Channel? It does not take much imagination to realize on whom the Murdoch yellow press outlets (and not only them) will pin the blame for the downfall: stubborn, egoistic, Anglophobic Europeans.Given what is at stake, Brussels and Berlin are gambling with far too poor a hand. What, after all, is to be gained from a stumbling, humiliated, angry and alienated Britain?For those of us who still want to see a vibrant, unified Europe, our best hope for the moment is the faint chance for a second referendum on Brexit. If Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plan on how to leave does not find approval in Westminster, the question of whether to leave with no deal at all could be put to the British people: Look, is this really what you want?It is a remote possibility, yet it offers Ms. Merkel her own second chance \u2014 an opportunity to do everything she can to show British voters that the European Union is worth keeping. She could begin by endorsing limits \u2014 even slight ones \u2014 on the free internal movement of labor. Done right, it would send a signal that Brussels and Berlin are listening to voters, while doing minimal harm to Europe\u2019s labor markets.This would not hurt the principle of free movement as such. It would also be a move that the Germans themselves might find attractive, given that a new batch of countries \u2014 this time in the western Balkans \u2014 are lining up for membership. Whatever her answer, the choice is pretty clear for the European Union: reform, or face the next revolt.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "My Friend Wrote a Book Before He Died. Could I Read His Handwriting?", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySam\u2019s legacy depended on my ability to decipher his notebook pages.Ms. Sittenfeld is a novelist.I knew my friend Samuel Park\u2019s handwriting well, its curves and spikes and looping lowercase g\u2019s and y\u2019s. I\u2019d first become acquainted with both him and his handwriting in college, when we worked together on the school newspaper. We were co-editors of the arts and entertainment section, and we would mark up the pages by hand and leave notes for each other. We shared a desk \u2014 sometimes we shared it sequentially, and sometimes we shared it simultaneously, sitting side by side. After college, we wrote each other letters \u2014 this was in the late \u201990s \u2014 about books we read, experiences we had, and people we hoped might fall in love with us. Spoiler: They rarely did, though I still think Sam gave me the all-time best tip ever for getting a guy to kiss you. It\u2019s that you convey there\u2019s a 100 percent chance you want him to.So by 2017, after 20 years of friendship, I was in a good position to decipher Sam\u2019s handwriting. The problem was that this was the last thing I wanted to do. Sam had died a few weeks earlier, and I was one of the people now trying to get his words right.Remarkably, Sam had written a novel during the first round of chemo, radiation and surgery for stomach cancer. He\u2019d then used his second round of cancer treatment to revise. Sam liked to give the impression that he\u2019d have made a magnificent aristocratic layabout, like a character created by Jane Austen or Oscar Wilde. But in reality, he worked hard, was casually brilliant and, among other talents, spoke five languages, the third of which was English. His first language was Portuguese because he\u2019d lived in Brazil until the age of 14, and his second was Korean, the native tongue of his parents. Like Sam himself, one of the characters in his novel was undergoing treatment for stomach cancer. \u201cBeing ill turned the sick person into a celebrity of sorts,\u201d Sam\u2019s protagonist observed, describing a character named Kathryn, a cancer patient, receiving visitors in her bedroom, \u201cdrinking hibiscus tea with them, exchanging pleasantries, Kathryn subtly apologizing for reminding them of their own mortality.\u201dHe was still putting the finishing touches on the book, which he titled \u201cThe Caregiver,\u201d a few weeks before he died. In the last month of his life that no one knew for certain was the last month, when he was very weak, he gave a notebook to his friend Jim, who also was a writer. The notebook contained three handwritten passages that Sam had told both his agent and Jim he wanted inserted into the novel, based on feedback from his editor.Sam\u2019s handwriting was lovely yet, even under the best of circumstances, not completely legible. These were not the best of circumstances. In the lined notebook pages, he had crossed out sentences, made additions in the margins, and in some cases crossed out the margin additions and inserted new additions. One section was eight handwritten pages; one was six; and one was 10.Jim typed up Sam\u2019s sentences as best he could, with what I\u2019d estimate was 70 percent accuracy. In many places, Sam\u2019s handwriting was so hard to read that Jim had simply put brackets with ellipses inside that looked like this: [\u2026]. Lest it sound otherwise, I was impressed with Jim\u2019s efforts. I also know firsthand that writers are precise, and few of us would be content with our words being published 70 percent as we intended.Jim emailed me his transcriptions as well as copies of Sam\u2019s original handwritten pages. I printed one copy of the handwritten pages and two copies of the typed pages. Then I sat on a couch with my husband, and we went very slowly. My husband read aloud from one set of typed pages while I followed along on the handwritten ones. When my husband encountered the ellipses or when I perceived a mismatch between Jim\u2019s wording and Sam\u2019s, my husband would pause while I tried to discern what the words really said. I\u2019d then mark the changes or additions in my own typed pages. Even though this was essentially a clerical task, I was struck repeatedly by the force of Sam\u2019s voice, his graceful turns of phrase and amusing observations.The publication of a novel always feels to me like a minor miracle, a kind of something-from-nothing alchemy. \u201cThe Caregiver\u201d came out last Tuesday. That Sam isn\u2019t here is, of course, heartbreaking. But his miracle is no less miraculous, and perhaps it is more so.Curtis Sittenfeld is the author of several novels, including \u201cEligible\u201d and \u201cPrep.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It also means making it easier for people to buy and sell weapons of mass killing, for lawmakers to green-light discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender Americans, for industries to pollute the environment with impunity, and for the wealthy to purchase even more political influence than they already have. One might reasonably ask, why even bother with confirmation hearings? Ideally, these hearings would inform senators and the American people about the men and women who are seeking an unelected, lifetime job on the nation\u2019s highest court. But that would require a level of honesty on the part of both the senators and the nominees themselves. Unfortunately, recent nominees by presidents of both parties have taken the wrong lesson from the Bork hearings, clamming up when asked even the most basic questions about their constitutional philosophy. As a result, the public learns almost nothing useful, and the confirmation vote becomes an exercise in blind political tribalism. Democrats howl now, as they should, but they will likely return the favor as soon as they\u2019re back in power, perhaps by trying to expand the size of the court. Politics will always be a part of Supreme Court nominations, but if the court is going to retain the credibility it needs to function as a pillar of American democracy, both parties must find a way to put the nation\u2019s long-term interest over their own.

{"Headline": "These Are Not Disposable Allies", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the United States really wants stability in Syria, it needs to back the Kurds politically and practically, not just with weapons. Ms. Marcus is the author of \u201cBlood and Belief: The P.K.K. and the Kurdish Fight for Independence.\u201dGoverning has proved difficult. Bureaucrats and others in the Civil Service, who, according to Kurdish officials number some 190,000 people excluding the police, are often untrained and inexperienced. Combined with limited funding and the continuing battle with the Islamic State, the Kurdish-led authority has found it hard to provide the necessary services to support the population and foster stability.The Kurdish region faces an additional challenge in the de facto embargo that is imposed on it by its neighbors and the rest of the world. Turkey has closed its border with the area and even blocked off portions of it with a concrete wall. Opportunities for trade with neighboring Iraq or the rest of Syria are severely limited. International aid, such as from the United States and Europe, goes mostly to refugee camps or the Arab areas around Raqqa or Manbij and ignores majority-Kurdish areas. This weakens the administration and paralyzes economic development.Washington has hesitated to recognize the ruling authority as the legitimate governing body for the area it controls because the Y.P.G. and its main political arm, known as the P.Y.D. were created by the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or P.K.K., the Turkish Kurdish group fighting a decades-old insurgency against Turkey. Both Turkey and the United States list the P.K.K. as a terrorist group.There are good reasons to criticize the Kurdish leadership. The P.Y.D. and the associated political and military institutions exert tight control in northeast Syria. Its administration harasses opposition parties, few of which still operate.Yet aiding the Kurds militarily and ignoring them politically doesn\u2019t promote a more politically tolerant society, nor does it encourage stability. The only way to build an alternative to the chaos and repressive dictatorship in the rest of Syria is through recognition of the Kurdish-led administration and active political engagement.The United States can use its support as a lever to push for a more open system in the Kurdish-controlled areas. The United States can include opposition and independent activists in political meetings in northeastern Syria, and it can demand the administration lift regulations that impede activities by groups and individuals not part of the self-rule authority\u2019s affiliated political organizations.At the same time, the United States and the European Union should help the Syrian Kurds on technical issues, such as water and sewage. They should help to train a professional bureaucracy that works on the basis of competence and skill rather than on party loyalty.It is the time for Washington to stop treating the Kurds as effective but disposable partners in the fight against the jihadists. The Kurdish experiment in Syria, however flawed, is a possible route to long-term stability. With assistance and recognition, the United States can salvage part of Syria, give the Kurds the backing they need to demand a fair settlement from Damascus and retain a base for future operations against violent extremists.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "25 Years After Oslo Accords, Mideast Peace Seems Remote as Ever", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERICHO, West Bank \u2014 When the Oslo peace accords were signed a quarter-century ago, residents of Jericho celebrated. Their dusty, 11,000-year-old desert city was given autonomy before anywhere else on the West Bank. Palestinians saw it as a foothold for what they trusted would become their own new state.But nothing has turned out as they expected.A shiny new casino, opened with great fanfare in 1998 to entice Israeli gamblers, has been empty since 2000, when they were barred from entering the city. The two-decade-old public hospital finally just got an elevator thanks to a donation from Japan. Perhaps the best-known institution of self-government in town is the jail, widely feared as a dungeon for political prisoners.The brilliant Palestinian future conjured by Oslo has instead become a bitter trap.They called for a comprehensive peace agreement by 1999, which was widely expected to lead to statehood for the Palestinians, and for Israel, realization of the long-held goal of land for peace.Today, however, the Oslo process is moribund, having produced neither a peace agreement nor a Palestinian state. About its only lasting substantive achievement is the Palestinian Authority, established as an interim self-government but still going two decades after its expiration date. The authority has made strides in providing basic services and created jobs for roughly a quarter of the work force, but it has grown increasingly autocratic and has been plagued by accusations of corruption.\u201cThe Oslo agreement was a catastrophe for the Palestinian people,\u201d said Ahmed Daraghmeh, 26, a clerk from Tubas, in the northern West Bank, who was in Jericho to pick up a friend being released from an Israeli jail. \u201cThere is no work. I work for the Palestinian Authority, even though I am against it.\u201dThat the Palestinian Authority has endured and the peace process has collapsed attests to how much Israel has gained. Oslo made the Palestinians responsible for policing themselves in the West Bank, which has led to vast improvements in Israeli security from terrorism in recent years at little cost to Israel. It gave the authority responsibility for providing services like sanitation and hospitals that would otherwise cost Israel, as the occupying power, hundreds of millions of dollars. And it has allowed Israel to postpone, seemingly indefinitely, a broader withdrawal from the West Bank.What the Palestinians have to show for these 25 years, however, is a much more muddled ledger \u2014 and a cautionary tale of how statehood delayed can harden into statehood denied.If Oslo has failed the Palestinians, part of that failure is self-inflicted. An increase in terrorist attacks after Oslo\u2019s signing, followed by the deadly Second Intifada that erupted in 2000, soured many Israelis on peacemaking and eventually led Israel to sideline the process.Palestinians have been left in a depressing limbo: Even as their leadership has consistently failed to establish a coherent, united front for independence, the authority\u2019s bureaucrats have become steadily more effective at administering, and controlling, the lives of West Bank residents.In Israel, the peace camp that backed Oslo has withered from waves of violence. The dominant right wing debates whether merely to manage the occupation in perpetuity or to declare victory and annex much of the West Bank. The number of Israeli settlers there, in what much of the world considers a violation of international law, has more than tripled, to about 400,000. Another 200,000 live in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their future capital.With the Arab world largely uninterested in coming to the Palestinians\u2019 aid, President Trump has been overturning the fundamental axioms of everyone who has tried to broker peace. He boasts of having taken Jerusalem \u201coff the table\u201d by recognizing it as Israel\u2019s capital, is working to minimize the problem of refugees by trying to strip their descendantsof refugee status, and has refused even to endorse the two-state solution, the goal that led the Palestinians to Oslo in the first place.All of which leaves the Palestinians stuck, having pursued the Oslo dream as far as an antechamber only to conclude that the cramped room has no exit.Oslo\u2019s security arrangement \u2014 which gave the Palestinians responsibility for internal security and, in coordination with Israel, fighting terrorism \u2014 undergirds that trap. The deal reduced the need for Israeli soldiers to patrol hostile areas of the West Bank, and protected the authority\u2019s leadership against Hamas.Economically, too, the current arrangement serves Israel\u2019s interests: The authority\u2019s foreign donors subsidize government services on the West Bank, relieving Israel of the obligation. Palestinians exist on Israeli goods, food, fuel and electricity. And rising consumer debt is only cementing the status quo, experts say.\u201cYou have a whole group of Palestinians in the West Bank who are dependent on P.A. jobs for their car payments and their mortgages,\u201d said Nathan Thrall, the director of the Arab-Israeli Project at International Crisis Group, \u201cand they look with real fear at the possibility of Oslo, which is to say the P.A., collapsing.\u201dApportioning blame occupies a cottage industry of analysts, ex-negotiators, lobbyists and partisans.It was a right-wing Israeli extremist who massacred 29 Muslims in Hebron in 1994, setting off a first wave of bombings, and another who assassinated Mr. Rabin in 1995, gravely imperiling Oslo. It was Israel that halted agreed-upon withdrawals from occupied territory, leaving itself in full control of 60 percent of the West Bank. Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza was so abrupt that critics say it contributed to the Hamas takeover.And Israel has expanded settlements, not only seizing more land but also demoralizing its Palestinian neighbors, said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel. \u201cOn one side of the road is a Palestinian village, and on the other side is a brand-new Israeli town with red-roofed houses, swimming pools, greenery and trees, and on a commanding hill,\u201d he said.But there is also much for the Palestinians to rue in their own decisions and actions.Whatever the justification, Palestinian violence crippled the peace process and led to other lasting setbacks: Israel\u2019s re-invasion of West Bank cities in 2002, when it destroyed much the authority had built, and its construction of a barrier wall that bred resentment, entrenched some land grabs, and \u2014 in achieving the laudable goal of reducing terrorist attacks \u2014 allowed Israelis to largely tune out the Palestinians and the occupation altogether.\u201cWhat they got,\u201d said Mr. Kurtzer, who remembers a sinking feeling evident on the faces of some Palestinians at the 1993 ceremony, \u201cwas poorly negotiated.\u201dOthers question the wisdom of entrusting the P.L.O. with any counterterrorism responsibility early on. \u201cArafat didn\u2019t do enough to stop terror,\u201d said David Hacham, who represented the Israeli defense ministry in the Oslo process. \u201cEither because he couldn\u2019t, or because he didn\u2019t see it as important enough at the time.\u201dThe Israelis also soon realized that the Palestinians were not ready to bend on their principles and even denied Jewish historical claims in Jerusalem. At the Camp David talks in the summer of 2000, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, made what most Israelis considered a generous offer for a final agreement, but the talks collapsed.\u201cThere was really a feeling we were beginning a new chapter in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\u201d Mr. Hacham said of Oslo\u2019s beginnings. But by 2000 it was \u201ca dialogue of the deaf,\u201d he said. \u201cArafat was not ready to cross the Rubicon.\u201dSome Israelis argue that the Palestinians have still not tempered their ideology sufficiently to persuade them that Palestinian statehood need not threaten Israeli identity. \u201cWhat is the reason Netanyahu views a Palestinian state as a security risk?\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, an analyst at Crisis Group. \u201cHe thinks Palestinians will continue to teach their children that Zionism is unjust and that the state next door should not exist as a state for the Jewish people.\u201dDespite the leadership\u2019s failures, many Palestinians still accept the authority as the least-bad option \u2014 although, given its longevity, nearly equaling the 26 years of pre-Oslo occupation from after the 1967 war until 1993, it is the only reality many of them know.Propped up with around $500 million a year in foreign aid, about 12 percent of its budget, the authority is the biggest Palestinian employer, providing livelihoods for around 150,000 workers and their dependents, roughly a quarter of the population. After the chaos of two uprisings, many credit it with restoring law and order.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the Palestinian Authority, people would be killing each other, left, right and center,\u201d said Tariq Halabi, 18, as he sat with friends in the hardscrabble Jalazoun refugee camp near a memorial to residents killed by Israeli fire.Palestinian Authority officials blame Israel for many of its problems, including the absence of democracy and economic progress. \u201cThe Israeli occupation controls the air we breathe in the West Bank or Gaza,\u201d said Jamal Rajoub, the deputy governor of Jericho. \u201cThe P.A. wants to improve the lives of the people, but everything is tied up with the Israeli occupation. The Palestinians are not free. We cannot open our wings and fly unless we are blind to reality.\u201dAnd the authority\u2019s supporters say that for all its faults, it has improved life for most Palestinians.\u201cMost people, including me, will say that after 25 years of Oslo we have nothing politically,\u201d said Dr. Nasser Anani,the director of Jericho\u2019s public hospital, which was built and equipped mostly with Japanese and American funds. \u201cBut life is better.\u201dGovernment health insurance is $22 a month, dozens of schools have been built, and a driving license can be had in about 10 minutes. \u201cI now have a Palestinian passport,\u201d Dr. Anani said. \u201cEven the United States recognizes it.\u201dBut many revile the authority \u2014 complaining of nepotism and corruption \u2014 as much as they may acknowledge its efficiency here or there.\u201cWhat Oslo created,\u201d said Mr. Tartir of Al-Shabaka, \u201cwas a clear benefit for some Palestinians and the political elite. Everyone else has to live with the consequences, but doesn\u2019t really have a say.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a jungle,\u201d said Ahmed Rashid, 22, an unemployed Jalazoun resident, who said he spent time in an Israeli prison in 2015 for throwing stones, then in the authority\u2019s Jericho jail in 2017 on vague security charges. \u201cThe strong eat the weak.\u201dHalf of Palestinians view the authority as a burden, the new survey found. Those aged 18 to 22 tend to have no trust in the elite and are more supportive of a one-state outcome than a two-state solution, seeing a corrupt and authoritarian state as \u201cnot worth having,\u201d said Khalil Shikaki, the director of the Ramallah-based polling center.\u201cIt\u2019s all lies,\u201d said Firial Qarawil, 53, a nurse from Awarta. \u201cThey promised us a state. Where is the state? All the agreements and all the authorities, including ours, have taken us back more than 60 years.\u201dWith Mr. Abbas and his lieutenants focused on surviving the Trump administration, others outside his circle are urging Palestinians to re-examine their increasingly undemocratic political system \u2014 and to reboot it, if not smash and rebuild it entirely.\u201cUltimately, the question is how many people on the ground are represented in the political system, and today that\u2019s few,\u201d said Sam Bahour, a Ramallah businessman. \u201cWithout giving the youth an opportunity to breathe, politically, they will remain in the streets. And that will lead to something negative.\u201dIn Jericho, resignation, more than anger, seemed the prevailing mood. \u201cWe sleep with our doors open,\u201d Said Hamis Ermalieh, 52, a school bus driver, said as he looked out over the city from his hilltop home. \u201cBut life is difficult.\u201dHis wife, Kamayil, 48, said of the Palestinian Authority, \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dIt was twilight, and the neon lights on a Ferris wheel flickered on at an empty amusement park in the distance, twinkling like the Las Vegas that Jericho had never become.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

They made matzo ball soup, challah, gefilte fish \u2014 dishes that were typical of Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, born of scarcity and cold climates and seemingly far different from Mexican cooking, with its abundant produce and aromatic spices.

The chicken is glazed with a mixture of apricot jam, butter, garlic and oil, and served with a vibrant pan sauce made with more apricot butter, red wine vinegar, shallots and pan drippings.For her friend Daniel Hirschhorn, it is a radical departure from the Jewish food he grew up eating in Mexico City. His parents, who were very traditional, didn\u2019t care for chiles and spices. But Mr. Hirschhorn adores Ms. Gerson\u2019s cooking. \u201cShe totally was able to synthesize our old-school traditions with these flavors,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is the Mexican balaboosta\u201d \u2014 a Yiddish term for a perfect hostess.Advertisement"}

He was 61.The state-controlled Vietnam News Agency said the death resulted from an unspecified \u201cserious illness.\u201dNguyen Quoc Trieu, a government doctor, was quoted by the state news media as saying that Mr. Quang had died of \u201ca rare and serious viral disease\u201d at a military hospital in Hanoi, the capital. Mr. Quang had fallen ill last July and traveled to Japan six times for treatment, Dr. Trieu said.Vietnam, like China, is governed by an authoritarian Communist Party but promotes a version of state capitalism. Unlike China, where Xi Jinping is both president and Communist Party chief, Vietnam has a power structure in which responsibilities at the top are split among a party chief; a president, who serves as head of state; and a prime minister, who runs the government.He was also a former chief of the country\u2019s powerful Ministry of Public Security, which oversees the uniformed police and a network of intelligence agents known to spy on civilians.Since 2016, top party officials have used the security ministry to intensify an anticorruption purge against some of their comrades. Some political analysts see the campaign as internal party rivalries spilling out into the open, rather than as a bona fide project to clean up Vietnam\u2019s systemic corruption.Several former Vietnamese officials declined to comment on Mr. Quang\u2019s death when reached by telephone on Friday. But on Facebook, Vietnamese intellectuals spoke of him in withering terms.\u201cSince Mr. Tran Dai Quang was highly educated, many people had a lot of hope for him,\u201d the human rights lawyer Tran Vu Hai said in an interview. But when he took over the security ministry, Mr. Hai said, \u201cthe situation for dissidents remained the same.\u201dTran Dai Quang was born in the northern province of Ninh Binh in 1956, two years after Vietnam shook off colonial rule by defeating the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.In the 1970s, Mr. Quang joined the security ministry, through which he rose after earning a doctorate in law. He became security chief in 2011 and received the rank of police general a year later.He spent the latter part of his career on the party\u2019s elite 19-member Politburo, which essentially sets the government\u2019s agenda.Mr. Quang was one of two senior Communist Party officials who were once thought to be in the running for party chief if Mr. Trong, 74, retired before the end of his five-year term, the Vietnam expert Carl Thayer wrote in January.However, Mr. Thayer added, last year\u2019s abduction from Germany of Trinh Xuan Thanh, the former head of a state-owned fuel company\u2019s subsidiary, was a \u201cmajor political embarrassment\u201d for Mr. Quang that threatened his chances of becoming party chief.Mr. Quang is survived by his wife and two sons, the state news media said.It is rare for a sitting Vietnamese president to die in office, and Mr. Quang\u2019s death will leave a political vacuum on the Politburo, said Huong Le Thu, an expert on Asian security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Canberra. She said the choice could affect which party faction \u2014 Mr. Trong\u2019s or that of his political rivals \u2014 gains the upper hand.Chau Doan contributed reporting from Hanoi.Advertisement"}

Though the earbuds are well designed and comfortable to wear lying down, they didn\u2019t help me sleep more. Over all, the product did a good job of helping me ignore annoying noises at night, which helped me conclude that noise was not the root of my sleep problems.Here\u2019s what I found.The Sleepbuds are a solid piece of industrial design. A metal hockey-puck-shaped case slides open to reveal the earbuds. The case holds each earbud in place with magnets. When you remove the earbuds, they turn on; when you clip the earbuds back onto the magnets, the case recharges their batteries. This clever design is reminiscent of Apple\u2019s AirPods, which also come in a carrying case that doubles as a charger.Yet the Bose case could be better. When you open it up, its LED light illuminates to signal that the Sleepbuds are charging. That is helpful for seeing the tiny earbuds in the dark. The downside is that the case does not light up when you open it to store the Sleepbuds. When I got up early in the morning before the sun came up, I struggled to put the Sleepbuds back inside the case in the dark and ended up leaving them on my nightstand.The earbud modules are also extremely small \u2014 about the size of a pinkie fingertip. You insert them into silicone tips that go into your ear canal and tuck under your ear ridge. Bose provides three sizes, and I used the small eartips.The Sleepbuds are noise-masking \u2014 not noise-canceling \u2014 earbuds. Noise-canceling earphones eliminate low-frequency noises, like the engine of an airplane, but they don\u2019t cancel out loud noises like a snorer next to you or a screaming baby. Noise masking involves playing a background noise that helps your brain stop paying attention to unwanted sounds.Because the Sleepbuds were designed to muffle unwanted noise, they specifically play sounds like raindrops or a water stream. There were only 10 sounds, none of which I loved. I ended up choosing the raindrops track, which did a fine job drowning out noise from my pets.But for earbuds this pricey, shouldn\u2019t there be more than 10 tracks to choose from?Brian Mulcahey, a director of Bose\u2019s wellness products, said that to preserve battery life, the sound files are stored on the earbuds, which have limited storage, rather than streamed from a smartphone \u2014 hence the few options. He added that in about a month, Bose would release more tracks that people would be able to load onto the earbuds, including sounds designed to help people ease their anxiety or fight insomnia.\u201cWe\u2019re hearing from many, many customers that this is a very common problem,\u201d Mr. Mulcahey said about mental issues preventing sleep.In the end, I recommend trying the Sleepbuds if you have sleep problems \u2014 with many caveats.Before considering Sleepbuds, try to determine what is preventing you from sleeping. Experts said a plethora of problems contributed to slumber deprivation, including noise, mental or physical health problems, and diet. And even if noise is your No. 1 culprit and you buy the Sleepbuds, take notes on your sleep quality for a few weeks. Many people simply can\u2019t sleep comfortably with objects inside their ears, so if these don\u2019t work out for you, take advantage of the 30-day return policy.For me, I\u2019m lucky if I sleep longer than six hours a night without interruptions. With the Sleepbuds, I continued getting an average of about five and a half hours of sleep a night.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Germany\u2019s Nazi Past Is Still Present", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEIt is often held up as a model liberal democracy that has fully reckoned with its horrendous crimes. It hasn\u2019t. Mr. Stanley is a professor of philosophy at Yale and the author of \u201cHow Fascism Works.\u201dDuring the election campaign, in Sept. 2017, one of its party leaders, Alexander Gauland, gave a speech in which he said that \u201cno other people have been so clearly presented with a false past as the Germans.\u201d Gauland called for \u201cthe past to be returned to the people of Germany,\u201d by which he meant a past in which Germans were free to be \u201cproud of the accomplishments of our soldiers in both world wars.\u201dAll of this is hard for Americans to understand. Germany plays a special role in our political and intellectual life; it is often held up as an example of country that, unlike the United States, has boldly faced down its own horrendous past, then moved on to become a true liberal democracy. Even in concerned discussions of the far right movements gaining ground in Europe over the past year \u2014 in which countries like Hungary, France and Sweden have been often mentioned \u2014 Germany seemed to be politely left out of the conversation. Germany had atoned and \u201cmoved on.\u201dThis is not to say that Germany has not gone a long way toward national transformation. But the rise of the AfD and the outburst of racial hatred and violence in Chemnitz, explicitly linked to its Nazi past, shows how difficult that struggle to maintain a liberal democratic culture has been, and the power of the history against which this battle has been fought. If Germany is to be praised it is precisely because its history is ever-present, its struggle ongoing, and not because that history has been overcome.I have visited Berlin regularly for more than 30 years. On my first day there each time I do the same thing \u2014 I go to Olivaer Platz in Charlottenburg and have a coffee in a cafe overlooking the square. Olivaer Platz was my father Manfred\u2019s favorite park growing up as a child in Berlin in the 1930s. His grandparents Jakob and Rosa lived down the street on Kurf\u00fcrstendamm. They lived several blocks from the Fasanenstrasse synagogue, where my great-grandfather Magnus Davidsohn was the chief cantor from 1912 until its destruction on Kristallnacht. The happiest memories my father retained from his Berlin childhood are from playing in Olivaer Platz. This is also where my father was beaten repeatedly, once so viciously that his nanny had to carry him bleeding and unconscious home to his mother. When I first came to Berlin, in 1985, I was a Congress-Bundestag exchange scholar, living for a year with a host family in the Ruhrgebiet. We scholarship recipients had as part of our schedule a trip to Berlin, where we were greeted by German Bundestag deputies and taken on a tour of the city. That year, the president of the Bundestag, Phillip Jenninger, addressed our group. In his speech, he lamented German suffering \u2014 but not the suffering of my German family. Instead, he spoke at length of the almost hundred or so Germans who had been killed in the previous quarter century trying to cross the Berlin Wall, as well as the families split asunder by the division of Germany. My family, too, had been split apart by Germany\u2019s divisions. My grandfather Alexander Intrator received his visa to London in 1938. My grandmother Ilse stayed along with my father through the horrors of Kristallnacht and until July 1939, when miraculously and at the last possible moment they received visas to the United States. My father was not reunited with his father for another decade, which rendered impossible the close ties that often form between parent and child. My German family was ripped violently from their roots. My grandmother Ilse writes in her 1957 memoir:Though I was proud at being privileged to begin a second life, remote from the place where I was born, I was no exception to the feeling of anguish. My roots were struck deeply in their native German soil. Perhaps a part broke and remained there, for how am I to explain that my heart at times seems to be drawn by a force thousands of miles away? \u2026 Today the scars still hurt from tearing out the roots, as the stump of an amputated leg causes a man to say, \u201cMy foot hurts;\u201d and yet he knows there is no foot to hurt.In the consciousness of intellectuals outside Germany, where I have spent most of my life, Germany is indeed connected to its past, but mainly positively. Germany is everywhere presented as the model country, as one of the few countries in history that has honestly faced its crimes. It is a clich\u00e9 in the world that Germany had a \u201creckoning\u201d with its past. Indeed, Germany is lifted up as a singular example of a moral nation, a nation that has faced its history honestly, the world champions of memory. But when was this moment of reckoning, this time at which Germany faced its past? The Historikerstreit was a debate held in the mid to late 1980s in Germany about whether or not it was time for the country to move on from discussing its Nazi past. It is a presupposition of that debate that Germany\u2019s \u201creckoning with its past\u201d had been going on for some time before that. In fact, the reckoning must have happened very long before the Historikerstreit, since the central thesis being debated was that it was long past time for such a reckoning to be over. I went to high school and university in Germany in the mid 1980s, around the time of the Historikerstreit. Its presuppositions do not surprise me. At that time, to raise the matter of my family\u2019s past was to risk defensiveness and ire. The reaction was always the same, even when I simply explained my parents\u2019 history. \u201cAmerica hasn\u2019t faced up to its history of slavery\u201d or \u201cWhat about the genocide of Native Americans?\u201d and \u201cWhat about Vietnam?\u201d Germans at the time were telling me that they were being unfairly burdened with guilt. As the Czech-born historian Saul Friedl\u00e4nder emphasized in his work, German dialogues about its past seem to have taken place without much interest in the perspectives of one group whom they also concern, the German Jews, and their descendants. German reconciliation was in the main a discussion between non-Jewish Germans among themselves. And yet, a dialogue about facing the past that occurs internally between the descendants of those complicit in terrible evil, without any significant interest in the perspectives of the descendants of those terribly affected by this evil, falls short of a full reckoning, just as a discussion of patriarchy only among men would be deficient. Similarly, a German discussion of the past without the voices of German Jews or Eastern Europeans is no reckoning at all.Some myths are politically useful. A primary force in National Socialism, for instance, was a deep-seated belief in German superiority, the specifically German equivalent of what is sometimes called \u201cwhite supremacy.\u201d This belief in German superiority has never in fact been vigorously challenged in that country. The 1919 \u201cGuidelines\u201d of the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (DAP) \u2014 the German Workers\u2019 Party, the original name of the Nazi Party \u2014 asks \u201cWho is the DAP fighting against?\u201d The answer is \u201cAgainst all those who create no value, who make high profits without any mental or physical work. We fight against the drones in the state; these are mostly Jews; they live a good life, they reap where they have not sown.\u201d Nazi ideology used the supposed unique work ethic of Germans to draw a distinction between Aryans and Jews. This national myth has inexplicably been allowed to continue: from the Wirtschaftswunder of the 1950s to the financial crisis of the last decade. And yet Germany is the country that brought the world the slogan, \u201cArbeit Macht Frei\u201d (Work sets you free). It is a singular failing of German Holocaust education that Germans still draw national distinctions with the use of this ideology, for example between Germans and Greeks. My father received small monthly Wiedergutmachung payments from the German government to compensate him for the beatings he had received on the streets of Berlin, beatings that left him with lifelong injuries. When he died in September, 2004, our family received a letter from the German government announcing the end of these payments. The letter stated that the case of Manfred Stanley was now settled.An earlier version of this article included a mistranslation of a headline in the German newspaper Die Zeit. The correct translation is \"Is Germany threatened by another 1933?\" not \"Is Germany threatening another 1933?\"Advertisement"}

We know it can work here because it already has elsewhere, in cities like London and Singapore.And yet this sensible plan, which could improve the daily commute of millions of New Yorkers, keeps getting stalled in Albany. Far too many Democrats and Republicans refuse to act, worried that their vote in favor would prove deeply unpopular with constituents in boroughs outside of Manhattan who drive to work. To help, the M.T.A. could continue to expand the bus system that connects the subway-starved farthest reaches of the city with Manhattan, giving those commuters a viable alternative to driving to work.Mayor Bill de Blasio can also help, by adding his voice in aid of the city and residents he serves (and by starting to ride the subway, too).Residents of New York City, Westchester County and Long Island need to force state lawmakers to act.

{"Headline": "Amazon Hits $1,000,000,000,000 in Value, Following Apple", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Amazon has become the second American company to cross that once-unimaginable line. Its shares rose as high as $2,050.50 on Tuesday morning, pushing it over $1 trillion in value, before immediately falling back and then ending the day at $2,039.51, below the $1 trillion threshold. Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is worth nearly as much as Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett put together.This time, the explanation is more complicated.Amazon captures 49 cents of every e-commerce dollar in the United States. It employs more than 550,000 people and generates $178 billion in annual revenue. It sells everything from computing space to peanut butter to appointments with plumbers.But the thing it has always sold the most \u2014 to investors, customers, the news media \u2014 is excitement.In the beginning, Amazon was an exciting new way to shop for books: online. Then it was an exciting new way to read (Kindle e-books), an exciting new way to publish (CreateSpace), an exciting new way to power the internet (Amazon Web Services), an exciting new way to get deliveries (Amazon Prime), an exciting new way to make your house a high-tech outpost (Alexa).Long before Amazon went to Hollywood and began making movies, it was the star of its own show, generating vast amounts of attention just for being Amazon. No other company had ever managed to turn its lack of profit into such effective drama, or the question of what its next move would be.Mr. Bezos made clear when Amazon went public in 1997 that he would not work for Wall Street, and the result was a company cast in an entirely different mold. It never feared losing money. In a real sense, there were no consequences for being wrong.Behind the drama is a relentless and sometimes scary ambition. Amazon is the Jay Gatsby of American companies, believing that tomorrow it will run faster, stretch its arms out farther, fulfill the desires of consumers in ways that no other business possibly could. You will live in Amazon\u2019s world, it says, and you will like it.One of the great benefits for Amazon of this approach is that it is impossible to tell where reality ends and hype \u2014 or perhaps even madness \u2014 begins.Take Amazon\u2019s drone program, which it first announced on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI know this looks like science fiction,\u201d Mr. Bezos said, as he showed a film of an unmanned vehicle delivering a package. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d He said there were \u201cyears of additional work\u201d to be done, but declared himself an optimist. Drone delivery, he predicted, would be a reality in \u201cfour, five years.\u201dThat was December 2013. Roughly a million features were written about Amazon and its drones, nearly all with the subtext: Isn\u2019t this the coolest thing ever?Over the years, the company kept raising the stakes, as if they were not already high enough. Amazon applied a few years ago for a patent for an \u201caerial fulfillment center\u201d that would float at 45,000 feet. Drones would fly out of it with your order and then glide down to your backyard.The fulfillment center, which looks in drawings like a blimp tugging a warehouse, has other uses besides delivering dinner. It would drift down to 2,000 feet to what the patent calls \u201cthe advertising altitude,\u201d where it would present information \u201cabout items and/or services.\u201d Perhaps it will be just like the movie \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and the floating ads will trumpet the joys of working in Amazon\u2019s off-world colonies. The patent was granted this summer.Haye Kesteloo, senior editor of the news site DroneDJ, noted that there were many hurdles to routine delivery by drone, even if the vehicles are not being launched from airships. The claimed drone attack on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela will not help soothe nervous citizens.Nevertheless, Mr. Kesteloo, like Mr. Bezos, proclaims himself an optimist. \u201cCompanies like Amazon will make routine drone deliveries to consumers by 2025,\u201d he said \u2014 only twice as far away as promised.\u201cThere is no doubt anymore,\u201d said Ron Nussbaum, who runs an investment management fund called Maverick Value in Los Angeles. \u201cThe stock always goes up, and no one doubts it will keep going up.\u201dMr. Nussbaum, who emphasized that over all his investments were profitable, might be the last Amazon skeptic. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d he said.And an expensive one. Last year, when Amazon crossed $1,000 a share, he started buying \u201cput\u201d options \u2014 bets that the stock would decline. One of his puts has dropped 85 percent; another, 92 percent.Mr. Nussbaum is planning to buy more. He thinks people are confusing their impressions of Amazon the company with Amazon as an investment.\u201cIf I fill up your gas tank for $1 but it costs me $2, you can say it\u2019s a great product, but it doesn\u2019t make any sense as a company,\u201d he said.Apple had profits of $48 billion last year. Amazon\u2019s were less than a tenth of that. If profits were all that mattered, Amazon should be worth about $100 billion, the size of United Technologies or Texas Instruments. That is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing to get people excited, either.Even before Amazon hit $1 trillion, the milestone was old news. There was a poll on Facebook run by a group of young Wall Street investors. The question: Would Amazon or Apple be the first to hit $2 trillion?The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of Amazon. Dreams will always triumph over devices.Advertisement"}

Even without the harassment and threats, Ms. Morris said she found the work of state government to be rewarding but draining. \u201cI am proud of that work, but I need the space to breathe because for that exchange it exacts a huge cost,\u201d she said. She pointed to the low pay for legislators \u2014 $13,000 a year for five to six months of intensive work \u2014 as a barrier that keeps women, people of color and the working class out of state politics. And she said there were few positions in state government that paid enough for people to support themselves or their families.\u201cTo serve in this state requires sacrifice, literally even financial sacrifice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a system set up for the wealthy and the retired.\u201d Ms. Morris and her lawyer, Robert Appel, accused the Bennington Police Department of failing to appropriately respond to her concerns since at least 2016. She said her experience illustrated that \u201cas a state we are not familiar, we are not prepared, we are not ready at all\u201d to deal with issues of racial justice.\u201cIt is not that I see myself as somehow better than any other individual on planet Earth, for real,\u201d she said. \u201cBut to know that as an elected official and as a person of prominence that I couldn\u2019t even find the protection and the justice that my family deserves so that we can have a sense of peace \u2014 that we weren\u2019t able to access that, that the system was not there in the ways that we needed \u2014 that is stunning.\u201dThe attorney general of Vermont, T.J. Donovan, announced on Aug. 27 that his office would investigate reports of threats and harassment against Ms. Morris. Paul Doucette, the chief of the Bennington Police Department, said he was not able to comment on the case, adding that he did not think the department had \u201cdone anything wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Torrents of Water in Towns Across the Carolinas. And a Guy With a Boat.", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON, N.C. \u2014 As the flat-bottomed fishing boat crept into a swirling river that had once been Summer Haven Lane, Tray Tillman scanned the brown floodwaters and half-submerged houses in search of somebody to save.\u201cToday it\u2019s been women and kids,\u201d Mr. Tillman said.Mr. Tillman, 26, a construction foreman, was part of a makeshift rescue flotilla that has plucked hundreds of stranded people from attics, second-floor bedrooms, church vestibules and crumbling decks as relentless, record-setting rains from Tropical Storm Florence flood rivers across the Carolinas and send torrents of water through downtowns miles away from the coast.Inland flooding is perhaps the biggest continuing danger as Florence trudges through the Carolinas, and an improvised network of volunteers, some helping from as far away as Africa, has sprung up to locate and rescue people who did not evacuate. Harnett County, N.C., which is in the path of a river that was expected to crest overnight at 17 feet above flood stage, was one of many jurisdictions that ordered new evacuations. At least six deaths were confirmed by Saturday afternoon.\u201cThey\u2019re used to flooding, but nothing like this,\u201d said Dan DiRenzo, who steered the boats with New Jersey Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, one of the teams deployed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.FEMA said it had more than 1,000 workers in the Carolinas, and the Coast Guard said it had ships and search-and-rescue crews at the ready. Tennessee sent firefighters and swift-water rescue specialists, and Maryland said it would send its helicopter aquatic rescue team, including two Black Hawk helicopters, on Sunday. A team of specialists in urban search-and-rescue and medical care left with boats to North Carolina from New York City, and another team left from Nevada.Animated maps and satellite images show the effects of the storm.There are scores of highly trained rescuers deployed by FEMA. There are hundreds of local sheriff\u2019s deputies and firefighters trundling through neighborhoods in their tallest trucks. There are volunteers with unofficial rescue groups such as the Cajun Navy, and monitors as far away as Nigeria searching for calls for help and posting people\u2019s locations on crowdsourced rescue databases.Then there is Mr. Tillman: a guy with a boat.A former soldier, he was just a local resident who wanted to help. On Friday, he drove around Washington, N.C., with a metal skiff lashed to the top of his minivan, responding to pleas posted online for help. When a rescue partner who had been working with him got tired, Mr. Tillman went out alone. When he broke his outboard propeller on a piece of wood, he hunted down a replacement.Would-be rescuers in the Carolinas used the walkie-talkie app Zello to request information on street conditions and the locations of people needing help. Volunteers outside the disaster zone scanned the internet to provide answers for them, broadcasting weather and traffic reports and even hyperlocal information.\u201cIt\u2019s been reported that snakes are in the floodwaters around Crabtree Creek, so I would not go outside,\u201d a moderator using the handle TrailBlaizin announced on Saturday morning on one popular Zello channel. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any of you all to get bit by something.\u201dA user on a Cajun Navy channel on Saturday morning requested a wellness check. \u201cI have two elderly people I haven\u2019t heard from since yesterday,\u201d she said, providing an address in Wilmington, N.C.Another user checked in from a shelter in Wilmington to report widespread destruction, saying help would be needed.During the disaster following Hurricane Harvey last year in Texas, volunteers and official responders often had difficulty coordinating, leading to duplication of efforts and gaps. This year, both groups recognized the need to do better. They shared information at high levels and began working together on the ground.As the storm progressed, mounting power and cell tower failures posed another challenge to the accuracy of crowdsourcing. So, too, did the fact that some rural areas that were expected to flood in the coming days had poor baseline wireless coverage, and relatively low social media usage.Mr. Tillman had been trying to keep in touch with faraway volunteer dispatchers on one crowdsourced rescue site. On Friday, after taking a brief break to run home and eat some tuna fish, he headed back out in search of a mother and her adolescent son who had not evacuated, and whose relatives had not heard from them.As Mr. Tillman pulled onto a flooded street leading toward the woman\u2019s house, he ran into a crew of volunteer firefighters who were heading to the same call. Room for one more? he asked. Why not, the Bunyan Fire Department chief said.He climbed into a fishing boat with two firefighters, Parker Williams, 19, and Johnnie O\u2019Neal, 46.Mr. Williams spun the outboard motor, they shoved the boat into the water and were off, puttering through pines and the surreal brown currents of the Pamlico River, now surging into people\u2019s kitchens and living rooms.A kayaker in camouflage paddled by in the opposite direction. A cruiser floated in someone\u2019s front yard.Mr. Tillman stuck an oar into the water and couldn\u2019t find bottom.\u201cThat\u2019s deep,\u201d he said.The three men in the fishing boat poked through the abandoned neighborhood in Washington, stopping to seal off some leaky propane tanks that bobbed in the water like zeppelins.They tried to get their bearings. Was that a street or a creek? What was the difference anymore?\u201cNobody step out of the boat at anytime,\u201d said Mr. O\u2019Neal, whose day job is as a safety specialist. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there.\u201dWas this Summer Haven Lane? They couldn\u2019t see any signs.\u201cWhere we going right now?\u201d Mr. Tillman asked.They steered around mailboxes, branches, pulverized decking and other debris that could blow out the propeller. When the water got too shallow and the boat scraped bottom, the men hopped out and waded, grabbing pieces of fence post and siding to sound the depth of the water in front of them.Finally, a blue two-story house on Summer Haven Lane emerged from the trees. As they approached, a woman\u2019s palm pressed up against a dark second-story window.\u201cHey! Can you go around to the porch so we can talk to you?\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neal yelled.Laura Tedder and her son, Dylan Evans, stepped out onto the second-floor balcony. Ms. Tedder said she had not realized there had been a mandatory evacuation, but had stocked her house with plenty of food and water.And though the churning river was lapping at the stairs to her house, Ms. Tedder said she did not want any rescuing. They had no power, but were recharging their phones with the spare power left over in her son\u2019s laptop. They were planning to play Uno that afternoon.\u201cThis is our home,\u201d Ms. Tedder said. \u201cI guess we just feel safer here. It\u2019s pretty much flooded most places anyway.\u201dMr. O\u2019Neal asked, and asked again to make sure, but Ms. Tedder was firm.\u201cWe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d she said.Mr. Tillman worried that conditions were just going to get worse as the storm squatted over the Carolinas. Mr. O\u2019Neal said that sometimes, people just don\u2019t want to go.\u201cYou all be careful,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neal said, as mother and son slipped back into the house.The three men pushed off from the front porch and headed back into the currents of Summer Haven Lane.Jack Healy reported from Washington, N.C., and Sheri Fink from Boydton, Va.

{"Headline": "How Jerry Brown Can Seal His Legacy as a Climate Champion", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe governor should sign legislation that commits California to a 100 percent clean electricity grid by 2045.Mr. Gillis is a former New York Times environmental reporter and a contributing opinion writer.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 This is a message, and a plea, for Gov. Jerry Brown of California. Please sign the bill.The measure, known as Senate Bill 100, passed the California Legislature last week. It commits the state to a 100 percent clean electricity grid by 2045. Rumors are swirling in Sacramento that the governor might veto that bill. His office has not said what he will do, which is ominous.This bill could well be the most important piece of climate legislation ever passed by any government. Putting the nation\u2019s largest state on a path to a clean electric grid would send an unmistakable signal to the rest of world that the odious Trump administration is not going to stop climate progress in the United States. It would encourage other states and countries to follow California\u2019s lead.  Governor Brown has been one of the world\u2019s most important voices on climate action. So why would he conceivably want to veto this bill?Alas, nothing is ever simple in Sacramento. The author of the bill was Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a state senator from Los Angeles who has long butted heads with Governor Brown. Mr. de Le\u00f3n is running this fall against Senator Dianne Feinstein, a longtime Brown ally (the two, both Democrats, were the top finishers in a nonpartisan primary in June). Vetoing the bill would have the effect, if not the intent, of denying Mr. de Le\u00f3n a big victory on which to run.The bigger issue, though, is that the governor had his own priorities in the legislative session that just ended. He wanted lawmakers to pass a bill that would have linked California\u2019s electric grid more closely to that of other Western states. That would have made it easier for California to import clean electricity from, say, wind farms in Wyoming, and to export the state\u2019s surplus of solar power. Senator de Le\u00f3n fought to keep the issues separate, and he won. The legislature declined to act on the governor\u2019s requests, though it is expected to revisit the issue next year, after he leaves office.So it is understandable that the governor is perturbed. I thought he had a good argument about expanding the grid, but some environmental groups feared that bill would open the door to mischief, allowing the fossil-fuel puppets in the Trump administration to force California to take more dirty coal power. This is not a crazy fear, since the federal government has some jurisdiction over interstate power sales.The sausage-making played out as it did, and now we have what the governor likely sees as an uncooked sausage sitting on his desk. Yet to veto the legislation that passed would be a black mark on his remarkable record of climate leadership.The bill is clever. It commits California to procuring more renewable energy from wind and solar farms, which will have to supply 60 percent of the state\u2019s power by 2030. But the bill recognizes that other sources of clean energy will likely be needed to drive emissions to zero.So for the remaining 40 percent, the bill allows any low-emissions source to compete. California will, I hope, set up a robust market in which new types of power plants can win a share, so long as they offer a reasonable price. The potential options include advanced nuclear reactors, geothermal plants tapping the earth\u2019s interior heat, floating offshore wind turbines, and gas-burning power plants that capture and bury their emissions.In other words, California could well be the place where the electric grid of the future gets invented. Building these new-age power plants will ultimately be a huge global business, and the bill will likely help California win more than its share of the jobs and economic growth.Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor who signed one of California\u2019s most important climate bills, made this point the other day on Twitter.\u201cWe are Californians,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe don\u2019t wait. We build the future economy here.\u201dRecall that Jerry Brown has been the governor twice. He started pushing for clean energy during his first term back in the 1970s, when most people thought his starry-eyed talk about solar and wind power was crazy. Those and other exploits earned him the sobriquet \u201cGovernor Moonbeam.\u201dNow we know he was not a moonstruck hippie; he was a visionary. The state simply would not be in a position to make a 100 percent commitment if Governor Brown had not risked scorn to start California down this path so many decades ago, when Mr. de Le\u00f3n was still in elementary school.I write these words with admiration for Senator de Le\u00f3n\u2019s work \u2014 and with even deeper admiration for everything the governor has accomplished for California. He is not just a brilliant political tactician; he is a former seminary student who wrestles with the moral questions embedded in our messy politics.This is a time, Governor, to look past the messiness and the rivalries. I hope your ethical compass will tell you there is only one thing to do. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is California a Good Role Model?", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDepending on how you look at it, it\u2019s one of the richest states or one of the most unequal.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Conservatives argue that California\u2019s liberal politics have failed. They point out that by one key measure the state now has the highest poverty rate in the nation and they argue that its liberal minimum wage and restrictive housing codes have more than a hundred thousand people homeless, more than a million unemployed and millions more stuck on the bottom rungs of the socioeconomic ladder.\u201cThis is a topsy-turvy debate,\u201d Jonathan Rodden, a political scientist at Stanford, told me by email. \u201cThe left celebrates California\u2019s rapid growth while turning a blind eye to its inequality. The right decries poverty and inequality while discounting rapid economic growth.\u201dThe dispute raises three basic questions.Are the huge disparities in income, education, housing and wealth inevitable in a state that is simultaneously home to hugely profitable high-skill industries and a surging minority population, many of them low-skilled immigrants?Conservatives, especially in essays published in the Manhattan Institute\u2019s City Journal, have led the charge, but some of this criticism also comes from the left and center.Its political leaders and a credulous national media present California as the \u201cwoke\u201d state, creating an economically just, post-racial reality. Yet in terms of opportunity, California is evolving into something more like apartheid South Africa or the pre-civil rights South.Jackson writes:California state and local governments spent nearly $958 billion from 1992 through 2015 on public welfare programs, including cash-assistance payments, vendor payments, and \u2018other public welfare,\u2019 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Unfortunately, California, with 12 percent of the American population, is home today to roughly one in three of the nation\u2019s welfare recipients.Michael Shellenberger, the president of Environmental Progress, a group that supports nuclear power and challenges the tenets of the traditional environmental movement, noted that by some measures \u201cthe Golden State is also number one in poverty and inequality in America.\u201dThese attacks have prompted angry retorts in some quarters.Manuel Pastor, a sociologist at the University of Southern California, sharply disputed the allegations of racism in the Kotkin and Shellenberger essays. Pastor shot back in an email:The notion that California has become like apartheid South Africa is over-the-top rhetoric. Consider whether as an immigrant you would like to be in a state that fully cooperates with ICE or one that has passed a \u201cCalifornia Values Act\u201d that has us labeled a \u201csanctuary state.\u201d Consider whether you want to be in a state that is cutting back on education \u2014 say, Arizona, until the recent teachers\u2019 strike \u2014 or one that has a Local Control Funding Formula that is now directing more money to districts and schools with more English learners, poor children, and foster youth.There\u2019s a whole cottage industry on the right dedicated to the proposition that California is a hellhole. Why? Because California is the most liberal state in the nation, and the existence of a high-tax, high-service state that nonetheless has a great economy is an affront to their principles. And yet, California\u2019s economy is doing fine.Richard Florida, director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto, argued in an email that California is better described as a crucial proving ground in a country undergoing exceptional structural change in its economy and demography.\u201cI think warts and all that California remains a bright spot and innovative force in the US political economy,\u201d Florida told me by email:I am not sure these are California problems. They are symptoms of the more general structural transformation of the economy and the bifurcation of the labor market into a small share (say 33 percent) of knowledge jobs and a much larger share of low wage service jobs (say half).California, Florida noted, \u201cleads on just about every measure I\u2019ve seen of innovation (patents, start-ups etc.) and talent (college grads). So the nature of its economy produces this kind of divide.\u201dThe actual economic data can be used to make the case for either side.The state has prospered and economic mobility is relatively high. At the same time, if Democrats\u2019 top goals are to reduce poverty, lessen inequality, get a roof over everyone\u2019s head and close the education gap, the party has a long way to go.\u201cThe odds of reaching the top fifth of the income distribution for children who are born in the bottom fifth in California is just over 10 percent,\u201d Nathaniel Hendren, a professor of economics at Harvard and one of the study\u2019s authors, said by email. \u201cThere are not many states with higher rates of this measure of upward mobility.\u201dWhat stands out is the concentration of high rates of mobility in Democratic areas of the state.Of the 26 California counties with higher than average levels of mobility, 18 \u2014 with a total population of 11-and-a-half million \u2014 voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump, most by decisive margins. Eight high-mobility counties, with a total population of roughly 891,000, voted for Trump.\u201cIt is very clear that it is housing costs that drive up poverty in California,\u201d Hoynes said by email. Using another poverty measurewhere the poverty threshold is constant across all parts of the United States, California is an average poverty state. With the Supplemental Poverty Measure that adjusts the poverty threshold at the state level using housing costs, California is a very high poverty state. This doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a problem, but it tells you the problem is not wages and incomes \u2014 at least relative to the rest of the United States \u2014 but instead is about the cost of housing.Homelessness by any standard is a severe problem in the state.Now let\u2019s take a look at inequality. There are a number of ways to measure inequality, and California does not do well according to any of them.Families with children headed by adults with a high school education led the charge out of the state, many of them unable to afford California\u2019s high housing costs. Dominating those coming into the state were those with high incomes and college-educated 18-to-35 year olds.What to make of the conflicting statistics? I went back to Jonathan Rodden, who argued that both the strengths and weaknesses of California are less political than structural.What Rodden calls \u201cCalifornia\u2019s locational advantages in technology and entertainment\u201d empower the stateThe result? \u201cA mix of high taxes, rapid growth and high inequality.\u201dKenneth Miller, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College, described California as \u201ca paradox.\u201d On the one hand, Miller wrote, the stateis succeeding on many dimensions \u2014 job growth, personal income, state revenues, and more \u2014 but failing on others. It ranks top in the nation on the Census Bureau\u2019s supplemental poverty measure and homelessness measures. Its high housing and other costs are also forcing many working and middle class residents to exit for other states.Miller was unwilling to assign blame, but his comments revealed both concern and regret:California is not yet as socially and economically stratified as South Africa or Latin American countries, but one does feel the growing divide between the highly educated, wealthy, upper class and the growing underclass, while the formerly dominant middle class hollows out.In terms of taxing and spending, however, they represent very different choices, California higher on both counts, Texas lower.California may presage America\u2019s political future in another sense.\u201cThe Democrats are essentially an urban party, which means they are a coalition of low-income service workers and high-income knowledge-economy workers,\u201d Rodden told me. That means \u201cthey are simultaneously trying to be the party of San Francisco and the party of Scranton.\u201dIn California, Rodden continued, \u201cthe policy demands of high-income professionals in Silicon Valley will often be in tension with those of low-income service workers,\u201d mirroring the built-in tension nationally between upscale well-educated Democrats and the disproportionately minority poor who make up a crucial part of the coalition.At the moment, the Democratic coalition in California is \u2014 relatively speaking \u2014 a smooth running machine. But over time, both in state and out of state, as Rodden put it, \u201cthe solidarity of Democrats in San Francisco with those in Scranton may become tenuous.\u201dThe fragility of that alliance is what left an opening for a candidate \u2014 and a president \u2014 like Trump.Advertisement"}

And as a black woman, an added trope that often befalls women of color \u2014 loud, angry or simply out of control \u2014 was applied to her.\u201cA woman expressing anger triggers the raging id \u2014 or hormones, out-of-control stereotype,\u201d Professor Williams said. \u201cA black person expressing anger triggers the angry black person\u2019s stereotype.\u201dResearch has long proved this is true, especially for women at work.As one black female biologist, who called herself a \u201cvery direct speaker,\u201d described it: She felt as if she had to \u201cput cotton candy in my mouth.\u201dMen, of course, speak directly all the time, she said.\u201cIt becomes another one of those invisible escalators for white men,\u201d Professor Williams said.For her book \u201cWhat Works for Women at Work,\u201d which she wrote with her daughter, Professor Williams spoke with over 120 female professionals who worked in senior-level roles at mainstream corporations and asked if they had ever expressed anger on the job. Remarkably, only three said they had ever done it.So I ask you, readers: Have you ever expressed anger openly at work? If so, did it come back to haunt you?____________The piece focused on why women\u2019s issues should be a primary focus of that year\u2019s presidential candidates \u2014 particularly as they pertained to safe, affordable abortions, which had been legal for 11 years. The article even singled out the town I grew up in, Owensboro, Ky., as an example of a place within a vast region where no facilities existed. \u201cMany women are angry and frustrated,\u201d the article stated.______Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Land of Altered Bodies", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDISABILITYTwo poets with disabilities enter a landscape where they can be at home, and free. Those poems, six of which are published here, detail our experiences with disability and medical intervention, and the subsequent grief and isolation that such intervention creates. The project began as a series of letters between us, designed to give voice to anxieties we had once experienced alone and that, until our friendship, had gone largely unspoken. We hope that in their current form, the poems convey the buoyancy of two voices in dialogue and allow the reader an entry point into a deeply specific experience with universal resonances. (The full collection will be published by Persea Books in 2020.)The book begins with a letter from S that details this speaker\u2019s dream about the possible loss of her legs, an imaginary space wherein she feels finally free of the heft and weight of the years of surgery, bodily alteration and physical disability. The second speaker, M, replies with an invitation to delve into that shared psychic space. Thus begins a series of letters that situates the speakers in relationship to each other and enacts their shared struggle to locate a stable sense of self.As the sequence develops, a collective, imagined landscape begins to take shape: The speakers find themselves caught between the desire to be at home in spaces that aren\u2019t made for them and a desire to be lost among the wild, uncultivated landscapes \u2014 woods, rivers, canyons and fields \u2014 that more readily resemble their untamable bodies. A central paradox emerges: How can a body that can\u2019t return to its natural form, since it has been irrevocably altered by the violence of surgery, ever be at home in the natural world? And if it can\u2019t go home, how can an imagined home be fashioned from what resources remain?     Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and the Koch Brothers Are Working in Concert", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey disagree about trade, tariffs and immigration, but don\u2019t be fooled. Neither side can get what it really wants without help from the other. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The Koch network \u2014 which in many respects has eclipsed the official Republican Party \u2014 has nurtured the careers of a host of politicians from Mike Pence to Scott Walker to Mike Pompeo. Major beneficiaries of the Koch network include the Tea Party, the Cato Institute, the National Federation of Independent Business and groups specifically created to act as conservative counterweights to a panoply of liberal interest groups \u2014 for example, the 60 Plus Association and the Center to Protect Patient Rights are conservative alternatives to the AARP. In this context, the public disagreement between Trump and Koch over trade, tariffs and even immigration clearly diminishes in importance.At a July gathering of Koch network donors in Colorado Springs, Charles Koch took a conciliatory approach when speaking specifically about Trump. Asked if Trump was to blame for heightened national divisiveness, Koch replied:We\u2019re all part of it. None of us are perfect. We\u2019ve had divisiveness long before Trump became president, and we\u2019ll have it long after he\u2019s no longer president. I\u2019m into hating the sin, not the sinner. Koch also told donors, \u201cWe\u2019ve made more progress in the past five years than I\u2019ve made in the previous 50.\u201d Trump and the Kochs are not just complementary; they are symbiotic. Trump is essential to marketing the Kochs\u2019 vision. Without him, the Koch agenda would fail. Any realistic assessment of the policy victories achieved by the Kochs shows that the public is firmly opposed to much of what the Kochs have gained from the Trump administration and a pliant Congress \u2014 and the public is opposed to much of what the Kochs still want and have not yet achieved. If public opinion were the guiding force, key elements of the Kochs\u2019 policy goals would be dead in the water. And without Trump\u2019s ethnonationalist appeal, these proposals (for the most part) would not survive either on their merits or on popular support.Put another way, the Charles Koch-Donald Trump collaboration has been productive, despite the distaste of the two men for each other.This war of words, however, is of only peripheral importance.\u201cRecently we have seen a much overhyped supposed split between Koch and the network and the Trump administration around free trade questions,\u201d Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, said by email. \u201cThis is mostly sound and fury with little impact.\u201dIn practice, Skocpol wrote,The Koch network has gotten 85 percent of what it has always wanted out of the Trump presidency so far \u2014 especially the huge government-starving, upward tilted tax cuts, the evisceration of the EPA, weakening of labor regulations and unions, cuts in social spending, and ultraright judges who will eviscerate government regulatory capacities and further weaken liberal forces.In 2016, according to Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, Trump was crucial to bridging the gap between his followers \u2014 \u201cprotectionist, anti-elite elements that are skeptical of globalization and free trade\u201d \u2014 and free-trade conservatives. Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a political scientist at Columbia, made a parallel point:On most issues the Trump administration, working together with a Republican Congress the Kochs helped to elect, has embraced the vision of the Republican Party that the Kochs have pursued aggressively over the past three decades. That includes implementing massive cuts to taxes, especially on businesses; dismantling the Affordable Care Act; appointing very conservative, free-market oriented judges to the federal judiciary; and efforts to undermine economic and environmental regulations.Hertel-Fernandez noted that trade and immigration are, to be sure, a point of disagreement between the Kochs and the Trump administration, but those are still only two areas where the Kochs have not gotten their way among many other successes.are longtime opponents of campaign disclosure laws. Unlike the parties, their network is constructed chiefly of nonprofit groups that are not required to reveal donors. That makes it almost impossible to tell how much of the money is provided by the Kochs \u2014 among the wealthiest men in the country \u2014 and how much by other donors.For some 50 years, Your Honor, since the Supreme Court in 1958 upheld the right of the NAACP to resist compulsion by the state of Alabama of its membership list, courts have recognized that the First Amendment protects against this sort of compulsion in this sort of circumstance.In practice, the Trump-Koch alliance has been extraordinarily productive, and the alliance is the odds on favorite to win the battle to put Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, where he is likely to cement a conservative majority for the foreseeable future.Despite his liabilities, Trump is determined to press forward in concert with the Kochs on behalf of a besieged Republican Party and an agenda of benefits for corporate entities and the wealthy.In the 2016 Republican primaries, the party\u2019s voters effectively declared that they were fed up with establishment candidates and demanded a red-meat nominee who would cater to \u201cworking white America.\u201dDespite their misgivings, the Kochs \u2014 and Republican politicians like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell \u2014 owe Trump a great deal. And because this is a political form of symbiosis, he owes them just as much. What will this alliance cost each partner? What are the possible consequences of their nonaggression pact? Everything temporary always looks permanent. The only certainty is that the equilibrium is bound to shift left or right. It can\u2019t stay like this forever.An earlier version of this column misstated the size of the tax cut that was enacted by Congress in December; it was $1.5 trillion, not $1.5 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Democrats Should Talk to People in Farm Country ", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike Barack Obama, Deidre DeJear, an African-American small-business owner and candidate for Iowa secretary of state, stresses opportunity, voting rights and unity. KNOXVILLE, Iowa \u2014 We keep hearing about Democratic women of color winning races in the Bronx, Georgia, Boston and other places with a diverse population. But here in mostly white Iowa, we\u2019ve got our own story to tell. Part of that story is it\u2019s not just diverse urban areas where a person of color can run for statewide office.Iowa is bipolar with respect to politics and race. Barack Obama won our first-in-the-nation Democratic caucuses in 2008 to help propel him to his two-term presidency. In 2016, Donald Trump almost won, and his second-place finish in the crowded Republican caucuses proved to the rest of the nation he was a viable candidate.But then here is Ms. DeJear, who nearly every day engages many of the rural voters who supported Mr. Trump and Mr. King. She is part of Iowa\u2019s contribution to a wave of women running for office nationally, and one of a record number of over 600 black women running.Race does not play a big role in Ms. DeJear\u2019s campaign. \u201cWhen I talk to Iowans,\u201d she told me, \u201cit\u2019s about values \u2014 of course people see I\u2019m black, and that I\u2019m a woman, but ultimately it\u2019s values that matter to people.\u201dProtests and a boycott of the store by both black and white citizens ensued, and a lawsuit was filed. In December 1949, the Iowa Supreme Court ruled that Katz Drug Store had discriminated against Griffin and Bibbs. This boycott occurred seven years before the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala., led by Rosa Parks.Griffin is often called the Rosa Parks of Iowa. Another way of looking at it is that Parks should be called the Edna Griffin of Alabama.Ms. DeJear has a personal connection to civil and voting rights. She was born in Mississippi, moved to Iowa to attend Drake University in Des Moines, and stayed.\u201cMy father was born in Mississippi in 1958, and then it was difficult for black people to exercise the right to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if they did, they could lose their jobs, they were threatened, and people used a number of intimidation tactics to stop them from voting.\u201dThe passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 may seem like a long time ago to some, but it\u2019s yesterday to those who were directly affected and their kin.Her opponent, Mr. Pate, has followed the lead of Republicans nationally who work to disenfranchise minority, poor and elderly voters by putting obstacles in front of them like voter ID requirements and reduced voting periods.At the Democratic Hall of Fame Dinner in June, Ms. DeJear drew the most applause while being introduced. I asked about a dozen people why they felt so strongly about her and her messaging. People spoke of her \u201ccharisma,\u201d \u201cquiet confidence,\u201d \u201cher passion\u201d; she \u201cmakes us feel like family,\u201d one said. Like Mr. Obama, Ms. DeJear hits a recurring theme: opportunity for all.Add into the mix those counties that voted for Mr. Obama once either in 2012 or 2016, and we have a great many rural counties that have the potential to turn blue in 2018 and 2020, if Democrats\u2019 campaigns promote unity and opportunity, rather than division.That\u2019s what Deidre DeJear is doing on the campaign trail, talking about values and opportunity. Democrats might notice that this message can create opportunities in Midwestern states that the party is desperate to reclaim.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018America First\u2019 Has Won", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe three pillars of the ideology \u2014 isolationism, protectionism and restricting immigration \u2014 were gaining popularity before Donald Trump became president and may outlast his tenure. Mr. Kagan is the author of \u201cThe Jungle Grows Back; America and Our Imperiled World.\u201dPresident Trump may not enjoy majority support these days, but there\u2019s good reason to believe that his \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach to the world does. There has been no popular outcry against Mr. Trump\u2019s trade battles with Canada, Mexico and the European allies. Experts suggest we are in for a long international trade war, no matter who the next president may be. After all, even Hillary Clinton had to disown her support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership in the last election. The old free-trade consensus is gone.Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration policies may be more popular with Republicans than with Democrats, but few Democratic politicians are running on a promise to bring more immigrants into the country. And just as in the 1920s, isolationism joins anti-immigration sentiment and protectionism as a pillar of America Firstism. Democrats might seem to be rallying behind the liberal order, but much of this is just opposition to Mr. Trump\u2019s denigration of it. Are today\u2019s rank-and-file Democrats really more committed to defending allies and deterring challengers to the liberal world order? Most Democratic politicians railing against Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cappeasement\u201d of Moscow hailed Obama\u2019s \u201creset\u201d a few years ago and chastised Republicans for seeking a new Cold War. Most Democratic voters want lower military spending and a much smaller United States military presence overseas, which hardly comports with getting tougher on Russia, Korea or China \u2014 except on trade.In retrospect it\u2019s pretty clear that Mr. Obama was too internationalist for his party base. He expanded NATO, intervened in Libya, imposed sanctions on Russia and presided over the negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Democrats may miss Mr. Obama for many reasons, but there\u2019s little evidence that the rank-and-file miss those policies. Mr. Trump\u2019s narrower, more unilateralist and nationalist approach to the world is probably closer to where the general public is than Mr. Obama\u2019s more cosmopolitan sensibility.It would be comforting to blame America\u2019s current posture on Mr. Trump. But while he may be a special kind of president, even he can\u2019t create a public mood out of nothing. Now as always, presidents reflect public opinion at least as much as they shape it. Between the two world wars, and especially from 1921 through 1936, an American public disillusioned by World War I was averse to further overseas involvement, and it didn\u2019t matter whether the presidents were supposed \u201cisolationists\u201d like Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge or supposed \u201cinternationalists\u201d like Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt. It took a lot more than fireside chats to turn public opinion around. It took Hitler\u2019s conquest of Europe, near-conquest of Britain and, finally, Pearl Harbor to convince a majority of Americans that America First was a mistake.In our own time, the trend toward an America First approach has been growing since the end of the Cold War. George H.W. Bush, the hero of the Gulf War, had to play down foreign policy in 1992 and lost to a candidate promising to focus on domestic issues. George W. Bush won in 2000 promising to reduce United States global involvement, defeating an opponent, Al Gore, who was still talking about America\u2019s indispensability. In 2008, Mr. Obama won while promising to get out of foreign conflicts for good. In 2016, Republican internationalists like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio were trounced in the primaries. Hillary Clinton struggled to hold off Bernie Sanders, a progressive isolationist, and it was certainly not because of her foreign policy views.Now we have Mr. Trump. Is he an aberration or a culmination? Many foreign policy experts, and most of the foreign leaders pouring into New York this week for the United Nation\u2019s General Assembly, have been counting on the former. They place their hopes on the 2020 elections to get America back on its old path. But they may have to start facing the fact that what we\u2019re seeing today is not a spasm but a new direction in American foreign policy, or rather a return to older traditions \u2014 the kind that kept us on the sidelines while fascism and militarism almost conquered the world.Robert Kagan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is the author, most recently, of \u201cThe Jungle Grows Back; America and Our Imperiled World.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Times, Kavanaugh\u2019s Defense Misleads or Veers Off Point", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySo it went for hours, as Judge Kavanaugh mounted an emotional defense against allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking. It was the second time he had testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the first being earlier in September when he was asked mostly about his legal career.The New York Times fact-checked his testimony, comparing his statements against the recollections of former classmates and acquaintances from his youth, as well as records from his time working in the administration of George W. Bush.The combative nominee was compelled to answer questions he clearly found embarrassing or offensive. What emerges is the image of a skilled lawyer who, when pressed on difficult subjects, sometimes crafted responses that were misleading, disputed or off point. When asked about his alcohol consumption in high school, he said his classmates were \u201clegal to drink\u201d in their senior year, even though the legality of the drinking was not the issue (and, in fact, he could not legally drink because the age was raised to 21 before he even turned 18).It was a performance that evolved with the increasingly fraught tenor of the proceedings. At his first hearing, Judge Kavanaugh, a Yale Law School graduate, fielded questions on policy and political work in the bland, studiously noncontroversial tradition of nominees to the high court. Still, even then some answers raised flags, as when he claimed not to know or suspect that internal Democratic documents about judicial nominations, shared with him when he worked in the Bush administration, had been stolen from Democrats\u2019 computers.Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, reminded Judge Kavanaugh that juries were routinely instructed that they can \u201cdisbelieve a witness if they find them to be false in one thing.\u201d\u201cSo the core of why we\u2019re here today really is credibility,\u201d he said.While it is true that the three people did not corroborate Dr. Blasey\u2019s account, they did not \u201crefute\u201d it either. Dr. Blasey had said that two of them were in the house, and one of them was in the room at the time of the alleged assault.All three said they did not recall the gathering, and two of them \u2014 friends of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s \u2014 said they had not, in general, seen him act in an aggressive manner.Leland Keyser, a longtime friend of Dr. Blasey\u2019s, submitted a short statement through her lawyer saying that she did not know Judge Kavanaugh and had \u201cno recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.\u201dDuring the hearing, Dr. Blasey said she did not expect that Ms. Keyser would remember the gathering because it was \u201ca very unremarkable party\u201d for her. She also noted that Ms. Keyser \u201chas significant health challenges,\u201d adding that \u201cshe let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her, and she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes.\u201dDr. Blasey recalled Patrick Smyth, known as \u201cP.J.,\u201d as attending the gathering. But through his lawyer, Mr. Smyth issued a statement that he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the party or the allegations. Dr. Blasey testified that, like, Ms. Keyser, it was not surprising that Mr. Smyth would not have memories of the gathering.In his statement to the committee, Mr. Judge, through his lawyer, wrote that he had \u201cno memory of this alleged incident\u201d and that he did \u201cnot recall the party described.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh portrayed himself in his testimony as enjoying a beer or two as a high school and college student, but not as someone who often drank to excess during those years. \u201cI drank beer with my friends,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost everyone did. Sometimes I had too many beers. Sometimes others did. I liked beer. I still like beer. But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out,\u201d he said.His statements are at odds with how some of his classmates remembered him. In interviews before his testimony, nearly a dozen college classmates of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s said they recalled him indulging in heavy drinking, some saying it went beyond normal consumption. (To be sure, a smaller number of classmates said his drinking was unexceptional.)Reached after the hearing, Lynne Brookes, an undergraduate classmate of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s at Yale University, said she believed he had \u201cgrossly misrepresented and mischaracterized his drinking.\u201d\u201cHe frequently drank to excess,\u201d she said. \u201cI know because I frequently drank to excess with him.\u201dLike Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Brookes, a Republican, was an athlete who went to a prestigious graduate school after Yale. She disputed the implication in his testimony that he could not have overindulged because he was too busy studying and competing in athletics. \u201cIt is completely possible to do both,\u201d she said.Another Yale classmate, Elizabeth Swisher, now a Seattle physician, said: \u201cI drank a lot. Brett drank more.\u201d\u201cI definitely saw him on multiple occasions stumbling drunk where he could not have rational control over his actions or clear recollection of them,\u201d said Daniel Lavan, who lived in Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s dorm freshman year. \u201cHis depiction of himself is inaccurate.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh disputed such accounts, saying they did not point to specific instances. But his own recollections have offered clues about his drinking. His high school yearbook, for example, refers to him as the treasurer of the Keg City Club, noting \u201c100 Kegs or Bust.\u201d Multiple high school classmates, in interviews, described Judge Kavanaugh as a heavy and frequent drinker.As an undergrad, he was affiliated with two organizations known for hard partying, including the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.He also recounted his own drinking exploits in speeches. In a 2014 address to Yale Law students, he recalled a night of \u201cgroup chugs\u201d in Boston that ended with his group \u201cfalling out of the bus onto the front steps of Yale Law School at about 4:45 a.m.\u201dFour of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s former schoolmates, including Sean Hagan, said the notion that the phrase was meant affectionately did not ring true. They said that Judge Kavanaugh and his friends often made disrespectful sexual comments about Ms. Dolphin, and that the understanding at the time was that the many yearbook references to her were boasts about sexual conquests.On Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh steered away from the idea that the yearbook reference had any sexual connotations. \u201cWe never had any sexual interaction,\u201d he said.After his testimony ended, Mr. Hagan wrote on Facebook: \u201cSo angry. So disgusted. So sad. Integrity? Character? Honesty?\u201dJudge Kavanaugh\u2019s yearbook page included the entries \u201cJudge \u2014 Have You Boofed Yet?\u201d and \u201cDevil\u2019s Triangle.\u201d On Thursday, he said that \u201cboofed\u201d meant \u201cflatulence\u201d and that \u201cDevil\u2019s Triangle\u201d was a drinking game in which three glasses were arranged in a triangle.\u201cBoofed\u201d in the 1980s was a term that often referred to anal sex, and that is how Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s classmates said they interpreted his comment. They said they had never heard it used to refer to flatulence.Similarly, they said that they had never heard of a drinking game called Devil\u2019s Triangle, but that the phrase was regularly used to describe sex between two men and a woman. \u201cThe explanation of Devil\u2019s Triangle does not hold water for me,\u201d said William Fishburne, who managed the football team during Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s senior year.\u201cOur senior yearbook pages were a place to have a little bit of fun with commemorating inside jokes,\u201d said Bill Barbot, who overlapped with Judge Kavanaugh at Georgetown Prep, an all-boys Catholic school. \u201cHowever, the spin that Brett was putting on it was a complete overstatement of the innocence with which they were intended.\u201dAsked about the intersection of his and Ms. Blasey\u2019s friend groups, Judge Kavanaugh said: \u201cWhen my friends and I spent time together at parties on weekends, it was usually with friends from nearby Catholic all-girls high schools \u2014 Stone Ridge, Holy Child, Visitation, Immaculata, Holy Cross. Dr. Blasey did not attend one of those schools. She attended an independent private school named Holton-Arms, and she was a year behind me.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh\u2019s implication is that students at Holton-Arms, an all-girls school, didn\u2019t mingle much those who attended Georgetown Prep. Two of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s former schoolmates said on Friday that this was not true and that Holton-Arms students were routinely present at parties with Georgetown Prep boys.\u201cHolton-Arms was definitely part of our social scene,\u201d Mr. Barbot said. Another Georgetown Prep alumnus who was in Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s class said, \u201cHolton was as much a sister school as the others.\u201dDuring his confirmation hearings earlier this month, Judge Kavanaugh said that when he worked in the White House of George W. Bush, he was unaware that a Republican staffer had stolen documents about judicial nominations from the computer servers of Democratic lawmakers. He maintained that receiving the documents did \u201cnot raise red flags\u201d because \u201cinformation sharing was common.\u201dDocuments released by the National Archives show that Manuel Miranda, the Republican aide, had sent Judge Kavanaugh several of the stolen files between 2002 and 2003. One email chain released by the Archives describes wanting to meet at Mr. Miranda\u2019s house so that Judge Kavanaugh, who was a White House lawyer working on judicial confirmations, could receive \u201cuseful info\u201d about two Democratic senators.Mr. Miranda told The Times that he had never informed Mr. Kavanaugh about the computer servers. Democrats say the documents show that Judge Kavanaugh must have been aware that the information he was receiving from Mr. Miranda was stolen from Democratic computers. Emails from Mr. Miranda to Judge Kavanaugh included remarkable detail about Democratic plans, and some were marked as \u201chighly confidential\u201d or \u201cintel.\u201dBut Judge Kavanaugh offered a more benign interpretation, saying that he merely assumed at the time that Mr. Miranda had received the information from friendly Democratic staffers.In 2006, Judge Kavanaugh told senators that when he was in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, he did not work on a controversial appeals court nomination and played only a small role in another. The nomination of Judge William H. Pryor Jr. was \u201cnot one that I worked on personally,\u201d he said. He also said that Judge Charles W. Pickering Sr. was \u201cnot one of the judicial nominees that I was primarily handling.\u201dEmails released after Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court showed that during his White House tenure, he was invited to participate in a conference call on Judge Pryor\u2019s confirmation. The email went to a group called the \u201cPryor Working Group.\u201d The emails also show that he worked on the Pickering nomination, and was called by one colleague \u201cmuch more involved in the Pickering fight.\u201dIt is clear that Judge Kavanaugh \u2014 in 2006 and again this year \u2014 sought to downplay his role. Democrats believe that he actively misled the Judiciary Committee, hoping that the true extent of his involvement would not be revealed.At the same hearing, the judge declined to directly answer questions by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, as to whether he believed the 1973 ruling was \u201ccorrect law.\u201dAt his initial confirmation hearing in September, Judge Kavanaugh told Ms. Feinstein that he believed a 1974 ruling, United States v. Nixon, was \u201cone of the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history.\u201d In it, the court ruled that the president could not invoke executive privilege to block a subpoena from the Watergate special prosecutor to turn over audiotapes of White House conversations.Democrats have pointed to remarks Judge Kavanaugh made about the case to suggest he would shield President Trump from a similar subpoena.David Enrich, Robin Pogrebin and Michael D.

{"Headline": "\u2018The Franks\u2019 Will Rework Their Brooklyn Restaurant Empire", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, friends since childhood, opened their first Brooklyn restaurant together in 2004, cooking simple Italian fare from behind the induction burners of the narrow kitchen, you could still see old-timers in the neighborhood walking home with lard bread from Italian bakeries.But over the past 14 years, that neighborhood, Carroll Gardens, has changed, and the ambitions of the Franks, as Mr. Falcinelli and Mr. Castronovo are collectively known, have changed as well.\u201cWhen we think about Luger\u2019s, we think about tradition, longevity and consistency,\u201d Mr. Falcinelli said.\u201cWhat we want to do now is set ourselves up for something that\u2019s going to live longer than us,\u201d Mr. Castronovo added. \u201cSomething that will always be here.\u201d Until it closes in November, the menu at Prime Meats will offer its greatest hits from over the years, such as the schnitzel and sausages. After that, a few of those dishes will live on, in the new Frankies menu. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a steak, a real steak, at least one,\u201d Mr. Castronovo said.When it first opened, the restaurant bought its sausages from Faicco\u2019s Italian Specialties, but the kitchen has been making its own since 2011, most recently a cacio-e-pepe sausage as well as a more traditional mazzafagati, made with pork liver.The Frankies menu will expand along with the dining room. It will include more vegetarian dishes, some grilled fish and more varieties of Italian-style sausages.Mr. Castronovo and Mr. Falcinelli will also take over the small building next door to Frankies and expand the restaurant\u2019s backyard so they can cater larger events, both indoors and outdoors, for up to 100 people.The bar inside Prime Meats will become Franks Wine Bar. The restaurant group\u2019s wine director, John Paterson, plans to pour about 20 wines by the glass each night, most of them French and Italian.\u201cWe grew up as kids watching Umberto make pizza,\u201d said Mr. Falcinelli, who first met Mr. Castronovo in Queens, where they went to school together. \u201cHe\u2019s legendary.\u201d\u201cAs kids, he was the pizza god to us,\u201d Mr. Castronovo said, \u201cand I still think he makes one of the best pizzas in New York.\u201dAt 75, Mr. Corteo runs several pizzerias on Long Island and serves grandma and Sicilian-style pies., which are baked in shallow pans. \u201cThe dough is literally like it\u2019s confited,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so delicious, it\u2019s like butter.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve tried so many things but over time, it seems like what\u2019s dear to us, what we really love, is this Italian thing,\u201d Mr. Castronovo said.Mr. Falcinelli nodded. \u201cCoincidentally, it\u2019s what everybody else loves, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Happens When You Give L.S.D. to an Elephant?", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHumans keep finding ways to justify giving drugs and alcohol to animals.Contributing Opinion Writer And then there are reports of animals taking drugs: pigs drinking beer, lobsters smoking pot, elephants on L.S.D. The state\u2019s health inspectors are not amused.Ms. Gill has a license to grow marijuana, under Maine\u2019s new law, but she says she has received word from the state that \u201cit is supposed to be used only for myself and not for a lobster.\u201dMy favorite part of this story is the detail that Ms. Gill\u2019s 82-year-old father is eating \u201ccopious amounts of marijuana-sedated lobster every day.\u201d I picture the gentleman wearing a relaxed grin, surrounded by a giant pile of lobster shells. \u201cMmm,\u201d he says. \u201cButter.\u201dIt is hard not to think wistfully of how things might have been different had the pig instead stolen some Ecstasy from a local octopus. Who knows? In that world, the cow and the pig and might have wound up as friends instead of turning to hooficuffs.Some things to know about the Tusko story:1. The name of the doctor performing the experiment was Louis West, but everyone called him Jolly.2. Tusko is a common name given to elephants in captivity, including a pachyderm exhibited in 1922 as the \u201cWorld\u2019s Meanest.\u201d3. The Oklahoma Tusko was injected with the L.S.D. by way of a dart gun shot into his right buttock. This is, of course, the same method once used on Timothy Leary.4. Five minutes after the injection, Tusko trumpeted, fell over and defecated.5. After that, he went into a state the scientists later described as a \u201cseizure\u201d; his eyes closed and rolled back in his great big head.6. In an effort to stop the seizure, Dr. West and company injected the elephant with both Thorazine and pentobarbital sodium. Tusko died an hour and 40 minutes later. There is some thought that it was these drugs, rather than the L.S.D., that killed the elephant.7. In the wake of the tragedy, it was noted that the amount of L.S.D. given to the elephant was about 30 times the amount that would be administered to a human.I like the idea of tripping elephants, in the abstract, in the same way that I like the idea of octopods on Ecstasy, or lobsters on pot, or drunken Australian pigs picking fights with cows.But the more I think about it, the sadder and angrier it makes me. Why do we have to mess with the brains of animals? Isn\u2019t it enough to destroy our own minds without having to ruin the lives of elephants and octopods and lobsters?It leaves me back where I started, with the conclusion that people are, at least sometimes, pretty terrible \u2014 to this world, to the animals we share it with and, of course, to one another. But then, watching the news and reading the paper every day, I knew that already.Advertisement"}

James Buchanan, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated.She is the daughter of Sunny A. S. Dupree of Cambridge, Mass., and the late Frederick F.

He was 23.\u201cHe was really cute,\u201d Ms. Dupree said. \u201cBut I had just taken a job in Los Angeles, and I had a boyfriend.\u201dThey didn't see each other again until six years later, when Ms. Dupree, now unattached, noticed on Facebook that Mr. Adair had posted something from London, where she was planning a vacation with friends to celebrate her birthday.She reached out to him in May 2016, which pleasantly surprised Mr. Adair, who had just begun a six- month work assignment in London. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s Lila Dupree.\u2019\u201d he recalled thinking.They met in London shortly thereafter, and though Mr. Adair said that Ms. Dupree \u201clooked great,\u201d romance was not on his mind. \u201cOur mothers were friends and I didn\u2019t want anything negative getting back to them,\u201d he said. \u201cSo while I was certainly attracted to Lila, I was very much in the mind-set of we were old friends just catching up.\u201dMs. Dupree had a different mind-set as the first date drew to a close. \u201cI didn\u2019t want the night to end,\u201d she said.She told him as much when he thought he was taking her home at 1 a.m. after they had spent time in a London bar. \u201cWhere are we going next?\u201d she asked him.That\u2019s when it clicked for him. \u201cI immediately thought to myself, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re on our first date,\u2019\u201d he said.They spent the rest of Ms. Dupree\u2019s vacation together, and shortly after she returned to Los Angeles, they met again in New York, where they both agreed that \u201cthis was a forever thing,\u201d as Ms. Dupree put it.Advertisement"}

Opinion ColumnistIn a New York congressional district months later, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stages an extraordinary Democratic primary upset and the wisdom inverts: Leftward lies glory. The strategists regroup. The commentators rewrite.That\u2019s because we\u2019re staring at the wrong thing. Intent on some ideological takeaway, we miss the human moral. This year\u2019s victorious candidates, like so many winners before them, aren\u2019t prevailing simply or even mainly because of the labels they\u2019re wearing or the precise points on the political spectrum to which they can be affixed.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with my candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week.

They have backgrounds that make sense to voters or temperaments that feel right to them. And they\u2019ve devised ways to reach voters that their rivals haven\u2019t.The lesson of 2018 isn\u2019t novel. But it\u2019s overlooked because it doesn\u2019t come wrapped in fancy analytics, it can\u2019t be integrated into sweeping pronouncements about the arc of America, and it transcends our beloved binaries of progressive versus moderate and blue versus red.Candidates matter. Campaigns count. Voters use more than bullet points, spreadsheets and the marching orders of the Democratic Socialists of America or the New Democrat Coalition to make decisions. We use our hearts. We use our guts. (Sometimes we even use our minds, though not nearly often enough.)I\u2019m speaking broadly, yes, and there are exceptions aplenty. Anyone who has spent any time on Capitol Hill knows that it\u2019s entirely possible to be both insipid and an incumbent re-elected again and again. Any full inventory of the 2018 contests includes losers exponentially more enticing than the dullards who trounced them. Democracy works in mysterious ways.And Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, was exactly right when she responded to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s triumph by deeming it a reflection of that particular district and that peculiar race at that specific moment in time.But I also think that if a single bold thread runs through the results so far and the surprisingly strong general-election prospects of some Democratic nominees in districts and states that lean Republican, it\u2019s not a given position on Medicare for all or the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. It\u2019s candidates\u2019 ability to connect and make the case.Gillum, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and Abrams are all people of color and all under 45. They reflect another important theme of 2018: Democratic voters\u2019 embrace of minorities, women, youth and a diverse slate of aspirants who more accurately mirror the country. But just as consequentially, they\u2019re seriously talented candidates.Perhaps no contest affirms the power of personality as well as the Senate race in Texas, which hasn\u2019t elected a Democrat to statewide office in more than 20 years. Against those odds, the Democratic nominee, Beto O\u2019Rourke, has become a genuine threat to the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz.The Democrats\u2019 hopes for a Senate majority hinge largely on how personally appealing and politically nimble candidates in tough races are. If Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Jon Tester in Montana, Joe Manchin in West Virginia and other Democratic senators running for re-election in red states where Donald Trump is popular win, it won\u2019t be because they have voted consistently with Trump. They haven\u2019t. They\u2019ll win in large part because they have managed, through deft interpersonal skills and dexterous campaigns, to garner the affection and respect of their constituents, and because the Republican opponents that they happen to be facing aren\u2019t rock stars. In races that aren\u2019t foregone conclusions by dint of the moment or the place, the superior candidate often wins. Obvious, I know. But it\u2019s amazing how frequently we forget that, and Democratic voters can\u2019t afford to when picking the person to square off against Trump in 2020.Advertisement"}

On their 18th birthdays they became criminals.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.In the fall of 2017, Wilmer Ramirez had reason to be hopeful. After he trekked from Guatemala and spent several months in a youth migrant shelter in Arizona, his application for \u201cspecial immigrant juvenile status,\u201d a designation that would make him eligible for lawful permanent residency, was pending. What\u2019s more, a family in Pennsylvania had agreed to sponsor him, meaning they would submit themselves to the Office of Refugee Resettlement for approval and take him in once they were approved. The only thing between him and freedom, then, was a little more paperwork.The transfer from shelter to jail can be abrupt; it often happens at midnight on detainees\u2019 18th birthday and typically cuts them off from any relationships they might have established, including with caseworkers and counselors. There are many things wrong with this policy. There is no dark magic that turns teenagers into criminals on their 18th birthday, even if they were born outside the United States. Given the damage that incarceration can do to young adults, every alternative should be pursued before turning teenage asylum seekers over to adult detention. And, as the Ramirez lawsuit indicates, the procedure itself may be illegal. Federal law requires ICE to place children and teenagers in the least restrictive setting possible, even after they turn 18. There are other options, in any case: Immigration advocates, including Mr. Ramirez's lawyers, have proposed releasing teenagers like Mr. Ramirez to sponsors, with ankle monitors if need be, or to group homes or shelters for young adults. Mr. Ramirez was just 17 when he crossed the American border, and he had already spent nearly a decade working under slave-like conditions in the coffee fields of his native Guatemala. But if he and others like him assumed the burdens of adulthood long before they arrived in Texas or California or Arizona, they are still teenagers. They deserve as much protection and support as teenagers born in this country \u2014 or in any other. We have the ways and means to provide that protection and support. We just need the will and the decency.Advertisement"}

Trump has asserted more control over his presidency\u2019s staffing decisions, ejected obvious establishment plants like H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn in favor of faces he likes from cable TV. He\u2019s pursued a version of the trade wars that he touted on the hustings; he\u2019s disrupted summit meetings with allies and fallen prostrate before Putin; he\u2019s conducted diplomacy with North Korea in a reality-television style; he\u2019s attacked the Mueller investigation constantly and hired surrogates to take the attacks all the way to 11; he\u2019s pursued a family-separation policy at the border that\u2019s exactly the kind of cruelty that his campaign promised and that many Republicans promised to restrain.[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] So is it still fair to describe Trump as a hemmed-in weakling, a Twitter terror but otherwise constrained? My answer is still a qualified yes. The president has torn through a few of the restraints that bind him, and some of the stories that Woodward\u2019s book tells (in which cabinet officials behave like Nixon\u2019s cabinet in the waning days of Watergate, doing everything possible to sideline their boss) may belong more to the era of Cohn and McMaster than Larry Kudlow and John Bolton. But Trump is still extraordinarily weak. Some of that weakness is invisible because we simply take it for granted; it\u2019s just part of the scenery, for instance, that this White House has no legislative agenda, no chance of advancing any policy priority on the hill, barely two years into the president\u2019s first term. Some of the weakness shows up in his attempts to play the tough guy. The child-separation policy, for instance, was abandoned scant days after it was publicized, because the president lacked the support within his own party and within his own White House to actually see a draconian measure through. Some of the weakness is implicit in Trump\u2019s attempts to reassert himself against restraints imposed by his allies or advisers. The rants against Jeff Sessions for failing to be his wingman are at once a dereliction of normal presidential duties and an admission that the Senate won\u2019t let him replace his own cabinet officials. The supine behavior beside Putin was at once a national embarrassment and a reminder that Trump\u2019s obvious desire to be pals with Russia has no discernible influence on his administration\u2019s actual Russia policy.And some of his weakness is presumably visible only behind the scenes and won\u2019t be revealed until the next tell-all book, when it\u2019s Bolton and Kudlow\u2019s turn to leak \u2014 though we get tastes already, as in this newspaper\u2019s recent account of how Bolton maneuvered successfully behind the scenes to shield the NATO summit\u2019s final communiqu\u00e9 from his boss\u2019s aggressive NATO skepticism.All of this points to the case that Trump-skeptical Republican lawmakers can still offer, if pressed, in defense of their own approach to this strange presidency. Sure, the trade wars are bad, but every president launches at least one dumb trade war. We stopped the child migrant business, his other immigration moves are just stepped-up enforcement of the law, we\u2019ve stepped back from the brink (however bizarrely) with the North Koreans, we\u2019re still sanctioning the Russians.Meanwhile he\u2019s nominated the most establishment Republican jurist possible to the Supreme Court, and we won\u2019t even let him fire his own attorney general, let alone Bob Mueller. Look, we\u2019re not enabling an American Putin here. We\u2019re just babysitting the most impotent chief executive we\u2019ll ever see, and locking in some good judges before the Democrats sweep us out. I could continue this ventriloquization, but instead I\u2019ll just point to its most substantial flaw: It assumes that Trumpian weakness will never breed Trumpian desperation, and that this president will be content with his impotence even in the face of a Mueller indictment of someone in his inner circle or a Democratic House\u2019s investigation that threatens disgrace and ruin for his family. It assumes that Trump will never, even in a desperate hour, put his party\u2019s attempts to contain him gently to a firmer sort of test.It\u2019s understandable that Republicans want to make this assumption. It\u2019s understandable that they want to manage their way through this presidency, to prod and press and redirect rather than confronting and resisting. And so far that strategy has worked out better than one might reasonably have feared.But we still have two years and four months left of this administration. And before it ends, I suspect the harder test will come. Advertisement"}

Then, one day, I accidentally knocked a wine glass off a table, and it shattered on the kitchen floor. I swept up the shards.A day or two later, someone rang the doorbell, and I ran to see who it was. As I did, I must have stepped on a tiny sliver of glass from that shattered goblet. I felt the sharp pain as it pierced my left heel.For the next week or so, I walked around Cork with that tiny sliver in my heel. I can\u2019t remember if I didn\u2019t think there was really glass in my foot or if I thought it would work itself out, or what. But slowly it began to hurt more and more and more.It took a long time before someone saw me. Then staff members took me into an operating room and jabbed my foot with painkillers, although not nearly enough. For 10,000 years, they hunted around in my heel for the sliver as I lay there screaming. At last they found it.My wife was there when I finished, and she took me in her arms, and drove me to the apothecary to get a post-procedure prescription filled. I waited in the car \u2014 a gray Opel \u2014 while she went in to fill the script.When she came back to the car, she found me sobbing. It was as hard as I\u2019d ever wept in my life. She held me as I cried and shook.I think in that moment I was realizing that my whole life had been like this. For years I had walked around with something piercing me to the core, and I had just pretended it was all fine, because I thought I had to.But I wasn\u2019t fine, and I had finally reached the limits of my being able to pretend. I needed to get to a place where I didn\u2019t hurt anymore. I needed to stop being the one who was always shielding everyone else, and to be the one who was cared for.I wouldn\u2019t begin my transition proper for another nine months or so, until after we came back to the United States. But when I look back, that was the day I shattered like a goblet. That was the day I realized I couldn\u2019t take one more step.I was 40 years old at the time. People often ask late transitioners, why now, after all this time? What kind of woman do you think you can be, after missing your girlhood and your adolescence? But those aren\u2019t the questions one should ask.The question is, how did you manage to go so long? What enabled you to keep carrying your burden in secret, walking around with a shard of glass in your foot, for all those years?This story may be less about what it is like to come out as trans than it is about finding the courage to do a difficult thing, even if you are no longer young, even if you do not know how. Trans people are surely not the only ones who wonder how to close the gap between the people they feel they have to pretend to be and their authentic selves. Individuals who arrive at such profound and difficult moments don\u2019t deserve to be interrogated and scoffed at and ridiculed. When it comes to trans folks, we don\u2019t deserve clever think pieces about \u201cWhat Makes a Woman?\u201d We don\u2019t deserve the cruel and the clueless telling us they know who we are better than we do.

{"Headline": "On Ecstasy, Octopuses Reached Out for a Hug", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesBy dosing the tentacled creatures with MDMA, researchers found they share parts of an ancient messaging system involved in social behaviors with humans.For Dr. D\u00f6len, who is interested in evolution of social behavior, the octopus offered an interesting test of MDMA and serotonin, because it is separated by 500 million years of evolution from humans, but also has complex behavior.Octopuses suspend their aggression for a few minutes to mate, perhaps accessing an otherwise switched-off neural signaling system \u2014 potentially similar to the one that helps humans behave socially, she reasoned. And any similarities in octopus and human genetic code related to this system could help her understand how the brain \u2014 down to its tiniest bits \u2014 evolved to govern social behaviors.Like a wedge in Pac-Man\u2019s mouth, MDMA fits inside a protein that moves serotonin in and out of neurons. The drug eventually causes a flood of serotonin between synapses, increasing its signals. When the researchers compared the genome of the California two-spot octopus (Octopus bimaculoides) to those of other animals, they discovered humans and octopuses could both make this protein, and it was nearly 100 percent similar at that special Pac-Man spot.But would that protein on ecstasy also make octopuses social?They put the octopuses in the center of a three-chambered tank where they could explore a Star Wars figurine on one side or another octopus on the other (it was contained beneath an overturned orchid pot with holes, in case the MDMA hadn\u2019t worked and violence ensued).Undosed, octopuses of either sex spent more time with the toy than the other octopus (if it was a male; they seemed less concerned when it was female).But after soaking in low-dose MDMA-laced baths, the octopuses seemed to relax. They spent more time with the male octopuses on the other side of the tank.They also hugged the pot with several arms, showing off their ventral ends, or mouths, almost like how the Larger Pacific Striped Octopus, the only known social octopus species, mates beak to beak in an eight-armed hug.Though just beginning, Dr. D\u00f6len is hopeful: \u201cWe need to be taking full advantage of these compounds to see what they\u2019re doing to the brain,\u201d she said.She added that when the octopuses came down from their serotonin highs, they acted completely normal \u2014 for an octopus.An earlier version of this article miscategorized insects.

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Judge Kavanaugh has flatly denied any wrongdoing. \u201cI did not do this back in high school or at any time,\u201d he said in a statement.As in the case of so many he-said/she-said scenarios, there\u2019s much we don\u2019t know and probably never will with certainty. But there are two things we do know.First, there is no upside for women who come forward with stories of sexual harassment or assault, especially when the accused is a famous or powerful man. It doesn\u2019t matter how credible the story is. Simply by telling it, a woman can expect to be pilloried in the press and suffer far worse on social media, if not in real life.Dr. Blasey, who initially asked Ms. Feinstein to keep her identity confidential, told The Washington Post that the alleged attack changed her life for years and contributed to long-term anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. She knew that putting her name to the allegations \u2014 which she felt forced to do after news of her letter was reported last week \u2014 would change her life again, and not for the better. Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s defenders have already launched a fusillade of victim-blaming counterattacks, from the predictable to the preposterous:If anyone is still wondering why women don\u2019t speak up about sexual assault sooner, or at all, you have your answer.The bottom line is that Brett Kavanaugh is up for a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land, and there is now a credible accusation of sexual assault against him.The next steps are for the F.B.I. to interview Judge Kavanaugh, Dr. Blasey, Mr. Judge and possibly others about the accusations under oath, and for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hear from all parties, however long it takes. Twenty-seven years later, Clarence Thomas remains on the court and the Republican side of the Judiciary Committee remains all male.

Let them interview the many witnesses whose names are already in the public record, among them Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s close high-school friend Mark Judge, then weigh the credibility of the various claims and write a report for the White House and the Senate Judiciary Committee.Yes, partisan games have no doubt been played on both sides. But the only reason for so much urgency about this confirmation is politics; the same cannot be said about calls for holding a fair and thorough investigation. These are grotesque charges \u2014 and, like the previous ones, they leave oceans of room for speculation and doubt. This is precisely why the Senate needs to stop trying to ram through this nomination by some arbitrary deadline and arrange for a thorough and nonpartisan inquiry.Yet he maintains that it is inconceivable that he would have sexually wronged anyone at any time. And he fiercely brushes aside all of the accusations to arise after Dr. Blasey came forward as part of plot against him. \u201cOver the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired,\u201d his prepared statement says. \u201cThere has been a frenzy to come up with something \u2014 anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious \u2014 that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple.\u201dThis claim of victimhood will most likely endear the judge to President Trump, who said at a news conference Wednesday that the accusations against Judge Kavanaugh were \u201call false.\u201d (The president also said he would watch Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimony and said he could possibly find it \u201cconvincing.\u201d) It is also likely to play well with more retrograde lawmakers like Orrin Hatch, whose response to Ms. Swetnick\u2019s allegations was to insist that Judge Kavanaugh is the real victim here.This is dereliction of the Senate\u2019s duty \u2014 and it is now up to senators who know better, who prize the dignity and duty of their chamber, to demonstrate that they are indeed something more than partisan tools.This is not, as Republicans have claimed, a matter of demanding the destruction of a man\u2019s career based on vague or unsubstantiated claims.

{"Headline": "Morgon, in All Its Gorgeous Complexity", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWine SchoolGood wine is almost never simple. If I needed a reminder of this rewarding but inconvenient truth, our examination over the last month of Morgon, one of the 10 crus of Beaujolais, gave it to me in three excellent bottles.The variance is not a fault of the wine. It is what one would expect from Clos de la Roillette. Nor is it the fault of the guides, which are generally good-faith efforts to make wine a little easier to understand.As is so often the case, the best efforts to organize thinking about wine falter when weighed against actual experience. The variables that go into producing good wine can be so many that even laudable efforts to characterize the general traits of a particular place inevitably give way to counterexamples.Though these are all Morgons, and all from the 2016 vintage, the wines are dramatically different.The Brun is light and graceful \u2014 almost ethereal \u2014 yet full of the aromas and flavors of cherries and flowers underscored by an earthy, mineral component; it is delicate yet resonant.The Lapierre is quite a bit richer: bright, fresh, energetic, also floral and fruity, with a touch of licorice on the palate and a similar sort of underlying minerality. It\u2019s deceptively easygoing, masking its inherent complexity.The Foillard is fuller-bodied than the others, a mixture of power and finesse, with a pronounced licorice flavor among the red fruits, spices, flowers and minerals. It has more bottom to it, as if it has been amped up by a few electric bass notes.Despite their variations, the bottles are insanely easy to drink and delicious, as good Beaujolais ought to be. They each have depth as well, complexity that goes beyond mere deliciousness \u2014 a characteristic of cru Beaujolais. The structure and minerality might further define them as Morgons, yet why are they so different?The answer is as complicated as the wines. First, the grapes for each of these wines come from different plots within the Morgon cru. While Morgon and the Beaujolais crus in general are known for granite soils, not all vineyards are the same. Some are rocky granite, some are more sandy; some are pink granite and some are blue, indicating different mineral compositions.Significant areas of Morgon are not even granite, but brittle, decomposed schist, a different rock altogether. And the proportion of clay in the soil plays a crucial role.Some producers, like Mr. Foillard, have long used names of climats unofficially, as on this bottle. C\u00f4te du Py is essentially a hill of schist, and wines from the C\u00f4te du Py are often the most intense and powerful of the Morgons. Mr. Foillard also makes a Morgon Corcelette, a different climat of sandy granite that is often lighter bodied than the C\u00f4te du Py. I highly recommend trying them side by side if you are curious.The Brun Morgon comes from an area of sandy decomposed granite that is said to be similar to the soil of Corcellete, which perhaps accounts for the lightness and elegance of the wine. Mr. Brun also makes a wine from a particular plot on the C\u00f4te du Py, Javerni\u00e8res, that is firmer and more forthrightly mineral, if you ever want to compare.The Lapierre Morgon comes from grapes grown in light granite soils, as near as I can tell, which also differentiates it from the Foillard. Lapierre makes another Morgon, Cuv\u00e9e Camille, which is from a C\u00f4te du Py plot, but I have not tasted it.The vineyard sites are not the only variables. Winemaking techniques also can differ. All three producers work naturally, without overt manipulation or technological methods like thermovinification, in which some producers of mass-market Beaujolais heat the wine to 140 degrees or so to stabilize the wine, essentially pasteurizing it.The Foillard and Lapierre are both made by the most common method among small producers in Beaujolais today, using semi-carbonic fermentation, a process in which whole bunches of grapes, stems and all, are piled into large vats. The bunches on top crush those on the bottom, producing juice that starts to ferment, emitting carbon dioxide.The gas rises and initiates a different, intracellular fermentation without yeast among the bunches higher up. Eventually, after a certain number of days, the grapes are crushed and the fermentation is completed in the conventional manner, as yeast consumes the remaining sugar. This method is said to account for the light, fresh, aromatic character of Beaujolais.But a small group of Beaujolais producers, including Mr. Brun, prefer to avoid the semi-carbonic method. Mr. Brun destems the grapes and ferments them simply with the indigenous yeast, often referred to in Beaujolais as the Burgundian style.Everybody still with me? We are just skimming the surface here of Morgon geekdom. As far as Wine School is concerned, the deeper we plunge the greater the fun. But we also understand settling for the deliciousness of the wines without trying to chase down the reasons they taste as they do.The important point here is that many efforts to simplify wine by summarizing characteristics in easily digested, bite-size pieces \u2014 no matter how well-intentioned \u2014 often confuse matters.These three wines don\u2019t conform to simple descriptions of Morgon. Nonetheless, they each epitomize different expressions of the region. I imagine we could duplicate this experience in any wine region where taxonomists have tried to classify characteristics briefly and simply.I should also note that in many regions around the world, such as Barolo, Montalcino and Sonoma, efforts are underway to better and more narrowly define appellations. Mostly, I believe, these efforts will remain unofficial: complicating labels, with additional place names and terms, are difficult politically and economically, even if the labels would better describe what\u2019s in the bottle.The conventional wisdom about Beaujolais is that it does not age well. That certainly applies to mass-market Beaujolais, in which the processing makes them stable enough to withstand shipping but eliminates the life force necessary to age and evolve. But good Beaujolais, made carefully and conscientiously, absolutely has the ability to age and evolve. When to drink it comes down to one\u2019s own preferences.\u201cEven though most of the \u201816s covered in this article are already delicious,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe best wines possess impressive concentration and balance, two factors that suggest they will enjoy graceful aging curves.\u201dThe great thing about the \u201816s is you can drink them anytime you want, no regrets. Or you can try this experiment: Buy three bottles. Drink one immediately, one in two years and the third in five years.Why do this? The same reason we do anything at Wine School. Both to know, and to make more educated decisions.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Forget Kavanaugh\u2019s First Hearing", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe shouldn\u2019t allow the questions raised about the nominee in his first hearing to be submerged by the onrushing tide of scandal.Contributing Opinion Writer The explosive, late-arising allegations of sexual misconduct threatening to derail Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court make it natural to point to the parallel between the present moment and Anita Hill\u2019s charges against Judge Clarence Thomas 27 years ago.In both cases, the confirmation hearings ended on schedule before members of the Senate Judiciary Committee found themselves unexpectedly in session again to hear allegations against the nominees, in Judge Thomas\u2019s case, that he sexually harassed Ms. Hill.But this eerie parallel, separated by a generation of cultural change \u2014 or perhaps it will turn out to be only presumed change or wished-for change \u2014 is not the perspective from which I want to compare these two cases on the eve of the Kavanaugh hearing. Rather, I want to offer a note of warning about something else the two might turn out to share: that the questions raised about Judge Kavanaugh in his first hearing will be submerged by the onrushing tide of scandal, as they were for Justice Thomas.I\u2019ve observed that many people who followed the Thomas nomination closely, even including those who retain strong feelings about the dramatic second hearing, have forgotten what happened in the first round \u2014 the real hearing, as I have persisted in calling it for the past 27 years. I don\u2019t mean to dismiss or diminish the significance of Ms. Hill\u2019s allegations or of the outrageous way the men of the Judiciary Committee treated her. But I do think it\u2019s unfortunate that the cynicism and racial politics that infused the nomination of the underqualified 43-year-old Judge Thomas to a lifetime position in the seat once held by Thurgood Marshall has been erased from public memory.And I\u2019d like to think that people remember his remarkable description of the transformation he underwent when he became a judge and \u201cshed the baggage of ideology.\u201d It was an \u201camazing process,\u201d he told the senators. \u201cYou want to be stripped down like a runner.\u201dIn one way, Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court nominee is Clarence Thomas\u2019s opposite. His conventional qualifications are not in doubt. (The American Bar Association committee that deemed him \u201cwell qualified,\u201d the organization\u2019s highest rating, had adjudged Clarence Thomas to be only \u201cqualified,\u201d with a minority of the members deeming him \u201cunqualified.\u201d) After a Supreme Court clerkship and 12 years on the federal appellate bench, he has an easy familiarity with the intricacies of the Supreme Court\u2019s docket. His avoidance of direct questions about his substantive views was graceful to the point of tedium, and not a surprise to anyone.No matter what happens on Thursday and in the days to come, I hope people will remember what the Kavanaugh nomination looked like at the close of the initial hearing.At this moment, the line fits Brett Kavanaugh, too. He and Clarence Thomas have that in common.Advertisement"}

Republican leaders can\u2019t seem to take the problem seriously.The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.Republicans seem determined to brand themselves the party of sexual harassment and abuse. This is not to pass judgment on whether the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were in high school, as she has said. That has yet to be investigated. Neither is this to suggest that Republican and conservative men are more inclined to behave like entitled pigs than are Democrats and liberals. Abuse of power is nonpartisan. Roughly, for every Blake Farenthold there is a John Conyers Jr.; for every Roger Ailes, a Harvey Weinstein.Get it? How serious could sexual assault be if it took place among teenagers? Chicks today are so touchy.Except that, if Dr. Blasey\u2019s account is true, then Judge Kavanaugh is not \u201ca really good man\u201d because he would have been lying to Congress, the president and the American people. It\u2019s hard to tell if this lawyer is suggesting that most men committed sexual assault as teenagers or he sees sexual assault on par with other youthful indiscretions, like breaking curfew. Either way, it is a troubling message.Sure, many voters may be unhappy about the failure to act, especially considering the parade of lawmakers caught up in sexual misconduct scandals this past year. But Mr. McConnell, like others in his party, is betting that G.O.P. voters don\u2019t care about such matters and will come out in force to support the team on Election Day.We can only hope that the Republican electorate proves itself better than its leaders.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Now Twitter Edits The New Yorker", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe venerable magazine hands the reins to the digital mob.Opinion Columnist\u201cToday, The New Yorker announced that, as part of our annual festival, I would conduct an interview with Bannon,\u201d Remnick wrote, in a manner reminiscent of a hostage letter. \u201cThe reaction on social media was critical and a lot of the dismay and anger was directed at me and my decision to engage him. Some members of the staff, too, reached out to say that they objected to the invitation, particularly the forum of the festival.\u201dWhat followed was a lengthy, and wholly persuasive, explanation of why Bannon was in fact worth inviting in the first place. True, Bannon was no longer in the White House, and his bid to get Roy Moore elected in Alabama had failed.Nevertheless, Bannon remains among the most outspoken impresarios of nationalist, illiberal politics in an age when such politics are sweeping the globe. If high-profile interviews with a racist like George Wallace or a theocrat like Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini were worth doing by a past generation of journalists, Remnick reasoned, why not one with Bannon?But none of that mattered because \u2014 well, Twitter.That\u2019s nice, and possibly sincere. But as a friend recently remarked with respect to another publication that quickly capitulated to online furies, what this really means is that Remnick is no longer the editor of The New Yorker. Twitter is. Social media doesn\u2019t just get a voice. Now it wields a veto. What used to be thought of as adult supervision yields \u2014 as it already has in Congress and at universities \u2014 to the itch of the crowd.That\u2019s an astonishing statement coming from any journalist who believes that the vocation should largely be about putting tough questions to influential people, particularly bad people. If speaking truth to power isn\u2019t the ultimate task of publications such as The New Yorker, they\u2019re on the road to their own left-wing version of \u201cFox & Friends.\u201dNot long ago, a public challenge such as Schulz\u2019s would have been a firing offense. But the gradual degradation of editorial authority is another depressing feature of our digital age, as supposedly neutral reporters use social media to opine freely, ferociously and very publicly about whatever they please, not least their own colleagues and employers. That the targets of these opinions are, like Remnick, themselves conventional liberals ought to be a warning to newsroom chiefs about the risks of employing progressive bullies.In the meantime, it\u2019s worth considering what Remnick\u2019s disinvitation has actually achieved. Here\u2019s my list:The next time we journalists demand \u201ccourage\u201d of the politicians, let\u2019s first take care to prove that we know what the word means, and to exhibit some courage ourselves.

{"Headline": "Is Boycotting Israel \u2018Hate\u2019?", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE STONEOpponents of the nonviolent Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement are involved in a dishonest branding campaign. Mr. Levine is a philosophy professor and a member of the Jewish Voice for Peace Academic Advisory Council.The debate over the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (B.D.S.) movement against Israel has been one of the most contentious in American political culture for more than a decade. Now, given the tumultuous and deadly events of the past several months, it is likely to heat up further. While these bills certainly constitute threats to free speech \u2014 (a view shared by the ACLU) \u2014 I am interested in a more subtle effect of a fairly widespread anti-B.D.S. strategy: co-opting rhetoric of the anti-Trump resistance, which opposes the growing influence of racist hate groups, in order to brand B.D.S. as a hate group itself. In my home state of Massachusetts, for example, where a hearing for one of the many state bills aimed at punishing B.D.S. activity took place in July 2017, those who testified in favor of the bill, along with their supporters in the gallery, wore signs saying \u201cNo Hate in the Bay State.\u201d They took every opportunity to compare B.D.S. supporters to the alt-right activists recently empowered by the election of Donald Trump. (Full disclosure: I am a strong supporter of B.D.S. and was among those testifying against the bill.)The aim of this activity is to relegate the B.D.S. movement, and the Palestine solidarity movement more generally, to the nether region of public discourse occupied by all the intolerant worldviews associated with the alt-right. This is an area the philosopher John Rawls would call \u201cunreasonable.\u201d But to my mind, it is the anti-B.D.S. movement itself that belongs there.One of the essential principles of democratic government is freedom of thought and expression, and this extends to the unreasonable/intolerant as well as to the reasonable, so long as certain strict limits on incitement to violence, libel and the like are observed. Still, doctrines within the \u201ctent of the reasonable\u201d are accorded a different status within public institutions and civil society from those deemed outside the tent. This is reflected in the kinds of public support or reprobation representatives of the state and other civil society institutions (e.g., universities) display toward the doctrines or values in question. To put it simply, we expect what\u2019s reasonable to get a fair hearing within the public sphere, even if many don\u2019t agree with it. B.D.S. supporters are \u201cdelegitimizers,\u201d according to Schumer, because they do not grant legitimacy to the Zionist project. Some might quibble with this claim about the B.D.S. goals, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that rejection of the legitimacy of the Zionist project is fairly widespread within the movement. But does this constitute anti-Semitism? Does this put them outside the tent of the reasonable?With regard to the second claim, it seems obvious to me, and I bet many others when they bother to think about it, that claims to land stemming from a connection to people who lived there 2,000 years ago is extremely weak when opposed by the claims of those who currently live there and whose people have been living there for perhaps a millennium or more.Remember, one needn\u2019t agree with me in my rejection of these two principal claims for my point to stand. All one must acknowledge is that the right at issue isn\u2019t obvious and is at least open to question. If a reasonable person can see that this right of the Jews to establish a state in Palestine is at least open to question, then it can\u2019t be a sign of anti-Semitism to question it! But once you admit the B.D.S. position within the tent of the reasonable, the proper response is not, as Senator Schumer claims, \u201cdelegitimizing,\u201d but rather disputing \u2014 engaging in argument, carried out in the public sphere according to the rules of public reason.But now we get to my second main point \u2014 that it\u2019s the anti-B.D.S. camp that violates reasonableness; not because it is an expression of intolerance (though often it flirts with Islamophobia), but because it violates the constraints on public reason. Just how far the positive argument for the legitimacy of the Zionist project often veers from the rules of public reason is perfectly captured by another quote from Mr. Schumer\u2019s speech to Aipac.\u201cNow, let me tell you why \u2014 my view, why we don\u2019t have peace. Because the fact of the matter is that too many Palestinians and too many Arabs do not want any Jewish state in the Middle East,\u201d he said. \u201cThe view of Palestinians is simple: The Europeans treated the Jews badly, culminating in the Holocaust, and they gave them our land as compensation. Of course, we say it\u2019s our land, the Torah says it, but they don\u2019t believe in the Torah. So that\u2019s the reason there is not peace. They invent other reasons, but they do not believe in a Jewish state, and that is why we, in America, must stand strong with Israel through thick and thin \u2026\u201d This quote is really quite remarkable, coming from one of the most powerful legislators in our democracy. After fairly well characterizing a perfectly reasonable attitude Palestinians have about who is responsible for the Holocaust and who should pay any reparations for it, Mr. Schumer then appeals to the Torah to justify the Jewish claim against them. But this is a totally illegitimate appeal as a form of public reason, no different from appealing to religious doctrine when opposing abortion. In fact, I claim you can\u2019t find any genuine argument that isn\u2019t guilty of breaching the limits of the reasonable in this way for the alleged right to establish the Jewish state in Palestine. This almost certainly explains why opponents of B.D.S. are now turning to the heavy hand of the state to criminalize support for it. In a \u201cfair fight\u201d within the domain of public reason, they would indeed find themselves \u201cdelegitimized.\u201dJoseph Levine is a professor of philosophy at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and the author of \u201cQuality and Content: Essays on Consciousness, Representation and Modality.\u201d He is a member of the Jewish Voice for Peace Academic Advisory Council.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "German Politicians Call for Surveillance of Anti-Immigrant Party", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 German politicians have called on domestic intelligence officials to place the nationalist Alternative for Germany party under surveillance on suspicion of undermining the country\u2019s Constitution, as it stokes resentments against immigrants and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s immigration policies.The call came from members of the Social Democrats, part of the governing coalition, as well as the opposition Greens and some members of Ms. Merkel\u2019s own Christian Democrats.Horst Seehofer, Germany\u2019s highest security official, rejected the calls, saying he did not see sufficient grounds for monitoring the party. Political parties, their associated organizations and individual politicians can be subject to such measures if the authorities can establish clear evidence of efforts to undermine the principles of the country\u2019s Constitution.A concert devoted to rejecting anti-immigrant sentiment drew around 65,000 people to the heart of Chemnitz on Monday, city officials said.Because the German authorities were not able to establish the defendant\u2019s identity definitively, and he claimed to be 15 at the time of the crime, he was tried as a juvenile, so the maximum sentence was 10 years.The killing, in December 2017, took place in daylight in a drugstore in a small western German town, shocking the nation and emerging as a rallying cry for the far right and others who maintain that the government cannot guarantee the safety of Germans in the face of a wave of immigration. Hundreds of demonstrators and counterdemonstrators converged on the town, Kandel, in unrest that gripped the city for days and left dozens of people injured.Although overall violent crime in Germany remains below its 2007 peak, anti-immigrant activists and far-right politicians have seized on violent crimes committed by migrants. They argue that Ms. Merkel\u2019s relatively welcoming policy toward refugees from the Middle East and Africa poses a threat to the country\u2019s safety, as well as to its national identity.Prosecutors argued that the killer had been jealous after his victim broke up with him several weeks earlier. In keeping with Germany privacy law, he was identified only as Abdul D., and she as Mia V.Twelve days before she was stabbed, Mia filed a report with the police in which she accused Abdul of insulting and threatening her, and her father reported him to the authorities two days before her death.Volker Poss, the mayor of Kandel, said right-wing groups were organizing demonstrations in the town for later Monday, to protest what they considered an overly lenient sentence for the killing.Although an expert analysis had suggested that Abdul was over 17, and possibly as old as 20, the authorities decided not to try him as an adult, which meant the trial was closed to spectators.Because migrants under age 18 are treated as juveniles in Germany, they are afforded better benefits, including access to schooling and protection from deportation until they become adults. This has led young men to enter the country without documents and lie about their ages.There is also some question about the defendant\u2019s origins. He said he was from Afghanistan, but officials have been not been able to confirm that.He arrived in Germany in 2016, a year that saw a surge of migration to Europe, primarily from the Middle East and Africa, and applied for asylum as a refugee. Like one of the suspects in Chemnitz, he had been denied asylum but had not yet been deported.In Chemnitz, an industrial city near the border with the Czech Republic, tens of thousands of people packed the city center on Monday night, joining a local punk band\u2019s call for Germans who support a tolerant, diverse society to take back the narrative from the right-wing nationalists.The police in Chemnitz would not allow anti-immigrant groups to register counterprotests in the area.Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a contributed reporting from London, and Christopher F.

{"Headline": "Off the Registry: Homemade Wedding Gifts", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI couldn\u2019t wait to see my older daughter, Sofie Hodara, walk down the aisle. I couldn\u2019t wait to celebrate her wedding to her longtime beau, Nathan Thomas Wilson. And I couldn\u2019t wait to give the happy couple my gift.I had spent months working on it before their May wedding in Philadelphia. It was a giant brass key ring hung with marital advice I\u2019d solicited from immediate family on both sides. I dubbed it the marriage ring.Everyone had emailed me their messages: \u201cSaying \u2018Thank you for washing the dishes\u2019 never hurts,\u201d an uncle suggested. \u201cAs you grow as a couple, continue to grow as individuals,\u201d Sofie\u2019s godmother wrote. My brother and his wife shared a short treatise they titled \u201cSnakes in a Bag.\u201dI compiled them all, and after fiddling with page breaks, margins, fonts and colors, printed them and turned each into a small book. There are nine, bound with staples, covered in multihued cardboard or brightly patterned origami paper; one I rolled into a scroll. They are attached to the key ring with ribbon or ball chain, alongside tokens like a heart-shaped rock and a sachet of orange peel my husband had ground up.I made the marriage ring because I wanted to share with Sofie and Nathan a collection of wisdom and counsel. But I also made it as an outlet for the swell of emotions I was experiencing, and as a tangible manifestation of a lifetime of growth and history and love.Sometimes a set of knives won\u2019t do. Sometimes a check feels too transactional and the options on a wedding registry too impersonal. An alternative is something handmade, something created specially for the newlyweds: a gift that honors the connection between the giver and the couple.A cheese board made sense: \u201cWe always hung out and talked over wine and cheese,\u201d he said. Beyond serving appetizers, Mr. O\u2019Malley views the cheese board as a repository of shared stories and a lasting symbol of his bond with his friends. \u201cIf you make something that is truly cared about, it will continue on as an heirloom or an object of durability, not disposability,\u201d he said. Ms. Vislocky found the couple\u2019s registry less than inspiring. \u201cMina is such a creative person,\u201d she said, \u201cand most of the gifts were pretty plain.\u201dBefore turning to her sewing machine, Ms. Vislocky checked with Ms. Ash: \u201cI asked if I could go off registry and make something, and she said yes.\u201dThe pillow is a patchwork of fabrics, each chosen to reflect her friend\u2019s aesthetics. Ms. Vislocky added a few metallic elements because, she said, \u201cMina has a really bright personality.\u201dThe choice to make a pillow was deliberate: \u201cI like to think it will be part of the home they build together,\u201d Ms. Vislocky said.She gathered 38, including hummus, cocktails and a grandmother\u2019s treasured cookies, then prepared and photographed 17 of them.Ms. Markel began as she begins most projects: with an inspiration board filling her studio wall with images selected from a stash amassed over time. \u201cI choose what matches my feelings about what I\u2019m working on,\u201d she said.In this case, the board included pictures of Kate Moss at her wedding (\u201cSarah loved Kate\u2019s veil,\u201d Ms. Markel said), lots of Jeanne Lanvin gowns (\u201cI love Jeanne Lanvin,\u201d she said) and childhood photographs of Ms. Wedge.Ms. Markel created several possibilities and invited the bride-to-be and the mother-of-the-bride-to-be for a try-on session. In the end, Ms. Wedge wore a wreath of moss-green silk adorned with vintage lilies of the valley that Ms. Markel had given to her in an elegant box.Titled \u201cTraveler,\u201d the haunting song was sparked by Ms. Olson\u2019s now-30-year marriage to her husband, Ted McMahon. \u201cI was thinking about how I could possibly describe the feeling of loving someone so deeply,\u201d she said.The lyrics include \u201cIf you were the mountains, I\u2019d be the sun,\u201d and \u201cIf you were a poet, I\u2019d be the rhyme.\u201d At the wedding, Ms. Olson played guitar, joined by Mr. McMahon on percussion and another guitarist, Jed Myers. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve given them a piece of my heart,\u201d Ms. Olson said, \u201cinstead of buying something at Crate and Barrel.\u201dComposing music, woodworking, crafting headwear \u2014 not everyone has these skills. But that doesn\u2019t rule out giving a handmade gift. Lauren Swann, 35, of Venice, Calif., sews garters for good friends using strips of stretch lace and appliqu\u00e9s she finds on Etsy.Guests often assume they should stick to the registry because that is what the newlyweds want. When in doubt, those moved to make an alternative can do what Ms. Vislocky and Ms. Olson did and ask first. Or they can jump in and trust that their efforts will be appreciated for what they are: an expression of good wishes and love.For 45 years, Christine and John Koziol, of Somers, N.Y., have appreciated the wedding gift they received from Ms. Koziol\u2019s beloved aunt and uncle, Eloise and Charles Harmon. It is an untitled painting created by Ms. Harmon: vibrant flowers spewing from a cream-colored vase against a bold red background. Ms. Harmon was a painter, sculptor and potter whose home, Ms. Koziol recalled, was filled with art. \u201cIt was something exotic that I loved,\u201d she said. \u201cShe saw beauty in everything.\u201dSome of her aunt\u2019s vision endures in Ms. Koziol and in the painting that graces her home. Shortly after they married, the Koziols purchased a house and hung the painting over the fireplace. When they moved to a new home, then to another, and yet another, the painting retained its prominent placement.

Today, on St. Helena Island, in South Carolina, there are about 5,000 Gullah people, the descendants of slaves who worked on rice plantations before the Civil War.I can\u2019t help but wonder if it was also influenced by the fear that if they were to leave, they would not be allowed to return.As you\u2019ll see below, the history is both disturbing and fascinating.

Part of the Democrats\u2019 comeback strategy for the House this year has been to nominate a historically diverse slate of candidates intended to inspire a disparate coalition of voters. Republicans have responded by maligning these nominees as out of touch, pointing to policy issues, or when it seems more convenient, the personal or ethnic background of the candidates.With whites making up more than 80 percent of voters in the 19th, which stretches throughout the Catskills region of New York, the district is one of the whitest in the country.

Eleven years ago, Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

Two decades later, she is sharing her inventions with the world as the chef of Seasoned Vegan in Harlem, a restaurant that specializes in vegan soul food and sees no contradiction between those terms, that debunks the notion of veganism as a sacrifice.Consider Ms. Beener\u2019s take on burdock, a thistlelike weed born in Siberia and northern Europe, with a hardscrabble capacity to thrive almost anywhere. (Its prickly, obstinately clingy burrs were the template for Velcro.) On its own, the root has the approximate meatiness of mushrooms and artichokes. Here, it\u2019s been pulverized, reconstituted with spices unnamed (trade secret), drenched in a meld of barbecue sauce and r\u00e9moulade, and tucked into a warm, chewy pretzel bun.It\u2019s got that seesaw of sweet and tang, a meld of pulped tomato, vinegar and sugar pressed from organic beets. The bread righteously puffs and sinks. And the burdock, credited as \u201ccrawfish\u201d on the quotation-mark-happy menu, is believable in the role.Then again, the burdock could as easily pose as chicken, like the fermented soy in nuggets with dark gold, featherweight panko crusts. The texture convinces, but it\u2019s the salt and crunch that carry the day, the seethe of oil in the fryer that has the power to set everything right.Fermented soy also shows up as tuna, shredded and snug inside a band of nori, topped by a daub of mayonnaise. It has a satisfying funk, even if it doesn\u2019t quite conjure the deeps.Fleshy fried \u201cshrimp,\u201d stuffed in a po\u2019 boy, go through a more dramatic metamorphosis: They\u2019re engineered from konjac, a fiber-rich tuber that is close to zero in calories and, in its native state, entirely tasteless. What it does best is absorb flavors, in this case seaweed\u2019s wistful, half-remembered brine. And the vegetable\u2019s stores of glucomannan, a viscous fiber that works as a thickener and binder, give the shrimp a touch of bounce \u2014 and dupe the stomach into feeling full.They opened the restaurant in 2014 in a corner storefront with windows overlooking St. Nicholas Avenue, after raising $22,000 through Kickstarter and winning a $5,000 prize from the Harlem Business Alliance. (\u201cConventional banks wouldn\u2019t help,\u201d Mr. Beener said.)The neighborhood was waiting. Most nights, the dining room gets crowded early and stays that way. A note on the menu says, \u201cPlease limit dining times to 90 min.\u201d Nevertheless, the servers field newcomers\u2019 questions patiently. They act as if they had all the time in the world, and sometimes the cooks do, too; don\u2019t expect food in a hurry.Half the pleasure of eating like this, for nonvegans at least, is the surprise and disbelief. Faux crawfish, ersatz shrimp: They\u2019re less a matter of alchemy and transfiguration than sleight of hand in a circle of sawdust. The rabbit pops out of the hat. You want to clap.At the same time, it can be hard to judge dishes on their own merits and not compare them to their counterparts in the world of meat. The question isn\u2019t, Does it taste as good as the original? Just: Does it taste good?Much of it, yes, although it would take someone on a higher plane of being than I to appreciate mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese in which the cheese (arrowroot-based) has attained stretch but not quite creaminess, or to willingly return to the mulchy undertow of raw \u201cbread\u201d forged out of dehydrated flaxseeds and onions.Still, any doubts vanish at the end of the meal. For here is ice cream, the cream supplanted and possibly surpassed by almond milk. Thick and rich, a scoop of it rests like a boulder between two equally mighty cookies. It tastes like the real thing. No: It is the real thing.slide showAdvertisement"}

Others, apparently heavily armed, faced the assailants, then threw themselves to the ground without firing back. Some just ran for their lives.Captured on video and widely shared on social media, the attack over the weekend on an Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps parade in Iran was a humiliating blow. A local Arab separatist group claimed responsibility, but Iran said the perpetrators were backed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United States.On Monday, Iranian officials vowed revenge against all three countries and Israel.The attack has escalated tensions between Iran and the Persian Gulf states and their American allies. The Trump White House has taken a hard line against Iran, withdrawing from a nuclear agreement and imposing sanctions that have damaged Iran\u2019s flailing economy.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have clashed with Iran over Yemen, Qatar and Syria. The conflicts are expected to take center stage at the United Nations General Assembly this week.The Islamic State claimed responsibility with bulletins on its Amaq news service, which also ran the video of the fighters. But the video did not explicitly say the attackers belonged to the Islamic State, nor did they pledge allegiance to the group\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as similar claims from the group have done in the past.Iranian news accounts said there had been at least four assailants, who disguised themselves in Iranian uniforms and attacked from behind the viewing bleachers at the parade. They said three of the assailants had been killed and one captured.Iranian officials provided no evidence that the countries they blamed were behind the attack. The United States and the Emirates issued statements dismissing the accusation.But the attack came at a volatile time in Iran\u2019s relations with those countries.Analysts said the Revolutionary Guards, an elite militia that operates independently of the Iranian government, were bound to react strongly to such a public humiliation.\u201cThey\u2019re going to go for a strong reaction to remedy the horrible image this attack has given them, the imagery that they are running away, falling down on the ground and so on,\u201d said Ahmad Moussalli, a regional expert and professor of political science at the American University of Beirut. \u201cThey could correct that with a heavy military blow somewhere.\u201dHe said that he doubted the Revolutionary Guards would risk a direct military confrontation with the Emirates or Saudi Arabia and that the response would more likely occur in Syria or Iraq. The attack, though embarrassing, Mr. Moussalli said, \u201cshows that the gulf and the United States is targeting Iran now, and gives Iran a pretext to flex their military power.\u201dThe Emirates were not the only regional power cheering on internal resistance to the Iranian government recently.Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, suggested a year ago that it was time to turn from external pressure on Iran to internal pressure. Prince Mohammed, in repeated interviews in the United States this year, also likened Ayatollah Khamenei to Hitler, saying at one point, \u201cI believe the Iranian supreme leader makes Hitler look good.\u201dAfter attacks in Tehran last year, the Revolutionary Guards said that Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States were responsible, but most government officials blamed terrorists. This time, Iranian leaders described the attack not as terrorism, but as an act of foreign aggression \u2014 a significant difference, said Hussein Allawi, a national security analyst at Al Nahrain University in Iraq.\u201cThe Iranian authorities denied that a terrorist organization did the operation,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead it accused states in the Middle East of carrying out the operation, even though signs of terrorism in the operation were clear.\u201dDespite the bellicose language from the supreme leader and the Revolutionary Guards in Iran, other officials seemed to adopt a more cautious reaction, at least initially.Speaking at the funeral for the Ahvaz victims on Monday, the deputy commander of Iran\u2019s regular army, Brig. Gen. Nozar Nemati, said it was too early to say whether Western intelligence agencies had been involved in the attack, and suggested it may have originated closer to home.Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, Falih Hassan from Baghdad, and Rukmini Callimachi from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Burden of Proof for Kavanaugh", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf he\u2019s asked to prove a negative, he has to be given room to try.Opinion ColumnistEven if Kavanaugh is innocent of the charge of a teenage sexual assault, I argued, to give such prominence and power to a man credibly accused would both leave an unnecessary taint on his future rulings (especially given his appointment by our Playboy president) and alienate social conservatives from the persuadable Americans, women especially, whose support any pro-life program ultimately requires.This argument was not well-received among many of my conservative friends. So I spent the week having private arguments about whether it was really fair to ask a public servant to withdraw in a kind of tacit shame, for some greater ideological good, on the basis of a single unprovable allegation \u2014 and whether that kind of standard would inevitably lead to less-provable allegations against more probably-innocent figures down the road \u2014 and how you could expect any decent person to put themselves forward for high office in the climate such a precedent would create.These arguments would be convincing, I think, if Kavanaugh were up for a lower court appointment, or running for a Senate seat. But the sheer abnormality of the Supreme Court \u2014 lifetime tenure, philosopher-king power \u2014 makes the prospect of a reputationally-clouded justice more damaging, to the court itself and the country and the causes that the justice might advance, than would be the case with a lesser office. And so the potentially deep injustice to Kavanaugh still doesn\u2019t seem like enough of a reason to let him ascend if he cannot clear his name.But what counts as a tainting argument? This question was sharpened on Thursday night when Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a longtime player in conservative judicial politics, tweeted out the outline of a theory that Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser might be misremembering the identity of her assailant \u2014 an outline that rashly and recklessly included the name of the Georgetown Prep classmate whom Whelan suggested might be the nominee\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger, a possibility that Ford immediately denied.But if Kavanaugh is actually innocent, there are really only two alternatives: Either Ford is a brazen liar, or some scenario of clouded or mistaken memory must be true. So to treat any version of the latter defense as simple confirmation of the nominee\u2019s villainy is to close even the narrow door that Wittes (and I) would leave open for Kavanaugh\u2019s potential exculpation. If you are being asked to prove a negative, you cannot be denied the opportunity to explain what you think that negative might look like.That is the charity that Kavanaugh deserves, given the burden of proof being laid upon him. If his accuser testifies credibly and all he has to offer are vehement denials, followed by a rushed Republican attempt at confirmation, then he may be innocent but his nomination will deserve to fail. But an obligation not to elevate a clouded nominee must coexist with an obligation to hear out any serious alternative explanation of the facts.Whelan\u2019s folly shows how not to offer such an explanation. But if Kavanaugh has one, or if some other silent person has one, the obligation to offer it remains.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How the Next Downturn Will Surprise Us", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn their campaign to contain the risks that caused the Great Recession, central bankers may have planted the seeds for the next global economic crisis.Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer. After the fall of Lehman Brothers 10 years ago, there was a public debate about how the leading American banks had grown \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d But that debate overlooked the larger story, about how the global markets where stocks, bonds and other financial assets are traded had grown worrisomely large. Today the markets are even larger, having grown to 360 percent of global G.D.P., a record high. And financial authorities \u2014 trained to focus more on how markets respond to economic risk than on the risks that markets pose to the economy \u2014 have been inadvertently fueling this new threat. Central bankers and other regulators have largely succeeded in containing the practice that caused disaster in 2008: risky mortgage lending by big banks. But with so much easy money sloshing around in global markets, new threats were bound to emerge \u2014 in places the regulators aren\u2019t watching as closely.Within the $290 trillion global financial markets, there are hundreds of new risks, pools of potentially troubled debt. Among the most troubling: corporate borrowers and so-called non-bank lenders all over the world.As bank lending dried up, more and more companies began raising money by selling bonds, and many of those bonds are now held by these non-bank lenders \u2014 mainly money managers such as bond funds, pension funds or insurance companies.Among corporations listed on the S.&P. 500 index, debt has tripled since 2010 to one and a half times annual earnings \u2014 near the historic peaks reached during the recessions of the early 1990s and 2000s. And in some parts of the bond markets, debt loads are much higher.One of the big corporate risks is developing largely beyond regulatory oversight. Some United States companies that were publicly traded in 2008 have since gone private, often precisely in order to avoid intensified scrutiny from regulators. Many of those companies were purchased by private equity firms, in deals that leave the companies saddled with huge debts. Right now the typical American company owned by a private equity firm has debt six times higher than its annual earnings \u2014 or twice the level that a public ratings agency would consider high-risk or \u201cjunk.\u201dAt a time when central banks are holding interest rates at record lows, the return from holding plain vanilla corporate bonds is negligible, so investors are more willing to buy junk, for the higher yields. And this hunt for higher returns has been playing out worldwide as asset managers chase higher returns anywhere they can be found, whether in United States private equity or in the bond markets of Europe and emerging economies like Argentina and Turkey.The biggest risks outside the United States are in China, which has printed by far the most money and issued by far the most debt of any country since 2008, and where regulators have had less success reining in borrowers and lenders. Easy money has fueled bubbles in everything from stocks and bonds to property in China, and it\u2019s hard to see how or when these bubbles might set off a major crisis in an opaque market where most of the borrowers and lenders are backed by the state. But if and when Beijing reaches the point where it can\u2019t print any more money, the bottom could fall out of the economy.More broadly, the trigger to watch is the United States Federal Reserve, since many other central banks in the world tend to follow the Fed\u2019s lead in setting interest rates. Over the last 50 years, every time the Fed has reined in easy money by raising interest rates, a downturn in the markets or the economy has followed eventually. It may take a while, but trouble almost inevitably does come.Many doomsayers worried that the Fed tightening that began in 2004 would help prompt a recession \u2014 and it eventually did, in 2008. Though rates are still historically low in the United States, the Federal Reserve began to raise them more than two years ago and is expected to continue tightening them into next year.If a downturn follows, it is more likely to be a normal recession than another 100-year storm, like 2008. Most economists put the probability of such a recession hitting before the end of 2020 at less than 20 percent. But economists are more often wrong than right. Professional forecasters have missed every recession since such records were first kept in 1968, and one of the many reasons for this is \u201crecency bias\u201d: using economic forecasting models that tend to give too much weight to recent events. They see, for example, that big banks are in much better shape than in 2008, and households are less encumbered by mortgage debt, and so play down the likelihood of another recession. But they are, in effect, preparing to fight the last war.To have any chance of anticipating and preventing the next downturn, regulators must look for the threats that have emerged since 2008. They need to recognize that the markets now play an outsized role in the economy, and their attempts to micromanage this vast sea of money have only pushed the risks away from big American banks and toward new lenders outside the banking system, particularly in the United States and China.Markets have grown so large in part because every time they stumbled, central bankers rescued them with easy money. When markets rose sharply \u2014 as they have in recent years \u2014 the authorities stood by, saying they are not in the business of popping bubbles. Now, the markets are so large it is hard to see how policymakers can lower the risks they pose without precipitating a sharp decline that is bound to damage the economy. It\u2019s a familiar problem: Like the big banks in 2008, the global markets have grown \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Both authors are national security experts who served under President Barack Obama. We welcome those moves.

The administration\u2019s willingness to begin direct talks should underscore to the Taliban that the United States believes talks are the only way to achieve its stated goal \u2014 stabilizing Afghanistan to prevent it from reverting to a safe haven from which terrorists could strike America and its allies. Some critics, including Afghan officials, worry that direct Taliban-American talks would legitimize the insurgents and undercut Afghanistan\u2019s elected government. To the contrary, direct talks with America could test whether the Taliban want a future in Afghanistan\u2019s civil politics, rather than continuing their insurgency with links to Pakistan\u2019s intelligence service. By revealing the Taliban\u2019s real intentions in this way, such two-party talks might open the door to talks among Afghan parties. The critics also question whether any Taliban partner could deliver an agreement that would bind that large, diverse movement. Does the Taliban\u2019s political office in Doha, Qatar, represent the movement\u2019s senior leaders? This should be a priority issue in exploratory talks. Our own experience suggests that the Doha office is the most accessible connection to the Taliban\u2019s leaders \u2014 able to deliver decisions from the Taliban\u2019s topmost governing body and to enforce its agreements.Other critics worry that the Taliban won\u2019t engage in serious dialogue with the United States until they are defeated militarily.  It is also clear that the emergence of the Islamic State in Afghanistan threatens both the Afghan government and the Taliban, giving them a common enemy. Some disaffected Taliban fighters have joined the Islamic State, and the Taliban\u2019s leaders know that the unstable situation in Afghanistan could well deteriorate further \u2014 another plausible incentive for a dialogue about the country\u2019s future. Next month, Afghanistan will hold parliamentary elections, and in April President Ashraf Ghani will be up for re-election. He has boldly made peace his primary goal, having declared his willingness to talk with the Taliban \u201canywhere\u201d and having delivered with the Taliban an extraordinary cease-fire at the conclusion of Ramadan last month. Direct talks, closely coordinated with the Ghani administration, would test the potential for a political solution and support President Ghani\u2019s commitment to peace. America\u2019s direct role in talks with the Taliban, which is composed largely of ethnic Pashtuns, could also reassure non-Pashtun Afghan parties that their interests will be protected in negotiations. Direct American-Taliban talks are not a panacea. They can only set the stage for Afghan government talks with the insurgents, in which Afghanistan\u2019s future can be decided among Afghans. And even those talks alone will not deliver stability. In the end, a broader diplomatic effort will have to account for Pakistan, Iran, Russia, China, India and the Gulf States, all of which have interests in the outcome. Such a political process will be neither quick nor simple. But direct American-Taliban talks are a fine place to start. America, after all, has led the international effort in Afghanistan since just after Sept. 11, 2001. We have decimated Al Qaeda, the terrorist group that attacked us, and for 17 years we have devoted resources to stabilizing Afghanistan to ensure it will not revert to being a terrorists\u2019 sanctuary. After this sustained international effort, we agree with many experts that the moment is ripe to pursue a durable political solution as the capstone to this long campaign. Now, as in 2001, American leadership is required. We should talk directly to the Taliban to open the door to a political outcome in Afghanistan that secures our national interests.Advertisement"}

I could imitate a cop or sheriff better than anyone else.\u201d\u201cSomebody showed me Walker Evans and I swear to God, I froze up and had sweats,\u201d he said. \u201cI could not believe what I was looking at. In a lot of the pictures of the Deep South, the people are seen in a way that was really very respectful, very thoughtful and very straightforward.\u201dAfter a stint as a staff photographer for the activist organization Students for a Democratic Society, Mr. Gorton returned to Mississippi in 1968 to embark on a project photographing his fellow white Southerners. He worked with Jeff Shero, a writer who was also from the South, attempting to emulate the work of Mr. Evans and James Agee in their book \u201cLet Us Now Praise Famous Men.\u201d\u201cI set out to photograph the white South because that\u2019s what I knew and was a part of,\u201d he said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t being examined in a way that made sense to me.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a matter of racism, but it was a matter of class, which is always the grizzly bear in the room,\u201d he said. \u201cI was interested in caste and class. The upper classes, they don\u2019t have that much trouble dealing with change. But working classes and middle classes are always on the edge during these huge transitions.\u201dBecause of his background and connections in Mississippi, Mr. Gorton was able to gain intimate access to situations that would have been difficult for a Northern photographer to enter.Mr. Gorton battled violent, systemic racism and segregation at the University of Mississippi and during his time with S.N.C.C. He was not alone. There were always some white Southerners who challenged the Jim Crow system from within.\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to me that 50 years later, that the enormous sacrifices, the enormous bravery and the enormous courage of ordinary white people in the Deep South in dealing with race issues is not recognized,\u201d he said.Mr. Gorton\u2019s archive of images taken in 1969 have sat unexamined for 50 years.

The Supreme Court ordered the immediate integration of schools in the South, the Vietnam War raged and Neil Armstrong walked on the moon.Back then, he saw deepening class divisions between well-off planters and poor and working-class whites. The plantation culture was collapsing, partly because of mechanization and foreign trade.Today, he sees parallels: Robots and artificial intelligence are eliminating jobs, there is growing economic inequality, and racism has become alarmingly common in public discourse.\u201cThe photos resonate today because all the verities are being disassembled, as are the support systems, and there\u2019s violence and a resurgence of racism,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a tinderbox.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Agreeing Democracy is Under Strain, Participants at Athens Forum See Reasons to be Optimistic About its Survival", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byExcerpts From the ForumAt the Athens Democracy Forum last week, a conference convened by The New York Times in Athens from Sept. 16 to 18, international leaders and policymakers debated a wide range of issues affecting the political health of the globe. Here are excerpts from the discussions. They have been edited and condensed.When we build social media the kind of platforms that we and others build, what they essentially do is dramatically lower the cost of entry for anybody who wants to become media. And so anybody sitting in the audience today with a smartphone could decide that they are now the TV station \u201cAthens Today\u201d and they can go out and they can film stuff and broadcast it live to the world over our server, essentially at no cost to themselves, to a global audience. People have used that lower barrier to entry to create some amazing things. And if we think back over the last few years, there were moments like the Arab Spring when I think a lot of people were celebrating the political convening power of technologies like ours. They brought people together to assert themselves against repressive regimes. We\u2019re now seeing the other side of it, which is people who, I guess, people in this room would feel much more concerned about using exactly the same technology, using the low barrier of entry to come at us. The question now is how do we deal with that? We think it\u2019s a combination of ourselves and governments.What we\u2019ve seen in the last year is concerns about different elections, different countries in the world, with a common thread, which is how relatively easy it is for an organization or, indeed, even a Russian agency, to gain social media to manipulate what people see, and to promote their favorite content, and try and influence the outcome of the elections as a consequence of that. And what we should be looking at in terms of protecting our democracy against that sort of attack is a combination of things. It\u2019s about the transparency of the information that users see. I think it\u2019s about the responsibility of the companies to monitor what\u2019s going on their platform.Sri Lanka has a high literacy rate \u2014 90 percent. But when it comes to media literacy we don\u2019t think critically. When somebody sends us something on WhatsApp, for instance, we\u2019ll often, especially if it\u2019s from a friend, we\u2019ll often forward it on. So how do we get people to stop and think before blindly sharing things? I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve also been trying to do \u2014 we\u2019ve been trying to put infographics on photo and video verification, for example, and trying to push people to think more critically. And when it comes to the role of platforms like Facebook, I guess people in the audience might know that Facebook actually announced they\u2019ve ruled out this misinformation policy for Sri Lanka. So we\u2019ve been in communication with them. We\u2019ve been learning more about the community standards and things like that. So this misinformation policy for Sri Lanka is kind of different to what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world. It basically says that content will be proactively removed if it can be shown to result in real-world harm. Now this is a really progressive policy and a great step. But having said that, given how fast fake news can spread \u2014 you know, for example, it\u2019s sometimes a matter of a couple of hours when things spread on Facebook and WhatsApp. And sometimes even faster. So how effective the new policy that\u2019s going to be in place is, is an open question. But having said that, we think that this policy is really going to be useful and progressive. It\u2019s still a little early to say how successful it will be, but we think it\u2019ll help.One thing has always remained the same \u2014 this is the human soul and heart. The personal journeys of each and every one of us are different, but we do share the same human inclination: When we face somebody in need, we want to help. This is one of the informal norms on which democracies are built. Because apart from laws and institutions, that are of course the foundation of democratic governance, what holds democracies together are also these informal norms, human acts that we all know are right. It is upon these common values of social solidarity, of standing by each other, of helping those in need, that we should try and rebuild our society.I\u2019m seeing an interesting tension between business and social movements, and I do believe that there is a tangible bridge that one can build between the two. I think the core is exclusion or inclusion. If you\u2019re able to say which part of that spectrum you want to be part of, then you are part of the problem or part of the solution. Exclusion caused the Arab Spring, caused Brexit, caused all sorts of populist movements that we\u2019re seeing everywhere. I think if we\u2019re able to have businesses take that first step, if businesses are able to come forward and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s the solution that I can be part of the solution? What do I need to do? Can we use these goals \u2014 zero poverty, zero net carbon emissions, zero unemployment, zero inequality \u2014 and put them into business objectives?\u201d That will make businesses really meaningful and inclusive.We are a company, so obviously we do have to make a profit. But the objective is to make a fair profit, to manufacture without harming mankind. Also, some portion of the profit should be earmarked to protect and safeguard the world. I want to try and act as a temporary guardian of these places. This is the great dream. In our business we are trying to set up not globalization, but rather the universalism of man. We want to have respect for religions, for different cultures, for places. Pericles held a very important, fascinating speech in 400 B.C., where he said, \u201cThat\u2019s the way we do things here in Athens.\u201d And then he made a list of all the things that they do in Athens. And the very last sentence is, \u201cOur city is open to the world, and we never kick out anybody.\u201d We really need to be so brave as to be open to the world. We are a company \u2014 we have to make a profit, but without harming mankind in the process. This is what really matters.I was elected to the Tunisian Confederation for Business. When I was elected, I called the general secretary of the union. I said to him: \u201cWe have to be together. We have to dialogue. We have to sit together. And we have to find solutions to all our conflicts.\u201d We had this idea of a road map, a solution for Tunisia \u2014 how we can finish the constitution, how we can have democratic elections and how we can also have answers for young people. When they took to the streets in 2011 they asked for democracy, they asked for dignity and they asked for jobs. I think we have this feeling that we have to do something for our country. We didn\u2019t do everything for our country, but I think we launched a challenge, how we can achieve democracy with dialogue.Authoritarians are working to refashion the internet from technology that promotes freedom to a tool of oppression. This is being done through the use of disinformation, internet shutdowns, arrests and the blocking of political information.A growing number of countries are manipulating content to impact elections. In most cases, it\u2019s actually governments that are trying to maintain power, or political parties that want to come into power. In order to deal with fake news and disinformation, countries are trying to legislate solutions. But these types of laws are deeply problematic. In all of these instances, the authorities are saying that they are trying to combat gossip and fake news. This becomes a problem in environments where criticism of the government is considered fake news.More and more governments are shutting down the internet completely in times of crisis, whether that be during elections or during political protests. China is building infrastructure in its neighborhood and in different African and Eurasian countries that could expose internet traffic to greater monitoring by the Chinese authorities.I still see the internet as holding an unprecedented liberating power. We\u2019ve seen it in Russia, where activists have been using YouTube to expose human rights abuses. We\u2019ve seen it in the right-to-drive movement in Saudi Arabia. We need to work together to combat emerging challenges to internet freedom.I\u2019m going to begin by saying something very shocking to some of you. I actually believe that liberal democracy is a very good thing, contrary to what some of you may think. At the same time it\u2019s very clear it\u2019s facing some challenges.But I do believe that if you look at the longer history of humanity, the directions are still very clear. Whenever societies develop a strong middle class, the middle class wants to be represented, and the best way to represent the middle class is through a liberal democratic regime. Now, it doesn\u2019t mean the history is going to go in one simple direction. If you ask me if I\u2019m optimistic that by the end of this century we\u2019ll have a world which is thriving with democracy, I say, yes, I\u2019m optimistic. But I\u2019m also going to tell you about the challenges we will face on the way.I think the problem that we are facing with liberal democracies is a result not of what we call the illiberal, but the failure of the liberal to understand the three big structural changes that have happened in the world. The full structural challenge is that we are coming to what I call the end of an artificial 200-year period of Western domination of world history. And liberalism travels on the power of its ideas, but it also travels on the back of the economic, military and political power that the West had. Now Western power is receding. So you now have got to market liberal democracy in a different way.That\u2019s structural challenge number one.Structural challenge number two: When I grew up in the poorest society in Singapore as a child in the 1960s, liberal democracies looked like Gardens of Eden. And when I was 13 years old, you had John F. Kennedy as president. And you can imagine what a source of inspiration he was. Now, today you\u2019ve gone from John F. Kennedy to Donald Trump. And you expect us to believe that liberal democracy is still as attractive as ever. So clearly you have to address this challenge, too.And third \u2014 and this is a somewhat provocative point I want to make here \u2014 the difficulties that liberals have in trying to understand the world of today and with the end of Western domination, is that liberals like to live in what I call a \u201cliberal bubble\u201d and talk to other liberals, and have a somewhat intolerance for non-liberal voices.Can you imagine a dialogue today based on mutual respect, let\u2019s say between a representative of the United States and a representative of China, without a representative of the United States condemning China for saying, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have our form of government now?\u201dIf a British utilitarian philosopher from the 18th century was alive today, and you asked him to name the one society that has delivered the greatest improvement of human happiness in the last 30 years, it\u2019s China.So how do you bring China into the conversation if you want to talk about the world of tomorrow? That\u2019s the problem. So the liberals have got to come out of their bubble and deal with other voices on this planet.Democracy, as you know, is when the representatives are chosen through free elections, and kept under watch by \u2014 as the president of Greece explained \u2014 by strong checks and balances, the independence of the judiciary able to protect basic human rights, like free speech, parliament, also freedom of the press, academic freedom and so on. So that\u2019s the system. And today the majority of human beings are under democratic regimes that may be very different from each other\u2019s, some more effective than others.But we had an improvement of democracy around the world, with some setbacks recently that we need to speak about.So why it\u2019s good in a nutshell, as Churchill said, is that \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.\u201dSo we need to keep this quote in mind in order to make sure that people don\u2019t have romantic hopes about democracy. It will not deliver everything, but it will do better than the other systems. So the main advantage of democracy to me, it is protecting people against two insecurities \u2014 two sources of violence: anarchy and tyranny, chaos and despotism. So if you want to be protected by both, choose a democratic system.If you look at the president of my adopted country, the United States, you may have noticed that he doesn\u2019t appear to be, let\u2019s say, overly fond of Muslims. When you look at another populist, Recep Erdogan, the president of Turkey, you might\u2019ve noticed that he doesn\u2019t appear to be overly fond of anybody who\u2019s not a Muslim.There are some populists who are very right-wing on the economy, who want to slash the welfare state and who like to serve big corporations. There are others who are very left-wing on the economy, people like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his handpicked successor, Nicolas M\u00e1duro, in Venezuela, who want to bolster the welfare state, but who rail against big corporations. They don\u2019t have that in common either.So does it make sense to speak of populists as a unitary item? I think it does. Because what they do have in common is a conception of politics in which they say the only real reason that we have problems today is because the political elite is corrupt and self-serving, and they need to be thrown out of office. But since you don\u2019t want to admit that you\u2019ve overpromised, you start to blame. You start to blame everything that goes wrong on the media, which are apparently fake news and need to be cowed and regulated. You start to blame it on the opposition, who supposedly are traitors. You start to blame it on independent institutions like law enforcement agencies or the courts, who supposedly are enemies of the people.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Debunking 5 (More) Viral Rumors About Kavanaugh\u2019s Accusers", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast week, after Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault, a torrent of false and misleading allegations about Dr. Blasey surfaced online, many of them originating on social media. Here are five of the most widely spread false and misleading allegations, along with explanations of how they went viral.This week, two distinct \u2014 but equally false \u2014 rumors spread about links between Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s accusers and George Soros, the liberal billionaire and Democratic megadonor. (Mr. Soros makes frequent appearances in internet conspiracy theories.)The first claim was that Ms. Ramirez, who lives in Colorado, had received a fellowship in 2013 from the Open Society Foundations, a philanthropic organization started by Mr. Soros. The false claim began to pick up steam on conservative social media on Monday morning. John Fund, a columnist for National Review, tweeted that the \u201cirony of this is just too great.\u201d Mr. Fund subsequently apologized and issued a correction on Twitter. On Tuesday, a photograph began circulating that purported to show Dr. Blasey posing with Mr. Soros.Within hours, the mislabeled photo had been shared thousands of times. On Facebook, a page called \u201cConcerned Citizens of America\u201d shared it along with the hashtag #WWG1WGA, a signature mark of the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy. The post had received 35,000 shares as of Tuesday. Also on Facebook, videos that falsely linked Dr. Blasey and Ms. Ramirez to Mr. Soros were shared inside private right-wing groups and viewed thousands more times.On Wednesday, the gossip website TMZ posted a story claiming that Debra S. Katz, a lawyer for Dr. Blasey, was photographed with Hillary Clinton at a campaign event in August 2016. The falsely labeled photograph may have originated with a post on 8chan, a message board frequented by conspiracy theorists. According to Travis View, a researcher who studies online disinformation, the photograph appeared in a Tuesday post in /qresearch/, a QAnon discussion forum on 8chan, where it was linked to Ms. Katz. The debunked photograph continues to spread on social media. One Facebook post containing the photo has been shared 49,000 times.On Monday, Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who represents the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, who is also known as Stormy Daniels, teased that he was preparing to bring new sexual assault accusations against Judge Kavanaugh on behalf of an unnamed client.No evidence corroborating the 4chan prank rumors has emerged.One of the more elaborate misinformation campaigns against Dr. Blasey involves claims that she worked for a pharmaceutical company that made abortifacient drugs. Because of these ties, the claims say, she was financially motivated to keep Judge Kavanaugh \u2014 who abortion-rights advocates worry would reverse Roe v. Wade and end legalized abortion in the United States \u2014 off the Supreme Court.This theory unspooled on Facebook and Twitter, as well as on right-wing websites like Gateway Pundit and World News Daily. Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group, called Dr. Blasey an \u201cabortion pimp.\u201dThe claim revolves around Corcept Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical start-up where Dr. Blasey worked several years ago.Conservative activists singled out a drug made by Corcept Therapueutics \u2014 Korlym, also known as mifepristone \u2014 that the activists said was an off-label \u201cabortion pill.\u201d Mike Adams, a far-right blogger who is known for his promotion of pseudoscientific conspiracy theories, wrote on the website Natural News that \u201cBlasey is a paid researcher for an abortion pill company with a lot to lose if Kavanaugh is confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201dIn addition, there is no evidence that Dr. Blasey ever researched the drug\u2019s use in terminating pregnancies, or has anything to gain financially from court rulings on abortions.The unfounded theory about Dr. Blasey\u2019s ties to an \u201cabortion pill\u201d provider is still traveling on Facebook. Gateway Pundit\u2019s post has been shared nearly 20,000 times on Facebook, according to its website.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Transparency Hasn\u2019t Stopped Drug Companies From Corrupting Medical Research ", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe outrage over an influential doctor\u2019s hidden millions is misplaced. Dr. Angell often writes on health policy and medical ethics. Although his case is extreme, these kinds of conflicts of interest are virtually universal in the upper levels of academic medicine.In order to get prescription drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, companies must conduct clinical trials to show that the drugs are safe and effective. But drug companies don\u2019t have direct access to human subjects, so they\u2019ve always contracted with academic researchers to conduct the trials on patients in teaching hospitals and clinics. Traditionally, they gave grants to the institutions for interested researchers to test their drugs, then waited for the results and hoped that their products looked good. The grants were at arm\u2019s length; the companies didn\u2019t design or analyze the studies, they didn\u2019t own the data, and they certainly didn\u2019t write the papers or control publication.It also gave the drug companies direct access to highly influential physicians, like Dr. Baselga, known to the industry as key opinion leaders. These are the people who write textbooks and medical journal articles, issue practice guidelines, sit on the F.D.A. and other governmental advisory panels, head professional societies and speak at the innumerable meetings and dinners where clinicians are taught about prescription drugs. Having key opinion leaders on the payroll is worth every penny a drug company spends.What do they get for their money? First, there are the intangibles. It\u2019s human nature to feel warm toward people with whom one collaborates closely, particularly when they\u2019re so generous, and key opinion leaders become a sort of informal sales force.Disclosure is better than no disclosure, but it does not eliminate the conflict of interest. It\u2019s simply a way of saying caveat emptor, and leaving it to readers to decide whether the research was biased. But most people \u2014 even doctors and science reporters \u2014 aren\u2019t really equipped to make those judgments, particularly when data are suppressed.I would suggest two reforms. First, researchers at academic medical centers should not accept any payments other than research support from drug companies, and that support should have no strings attached \u2014 no control over the design, interpretation and publication of trial results. We should go back to arm\u2019s length grants.Second, doctors should not accept gifts from drug companies, even small ones, and they should pay for their own meetings and continuing education, as is standard in other professions. They can afford it. In the meantime, those of us who read these studies should remain skeptical about them until several different trials reach the same result.The indignation about Dr. Baselga is justified. But the fact that other physicians disclose their myriad conflicts of interest does not solve the underlying problem. Collaboration with industry can lead to important scientific contributions, but we should not let drug companies buy the hearts and minds of researchers. The cost of this is high, and not just in drug prices. It means both doctors and patients believe prescription drugs are better and safer than they really are.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former N.F.L. Cheerleaders Hope to Quicken Change by Shedding Their Anonymity", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome of their former teammates publicly called them liars and traitors and attention-seekers who disrespected every woman who had ever worn the Washington Redskins cheerleading uniform.Now, however, two of the women are coming forward to denounce attempts to discredit them and to speak on the record about their experiences and their frustrations at what they consider the slow pace of change to protect N.F.L. cheerleaders from degrading treatment.Their names are Rebecca Cummings and Allison Cassidy, and they said they agreed to be named now to bolster the credibility of their allegations and to inspire other women to speak out about workplace harassment.\u201cOur main goal was for the Redskins to make a safe working environment for the cheerleaders,\u201d Ms. Cummings said. \u201cBut even after we laid out all the shady situations we were forced to be in, the team failed to really fix things.\u201dThe Redskins conducted a three-month investigation into their cheerleading program after The Times report described some of the most egregious behavior toward cheerleaders, which included accounts of uncomfortable events and interactions with well-heeled supporters of the team and a 2013 calendar shoot in Costa Rica. On that trip, the five women said, male sponsors invited to the photo sessions ogled scantily clad, and sometimes topless, cheerleaders and the squad\u2019s director sent cheerleaders to entertain the men at a nightclub.Although the resort trip did not involve any expectations of sex with the sponsors, and none of the cheerleaders have claimed that they were physically harmed, the women described feeling unsafe and harassed by team managers and the sponsors.The Redskins\u2019 internal inquiry determined that \u201call aspects\u201d of The Times article were accurate, but that what the women described was \u201cgreatly exaggerated.\u201d The team insisted that no cheerleader was forced to do anything against her will, said Maury Lane, a team spokesman. Still, it led the Redskins to make changes this season intended to improve the safety of cheerleaders and to portray the team as more family-friendly.Those changes include new uniforms, which show slightly less skin, for a group of cheerleaders who mingle with fans but do not perform on the sidelines. An elite group of supporters and suite owners this year were not invited to a team calendar shoot, in Mexico, and two female police officers accompanied the team to provide security. The cheerleaders also will no longer be assigned to private events.Ms. Cummings, 31, and Ms. Cassidy, 29, said those changes, while welcome, fell short of their expectations of broader moves to eliminate the culture of harassment, such as the removal of the program\u2019s leadership that intimidated cheerleaders into silence.Although a Redskins executive who oversaw the cheerleading program resigned after the Times article was published, the team director, Stephanie Jojokian, who the women said had orchestrated the events where harassment occurred, is still with the team. The Redskins said she was unavailable for comment, but in the past she has denied putting any cheerleader in harm\u2019s way.Both women said they were surprised Ms. Jojokian has kept her job.Across the N.F.L. several teams have made adjustments to their programs after the reports about the Redskins, and allegations of improprieties within other teams, came to light. A handful of lawsuits and legal complaints have been filed against at least four teams this year, claiming harassment, unfair wages and unequal treatment.The league\u2019s front office has sought to keep the turmoil at an arm\u2019s distance, saying the cheerleader programs operate independent of the N.F.L., although several league representatives have met with Sara Blackwell, a lawyer for some of the cheerleaders, after she asked the league to make binding rules for the programs. No agreement has been reached.\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly worked with the clubs and encouraged them to review their programs,\u201d said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman.Ms. Cummings, however, said that the N.F.L. wasn\u2019t doing enough.\u201cThe changes some teams are making right now are just Band-Aids to hide the really serious issues, like better pay and a safer workplace,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the N.F.L. to basically man up, stop looking the other way and start treating women the right way.\u201dMs. Cummings, a nutrition consultant, and Ms. Cassidy, a defense contractor, began training as dancers when they were children and eventually joined the Redskins because they wanted the chance to dance professionally.They reluctantly followed the code of silence that permeates the world of professional cheerleading where many women fear ostracism or dismissal if they publicly criticize the team.After the Times article was published, one former Redskins cheerleader wrote on her own Facebook page, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to be anonymous, but trust us, we know,\u201d before calling on the women to turn in their team rings.Both women said they have lost many friends since they spoke of their experiences. They said they were sickened as they watched current and former cheerleaders on social media label the five anonymous cheerleaders as has-beens just looking to regain the spotlight while sullying the profession.\u201cYou would think I kicked someone\u2019s dog or said their mom was ugly when all I did was tell the truth,\u201d Ms. Cassidy said. \u201cWe just wanted positive changes for the future after we saw some very wrong things happening. Women in a sisterhood should support that.\u201dMs. Cassidy and Ms. Cummings said they mostly enjoyed being cheerleaders, the adrenaline rush of dancing for 80,000 or more fans at FedEx Field and visits to charities, including military hospitals where they met wounded soldiers.But the other workplace experiences, when they felt unprotected and \u201cpimped out,\u201d in Ms. Cassidy\u2019s words, have left them shaken.Ms. Cummings, who keeps her Redskins\u2019 cheerleader memorabilia on the top shelf of her kitchen pantry, next to a few cans of paint, and Ms. Cassidy said they did not previously speak out with their names because they had signed nondisclosure agreements when they were hired. They have decided to do so now because they believe highlighting the issue of the treatment of cheerleaders is worth the risk of legal action.Still, they said they did not participate in the Redskins\u2019 investigation of the program.Both women received several voice messages from Will Rawson, who, they learned subsequently, is an assistant general counsel at the Redskins. In those messages, which were reviewed by The Times, Mr. Rawson said he was calling from the Redskins and wanted to ask some questions about their time as cheerleaders.They did not call him back, they said, because they suspected that the Redskins were just trying to determine which cheerleaders might have breached the confidentiality agreement, though Mr. Lane, the spokesman, said the team was trying to talk to as many people as possible so it could conduct a thorough investigation and improve working conditions.He said the women should not fear any legal ramifications in light of the confidentiality agreement.Mr. Lane said the team interviewed 22 people involved with the program from 2011 to 2013, which overlapped with Ms. Cummings\u2019s and Ms. Cassidy\u2019s time on the team. Among those interviewed were Ms. Jojokian, the cheerleading director, and Jamilla Keene, the assistant director, and also a makeup artist, a hair stylist and photographers who worked the Costa Rica trip.Though the Redskins said they had several employees who reached out to every cheerleader on the Costa Rica trip either by phone or by email \u2014 36 attended that photo shoot \u2014 at least four cheerleaders from 2013 told The Times that they never received any queries from Mr. Rawson or anyone from the Redskins.Still, Ms. Cummings and Ms. Cassidy said they were not surprised, but are disappointed, that more women have not come forward about their treatment with the team.Ms. Jojokian was always quick to remind the team that every cheerleader was expendable, they said.\u201cIt\u2019s like the women there have been brainwashed to think it\u2019s O.K. to be treated like garbage,\u201d Ms. Cassidy said. \u201cSo many of them are afraid that pointing out injustices will lead to the program folding, or that will lead to the collapse of their social circle, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201dMs. Cummings, the mother of two young sons, said she had long regretted not coming forward and was prepared for any backlash.\u201cHaving kids, I realize that I want to look back and see that I was on the right side of it all, and stand up for myself and for other women,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not O.K. with how I was treated, and I hope I can light a fire under teams to make real changes and inspire other women to speak up, too. This is more than just a story about Redskins cheerleading.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a lawyer for several N.F.L. cheerleaders. She is Sara Blackwell, not Davis.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Age Divided by Sex", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Kavanaugh nightmare shows how the competing moralisms of conservatism and feminism are tearing us apart.Opinion ColumnistThe Year of Our Lord 1982, upon whose disputed summertime events a Supreme Court nomination now hinges, was part of the Reagan era but not a particularly conservative year.The \u201970s were officially over, but their spirit still lived on. The American divorce rate had peaked the previous year, after a steep climb across the previous two decades. The abortion rate was near its post-Roe v. Wade apex. Rape and sexual assault were much more common than today. The shadow of AIDS hadn\u2019t yet fallen on the sexual revolution, the era\u2019s teen movies offered unapologetic raunch, and real-world teenagers were more likely to drink and have premarital sex than in either the Eisenhower era or our own age of helicopter parenting.Most contemporary discourse about the social revolutions of the 1960s and \u201970s imagines a consistent \u201cleft\u201d that created those revolutions and a consistent \u201cright\u201d that opposed them. But glancing back to the debauched world of 1982 suggests a rather different take, one that clarifies what happened to American politics in the age of Bill Clinton and what\u2019s happening now in the age of Donald Trump.The irreducible core of their dispute is the question of legal abortion \u2014 whether it represents progress or regress, a necessary human right or a grave evil. But then in addition to that division, there is a more complicated contrast in their sexual ethics. Religious conservatives generally want to restore the sexual order of a more Christian past, restoring ideals of chastity and monogamy that the \u201960s and \u201970s dissolved. But feminists believe those older rules were just a means for men to subjugate women, so it\u2019s better to maintain or further sexual emancipation while imposing the most stringent moral norms around consent. Instead of fruitlessly trying to tame lust, the theory goes, we can remoralize sexual culture by taming misogyny, extirpating toxic masculinity, and re-educating men.There is enough overlap between these perspectives (the villain in \u201cMetropolitan\u201d is a predator whom feminists can hate as well) that it\u2019s possible for them to find some common ground. Indeed in the 1980s and again in the 1990s you would find moralistic feminists \u2014 of all different sorts, from Andrea Dworkin to Tipper Gore \u2014 allying with social conservatives over pornography, misogynistic song lyrics, and other cultural effluvia that violated both of their ideals.It wasn\u2019t that those feminists had ceased to believe in the principle that powerful men shouldn\u2019t prey on weaker women. It was that they felt compelled to shelve that principle, temporarily, because they feared its application by Republicans would allow conservative-Christian moralism rather than their own to dominate the culture. Now we\u2019re living through a similar period of tactical compromise with libertinism, but this time it\u2019s religious conservatives who are compromising. Fearful of secularization and feeling culturally besieged, they have thrown in with a president who embodies that old early-1980s debauch. And in the battles of the Trump era, some are embracing the idea that the #meToo moment \u2014 which, like the anti-porn battles of yore, offers potential feminist-conservative common ground \u2014 is a puritanical danger to the liberties of men. As a conservative who appreciates feminism precisely because of its puritanical streak, it\u2019s important to concede that sometimes fears of puritanism are justified. The feminists of the 1990s were deeply wrong about Bill Clinton but they were right that many of the men investigating him were fearful hypocrites. Likewise, while the #meToo movement has generally punished the guilty, some campus rape regimes have been genuinely unfair to men, and in our present derangement the reasonable concerns about Judge Kavanaugh coexist with a slightly fevered eagerness to make him a bad-guy preppy scapegoat. But my general sense is that the way for religious conservatism and feminism to correct these excesses would be to learn from the other a little bit. Obviously the stumbling block of abortion would always be there. Still, the inevitability of that battle doesn't require embracing strategic libertinism at every turn and hardening your battles lines at every front.Thus the puritanism of conservatism would be more admirable, more fully moral, if religious conservatives had a stronger appreciation for the reality of sexism, the value of female leadership, the need to seriously correct for the way ideals of chastity often punished women more than men.The puritanism of feminism, meanwhile, would be more realistic if it could acknowledge that crucial differences between men and women aren\u2019t just an artifact of sexism, and that the costs that promiscuity imposes and the unhappiness it breeds might actually be woven into the deeper natures of how both sexes love and mate and reproduce.That means that #meToo zeal will be seen by too many men (and their sympathetic wives and friends and mothers) as a means of punishing only guys for a sex-and-booze culture in which both sexes are complicit \u2026 while any Christianity-influenced sexual moralism will be seen by too many women (and their male allies and partners) as just the royal road to the Commander\u2019s bedroom in Gilead.The half-understood fear of just this scenario, I think, is part of what has made the Kavanaugh hearings even more nightmarish than the stakes for abortion law made me originally expect. Everyone, feminist and conservative and otherwise, has a different view of what they\u2019re seeing happen.But we all sense that in this political disaster, we\u2019re seeing a glimpse into a cultural abyss.Advertisement"}

I am a Russian bot in the Capitol.\u201dDozens of protesters roamed Capitol Hill on Wednesday to disrupt the second day of confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court.But Mr. Jones was on hand to cast a shadow over a different show \u2014 a pair of marquee congressional hearings scrutinizing the influence of two of the nation\u2019s largest technology companies, Facebook and Twitter.It was quite a performance, even for the incendiary Mr. Jones, whose website, Infowars, has peddled theories that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, that Hillary Clinton is a demon, and that Democrats run a global child-sex ring. He tussled with the police, wandered in and out of the hearing room, thrusting a smartphone up in the air to film the proceedings. For nearly an hour, he inveighed against Democrats and mainstream news outlets that he said were slandering him, sweating through his blue oxford shirt.When Senator Marco Rubio, the pugnacious Florida Republican, stepped out of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing to speak with reporters, Mr. Jones homed in. Mr. Rubio launched into a discussion of the risks of authoritarian governments abusing social media platforms.\u201cBut what about the Democrats purging conservatives?\u201d Mr. Jones cut in. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering. Republicans are acting like it isn\u2019t happening. Thank God Trump is.\u201dA bewildered Mr. Rubio rolled his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s weird,\u201d he said, asking aloud who Mr. Jones was \u2014 a question that appeared designed to irk Mr. Jones.Then Mr. Jones patted Mr. Rubio on the shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me again, man,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cI\u2019m asking you not to touch me.\u201dMr. Jones asked if the senator would have him arrested.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get arrested,\u201d Mr. Rubio continued. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you myself.\u201d\u201cOh, he\u2019ll beat me up. He doesn\u2019t know who I am, but he is so mad,\u201d Mr. Jones said with excitement. \u201cYou are not going to silence me. You are not going to silence America. You are literally like a little gangster thug. Rubio just threatened to silence me.\u201dThe senator walked away and the show went on.For Mr. Jones, the appearance of top Facebook and Twitter executives was personal enough to bring his trolling out of the dark corners of the internet and into the halls of the House and Senate.In early August, Facebook and YouTube banned Mr. Jones and Infowars from their platforms, drastically reducing his reach. Since then, he has led an on-air crusade against the companies, pointedly accusing them of an unfounded campaign to suppress conservative speech.\u201cI am here to face my accusers one way or another,\u201d he declared to a bank of cameras just outside a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, where Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, faced questions from senators about how to combat foreign influence campaigns on their platforms. He urged lawmakers either to block the companies from banning users or to simply break the companies up.\u201cThe real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people,\u201d Mr. Jones bellowed. \u201cThey are outright banning people and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.\u201dNeither Mr. Jones nor Infowars actually earned a mention inside the Senate\u2019s hearing room, as lawmakers debated how to combat the ability of foreign powers like Russia to influence the American political process. But later in the day, as House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee pressed Mr. Dorsey on what they called Twitter\u2019s censorship of conservative political figures and viewpoints, Mr. Jones\u2019s arguments appeared to have more resonance.Jack Posobiec, an ally of Mr. Jones, microphone in hand, repeatedly conducted interviews with Mr. Jones. He complained about being barred from testifying. Other allies were on hand, armed with rolling cellphone video, including Laura Loomer, a former member of the undercover conservative group Project Veritas, and Charles C. Johnson, a right-wing internet provocateur.Ms. Loomer made her own attempt to halt the proceedings, standing up in the House hearing room to publicly accuse Mr. Dorsey of lying about censoring conservatives.\u201cYou are censoring conservatives, and I am asking you, President Donald Trump, to help us,\u201d she shouted, bringing the hearing to a sharp halt.Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a certified auctioneer, quickly stepped in with a fast-paced patter in an attempt to drown out Ms. Loomer until the police could remove her from the hearing room.Earlier, as he waited with a large gaggle of reporters trying to intercept Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey outside the Senate hearing room, Mr. Jones sounded pleased with what he had pulled off.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun to get out of the studio,\u201d he said to his entourage. \u201cNow when they have these hearings, I am going to show up.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Laura Loomer\u2019s affiliation with Project Veritas.

{"Headline": "The iPhone XS and XS Max Review: Big Screens That Are a Delight to Use", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixApple\u2019s new smartphones start at $999 and $1,099, but their superb cameras and screens make them worth the high prices, our reviewer writes. For the past few years, I have been a naysayer on one feature of smartphones: their growing size. My position was unusual given the increasing prevalence of larger screen devices. The world\u2019s top phone makers have all added more substantial glass screens to stretch from one edge of their smartphones to another, on the theory that people can better enjoy their apps and content on an ample display.I have been troubled by this trend. These devices spend a lot of time in your pocket and your hand, and there are often compromises in portability and comfort when the screens balloon in size. For those reasons, I never liked the Plus phones, the line of iPhones that Apple introduced in 2014 with 5.5-inch screens. They felt impossible to use with one hand and far too bulky in a pocket.So it\u2019s humbling to come to you now with another confession: The iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max may be making me a convert to bigger smartphones. Last week, I began testing both new iPhone models. I had predicted that the larger display on the XS Max would be unwieldy in my pocket and make the phone cumbersome to hold with one hand while typing and reaching for buttons inside apps.There were other things I figured I would dislike. The prices of Apple\u2019s phones, for one, have shot up. The XS will start at $999 and the XS Max at $1,099 when both become available on Friday, compared with $699, $799 and $999 for new iPhones last year. The iPhone XR, which will be released on Oct. 19, is starting at $749.Yet after running the 6.5-inch XS Max alongside the 5.8-inch XS through different situations and conditions for a week, I was surprised by my reaction. Far from being disappointed by the supersized devices, I was delighted.The trade-offs of the new jumbo model felt minor. By eliminating the bezels, which are the screen\u2019s borders, Apple did a terrific job of increasing screen size without adding bulk or compromising the usability of the XS Max. I still think the smaller XS is a better fit for most people, but many would enjoy the XS Max.Here\u2019s how all the testing went down.I began by testing the iPhone XS Max because why not start with the biggest device? I moved my SIM card and all my data from an older iPhone to the new gadget and took it with me to dinner parties, bars, meetings and the gym. After three days, I was surprised by how good it felt to use the XS Max with one hand. A key factor was how Apple had managed to cram a bigger screen into a slightly smaller body. (The body of the Plus phones was 6.24 inches by 3.07 inches, while the XS Max\u2019s body is 6.2 inches by 3.05 inches.)These changes amounted to meaningful improvements in ergonomics and overall convenience. I was able to hold the XS Max in one hand and type messages easily. In contrast, my thumb could not reach keys on the sides of the older iPhone 8 Plus, like the shift key or the backspace key, because of the space taken up by the bezel.And I found the jumbo-screen XS Max particularly beneficial in several instances. While driving, it was easier to read maps. The bigger screen made writing longer emails \u2014 a task that I usually do on a laptop \u2014 more pleasant. The display was also nice for reading recipes in the kitchen.While browsing Instagram next to my partner, I said to her: \u201cIf you can use this thing with one hand, who would want the smaller phone if you only have to pay $100 more for this huge screen?\u201d\u201cBut does it fit inside your pocket?\u201d she asked.That brings me to the iPhone XS. After taking the larger XS Max everywhere with me for three days and feeling good about it, I switched to the iPhone XS \u2014 and immediately experienced a sense of relief. I found I simply preferred the XS\u2019s smaller body for the very basic task of moving around. Having the smaller phone in my pocket felt less obtrusive during dog walks, long hikes and gym sessions. I also found the XS easier to use as a camera. While the XS and XS Max share identical camera systems, which produce excellent, clear photos with natural-looking colors in normal and lowlight conditions, the smaller phone worked better in a pinch because it was easier to pull out of a pocket and quickly stabilize to take a clear shot.So where does that leave us? I concluded I no longer had any real objection to the bigger size of the iPhone XS Max, but felt that the smaller XS was still a better mobile phone because it was just as capable but more portable and pocketable. That means if you are a more casual technology user who wants a superb smartphone that is comfortable to carry, I recommend you go for the XS. If you plan to treat your phone as a primary computer, go for the XS Max.One flaw frustrated me in both iPhones: the poor design of Reachability, the software feature that was designed to make larger phone screens easier to use with one hand. On past iPhones, Reachability let people tap the home button twice to lower the top of the screen and reach for the buttons up there. Now there is no home button, so the new way to trigger Reachability is to swipe down from the bottom of the screen. That\u2019s problematic because when you swipe from the bottom, it\u2019s easy to unintentionally hit a button on the bottom of an app, like the search tab inside Instagram or the video tab inside Facebook. There is a clear opportunity here for Apple to use the iPhone\u2019s pressure sensitivity, called 3D Touch, to let you press hard on the bottom of the screen to trigger Reachability. But for now, we are stuck with swiping down.Apple said the Reachability swipe gesture was designed as a quick action to let people easily reach for the top of the screen.But I suspect it will largely come down to whether you can live with a single-lens camera, which doesn\u2019t do as good a job taking those D.S.L.R.-like photos with a blurred-out background and a sharpened foreground. The XS is about $250 more than the XR, but after shooting photos like the one below, I\u2019m sold on dual-lens cameras.It\u2019s important that you find the right fit: Since you have to pay so much for your next iPhone, you will probably live with it for a long time. And who knows? You might assume you will dislike a bigger screen and then change your mind \u2014 just as I did.Advertisement"}

This applies to his own family: Mr. Baca is Hispanic but his wife and children are members of Pojoaque Pueblo, one of New Mexico\u2019s six Tewa-speaking peoples, and they live on the pueblo\u2019s lands.During Friday\u2019s observances, Native American leaders recited prayers in the Santa Fe Plaza in the Keres and Tewa languages.

A local historian, Richard Polese, held aloft a sign proclaiming, \u201cDe Vargas Protected Pueblos\u2019 Kiva Faith\u201d and \u201cViva la Fiesta!\u201d\u201cDon Diego de Vargas offered genuine respect for Native faith practices,\u201d Mr. Polese contended.Nearby, Rachel Gir\u00f3n, who works in a dental office in California but grew up in Santa Fe, said she was pleased with the changes in the Fiesta. \u201cIf this means I can dance and sing with my Native brothers and sisters, then I\u2019m all for it,\u201d said Ms. Gir\u00f3n, 54. \u201cThe Fiesta is still as beautiful as ever.\u201dWhile the Fiesta de Santa Fe bills itself as one of the country\u2019s oldest continuous community celebrations, the pageant honoring De Vargas was neither very old nor as historically precise as some here suggest.The pageant historically focused on De Vargas, a conquistador born in Spain to an illustrious family of knights, and an imaginary Spanish queen from a family of monarchs who never set foot in colonial New Mexico. Estevan Rael-G\u00e1lvez, a former state historian of New Mexico who advised various parties here during the Entrada negotiations over the past year, described its creation as a \u201creimagining that idealized a mythic past, place and people at the expense of the actual complexity of the population and their experiences.\u201dStill, some have complained that the Entrada\u2019s cancellation is emblematic of the many ways in which Hispanics have ceded economic and political power in Santa Fe to Anglos in recent years, to the point that many families who have hewed for generations to the city\u2019s Hispanic traditions can no longer afford to live here.Joshua Rodriguez, a warehouse manager for the New Mexico Health Department, expressed similar dismay over the end of the Entrada, contending that authorities were in danger of simplifying history at the expense of Hispanics in a state where genealogy holds considerable importance to many families.\u201cThis may be an opportunity,\u201d Mr. Pecos said, \u201cfor people in New Mexico to be frank and earnest about their ancestry.\u201dAlan Webber, the mayor of Santa Fe and a progressive Democrat, said the city\u2019s approach to ending the Entrada \u201csets an example of what\u2019s possible,\u201d pointing to similar tensions around the country and unease over Trump administration policies that are viewed by many as divisive.\u201cAfter we get past this period of darkness, Americans will be thirsty for a period of reconciliation,\u201d said Mr. Webber, emphasizing that \u201cvoices were never raised and fingers were never pointed\u201d in the negotiations around the Entrada.\u201cYou start doing away with those and we just become like Phoenix, Arizona,\u201d said Mr. Barela. \u201cNo esp\u00edritu,\u201d he added. \u201cNo spirit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Conspiracy Theories Made Alex Jones Very Rich. They May Bring Him Down.", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAUSTIN \u2014 More than ever before in his two-decade career built on baseless conspiracy theories, angry nativist rants and end-of-days fearmongering, Alex Jones is being called to account.The big question for him now is whether his bluster \u2014 and the implicit support he has received from President Trump, who has channeled bogus or misleading claims promoted by Mr. Jones and echoed his complaints of anticonservatism by technology companies \u2014 will be sufficient to see him past his current peril. He is facing a legal, public opinion and social media reckoning that poses the most serious threat yet not just to his ability to inject the outlandish into the mainstream, but also to the lucrative business he has built.Mr. Jones likes to portray his digital channel, Infowars, as a media outlet, and he is quick to wrap himself in the First Amendment. But in business terms, it is more accurate to describe Infowars as an online store that uses Mr. Jones\u2019s commentary to move merchandise. Its revenue comes primarily from the sale of a grab-bag of health-enhancement and survivalist products that Mr. Jones hawks constantly.A close look at his career shows that he has been as much a canny if unconventional entrepreneur as an ideological agitator. He has adapted to \u2014 and profited from \u2014 changes in both the political climate and the media business even as he has tested, and regularly crossed, the boundaries of acceptable public discourse.For more than two decades, Mr. Jones, who is 44, has built a substantial following appealing to an angry, largely white, majority male audience that can choose simply to be entertained or to internalize his rendering of their worst fears: that the government and other big institutions are out to get them, that some form of apocalypse is frighteningly close and that they must become more virile, and better-armed, to survive.\u201cI\u2019m not a business guy, I\u2019m a revolutionary,\u201d he said in an interview in August.If it is a revolution, it is one that he has skillfully monetized. His fundamental insight was that his audience is also a nearly captive market for the variety of goods he peddles via Infowars\u2019 website and his syndicated radio show \u2014 products intended to assuage the same fears he stokes.Infowars and its affiliated companies are private and do not have to report financial results publicly. But by 2014, according to testimony Mr. Jones gave in a court case, his operations were bringing in more than $20 million a year in revenue. Records viewed by The New York Times show that most of his revenue that year came from the sale of products like supplements such as the Super Male Vitality, which purports to boost testosterone, or Brain Force Plus, which promises to \u201csupercharge\u201d cognitive functions.Court records in a divorce case show that Mr. Jones\u2019s businesses netted more than $5 million in 2014. Court proceedings show that he and his then-wife, Kelly Jones, embarked on plans to build a swimming pool complex around that time featuring a waterfall and dining cabana with a stone fireplace. Mr. Jones bought four Rolex watches in one day in 2014, and spent $40,000 on a saltwater aquarium; the couple\u2019s assets at the time included a $70,000 grand piano, $50,000 in firearms and $752,000 in silver, gold and precious metals, in a safe deposit box, court documents say.People who have worked with him or studied his business said his revenues had probably continued to grow in recent years.But his problems are mounting. At least five defamation suits against Mr. Jones, including three filed by Sandy Hook families, are moving forward. Last month, a Texas judge ordered Mr. Jones and officers in his web of limited-liability companies to provide depositions to lawyers for the parent of a Sandy Hook victim in coming weeks, testimony that could shed new light on Mr. Jones\u2019s operation.He is also facing complaints of workplace discrimination from two ex-employees, a fraud and product liability case and a nasty court battle with Ms. Jones, now his ex-wife. She says that the couple have spent a combined $4 million on their four-year battle over custody of their three children and disputes over the business.Apple had already removed Mr. Jones\u2019s show from its podcast service on Aug. 5. On Friday, an Apple spokeswoman said the app was removed under company policies that prohibit apps from including content that is \u201coffensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, or in exceptionally poor taste.\u201dMr. Jones will be forced to rely even more on his Infowars site and his radio show, which is heard on more than 100 stations nationwide.True to form, Mr. Jones is using the challenge to move more product.For several days in August, after the ban by the social media companies, his online Infowars Store offered deep discounts under an all-caps banner that read, \u201cFIGHT THE BULLIES, SAVE THE INTERNET, SAVE INFOWARS.\u201dThe best-selling Survival Shield X-2 nascent iodine drops were discounted 40 percent, to $23.95, while Alpha Power, a product marketed as boosting testosterone and vitality to \u201cpush back in the fight against the globalist agenda,\u201d was half off, at $34.95.\u201cThe enemy wants to cut off our funding to destroy us,\u201d Mr. Jones said on his broadcast, concluding a segment about being banned by the social media companies with a sales pitch for another product. \u201cIf you don\u2019t fund us, we\u2019ll be shut down.\u201dMr. Jones operates from behind bulletproof glass at an Austin industrial park, in a dimly lit hive of studios and cluttered, open-plan desks. He invited a New York Times reporter there for an interview on two conditions: that the location of his headquarters not be specified and that he would record audio of the interview.There are no identifying signs outside. Inside, there are split-screen security camera monitors throughout, which Mr. Jones checks as he passes by. There are guns in the building for protection, he said. He added that armed snipers are positioned on the roof, then in a phone call the next day said that he had made that up. He wouldn\u2019t say how many employees he has, but in 2017 court testimony he said he employed 75 people, plus 10 contractors.Mr. Jones talked for nearly three hours, bouncing around the room, raising his voice, feigning menace, replaying themes and entire riffs from his show.\u201cI am here giving you the unfiltered truth of my soul,\u201d he said.He insisted that his troubles are proof that a globalist, leftist cabal aims to silence him.He claimed advance knowledge that technology companies, Chinese communists, Democrats and the mainstream media would \u201ctry to use me as a 2018, 2020 campaign issue \u2014 to hurt Trump, to misrepresent what I\u2019ve said, to project it on Trump, and to go after the First Amendment and legitimize the censorship of all the Republican congresspeople.\u201dIt was classic Alex Jones: a nonstop mix of flimsy fact, grievance, paranoia, ideology, combativeness and solipsism.Mr. Jones often exhorts his listeners to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the hoaxes and theories he advances, pleas that may have inspired criminal acts by some of his followers.In 2000, Mr. Jones and his cameraman, Mike Hanson, infiltrated Bohemian Grove, an annual camping retreat for global business and political leaders near Monte Rio, Calif. The pair shot dim video of a pyrotechnic spectacle that Mr. Jones wrongly claimed was an \u201coccult ritual.\u201dMr. Jones for years spread the false claim that the Sandy Hook shooting was a fraud, and that the victims\u2019 relatives were actors in a hoax planned by government \u201cgun grabbers.\u201dIn 2015, after Leonard Pozner, whose son Noah died at Sandy Hook, got one of Mr. Jones\u2019s Sandy Hook hoax broadcasts removed from YouTube, Mr. Jones showed viewers Mr. Pozner\u2019s personal information, and maps to addresses associated with his family, according to court documents.On Father\u2019s Day 2017, Mr. Jones went on Infowars in a brief broadcast to offer the Sandy Hook parents \u201cmy sincere condolences\u201d for the loss of their children in \u201cthe horrible tragedy\u201d in Newtown, Conn. He said he wanted to \u201copen a dialogue\u201d with the families because it was essential for the nation to come together rather than \u201cletting the MSM misrepresent things,\u201d referring to the mainstream media.In the Times interview, Mr. Jones suggested that blame for the pain of the Sandy Hook families rests not with him but with the media and inconsistencies in coverage of the shooting.\u201cI was covering a giant phenomenon of people not believing media anymore because they\u2019ve been caught in governments\u2019 lying so much,\u201d he said.Alex Jones grew up in a conservative, upper-middle-class family in the Dallas suburb of Rockwall, the son of a dentist.There was nothing particularly unusual about him during those days, except a conspiratorial nature and, from high school on, as he put it in court testimony, a commitment to \u201cseeking out ways to get on air.\u201dWhile a community college student in Austin, Mr. Jones landed a show on Austin community access cable hawking outlandish conspiracy theories.When Kelly Jones met him in Austin in the late 1990s, Mr. Jones was wearing a bumblebee costume in the Texas heat, doing promotional stunts for a local radio station.He dropped out of community college, and with money from his father, produced \u201cdocumentary\u201d videos, starring himself, about 9/11 being an inside job, \u201cpolice state\u201d abuses and the \u201cnew world order\u201d he claimed was being engineered by the Bilderberg Group, an annual gathering of prominent financiers, economists and political leaders.He bought airtime on shortwave radio, and broadcast his theories out of an unused nursery in his house with \u201cchoo-choo\u201d train wallpaper, Ms. Jones said in an interview.To the extent that his early shows were informed by coherent political thought, he was a libertarian, suspicious of Republicans and Democrats alike; Ron Paul, the three-time presidential candidate and libertarian icon, was an occasional guest.But with the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, Mr. Jones discovered that nasty partisanship was a moneymaker.In court in 2014, he said, \u201cWe have had company meetings in the last two years preparing for the eventuality of a Republican takeover,\u201d which he considered a threat to his business, because when attacking Democrats in power, conservatives could \u201cbe more provocative, more interesting and so it gets more viewers.\u201dThe two men were connected by Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump who is a paid host on Infowars. In December 2015 Mr. Stone arranged for Mr. Trump to do a 30-minute interview with Mr. Jones.On Infowars last month, Mr. Jones suggested that he is coordinating his message with Mr. Trump.Two White House officials said they were not aware of any recent contacts between Mr. Jones and the president.Infowars operates through a series of interlocking companies, none of which publicly reports its results. But a rough picture of the operation\u2019s scale can be gleaned from the documents detailing its financial condition in 2014.One entity \u2014 created to house the supplements business \u2014 generated sales of $15.6 million and net income of $5 million from October 2013 through September 2014, according to an unaudited profit and loss statement viewed by The Times. During the same period, another entity, possibly recording overlapping revenues, listed net income of $2.9 million and sales of $14.3 million, with merchandise sales accounting for $10 million, advertising for nearly $2 million and $53,350.66 in donations, according to an unaudited company statement.Since then, current and former business associates said, the Infowars empire has continued to thrive.The heart of the business is sales of lightly regulated nutritional supplements that purport to improve health or virility or both.\u201cSupplements are popular,\u201d Mr. Jones said in the interview. \u201cThey\u2019re good. They\u2019re a fast-growing market. I use it to fund the operation. Other revolutionaries rob banks and kidnap people, O.K.? I don\u2019t do that.\u201dBy late 2012, Mr. Jones decided to create a supplement line of his own, a move that would allow him to reap more of the profits. The next summer, he recruited his father, David R. Jones, to leave his dental practice and help manage the family business, negotiating a deal for Dr. Jones to be paid what he was making previously \u2014 $300,000 to $500,000 a year \u2014 plus an additional bonus of 20 percent of the profits from the entities he created.When Dr. Jones came on board, the business was in disarray. In court testimony, he said he found a series of \u201cgreen notebooks stuck in a cabinet\u201d outlining a number of entities that had been established over the years.Dr. Jones set about evaluating the business, getting the corporate entities sorted out, and creating opportunities to expand the supplement business.Kelly Jones compared Mr. Jones\u2019s marketing to that of a televangelist, preaching to his faithful, selling cures and soliciting donations. His customers buy in \u2014 and then they buy. For every threat he raises, there is a solution for sale.\u201cControversy sells. You can\u2019t ignore the fact that there is a method there,\u201d he said.\u201cPreppers\u201d are an important market segment for Infowars, and ads on its website bring better response than on other conservative media shows, said Chad Cooper, who owns Infidel Body Armor, based in San Tan Valley, Ariz. He spent about $5,000 a month on Infowars advertising for his civilian body armor line until recently, when he suspended his advertising because Infowars started selling ads to too many of his competitors.While he does not take in Mr. Jones\u2019s show \u2014 \u201che\u2019s a nutter,\u201d he says \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time on the phone with these Alex Jones people who order from me,\u201d and described them.\u201cThey\u2019re nonbelievers in what the media tells them. They think there\u2019s more to the story,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think there\u2019s aliens, and the government knows about that and they\u2019re not telling them. They\u2019re all religious, and they\u2019re very concerned about the direction the government is going.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really good at scaring people,\u201d Mr. Cooper said of Mr. Jones. \u201cHe gives them that sense of urgency \u2014 they need to hurry up and do something. Now.\u201dLast February, two former employees came forward with allegations that they faced discrimination at Infowars. In interviews, they depicted Mr. Jones as the leader of a racially charged workplace.Robert A. Jacobson, 43, started working with Mr. Jones in 2004 as a video editor, and said that over the years he was taunted for being Jewish. He said that the harassment escalated after August 2015 when Mr. Jones interviewed David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard.Ashley L. Beckford, who was hired as a production assistant in June 2016, said that she was called racial slurs, paid less because of the color of her skin and forced to fend off unwanted sexual advances, including from Mr. Jones. Ms. Beckford, 32, said that an employee once called her a \u201ccoon,\u201d that she was shown swastikas in the office, that Mr. Jones once grabbed her buttocks, and that staff members repeatedly used the term \u201cfat black bitch\u201d around her.On his show, Mr. Jones denied the allegations and called both former employees liars.Mr. Jones\u2019s image and credibility as a provocateur are closely linked to his credibility as a marketer of supplements and other products.Consequently, sales of the fluoride-free toothpaste he promotes might decline if he recants his bogus claim that fluoridated water causes cancer and stunts the brains of children. Demand for Infowars-branded gun components that can be purchased without a firearms permit might fall if he backs off his predictions of a looming civil war.Mr. Jones had cited a desire to express contrition to the Sandy Hook parents as a reason for agreeing to be interviewed. But many times during the interview, his efforts at apology morphed into new theories.\u201cThe idea they\u2019re pushing is that you can\u2019t ever question anything,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u201d referring to anyone who criticizes his twisting of the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can establish that anything is 100 percent fact.\u201dJack Nicas and Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "We Need More Enemies of the People", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA forgotten slice of history about courageous African-American high school students and the journalists who covered them. Mr. Margolick is the author of \u201cElizabeth and Hazel: Two Women of Little Rock.\u201d The obituary for Jerry Dhonau in The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette last month contained all of the usual information. He was 83 years old and lived in Little Rock and Albuquerque. He\u2019d had a long career in journalism. Survivors included a wife, a daughter and a granddaughter.When a racist mob surrounded 15-year-old Elizabeth Eckford near Little Rock Central High School on the morning of Sept. 4, 1957, he and a few other journalists \u2014 armed with only their notebooks, pencils and cameras \u2014 had protected her. Yet the article omitted a crucial fact about Mr. Dhonau: To some back then, he was a card-carrying enemy of the people.Mr. Dhonau, who\u2019d graduated from the same high school only a few years earlier, had joined The Arkansas Gazette the previous January. He\u2019d been outside Central the night before, as Arkansas National Guardsmen deployed by Gov. Orval Faubus encircled the campus. And he\u2019d returned the following morning to see a solitary black girl alight from a city bus down the street from the school. With a reporter\u2019s eye and a Southerner\u2019s sensibility, he had known something was awry: The mob outside Central into which she was heading that day was every bit as white as the student body inside, and much, much angrier.He\u2019d followed Ms. Eckford, who had inadvertently been separated from the eight other black students attempting to desegregate Central that morning. He\u2019d watched her walk intently toward the school and seen the soldiers raise their rifles to block her when she had repeatedly tried to enter. He\u2019d seen the hecklers gather around her, and listened to them, and took down what they said. \u201cGo back where you came from!\u201d a woman shouted. \u201cDon\u2019t let her in our school\u201d another exclaimed, appending the usual racial epithet.For two blocks Ms. Eckford proceeded, the mob on her heels. Finally she reached the bus stop at 16th and Park Street, taking her place at the edge of an empty bench, waiting for the ride that would, she hoped, carry her to safety. \u201cA crowd of about 50, supplemented by several Central High students, pressed closely,\u201d Mr. Dhonau was to write. \u201cThe abusive shouts from the crowd continued.\u201d He\u2019d seen Benjamin Fine of The New York Times briefly sit alongside Ms. Eckford \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t let them see you cry,\u201d Mr. Fine had told her \u2014 and a white woman named Grace Lorch also try to comfort her, gestures that only further inflamed the mob.In it, Mr. Dhonau, a lanky young man in a suit, stands near the bench, writing in his notebook. He and Mr. Fine, wearing a bow tie, were hardly intimidating. Still, they were two points in the makeshift line that, for whatever reason, none of Ms. Eckford\u2019s tormentors dared cross.Afterward, Mr. Dhonau reproached himself for what he had done. \u201cThe only time I lost my objectivity,\u201d he said. Gene Foreman, another former Gazette colleague and later the editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, thinks he was being too hard on himself. \u201cHis was a passive act, as opposed to Fine\u2019s active intervention,\u201d said Mr. Foreman, author of a textbook on journalistic ethics. To some that day, Mr. Dhonau and his ilk were very much \u201cenemies of the people.\u201d Members of the mob tried toppling the telephone booths from which he and other reporters were transmitting what they had just seen to the rest of the world. That night, Mr. Dhonau received angry, anonymous phone calls. And twice the F.B.I. awakened him \u2014 not to ask him what had happened that day, but to find out whether the Times reporter had indeed egged on the crowd, as some locals had claimed.Mr. Dhonau, whose older brother had been killed in World War II, came by his wicked ways early. As co-editor of The Little Rock High School Tiger in 1952, he\u2019d written a column urging that the school\u2019s new field house be named for Riley Johns, a black man who had long tended the athletic fields. The column never ran; it would upset the principal and the school board, he was told. He promptly quit. Ernie Dumas, a longtime Gazette reporter to whom Mr. Dhonau gave an oral history in 2000, asked whether that soured him on journalism. \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Dhonau replied. \u201cIt made me more committed.\u201d The year after Little Rock blew up, Mr. Dhonau applied to the Columbia School of Journalism. While one committee there admitted him, another awarded him and his Gazette colleagues a Pulitzer Prize. Mr. Dhonau soon returned to The Gazette, where he remained, largely as an editorial writer, until it folded in 1991. And so, too, did he that day in 1957. \u201cEnemies of the people\u201d?

It arrives, by definition, suddenly \u2014 a jolt that makes us pause, stuck on a thought, unable to process it. When we recover our senses, something about us has changed \u2014 our movements are a bit shakier, our minds carry a slight disturbance.The power to leave an indelible mark may be why shock is so often used to drum up outrage. A headline screaming that something is \u201cshocking\u201d tempts us by dangling the reaction we might have, either moral or visceral. \u201cThe Scale of the Catholic Church\u2019s Criminality Still Shocks,\u201d says a recent editorial in The Washington Post. In Teen Vogue, \u201cSeparating Children From Parents Is Shocking and Inhumane \u2014 It Is Also an American Tradition.\u201d (In both headlines, the shock is perpetual: We are \u201cstill\u201d shocked, despite experience, or shocked by our own traditions.) Even in tabloids, a promise that we are about to be shocked is a promise that we will be treated to memorably salacious details, as in old Page Six stories: \u201cMost Shocking Celebrity Breakups,\u201d \u201c12 Shocking Facts About Billy Joel.\u201dDecades before Trump, in the haze of the Vietnam War, the shock was less sarcastic. The publication of shocking photographs \u2014 a man with a gun to his head, about to be unceremoniously executed; a naked preteen fleeing down a rural road \u2014 helped fuel public outcry against America\u2019s involvement. As Susan Sontag wrote in \u201cRegarding the Pain of Others\u201d (2003), photographers of the era believed their role was \u201cunmasking the conflict\u201d and showing the war\u2019s \u201creal face\u201d to the American people. Their images revealed moments with no adequate explanation, no military justification \u2014 frozen instants that forced the viewer to dwell on the moral truth of a single moment. The images ask, simply: Is war wrong? In a 1985 book called \u201cThe Body in Pain,\u201d the scholar Elaine Scarry wrote that \u201cthe visual immediacy of an injured body is itself so overwhelming that it has the capacity to \u2018surprise\u2019 and \u2018shock,\u2019 even if the observer is already acutely conscious of the fact that injuring is the central activity of war.\u201dToday the equivalent might be donating to a GoFundMe drive or admonishing your Facebook friends to call their senators. We pay our indulgences in remit for our sins, feel a brief respite from moral quandary, lean back and congratulate ourselves for doing our part. \u201cAfter all,\u201d we think, \u201cI\u2019m just one person. All we can change is ourselves.\u201dBeing harried and dazzled like this \u2014 bombarded with information we lack the time or capacity to process \u2014 we can become pliable, susceptible to groupthink, open to Faustian bargains. Collective shock can be an effective tool not just for numbing the population but for swaying public opinion or introducing policies that would normally seem unacceptable. In her 2007 book \u201cThe Shock Doctrine,\u201d Naomi Klein described how moments of \u201cgreat rupture\u201d generate \u201cvast, clean canvases\u201d \u2014 a shocked citizenry who may allow the rules of society to be rewritten. The stunned acquiescence of the American public after Sept. 11, for instance, allowed for overwhelming, bipartisan support of everything from the Patriot Act to two wars. Shock paves the way, as Berger once wrote, for \u201cimpunity.\u201dOnline, people spend huge amounts of time in a shocked stupor, trying to steer others in useful directions. People workshop one another\u2019s reactions to the news and police the reactions of their internet acquaintances, spending pent-up moral outrage slapping friends on the wrist for being insufficiently struck by some new development (men should all be more stunned by rampant harassment!) or too na\u00efve in their astonishment (how are you surprised that men are like this?). Much as with Berger\u2019s news consumer, what had the potential to be transformative moral energy can also be dispersed, turned into a moral critique not just of ourselves but of one another. Attention turns away from events and toward our own ability to react to them. The difference, online, is that we also pull at one another; everything becomes a fight to ensure that everyone else is experiencing and interpreting the shock the same way.Chief among those reactions is the expression of continued shock, a refusal to accept any stream of bad news \u2014 sexual harassment, school shootings, presidential lies \u2014 as the new normal. Generations of Americans have been taught, after all, that it was the apathy and hesitation of ordinary people that led, gradually, to the greatest horrors of the 20th century; that if only citizens had been more aggressively alarmed about what was happening around them, they might have stopped whole nations rolling slowly toward genocide.But why such a focus on expressing shock in particular \u2014 as opposed to caring, or commitment, or determination? Shock is clearly seen as somehow more extreme; it feels so visceral, a result of an unshakable sensitivity and a straining toward righteousness. Performing it is a way to combat the fear that, as Berger wrote, the things we are shocked by will come to seem like unshocking representatives of the \u201cgeneral human condition.\u201d As soon as we accept something as the human condition, we stop talking about it or holding others to account; we simply adapt, admit defeat, lower our expectations.To be shocked and to no longer be shocked are, after all, twin emotions, one leading directly to the other. Or perhaps not \u201cemotions\u201d; shock isn\u2019t actually an emotion. It\u2019s an amplification, or a performance, that masks the core reaction behind it \u2014 a reaction that might actually be more difficult to face than shock. Scrape away the hype and the hyperbole, the enervation and the exhaustion, and you find any number of more useful or wrenching impulses: kindness, hatred, antipathy, humanity, pity, awe, disgust, even ambivalence. It\u2019s in trying to be eminently moral \u2014 to calibrate our own sensitivity to shock so finely that it is beyond reproach \u2014 that we forget to act at all. Which is to say that shock might actually be the easy way out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can You Win an Election by Talking About Segregation?", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe next mayor of Chicago should find out.Ms. Moore is a journalist in Chicago.In Chicago, our mayors stay in office for a long time.For 40 years, two of them were named Daley.That Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the United States is a fact that is treated by too many here as a footnote or a quirky characteristic, like deep-dish pizza. Segregation gets ignored because it\u2019s accepted.But segregation is intentional, and dismantling it must be, too. Chicago\u2019s population is divided almost equally among African-Americans, Latinos and whites, and the geographic Balkanization allows segregation to infect neighborhoods with the graveness of a waterborne disease. Too many politicians, black and white, do not address the realities of segregation head on. It is as if speaking directly about this reality \u2014 vacant lots, boarded-up buildings and paltry economic investment in majority-black neighborhoods \u2014 will turn voters off or make even more real the reality that Chicagoans live every day.Police accountability in Chicago has received a lot of attention, and that has led to a federal investigation into brutality in the department. Policing isn\u2019t the only problem. Schools, pension payouts, a black population steadily dipping, a shrinking middle class, violence. Mr. Emanuel didn\u2019t invent any of these issues, but they have certainly come to a head after decades in the making. So a wide-open mayoral field also means that perhaps candidates will actually talk about segregation. Race-neutral policies rooted only in class won\u2019t work. Job creation downtown doesn\u2019t help black neighborhoods with high unemployment. Affordable housing is scarce in affluent white neighborhoods.It sounds so simple to ask an elected official to talk in a direct way about segregation. But it\u2019s actually bold, because we don\u2019t hear such talk.Chicago is a great, quintessential American city, despite the singular narrative we\u2019ve all heard and bristled at. We\u2019re more than gunshots in the headlines. It can be disorienting, and frustrating, to see the president tweet about our city. \u201cIf Chicago doesn\u2019t fix the horrible \u2018carnage\u2019 going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds!\u201d he wrote last year. I can read that and then go to the Englewood neighborhood and see a block club president pick vegetables from a vacant lot she bought and transformed into an oasis. I don\u2019t live in a war zone, despite what President Trump thinks. In between the reign of the Daleys, Harold Washington occupied City Hall as Chicago\u2019s first black mayor. He died in office in 1987, during his second term, while fulfilling his promises of creating opportunities for all races and giving community members a seat at the table. His elections marked the last time an interracial coalition was forged to change who runs this city. I don\u2019t want to dwell in nostalgia, but I do think that could happen again. It depends on how honest we\u2019re willing to be with each other first.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.The administration bears unique responsibility for these violations, in no small part because its disastrous and short-lived separation policy has wreaked havoc on a system that was already rife with problems. Shame alone should have federal officials working hard to undo the damage of that policy and to prevent further harm to the children under their charge, never mind that it\u2019s the right thing to do under any number of international agreements and norms.After that period, the issue is almost certainly headed to court. Observers say the same judge who has ruled against past attempts to undermine Flores is likely to thwart this attempt as well. Which paints a stark reality for what\u2019s motivating this move and what it ultimately means: The administration surely knows what a long shot this proposal is, but it will undoubtedly excite President Trump\u2019s political base as the midterm elections approach. So while the administration plays politics, the well-being of thousands of children who came to America seeking protection and safety will be put at risk \u2014\u00a0today and, developmentally, for the rest of their lives.

{"Headline": "Trump Can\u2019t Help Obstructing Justice. Who Will Stop Him? ", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president abuses his office and views the Justice Department as a tool to punish his political enemies and give his allies a free pass. Mr. Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor. It wasn\u2019t always this way \u2014 even a little over a year ago. Remember, Robert Mueller, the special counsel, was appointed just last May in the wake of significant critical public reaction to his firing of James Comey, the F.B.I. director, who reportedly offered no assurances about curtailing the Russia investigation generally or specifically taking it easy on Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser.Since then, Mr. Trump has increasingly obstructed the special counsel\u2019s investigation in plain view, in the process politicizing both the Justice Department and F.B.I. It is no longer news when the president \u2014 the head of the executive branch \u2014\u00a0maligns the F.B.I., calls on the Justice Department to investigate his political enemies or teases pardons to try to influence potential witnesses against him.There can be little doubt that Mr. Trump views the Justice Department as a tool to punish his political enemies and give his allies a free pass. He has also made it clear that he hates \u201crats,\u201d praising the felon, Paul Manafort, who once ran his campaign for refusing to \u201cbreak\u201d by cooperating with law enforcement.It is hard to imagine 19 Republican Senators voting to convict Mr. Trump for obstructing justice. In itself, that does not mean his presidency will survive until 2020 (or beyond), given the array of legal problems he now faces. After all, just two weeks ago, his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, told a judge under oath that Mr. Trump directed him to commit crimes. But obstruction appears to be the first existential challenge to the Trump presidency if reports that Mr. Mueller is preparing a report regarding obstruction are accurate.On the surface, the Senate\u2019s refusal to remove the president from office for obstructing justice does nothing to counteract the other legal problems that he faces, such as the investigation of Mr. Cohen that resulted in immunity for Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization\u2019s chief financial officer. Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and threats to impede the Mueller investigation, warnings from his team that his acts could create liability for him seem at times to have restrained the president. For example, Mr. Trump reportedly did not carry out his plans to fire Mr. Mueller in the face of pushback from Don McGahn, the White House counsel. More recently, the president did fire Mr. McGahn 11 days after reports emerged that the White House counsel had cooperated with Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation. But the president followed up \u2014\u00a0presumably because of warnings from Mr. Trump\u2019s attorneys \u2014\u00a0with corrective tweets claiming that the firing was not punishment for Mr. McGahn\u2019s cooperation.If the United States Senate refuses to convict the president for obstructing justice, Mr. Trump could ignore those warnings going forward. He could pardon his friends and replace Mr. Sessions with an attorney general who would close down investigations of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies, fire Mr. Mueller and initiate investigations of the president\u2019s political enemies. If this sounds alarmist, remember that the president has publicly indicated that he would like all of these things to happen. Furthermore, if Mr. Trump is given a green light to undermine the investigations, even if you set the question of impeachment aside, the American public will never know the truth about the threats to our elections and crimes that Mr. Mueller continues to investigate, among many other things.Perhaps these drastic steps would jolt Senate Republicans into action. A charitable reading of their behavior thus far is that like the proverbial frog in boiling water, they have been unable to notice or react to the gradual ramping up of Mr. Trump\u2019s obstruction. After all, for some time, many Republican senators warned the president not to interfere with the Mueller investigation.But lately, even Mr. Mueller\u2019s defenders, like Senator Lindsey Graham, have come around to accept Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to fire the attorney general, leading many to conclude that Mr. Trump\u2019s popularity with the Republican base has made party members unwilling to check his power because they fear a primary challenge. The line drawn by Republicans in the past appears to be far less defined than it once was.The stakes could not be higher. A president with the power to initiate investigations of his opponents and quash investigations of his friends could destroy the rule of law and the ability of our criminal justice system to check corruption forever. For the sake of our nation, let us hope that congressional Republicans check the president while they still can. Renato Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Manafort Folds. Now What?", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHis cooperation agreement with Robert Mueller is the start of a new chapter in the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Mr. Bookbinder is the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Mr. Berke is a co-chairman of the litigation department at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel. Mr. Eisen is the chairman of CREW. Those who practice criminal law \u2014 including the three of us \u2014 have long predicted that Paul Manafort, the disgraced former Trump campaign chairman, would eventually fold to Robert Mueller, the special counsel. On Friday, we were proven right: Mr. Manafort and the special counsel have reached an extensive cooperation agreement, among the most significant developments in Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation to date. The capitulation came in spectacular fashion: According to prosecutors, Mr. Manafort has already participated in a so-called proffer session, in which he described information that investigators deemed valuable. Mr. Manafort\u2019s agreement will also require him to give further interviews without the presence of his own counsel, turn over documents and testify in other proceedings. His surrender is complete. We will soon see what it means for the president.Mr. Manafort\u2019s cooperation obviously represents an enormous pivot from the previous strategies he had seemed to be pursuing \u2014 trying to persuade a jury to ignore the strong evidence against him based on personal sympathies or, if that failed, to obtain a pardon from President Trump. In our estimation, this about-face represents a realistic judgment on his part, not to mention vindication of Mr. Mueller\u2019s strategy so far.A quick pardon was always a long shot. It would be hard for Mr. Trump to justify politically, even given his willingness to use the pardon power with seeming abandon. A pardon would not protect Mr. Manafort from the wide array of state charges that could be brought against him.Mr. Manafort now has the ability to trade all of the valuable information he has regarding the president and those close to him for a significantly reduced prison sentence. He is the first Trump campaign participant in the now-infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting to break with the president. Mysteries around that meeting abound. They include whether then-candidate Trump knew about the meeting in advance and why Mr. Trump announced after the meeting had been scheduled that he would soon be giving a major speech on \u201c the things that have taken place with the Clintons.\u201d Now that Mr. Manafort is cooperating, we may soon have answers.If all that were not bad enough news for Mr. Trump, Mr. Manafort may also be able to shed light on other episodes during his tenure at the helm of the Trump campaign. Those include the 80-plus contacts between the campaign and other associates and Russia-linked individuals; the campaign\u2019s possible collaboration with WikiLeaks; and the amendment of the Republican National Committee platform on arming Ukraine. Given Mr. Manafort\u2019s history of working with Russian oligarchs and his close ties to Roger Stone, an informal Trump adviser, Mr. Manafort was well-placed to know about any attempts by the campaign or its allies to collude with Russian operatives and others engaged in illegal election interference.Mr. Manafort may also be able to shed light on obstruction of justice by the president. If the reports of pardon negotiations between the president\u2019s personal attorneys and Mr. Manafort\u2019s lawyers are true, that raises the question of whether any of these discussions could be construed as offering a pardon in exchange for Mr. Manafort\u2019s silence. Cooperation can be like dominoes. Mr. Manafort\u2019s cooperation is not limited to actions of the president, and if he can help the special counsel bring charges against others close to Mr. Trump, they too may end up cooperating and further strengthening the case that Mr. Mueller is seeking to build.For Mr. Mueller, the plea deal and cooperation agreement represent momentum: more evidence of his continued success in bringing wrongdoers around the president to justice. It vindicates his strategy of methodically building cases against those in Mr. Trump\u2019s circle and applying pressure on them to cooperate up the chain. For the president, it is ominous. Yet another person who was in Mr. Trump\u2019s immediate orbit has fallen to the rule of law. Now that Mr. Manafort is helping the investigation and may testify in future criminal proceedings \u2014 not to mention congressional ones \u2014 Mr. Trump cannot be resting easy.But most important, for the American people, today\u2019s outcome is further proof that no one \u2014 no matter how important or powerful \u2014 is immune from justice. Mr. Trump would do well to study the heights from which his former top aide has fallen, and the depth of his plunge.Advertisement"}

And I knew that they would be taking at least a brief bath in a salty brine.Pork and fennel are often companions, and the flavor combination is exceedingly delicious. As some wise cook long ago discovered, fennel\u2019s sweet flavor and perfume pair perfectly with pork.As for the brine, immersing pork chops in it always improves their flavor and texture. More than just salt water, most brines contain a bit of sugar, as well as aromatics like allspice and bay leaves. (I added a teaspoon of crushed fennel seeds to mine.) For best results, let the chops soak for at least a few hours, preferably overnightMaking a wet brine is easy, but if you haven\u2019t the time, you can get a similar result with a dry brine, a seasoned salt mixture. Stir some crushed fennel seeds and coarsely ground black pepper into a couple of tablespoons of salt. Sprinkle both sides of the chops with the seasoned salt and leave them for at least an hour before cooking. (Alternatively, wrap and refrigerate the seasoned chops to cook the next day.)Since I craved pork, but also vegetables, I found some lovely medium-size fennel bulbs at the market. Sometimes called Florence fennel, it is often thinly sliced and eaten raw in salads, but it is delicious cooked, too. I cut it on the thick side and combined it with sliced onion, saut\u00e9ed it in olive oil, and then goosed up the flavor with fennel seed and garlic.I placed the pan-seared chops on top and popped the whole affair into the oven for about 20 minutes. So, you see, aside from the brining, it\u2019s really a simple dish to put together. The pork emerges tender, moist and flavorful, and the fennel-onion compote delightfully unctuous.Advertisement"}

Mr. Kamara accepted.\u201cI was so excited to spend an extra three days with this boy, who I had just met and felt was someone I could really be best friends with, someone who I could trust,\u201d Mr. Kamara said.Once they told each other that they were gay, the two became fast friends. \u201cWe were completely enamored with each other, but not sure where it would go.\u201d Neither had ever had an official relationship before, nor had come out to their families.After returning home to New York, they did just that. \u201cAnthony\u2019s family was fantastic, supportive, and took me in right away,\u201d Mr. Kamara said. \u201cMy family, being Russian and West African, was a different story. My mother finally came around after five years into our relationship, but my father took longer. Even though my family wasn\u2019t accepting at first, I always knew they loved me and would eventually come around. They are now very supportive of us and an integral part of our lives.\u201d The couple married in August 2008 in Montecito, Calif., before the state\u2019s voters passed Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage.Ten years later and now living in New York City, they believe that they have become an example of a healthy, good and successful relationship among their family and friends.\u201cWe\u2019ve been through family deaths together, me being diagnosed with leukemia, and life successes as well,\u201d Mr. Kamara said. \u201cBut my best friend has always been by my side. We are planning on having children in 2020 through a surrogate. We can\u2019t wait to be parents. We are still in love, and after seeing each other through it all, we give gratitude for that every day.\u201dBarbara Werner and Nick Morris have been together in a committed, loving, long-distance relationship for seven years this September. And it all started in coach class. \u201cOurs is a very strange love story,\u201d Ms. Werner said. \u201cWe were in our 40s and 50s when we met. Neither of us was looking for love or a relationship.\u201dShe was traveling on business from Anchorage to Seattle. \u201cBeing only five feet tall, I have no idea why I decided to purchase a seat with extra legroom,\u201d she said. A very tall man sat down next to her. He told he had been bear hunting.When they got off the plane, Mr. Morris didn\u2019t ask for her name or her phone number. She assumed he wasn\u2019t interested.About a week later, Ms. Werner received a card in the mail. It read, \u201cIf this is the right Barbara from the flight from Anchorage to Seattle: Hi. This is Nick and I sat down next to you on the plane.\u201dMs. Werner, who lives in Stamford, Conn., and Mr. Morris, who lives in Joppa, Md., became serious very quickly, but she had to work in New York, a city that made Mr. Morris uncomfortable. The thought of either of them relocating was a non-starter.\u201cI thought the relationship was over,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after three months of not seeing each other, he sent me a huge bouquet of flowers with a note that read, \u2018If this is all you can give \u2014 texting every morning, speaking with each other every night, going on two weeklong yearly vacations, and spending around six weekends together \u2014 I\u2019ll take it.\u2019 He said he would rather have me in his life long-distance then not have me in his life at all.\u201d\u201cI thank God and United Airlines for the start of an amazing relationship,\u201d Ms. Werner said. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t gotten on that flight and paid for extra legroom, if he hadn\u2019t traded seats with his brother, we would never have met.\u201dIt was July 2005 when Michele Natola, 18, was on a cruise from Boston to Bermuda with her best friends after their high school graduation. Steve O\u2019Connell, 18, was also aboard.The two met the first night on the dance floor. \u201cHe was a dancing machine, going a mile a minute,\u201d said Ms. Natola. \u201cWearing shorts, tube socks up to his knees, sandals and a fedora, my first impression was that he was crazy and I was not interested. I pulled my friend Amanda over to \u2018save me.\u2019\u201d\u201cDespite my initial reaction, every night on the dance floor I would gravitate toward him,\u201d she continued. After some conversations, she discovered that \u201che had spent most of his childhood summers at a campground that was only two minutes away from where her family lived in Plymouth. We had been less than a mile from each other every summer for the past 10 years.\u201dShe gave him her number on the final night of the cruise. \u201cAt that point, I realized that I wouldn\u2019t mind getting to know this crazy guy once we were off the boat \u2014 it was worth a try,\u201d she said.A week later he called. \u201cWe met a few times over the summer and it was like we were still on the ship,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had a blast whenever we were together.\u201d Ms. Natola moved to Boston that September; she had been accepted at Suffolk University before meeting Mr. O\u2019Connell, who lived in Boston. They continued dating through her college career at Suffolk.In March 2014, on another cruise, Mr. O\u2019Connell proposed. They were married in September 2015 after 10 years of dating.The couple, who still live in Boston, welcomed their first child, a boy, on Aug. 9.Advertisement"}

That answer must await a post-mortem by climate scientists. But it is also true that rapid coastal development is amplifying the impact of hurricanes and other extreme weather.In fact, according to research by my colleagues and I, the root cause of the country\u2019s escalating number of weather- and climate-related disasters is not necessarily a rise in the frequency or intensity of these events but the increasing exposure and vulnerability of populations in their path.That may seem obvious, though perhaps not for the people who have moved to places that are likely to end up disaster areas someday. That fact has either escaped their notice or seems to be of little consequence to them.This process of population and development growth that influences disaster frequency and magnitude is known as \u201cexpanding the bull\u2019s-eye effect.\u201d It isn\u2019t just the population increase that is important in raising the disaster potential, but also how the population and built environment is distributed across a landscape. As the targets \u2014 people, homes and businesses \u2014 become more numerous and spread out, so does the likelihood that they will be hit by a tornado or hurricane, for instance. And that expanding pattern determines the severity of the disaster.Since 1940, development within 50 miles of the Carolina coastline has increased an estimated 2,180 percent, or by 1.3 million homes. And as I mentioned, nearly half of this development has taken place since Hurricane Hugo, and many of these homes were built in high-risk areas like floodplains.There seems to be a bit of \u201cdisaster amnesia\u201d going on with respect to our development practices after a calamity.We now know much more about how the warming climate is influencing tropical storms. And in many places, the lemmings are still marching toward the sea.And when disaster knocks at the door, the bill is left to taxpayers who subsidize the National Flood Insurance Program. That money is often used to rebuild homes in the same high-risk locations. Unfortunately, given current insurance programs, rates that don\u2019t reflect the true risk in hazard-prone regions and the lack of incentives to persuade people not to live in these areas, the system we have is unsustainable.We need to be smarter about where we are developing and how we\u2019re doing it, building in resilience in any new construction in areas prone to weather and climate extremes. People who choose to live in high-risk areas should bear the cost when disaster strikes. Of course, we should be helping people hit by big storms. But I\u2019d rather see those dollars directed to hazard mitigation, and making existing and future development better able to withstand a disaster.Just because we can live somewhere doesn\u2019t mean we should. After all, as the saying goes, \u201cThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.\u201dStephen M. Strader is an assistant professor in Villanova University\u2019s geography and environment department.Note: Housing density indicates the number of housing units per hectare.

{"Headline": "Republicans Accuse Twitter of Bias Against Conservatives", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sparring focused on the testimony of Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, who repeatedly denied the accusations during a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Republicans grilled Mr. Dorsey, suggesting that Twitter\u2019s algorithms suppress conservative viewpoints and discriminate against Republican voices.Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, accused Republicans of sounding the alarm of bias for political gain. The idea that social media services exhibit a partisan slant, Mr. Doyle said, was a \u201cload of crap.\u201dYet the notion that social media companies might be intentionally choosing what political content to display was also pushed by the Trump Administration. Before the afternoon hearing, the Justice Department said Attorney General Jeff Sessions planned to hold a meeting with state attorneys general this month to examine how social media companies \u201cmay be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\u201dWhile Mr. Sessions has weighed in on free speech issues in the past, the scrutiny of social media pushes his agenda into a hotly contested and political area. Democrats and media law experts immediately pushed back.\u201cThis is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to the president\u2019s misguided belief in such bias, which has been disproved time and again by legitimate researchers,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior official at the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration.\u201cThey are outright banning people and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech,\u201d Mr. Jones said of Facebook and Google on Wednesday.Those issues have prompted outrage from lawmakers, who hauled Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to Washington to testify in April.\u201cIt\u2019s totally politics,\u201d said Andrew Schwartzman, a lecturer at Georgetown University Law Center, of the House hearing. He said Republican lawmakers accused social media companies of bias but he doubted that Congress would want to create laws to monitor speech on the services.\u201cI don\u2019t hear any discussion that suggests there are genuine legislative solutions to problems they are talking about,\u201d Mr. Schwartzman said.During the hearing, Mr. Dorsey repeatedly said that Twitter did not exhibit any bias against conservatives, echoing his previous denials. He also sidestepped taking sides in the partisan debate. When Kathy Castor, a Democrat of Florida, asked if he felt manipulated by Republican politicians for fund-raising purposes, Mr. Dorsey demurred.\u201cI do believe there is growing concern around power companies like ours hold,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople do see us as a digital public square and that comes with certain expectations.\u201dThe lawmakers\u2019 comments were a stark shift from the harsh criticism that they had leveled at the social media companies for months.\u201cAfter the election, you were reluctant to admit there was a problem,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the committee and a Democrat of Virginia. \u201cEach of you have come a long way with respect to recognizing the threat.\u201d\u201cTo the invisible witness, good morning to you,\u201d said Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat of California. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida, said Google may not have shown up \u201cbecause they are arrogant.\u201dThe afternoon\u2019s House hearing was far more political from the start. One lawmaker brought up Twitter\u2019s decision to take down an anti-abortion post by Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican. Others said the company needed to hire people outside of San Francisco so its employees would have more diverse political perspectives.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion if there wasn\u2019t a general agreement that your company had discriminated against conservatives,\u201d Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Dorsey.During the hearing, House Republicans pressed Mr. Dorsey about the way Twitter\u2019s systems treat conservative voices, including the methods by which the service suggests people to follow or selects certain users to be promoted.Mr. Dorsey, in his prepared testimony \u2014 which he also posted on Twitter \u2014 called bias in algorithms an important, but complex, matter. \u201cOur responsibility is to understand, measure, and reduce accidental bias due to factors such as the quality of the data used to train our algorithms,\u201d he said.Democrats slammed their Republican colleagues, saying they were promoting unproven allegations of bias for political fund-raising ahead of the midterms. Campaigns for House Leader Kevin McCarthy and President Trump have promoted their criticism of social media bias in online fund-raising ads.Again and again, Mr. Dorsey rebuffed the claims that Twitter favors one political viewpoint over another. \u201cLooking at the data, we analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate, and found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a Republican, even after our ranking and filtering of tweets has been applied,\u201d he said at one point.The contentiousness was evident more than an hour into the House hearing, when the right-wing activist Laura Loomer interrupted to accuse social media executives of censoring conservative voices. Holding up a cellphone on a stick to record herself, Ms. Loomer called on Mr. Trump to \u201csave us.\u201dHer interruption was largely drowned out by Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a certified auctioneer, who started calling out prices as Ms. Loomer repeated her accusations at increasing volume. The bidding reached $550 before Ms. Loomer was escorted from the room, and Mr. Long ceased his patter and yielded the floor back to the House Committee.Katie Benner and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington and Kate Conger from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I populisti italiani ammorbidiscono la legge sulle vaccinazioni al rientro a scuola dei bambini", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Da anni, la comunicazione anti-establishment del Movimento 5 Stelle diffonde confusione sui vaccini. Il suo cofondatore ha collegato i vaccini all\u2019autismo. I suoi leader politici hanno condotto compagne contro una legge che rendeva obbligatorie le vaccinazioni.La galassia di siti web che fa riferimento al M5S ha ospitato innumerevoli post di scettici sui vaccini e gli attivisti del Movimento hanno accusato i vaccini di provocare tumori e allergie. Una senatrice \u00e8 arrivata a definire le cicatrici lasciate da alcune vaccinazioni \u201cmarchi per le bestie\u201d.Gioved\u00ec scorso, nella settimana di riapertura delle scuole, il Movimento 5 Stelle e il suo partner di governo, la Lega, hanno approvato un decreto che consente agli alunni di stare in classe a condizione che i loro genitori attestino che sono stati vaccinati o che lo saranno entro marzo. Non occorre nessuna certificazione medica.I contrari ritengono il decreto un provvedimento pericoloso e puramente politico, che crea caos nel sistema scolastico, aumenta i rischi per gli alunni affetti da carenze del sistema immunitario ed espone il paese a una possibile emergenza sanitaria.Nel corso del 2017, i casi di morbillo in Italia sono schizzati a 5.006 rispetto agli 843 dell\u2019anno precedente, collocando il paese al terzo posto in Europa per incidenza della malattia in rapporto alla popolazione, preceduto da due paesi ben pi\u00f9 poveri, la Romania e la Grecia. Il Messico ha raccomandato ai suoi cittadini che intendono recarsi in Italia di vaccinarsi.L\u2019Italia \u00e8 forse il caso pi\u00f9 grave di un contagio di altro genere che si va diffondendo in Europa e nel Mondo Occidentale, un contagio nel quale la politica populista, la disinformazione e la pseudoscienza veicolate da Internet si sono combinate con un sentimento anti-sistema che impone la diffidenza verso chi possiede competenze. Ma ora le forze populiste che hanno alimentato quella tendenza sono al potere e devono fare i conti con le conseguenze che questa comporta per la sanit\u00e0 pubblica e la sicurezza dei cittadini.\u201cFa tutto parte della deriva anti-sistema\u201d, ha detto Beatrice Lorenzin, ministro della salute nel precedente governo di centrosinistra e promotrice della legge del 2017 sull\u2019obbligatoriet\u00e0 delle vaccinazioni che porta il suo nome. \u201cDato che tutto \u00e8 casta, anche la scienza diventa una casta. Ma la scienza \u00e8 l\u2019ultimo bastione, e quando si riduce al minimo l\u2019autorevolezza della scienza non resta nient\u2019altro\u201d.Di fronte all\u2019aumento dei casi di morbillo e a un\u2019erosione della fiducia nei vaccini iniziata da una decina d\u2019anni, il precedente governo decise che i bambini dovessero ricevere dieci vaccinazioni prima di potere essere ammessi nelle scuole. La legge \u00e8 entrata in vigore quest\u2019anno.Quest\u2019estate, tuttavia, il ministro pentastellato Giulia Grillo, successore della Lorenzin nel nuovo governo populista, ha cercato di allentare i vincoli imposti dalla legge sulla vaccinazione obbligatoria, inserendo nella sua formulazione un concetto che ha definito \u201cobbligo flessibile\u201d. Giulia Grillo, che non ha voluto rilasciarci dichiarazioni, ha deciso, in via definitiva, per l\u2019estensione dell\u2019iscrizione agli scolari senza certificazione vaccinale.\u201cNon \u00e8 cambiato niente; \u00e8 esattamente come prima\u201d, ha dichiarato Rocco Casalino, portavoce dei Cinque Stelle, gioved\u00ec, dopo l\u2019approvazione della legge, sollevando l\u2019ovvia domanda: ma allora, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 stata approvata?Gioved\u00ec stesso, alcuni senatori del M5S hanno dichiarato che il loro prossimo impegno sarebbe stato la dissoluzione completa della legge sulle vaccinazioni.\u201cPurtroppo, lo Stato ha diffuso informazioni ambigue che potranno confondere i genitori che stanno cercando di decidere se vaccinare i figli o no\u201d, ha dichiarato Roberto Burioni, prestigioso immunologo dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele e oggetto di odio feroce da parte del movimento \u201cno-vax\u201d (una mamma ha scritto nella sua pagina Facebook che sperava che affogasse durante la sua vacanza al mare). \u201cLo Stato dovrebbe essere chiaro, e prendere chiaramente posizione a fianco della scienza\u201d, ha conclluso il professor Burioni.Il vaccino antimorbillo, che negli ultimi 50 anni ha contribuito a debellare completamente la malattia negli Stati Uniti, \u00e8 stato reso obbligatorio in Italia nel 1976. La copertura \u00e8 andata costantemente crescendo fino a superare il 90% nel 2003. Purtroppo, ha fatto rilevare Beatrice Lorenzin, l\u2019obbligo \u00e8 diventato meno rigoroso nel 1999 perch\u00e9 le autorit\u00e0 italiane hanno creduto, erroneamente, che la fiducia nella scienza e nei vaccini fosse ben radicata nella cultura nazionale. Invece, ha detto l\u2019ex ministro, si \u00e8 dimostrato vero il contrario.Lorenzin ha attribuito l\u2019ondata di sfiducia nei vaccini al fatto che alcune malattie fossero diventate cos\u00ec rare da non sembrare una minaccia reale, all\u2019effetto disastroso di un studio confutato e sconfessato da tempo apparso sulla rivista medica \u201cThe Lancet\u201d, nel quale si sosteneva una correlazione tra il vaccino trivalente e l\u2019autismo e a quello che l\u2019ex ministro ha chiamato \u201cil dottor Google\u201d. Nel 2015, la copertura era scesa intorno all\u201985%. I casi di morbillo, una malattia che pu\u00f2 causare cecit\u00e0, encefalite, polmonite e talvolta il decesso, sono andati aumentando.Anche il movimento \u201cno-vax\u201d \u00e8 andato crescendo. A Rimini, un fertile terreno di attivit\u00e0 no-vax nonch\u00e9 citt\u00e0 in cui un magistrato locale, nel 2012, pronunci\u00f2 una sentenza - poi annullata - che stabiliva l\u2019esistenza di una correlazione tra vaccini e autismo, i militanti anti-vaccini hanno fatto ricorso alla pubblicit\u00e0 aerea, con striscioni che recavano la scritta \u201cTutti a scuola. Libert\u00e0 di scelta\u201d.Il governatore leghista della Regione Veneto Luca Zaia si \u00e8 fatto promotore di un approccio \u201cpersonalizzato\u201d alla valutazione delle vaccinazioni; alcune famiglie hanno organizzato una \u201cscuola nei boschi\u201d isolata per i bambini non vaccinati, altri bambini hanno fatto lezione in abitazioni private.Beatrice Lorenzin ha affermato che se fosse ancora il ministro della salute, manderebbe la polizia a chiudere le scuole illegali. \u201cSono una bomba chimica\u201d, ha aggiunto.Mattia Marchi, uno dei portavoce del Coordinamento per il Veneto dell\u2019Associazione Corvelva, un gruppo che raccoglie organizzazioni no-vax e free-vax, ha affermato che i genitori diffidenti dei vaccini non avevano praticamente altra scelta che far vaccinare i figli. \u201cNessuno ha mai detto che i vaccini causano l\u2019autismo\u201d, ha dichiarato Marchi. \u201cMa se mille persone vedono un UFO, vogliamo dire a queste persone che sono matte o vogliamo trovare una soluzione?\u201d.La scorsa settimana Federico Aliberti, un artigiano di Livorno, \u00e8 venuto a Roma con il figlio di tre anni per protestare contro l\u2019obbligo di vaccinare qualsiasi bambino si volesse iscrivere al nido d\u2019infanzia, alla scuola materna e alla scuola elementare. Il sig. Aliberti, un elettore dei Cinque Stelle, si \u00e8 detto irritato dall\u2019\u201carroganza\u201d degli scienziati che hanno la presunzione di capire una cosa complessa come il sistema immunitario umano.Il feed della sua pagina Facebook, ha detto, era stato inondato da clip di politici Cinque Stelle che promettevano la libera scelta e da articoli e video sugli interessi dell\u2019industria farmaceutica nel campo dei vaccini e sui presunti collegamenti dei vaccini con i tumori e l\u2019autismo. Ha concluso che il governo gli aveva dato speranze ma poi, anche con il nuovo decreto, non veniva fatto altro che sferrare \u201cuna pugnalata alla schiena\u201d. In effetti, per anni, il Movimento 5 Stelle e, pi\u00f9 di recente, la Lega, gli avevano dato qualcosa in cui credere.Beppe Grillo, il cofondatore del Movimento 5 Stelle, ha presunto che esista un legame tra vaccini e autismo, suggerito che i vaccini indeboliscano il sistema immunitario dei bambini sani e asserito che l\u2019industria farmaceutica promuova le vaccinazioni per fare profitto. Vari membri del partito eletti al Parlamento Europeo hanno proposto l\u2019eliminazione di alcune vaccinazioni obbligatorie per determinate categorie di dipendenti pubblici e dichiarato di ritenere le vaccinazioni possibili cause di leucemie, tumori e autismo. In un\u2019altra circostanza, hanno espresso preoccupazioni per la possibile pericolosit\u00e0 dei metalli contenuti nei vaccini. Il sindaco pentastellato di Livorno ha definito \u201cintollerabile\u201d l\u2019obbligo vaccinale, mentre alcuni suoi colleghi pugliesi hanno esortato i cittadini a rivolgersi a medici convinti che un\u2019alimentazione ricca di noci fosse una misura profilattica pi\u00f9 efficace dei vaccini.Lo scorso febbraio Paola Taverna, una senatrice molto in vista nello schieramento pentastellato al Senato, ha evocato con appassionata nostalgia i tempi in cui \u201candavano in processione a casa del cugino\u201d per prendere tutte le malattie esantematiche possibili e togliersi il pensiero come alternativa preferibile ai Centri di Vaccinazione, dove \u201cfanno i marchi per le bestie\u201d. Comunque, questa settimana, la senatrice ha dichiarato che avrebbe fatto vaccinare i suoi figli.A luglio, un membro eletto al Consiglio Regionale del Lazio con i Cinque Stelle ha presentato la proposta di imporre una quarantena di 4-6 settimane agli scolari dopo la vaccinazione. Il promotore, Davide Barillari, ha anche insistito per l\u2019organizzazione di uno \u201cstage informativo\u201d in tema di \u201ccorrelazioni causali\u201d tra vaccini e patologie diretto ai genitori che si rivolgono ai centri vaccinali. \u201cLa politica viene prima della scienza\u201d, ha dichiarato.Davide Casaleggio, il potente figlio dell\u2019altro cofondatore del Movimento 5 Stelle, che secondo molti controlla la piattaforma web attraverso la quale il partito funziona, ha scritto nel suo blog che il Movimento \u201cprende completamene le distanze\u201d dalle affermazioni di Barillari.Lo contraddice per\u00f2 Marco Canestrari, ex dipendente della Casaleggio Associati uscito dall\u2019azienda e dal partito e coautore del libro Supernova, dedicato al funzionamento interno del M5S, affermando che la costellazione di siti di Casaleggio era solita dare spazio ad articoli \u201capertamente contrari ai vaccini\u201d. \u201cLo facevano per incrementare le visite e la pubblicit\u00e0 in tema di salute sui siti\u201d ha detto. \u201cC\u2019era un forte consenso intorno alla cosa, ma poi, quando il partito \u00e8 cresciuto e l\u2019argomento \u00e8 diventato scomodo, hanno preso le distanze\u201d.Durante la campagna elettorale, ogni qualvolta i candidati sollevavano questioni sui vaccini, i leader del partito badavano bene a rispondere sempre di non essere contrari ai vaccini. Hanno continuato a farlo anche dopo il decreto approvato gioved\u00ec. Matteo Salvini, leader della Lega anti-immigrazionista e partner di governo dei Cinque Stelle, sembrava chiaramente intenzionato a partecipare al fronte anti-vaccini mentre andava costruendo il suo movimento populista.A marzo 2013, Salvini non sembrava affatto darsi pena dei vaccini, quando scriveva su Twitter che sua figlia Mirta aveva fatto le prime vaccinazioni e commentava: \u201cRideva, la pi\u00f9 preoccupata \u00e8 stata la mamma\u201d. Due anni dopo, a ottobre 2015, quando era ancora ai margini della politica, \u00e8 sembrato voler saggiare la forza elettorale dell\u2019argomento. \u201cVaccinazioni obbligatorie, sanzioni ai medici che le sconsigliano. Che ne pensate?\u201d Altri due anni dopo, ad aprile 2017, chiedeva: \u201cil primo medico italiano che ha detto NO ai vaccini \u00e8 stato radiato.

Opinion ColumnistOn Wednesday afternoon, I traveled to the charming but unassuming neighborhood of Juniper Hill in White Plains to speak with a living legend too few people know about.There was no news peg for my conversation with Dr. Hooker, no milestone, no major anniversary, but it is my philosophy that when life affords you the opportunity to sit at the elbow of a historical figure who has lived through things you\u2019ve only read about, you take it.So I entered Hooker\u2019s home and locked eyes with her, as a broad smile pushed up her cheeks. Her small body lay almost enveloped by the cushions of a large red recliner.Shortly after I arrived, she began to speak, recalling an awesome story of a terrible time.Hooker grew up in a happy house with three sisters and one brother \u2014 she was the fourth child \u2014 her parents and a grandmother. Their house was a small, five-room cottage, white with green trim, in Greenwood.She described an idyllic life of school, visits to the grocery store whenever she had two pennies, and her fear of the trolley that ran through town.White men broke into their house as Hooker and some of her siblings hid beneath an oak dining table, draped with a tablecloth.She continued, \u201cThey took all the beautiful biscuits out of the oven and threw them out in the mud.\u201d We both managed a laugh.They broke the phonograph and the Enrico Caruso records her mother had received as a gift from a friend who had gone to study in Heidelberg, Germany.\u201cThey didn\u2019t appreciate you having anything classical,\u201d Hooker said. \u201cThey took all the silverware that Momma had just got for Christmas, coffee pot, teapot \u2014 you know, that kind of beautiful stuff. If anything looked precious, they took it.\u201dPeople think that the horror of America\u2019s racial history is an unfortunate episode among ancestors, but it is not. The civil rights movement was only 50 years ago. The Tulsa riot was less than 100 years ago. People alive today still carry that weight, still manage that trauma, still hide those scars.American history is full of stories of black people doing precisely what America says it wants of its citizens \u2014 being creative, enterprising and industrious, being self-respecting and self-sufficient \u2014 only to have white people destroy what they\u2019ve built, impede their progress and erase their wealth. And those are not far-off stories: Those are also the stories of the living.I look at it this way: Dr. Hooker\u2019s life has overlapped with that of my grandparents, my parents, my kids and me. So, too, must the lives of some of the men who destroyed this black neighborhood, the ones who burst into the small white and green Hooker house looking to loot \u201cprecious\u201d things.What impact did this have on Hooker and those she influenced? What impact did it have on the rioters and those they influenced? History doesn\u2019t stay stuck in the time that it happens. That is only where it is born, after which it is alive and moving with us through time and space.In the immediate aftermath of the riots, Hooker was traumatized.The community was decimated. \u201cAll of the schools where black people could go to were destroyed,\u201d she told me. As Hooker tells it, they were bombed from the air using crop dusters. Her father\u2019s store, with its Arrow shirts and Edison hats, had been emptied by looters.Her mother moved with the children to Topeka, Kan., so they could go to school, while her father stayed behind to try to rebuild his business.\u201cI used to scream at night. I didn\u2019t sleep. I had nightmares,\u201d she said. Dr. Hooker was so traumatized that when her mother sought medical advice about what to do with her sleepless child, she was told to keep her home from school, which she did for a while.Think about what this kind of trauma (or our modern versions, in the form of things like televised state violence or mass family separation and internment) does to a child\u2019s \u2014 a person\u2019s \u2014 sense of trust and belonging.Hooker said it made her question her sense of belonging in this country, as well as the patriotic songs she had learned as a child. \u201cAll the beautiful songs, well, I had believed them.\u201dHooker said her mother told her, \u201cWe are citizens, but they don\u2019t respect us.\u201d\u201cMy family had never told me about hate,\u201d said Hooker. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what that was.\u201d She told me: \u201cAll of the nonblack people I had seen had been gentle and nice, laughing with us children and listening to my sister play the piano, because they wanted to sell my father their wares. I thought that was the nature of whites.\u201dAs Hooker put it, \u201cIt took years for me to get over the shock of seeing people be so horrible to people who had done them no wrong.\u201dThat to me was Hooker\u2019s great lesson about Tulsa: that racism and racial violence is shocking and haunting and you carry it with you, both communally and individually, in blunt injury and in excruciating detail, down to the image of the beautiful biscuits being tossed in the mud.Advertisement"}

A ridge of high pressure between the storm and New York should prevent the hurricane from moving toward us, Mr. Cline said. \u201cIt should move strictly west to northwest.\u201dWe could, however, see some indirect effects from the storm.Hurricane Florence is predicted to slow down significantly once it makes landfall, and it could stall over the Carolinas \u2014 horrible news for that region, said Tim Morrin, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service.

He\u2019s aloof and tone-deaf, it\u2019s said. What else is new?Opinion ColumnistPARIS \u2014 The French, it seems, have soured on President Emmanuel Macron, the wunderkind who swept to power 16 months ago. His poll numbers have slumped as the gloss on the 40-year-old upstart has faded. The consensus is in: He\u2019s aloof, Jupiter-like, tone-deaf, devoted to coddling the rich.In a whirlwind of activity, Macron has taken aim at the protections and entitlements that have made it hard to hire and fire in France, and sometimes made not working (at least in the official economy) more rewarding than working.Live well, live hidden, goes the old French saying. Financial success is always a little suspect. Money is like God: best not mentioned in public. \u201cPro-business\u201d remains an insult. Macron, the young disrupter and ex-banker, has been challenging an old country to adjust its self-image, embrace risk over security. Many have tried to do that. Many have failed.So the domestic honeymoon is over, like the coziness with President Trump that could not stop Trump trashing international agreements dear to Macron (Iran, climate). The rekindled thrill at Macron\u2019s Gaullist pomp has ceded to irritation at his airs. A scandal involving his security chief, Alexandre Benalla, who was caught on video beating up a protester, was handled badly enough to become an \u201caffaire.\u201d Macron can be peremptory when his convictions are challenged. The business of politics engages him less than the burdens of history.For decades, there were two skeletons in the French closet \u2014 Vichy and the Algerian War. The shame of France \u2014 for its World War II collaboration, for its brutal colonial war \u2014 eluded honest accountings. Such lies and evasions are ticking bombs in the fabric of any society.This month, Macron also aimed a volley of truth at the cast of little-England chameleons, headed by the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who ushered Britain to its unfinest hour, the delusional decision to leave the European Union.\u201cThose who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be all right, and that it\u2019s going to bring a lot of money home are liars,\u201d he declared. \u201cIt\u2019s even more true since they left the day after so as not to have to deal with it.\u201dThese were words that needed saying. With each passing week the immense cost of Britain\u2019s fit of pique becomes clearer. Macron remains Europe\u2019s most vigorous bulwark against the wave of nationalism, nativism, xenophobia and small-mindedness that were expressed in the Brexit vote and have found expression across a continent anxious about immigration.Macron faces no domestic presidential or parliamentary elections until 2022. With the weakening of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, he is the only European politician who can stand up to the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, whose illiberal model for the evisceration of democracy through the politics of fear has traction. The European Parliament elections in May 2019 will be an important barometer of the Macron-Orban confrontation.To be a serious historical figure today is to stand in isolation. Judgment is instantaneous, sometimes irrevocable. Macron has made mistakes. People do. I think he\u2019s the last best hope for the world I believe in and I salute him.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Broken Pieces of Middle East Peace", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "OpinionForty years after the Camp David accords, we\u2019re again at a fateful moment. Supported byOpinion ColumnistThis week marks the 40th anniversary of the Camp David accords \u2014 the high-water mark of Middle East peacemaking. How far we have fallen since then. It makes you weep.Rather than a breakthrough, Israelis and Palestinians seem to be inching closer and closer to a total breakdown. Without some dramatic advance, there is a real chance that whatever Palestinian governance exists will crumble, and Israel will have to take full responsibility for the health, education and welfare of the 2.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank. Israel would then have to decide whether to govern the West Bank with one legal authority or two, which would mean Israel would be choosing between bi-nationalism and apartheid, both disasters for a Jewish democracy.So many people are acting badly. Hamas is pursuing a strategy of human sacrifice in Gaza \u2014 throwing wave after wave of protesters against the Israeli border fence to die without purpose or even much notice anymore. It is shameful.Hamas has been a curse on the Palestinian people. At a time when the key to any Palestinian breakthrough with Israel is for Palestinians to make Israelis feel strategically secure but morally insecure about holding occupied territories, Hamas, with its relentless tunnel-digging into Israel and border assaults \u2014 unaccompanied by any offer of a two-state solution \u2014 does everything to make Israelis feel strategically insecure and morally secure about holding territories.Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu of Israel has been a brilliant strategist in confronting Iran and managing Russia in Syria. But on the Palestinian issue, all he has is a P.R. strategy \u2014 he uses all his intelligence to find ways to make sure the Palestinians get blamed in the U.S. for any absence of progress \u2014 without offering any new, or old, ideas on how to separate from the Palestinians to avoid the terrible choices of bi-nationalism and apartheid.Bibi is well on his way to going down in history as the Israeli prime minister who won every debate and lost Israel as a Jewish democracy.Meanwhile in the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority has settled into a strategy of \u201cI am going to hold my breath until you turn blue.\u201d It is refusing to negotiate with the Trump team out of anger over Trump\u2019s ridiculously one-sided approach and his moving of the embassy and out of frustration for receiving no credit from Israel or the U.S. for its security cooperation in the West Bank.At the same time, though, a March poll by the respected Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey found that 78 percent of Palestinians believed that the Palestinian Authority was hobbled by corruption.The authority needs a new strategy \u2014 fast \u2014 because its old go-to strategy of defiance and highlighting its victimhood is not working. The status quo is hammering Palestinians but, for now, is tolerable for everyone else. So the authority needs to get back to the negotiating table. May I make a suggestion?The Trump team keeps saying that it wants to get America\u2019s Arab allies to endorse its peace plan. The Arabs won\u2019t do that if that plan does not meet some minimum Palestinian demands, and the Palestinians won\u2019t settle for those minimum demands without Arab cover.Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, should go to America\u2019s four key Arab allies \u2014 Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 and propose that they collectively say \u201cyes\u201d to engaging Trump and Kushner if the U.S. plan includes two criteria: It calls for a contiguous Palestinian state in the West Bank \u2014 not a bunch of disconnected cantons \u2014 and it grants Palestinians some form of sovereignty in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem, where 300,000 Arabs already live. (The authority will also have to agree that its state will be demilitarized.)If a Kushner-Trump plan embraced the Arab-Palestinian minimums, Bibi would have to either reject it \u2014 exposing his real position \u2014 or jettison some of his far-right political supporters and form a new government prepared to negotiate on the U.S. terms. He could definitely do the latter \u2014 if he wanted.\u201cThe Palestinians can\u2019t want to lose their governing authority in the West Bank,\u201d notes veteran Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross. \u201cAnd the Trump administration and Israel can\u2019t want a total vacuum to emerge there, because in the Middle East, all vacuums are filled by something worse.\u201dAn agreement by the Palestinians and America\u2019s Arab allies on their minimum foundations for negotiations, adds Ross, gives Palestinians cover to come back to the table and puts pressure on the Trump team to deliver a credible plan or be exposed as not being serious. And \u201cit gives Israel a partner and some fateful choices to make.\u201dSay what you will about Anwar el-Sadat and Menachem Begin and Jimmy Carter 40 years ago, but they came to a point at Camp David where there were only hard choices \u2014 and they made them, and they made the right ones.We\u2019re again at a fateful moment. For the Palestinians, it\u2019s choose nihilism or pacifism. For Israel, it\u2019s choose separation from the Palestinians or get bi-nationalism or apartheid. For Jared and Donald, it\u2019s either be serious \u2014 and be ready to take a tough stance with all parties, including Israel \u2014 or stay home.Making progress toward peace requires telling everyone the truth, twisting everyone\u2019s arms and not letting any party drive drunk. Not ready for that? Then stick to building condos and golf courses.Advertisement"}

As different as they may be in size, they are all related, part of the flatfish family \u2014 and delicate, mild and sweet tasting, with tender white flesh.They are aptly named, for indeed they are flat. While other species of fish are symmetrical, with eyes on both sides of the head, and upright swimmers, flatfish have eyes on just one side, and swim sideways.So how to choose? It can be confusing. The thing to know is that flatfish fillets are relatively interchangeable when it comes to preparing them, each one quick and easy to cook on the stovetop in a large skillet.I usually opt for large, six- to eight-ounce flounder fillets, if they are available, or fluke (also known as summer flounder, but available year-round, go figure).I take a classic approach, dusting the fish fillets lightly with seasoned flour, and browning them lightly on both sides in a little olive oil \u2014 about two minutes per side.Then I transfer them to a warm platter while I make a quick butter sauce in the same pan. It is a simple matter of tossing a few chunks of cold butter into the hot skillet, letting it sizzle and begin to get brown and foamy, but not too brown. (The flavor I\u2019m going for is toasty and nutty, not burned.)A splash of lemon juice stops the browning and contributes acidity. A fistful of chopped parsley and a little chopped tarragon to finish is nice, though parsley alone will do. The sauce takes less than a minute, really, before it is spooned over the fish.This is the kind of fast food that is elegant enough for company, but easy enough for weeknight fare.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "At Kopitiam, Malaysian Food Powers Through Some Growing Pains", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant Review10 PhotosSometimes when I am waiting, and waiting, for a barista to steam milk for my cortado, I like to pass the time by imagining what life would be like if Howard Schultz had boarded the wrong plane in 1981 and flown to Penang instead of Milan.Kyo Pang founded Kopitiam three years ago as a homage to the coffee and tea parlors of Malaysia, where she grew up. A typical Malaysian kopitiam is a ramshackle hangout where people drop in to read the morning paper, grab breakfast, catch up on neighborhood gossip and do all the other things that classically accompany a cup of tea or coffee. Something of that spirit pervades Kopitiam, too.From 9 a.m., when the doors open, until 10 p.m., when they close, you can get nasi lemak, Malaysia\u2019s national dish and a particular favorite at breakfast. I don\u2019t know another kitchen in the city where the fragrances of coconut and pandan leaf infuse the rice as elegantly, or where the tiny dried fish, which Kopitiam fries with peanuts, form a caramelized crust that erases the distinction between sweet and savory.Or your breakfast could be a bowl of two eggs boiled just long enough to turn the whites opaque while leaving the yolks free to billow into mushroom-soy broth underneath. Or it might be fish ball soup, grape-size globes of ground fish in a cloudy white broth; if the grains of white pepper on the surface aren\u2019t intense enough for you, you can stir in a little fish sauce spiced with bird\u2019s eye chiles. Rice vermicelli can be added, too, but the soup is easier to appreciate in pure liquid form.But one of the most inviting aspects of Kopitiam is Ms. Pang\u2019s fidelity to the Malaysian love of snacks. Pandan leaves wrapped around a kind of chicken sausage; ground five-spice pork rolled inside bean-curd skins and fried; fried strips of mackerel sausage with a curry-leaf sauce \u2014 any of them makes a fine appetizer, but each could just as easily be the entire goal of a between-meals stop at Kopitiam. For that matter, so could the small sweets like pulut: triangular, pandan-wrapped bundles of sticky rice tinted with blue morning glory flowers and spread with toasted coconut sugar or house-made coconut jam.Ms. Pang is devoted to cakes as well. You get the sense that if it were physically possible, she\u2019d bake every cake she knows every day, but she settles for one or two in an unpredictable rotation. You may find the caramel-brown honeycomb cake, with its intriguing structure of hollow vertical columns at the bottom, or you may find her coconut cake, or there may be some fresh surprise.Snacks and sweets tend to get edged out of the spotlight in New York restaurants, where there\u2019s always pressure to order something big. This is, after all, a city that turned the casual tapas bar into the peculiar genre known as the tapas restaurant. There is no such pressure inside Kopitiam, at least on weekdays.Weekend brunch is another story, as it often is. The menu is the same, but the crowds thicken. A sign-in sheet is kept outside the door, next to the pink pay phone (25 cents; it works), and hopeful customers sit on ceramic garden stools at the top of the stoop listening for their names. When you\u2019re finally called, you may feel silly getting nothing more than tannic milky tea and a bundle of blue sticky rice.And when demand peaks, chaos can creep in, suggesting that Kopitiam is still figuring out the mechanics of its larger space. Servers may pop by anxiously to ask, \u201cDid you get all your food?\u201d and the answer may be no. Drink orders may stack up. Once the white coffee was off the menu; another time, no coffee at all was being poured; and for a short time one day, both coffee and tea were unavailable, an awkward state of affairs for a coffee and tea parlor.Even with a backlog of tickets, though, the food trickling out of the kitchen is almost unfailingly terrific. Maybe the stir-fried duck tongues I ate last time could have slid from their cartilaginous framework more easily. Then again, maybe I wasn\u2019t in the right mood for duck tongues.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Marvelous Filters in the Manta Ray\u2019s Mouth", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrilobitesThe car-sized, kite-shaped fishes don\u2019t have to clear their throats because of their unique method of filtration that could be applied to preventing plastic pollution in the seas.It all began with a simple question: Why don\u2019t manta rays clear their throats?The car-size, kite-shaped fishes filter their plankton food from seawater, but they don\u2019t pause, close their mouths and snort clogs from their filters nearly as often as you would expect, according to Misty Paig-Tran, a marine biologist and a professor at California State University, Fullerton. If their filters work like sieves, then they must get clogged over time, like all similar systems, from vacuum cleaners to your water-filter pitcher.To understand how the manta\u2019s filters work, imagine a series of tiny angled slats lined up in its mouth. When seawater rushes over these structures, according to experiments by Raj Divi, a student in Dr. Paig-Tran\u2019s lab, it forms whirlpools between each pair of slats. These vortices don\u2019t suck particles down. Instead they push up, keeping the fragments of plankton and other seaborne particles from falling into the crevices.As a result the particles ricochet off the slats, growing concentrated in the mouth while the water drains away. They never actually get in the filter, according to both lab experiments washing colored dye and particles over plastic versions of the structures, and mathematical models of what\u2019s going on. They are bounced out before they get the chance, and then are swallowed by the ray.Understanding how the manta ray is feeding and what it is eating may assist conservation efforts. \u201cThis is a protected animal that is being harvested like crazy. And we don\u2019t even have a good handle on what they\u2019re feeding on,\u201d Dr. Paig-Tran said, noting that this could aid in understanding what organisms they depend on and whether they are ingesting plastic particles floating in the ocean.It could also lead to filters for human use, relying on this method. In the past, machines that use clever engineering to avoid the buildup of obstructions while filtering have met with striking success: some vacuum cleaners, for instance, separate dust from the air using centrifugal force, rather than a filter that grows caked with grit.Dr. Paig-Tran hopes that this discovery will aid in the battle against microplastics in the ocean.Tiny plastic pieces may wind up in wastewater, she said, \u201cbut they don\u2019t get treated in wastewater treatment because they\u2019re not equipped for that size particle.\u201d Manta rays, in contrast, are good at filtering at such a scale.Imagine a clog-resistant filter modeled on the manta\u2019s mouth and placed in a treatment plant to catch plastic fragments before they are released into the environment.

Should Mr. Moonves depart, his chief lieutenant, Joseph Ianniello, is likely to be named interim chief executive, two of the people said.During his tenure, Mr. Moonves, 68, has helped transform CBS from a last-place network into the most watched channel for the last decade, with hits like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cSurvivor.\u201d That success has made Mr. Moonves one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood and his possible departure has put the future fortunes of the company into doubt.For over a month, Mr. Moonves has been grappling with the two separate but equally fateful issues. In addition to the harassment allegations against him, Mr. Moonves is involved in a legal dispute with Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of CBS. An exit with a significant cash payout for Mr. Moonves before a trial that may decide control of the company could be seen as a beneficial outcome for all parties, according to the people.Earlier this year, Mr. Moonves and the network\u2019s independent directors mounted a legal challenge to Ms. Redstone, 64, in an attempt to stop her from merging the network with Viacom. The trial is set to begin Oct. 3 in Delaware Chancery Court. At the same time, the board is investigating claims of sexual harassment against Mr. Moonves and allegations of a broader culture of harassment at CBS, most notably in its news division.Both issues complicated the interplay among directors, and exposed its factions, with one group apparently loyal to Ms. Redstone, another to Mr. Moonves and others debating which direction the company should take.In a statement at the time, Mr. Moonves said: \u201cI recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2014 and abided by the principle \u2014 that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career.\u201dShortly after the article was published, the CBS board enlisted two law firms to lead an inquiry into the claims against Mr. Moonves and the wider workplace culture at the network. The board soon after folded a separate examination of CBS News \u2014 underway since March \u2014 into the larger investigation.The board hired Nancy Kestenbaum of Covington & Burling and Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton to conduct the inquiry. Ms. White led the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration and was previously the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Ms. Kestenbaum was also a federal prosecutor with the same district. The investigation into CBS News is being led by the law firm of Proskauer Rose.Mr. Moonves had recused himself from any matters related to the investigation, and a three-member committee \u2014 Bruce S. Gordon, Linda Griego and Robert N. Klieger \u2014 has been appointed to oversee the inquiry. The makeup of that panel reflects the fractious board itself.Mr. Klieger, a lawyer based in Los Angeles, occupies one of three CBS board seats appointed by Ms. Redstone\u2019s family company. (In addition to Mr. Klieger, Ms. Redstone and David R. Andelman, a Boston-based lawyer who has represented the Redstone family in the past, make up the Redstone family\u2019s board seats.)Ms. Redstone commands both CBS and Viacom by owning 80 percent of voting rights, and the legal battle is being waged to water down that stake in CBS.Ms. Redstone had asked the boards of CBS and Viacom to explore the possibility of a merger to protect themselves from the onslaught of technology giants like Netflix, Amazon and Facebook, which have taken ad dollars and eyeballs away from the traditional players.Mr. Moonves and the majority of the CBS board, however, concluded a combination would not benefit CBS\u2019s shareholders. The company has a far more robust business, while revenue at Viacom, which includes the cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, has been shrinking over the last few years.Ms. Redstone has countersued, claiming Mr. Moonves had effectively forced the CBS board to take legal action against her lest he leave the company.Mr. Moonves draws an annual pay package worth $69.3 million. His employment agreement included a provision that would pay him more than $184 million in pay and benefits as part of his exit if the board fires him without fault, or if he leaves because of the legal dispute.Last month, the CBS directors who are unaffiliated with Ms. Redstone filed requests to seek more information about how her family company, National Amusements, handles the voting shares of its own company and that of CBS.Lawyers for the network suggested in court proceedings that Ms. Redstone\u2019s control of the shares could be in doubt because she\u2019s acting at the behest of her father, Sumner Redstone, 95, who has been in ill health for several years. Mr. Redstone owns the controlling shares, and he does not speak and is being fed through a tube.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Photography Exploits the Vulnerable", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere are too many gratuitous photos of people jamming needles into their bodies and bloated corpses carried out of filthy homes.Mr. Jones is a freelance photographer based in New York City.Photojournalism is built on the idea that photojournalists are witnesses to history. Part of our job is to visualize issues the general public does not have immediate access to. We have a responsibility to portray the visceral realities of an often devastating world, but we also have a responsibility to maintain the humanity of the people we photograph. And on this measure we too often fail, especially when it comes to coverage of drug abuse. Almost four decades later, the opioid epidemic has shown that journalism still slouches toward sensationalism. It has become the most fatal drug crisis in modern American history, and much of its coverage perpetuates the class warfare that has lingered since the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d began in the 1970s. We still see gratuitous photos of people jamming needles into their bodies. We still see photos of nameless men and women shackled by law enforcement and dead, bloated bodies carried out of filthy homes.Drug addiction is real; it is menacing and ugly. But if we fail to maintain the humanity of the people who share their stories with us, addiction coverage turns drug users into caricatures or props. When suffering is coupled with exploitation, those who are photographed are never allowed to live outside of the pain they\u2019re in, because those photos turn a single behavior into an identity that exists in perpetuity.Rich people do drugs, too. But they don\u2019t often end up on the streets or in the methadone clinics where journalists almost always go to tell the story of the opioid epidemic. This is a public health crisis that is affecting all classes of Americans, but the poor are often the only ones seen suffering.Photojournalists will always be tempted to make graphic, evocative imagery, but we must move on to more nuanced, compassionate work about vulnerable people. We need to see more stories on harm reduction, policy reform, advocacy groups and the variety of evidence-based recovery. We need to see the ways that families and communities are fighting and responding to the devastation in their homes. We need to acknowledge the racial and class biases in drug coverage and the representational mistakes made by those in editorial power. We need to understand how language perpetuates stigma. We need to be aware that the words, photos and captions we use as journalists can be weaponized in an already volatile national conversation around drug use. Most important, we need to represent people with addiction as human beings, even if they seem unable to protect themselves when their illness is at its worst.Some people who use drugs never see peace, and that\u2019s a reality that journalism has to portray. But it is important we do not paint American drug use with a monolithic brush. It is difficult to make sensitive stories, and journalists cannot create redemption. But we can find where it lives and make it louder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Hero to Pariah, Aung San Suu Kyi Dashes Hopes About Myanmar", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGKOK \u2014 Over a span of a month, a pro-military newspaper columnist, U Ngar Min Swe, wrote 10 brief Facebook posts accusing Myanmar\u2019s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, of taking bribes and dividing the country. In one post, without naming her, he suggested that she was a \u201cpower-mad prostitute.\u201dAfter the police brought charges of sedition, a judge found him guilty and sentenced him this month to seven years in prison.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government could have kept the case from reaching court. But for the Nobel Peace laureate and onetime democracy icon, suppressing criticism has become a hallmark of her leadership.Much of the world had high hopes for Myanmar two and a half years ago, when Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi came to power.So much has changed.Once a symbol of resistance to military rule, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is known today as an enabler of ethnic cleansing and a foe of press freedom. Hopes that she would use her party\u2019s majority in Parliament to encourage badly needed economic growth and abolish oppressive laws have faded.Now, about halfway through her National League for Democracy party\u2019s five-year term in office, Myanmar is in danger of again becoming a pariah state, as it was under the rule of the generals who once kept her under house arrest.\u201cBefore the N.L.D. government, the international community felt pity for our country because we lived under the military regime,\u201d said Daw Nyo Nyo Thin, a democracy advocate and former regional lawmaker, referring to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy party. \u201cBut now, the world sees our country as the majority killing the minority.\u201dMs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 73, who spent 15 years under house arrest during military rule, emerged from isolation as a hero, across Myanmar and abroad. Her party swept elections in 2015 and took office the following year. It now controls both the Parliament and the presidency.She gave herself the title of state counselor, and also named herself foreign minister. In those roles, she has become known for stubbornness and an imperious style.\u201cSuu Kyi has covered for the military, and thereby condemned the whole country to vilification, all due to her stubborn certainty that she has all the answers, when it\u2019s clear she has few answers or ideas, and almost no empathy,\u201d said David Mathieson, an independent political analyst based in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi rarely grants interviews to the news media. Her spokesman, U Zaw Htay, did not answer repeated calls from The New York Times.Her dwindling number of defenders have argued that the military\u2019s outsize power has left her with few options. But with her control of Parliament and the presidency, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi could enact legislation on a wide array of social issues that lie outside the Tatmadaw\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201cThey can enact any law they want,\u201d said Ms. Nyo Nyo Thin, the democracy advocate. \u201cOur N.L.D. Parliament can abolish old laws and enact new laws. But in only a few cases have they taken action.\u201dOne missed opportunity, Ms. Nyo Nyo Thin said, has been the failure to abolish hundreds of repressive laws left over from the days of military dictatorship or even British colonial rule \u2014 like the Official Secrets Act, which was used to prosecute the two Reuters journalists.Advocates also say Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has done little to create opportunities for women, who are largely relegated to a secondary role in the conservative country.There is only one woman in the cabinet, for example \u2014 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi herself. Women make up just 14 percent of her party\u2019s members of Parliament. The parliamentary committee that handles women\u2019s affairs is headed by a man.\u201cI\u2019m not sure she believes in gender equality,\u201d said Daw Htar Htar, founder of Akhaya Women, a women\u2019s rights group.Her critics say that there is much more she could do, even with her limited powers, to promote democracy and protect freedom of expression.The prosecution of Mr. Ngar Min Swe, for example, proceeded only after the president gave his approval, the judge, U Aung Myint, said in rendering his verdict.\u201cThat she has yet to release Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo adds to the growing evidence of her having strong authoritarian tendencies and little interest in media freedom and freedom of expression,\u201d said Mark Farmaner, director of the London-based Burma Campaign UK.When they were arrested, the journalists were reporting on a massacre of 10 Rohingya Muslims, whose mass grave they discovered. The victims were just a few of the countless Rohingya killed in the western state of Rakhine in the Tatmadaw\u2019s campaign of violence, meant to drive them across the border into Bangladesh.The Rohingya have long been denied even basic rights in Myanmar, a majority Buddhist country where most people regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, though many have been in the country for generations.Instead, the report said, officials in her government spread false narratives, denied the military had done anything wrong, oversaw the destruction of evidence and blocked independent investigations, including that of the United Nations mission itself.Also this month, the International Criminal Court said it had the authority to investigate the expulsion of the Rohingya as a crime against humanity. President Win Myint said Myanmar was not obligated to respect the ruling, since it had not signed the treaty establishing the court. But Bangladesh did sign it, and the court said the crimes had continued into that country, giving it jurisdiction.Some officials and analysts fear that Myanmar is heading toward the kind of isolation it experienced during the decades of outright military rule.\u201cThe pressure on this government is much worse than it was on the military government,\u201d said U Win Htein, a former adviser to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. He said Myanmar, so recently embraced by the West as it emerged from dictatorship, was now relying on China and Russia to shield it from potential sanctions at the United Nations Security Council.\u201cThe military government was defended by Russia and China,\u201d Mr. Win Htein said. \u201cNow the irony is that this government is protected by Russia and China.\u201dSaw Nang contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: Boon Cafe in Sydney, Australia", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAustralia FareAt Boon Cafe in the Haymarket neighborhood in Sydney, croissants come slathered in pandan custard, and congee is offered alongside a more traditional Australian cafe breakfast of baked eggs and organic bacon.But the most remarkable thing to me is the palpable feeling that Boon embodies something cracking and vital about a new generation of business owners and restaurant workers and Australians.That feeling is made explicit: Rarely have I seen a menu-as-manifesto quite so endearing as the one at Boon. \u201cWere you ever the kid at school who was too embarrassed to bring out your lunch? We were that kid,\u201d the daytime menu reads. But it also describes noticing \u201cthe kid with the sandwich that always looked enviously at our lunch.\u201d It explains that during the day, the cafe plays with Thai flavors, but at dinner the restaurant serves traditional Isaan food. \u201cYou don\u2019t mess with the original.\u201dBoon is tucked into one side of Jarern Chai, a Thai grocery store in the Haymarket neighborhood. Tables are positioned against the front window and crammed between pillars \u2014 you may well end up sitting on a stool next to a table piled with shrimp paste while shoppers bustle around you.A cafe counter against one wall displays almond croissants and brownies behind a glass partition (the best brownies I\u2019ve had in Australia), and the espresso machine is constantly in use. The staff is young and Thai and queer and straight \u2014 some speak very little English while some speak little-to-no Thai. This is an Australian cafe through the lens of modern-day downtown Sydney, which is now just as Asian as it is anything else.Jarern Chai and Boon Cafe opened together in 2015, and are part of a local chain of businesses. In 1989, Amy Chanta opened a restaurant called Chat Thai in Darlinghurst. It did not last, but Ms. Chanta opened a new location in Haymarket in 1993 that gained a loyal following as one of the first restaurants in Sydney\u2019s now-booming Thai scene to offer fresh, uncompromising, non-Westernized cooking. Today, Ms. Chanta runs 11 businesses with her family.Boon was spearheaded mainly by Palisa Anderson, Ms. Chanta\u2019s daughter, who wanted to present food that spoke to her generation. On Boon\u2019s daytime menu, the spicy Thai herbs and pork sausage come mixed into a plate of fusilli, and you can get your nahm prik makua \u2014 the spicy eggplant relish from northern Thailand \u2014 over brown rice or as a sourdough sandwich. This isn\u2019t fusion as much as it is the food of two fused cultures, one in which second- and third-generation Asian-Australian kids operate comfortably.At night, the menu turns more exclusively toward Isaan, the region in northeastern Thailand that heavily relies on fermentation and chiles. With the move to more traditional cooking, nothing is dumbed down or purposefully altered for Western tastes \u2014 quite the opposite. There\u2019s something punk rock about this daytime playfulness matched with an evening menu that pulls zero punches. Many Thai-Australians revel in the uncompromising heat and aroma of the food of their heritage, and there is no lack of either at Boon.Dinner is sprawling enough to be overwhelming, and best suits large groups willing to share. In the \u201cgrilled and fried\u201d section, you can find skewers of chicken gizzards and sai ouah, the pungent, meaty, fiery pork sausage. There\u2019s a large selection of larbs and other warm salads, and nine variants of spicy green papaya salad.I\u2019ve eaten so much at Boon, over so many visits, and not yet scratched the surface of what\u2019s available. Certain dishes stick out in my memory: the padt mee kha-ti, stir-fried thin rice noodles with tofu, omelet, tamarind and coconut milk, the combination of which is mild and sweet on the palate and has the side effect of turning the noodles bright pink.There was a whole fish doused in a flurry of chiles that I\u2019m tempted to reorder every time I go. But the dish that haunts me is the green mango salad with pickled field crabs and fermented fish, which my waitress warned me about repeatedly, stressing that it might be too spicy. And it was spicy, enough to send me into one of those sweaty trances, but also bracingly sour, delicately tropical and with a funk so alluring as to be primal. It is a study in extremes and balance and beauty.The retail side of the business has all the design sense of an upscale deli, with all the hidden-treasure clutter of the best Asian grocery stores. Most notable is the refrigerated room off to one side, which holds all manner of common and uncommon fruit and vegetables. Most come from the family\u2019s organic farm, in northern New South Wales near Byron Bay.The farm was originally planned so the family could grow ingredients that were hard to find, especially as their restaurants proliferated: holy red basil for a certain stir-fry; apple eggplant for curries. In the five years since Boon Luck Farm began operation, it has become a much larger project, managed primarily by Ms. Anderson, who grows specialty produce for her family\u2019s businesses and other chefs and restaurants. On a recent afternoon in Jarern Chai\u2019s cold room, there were bundles of chive flowers, piles of galangal, knobby bitter \u201csmall bird\u201d melons, tiny eggplant and boxes overflowing with red oak lettuce.Boon Cafe is a restaurant, a cafe and part of a grocery store, but also so much more. It is the meeting of two worlds, a middle ground that many young Australians inhabit. It is the physical embodiment of a generation of people claiming their space, which is Asian and Australian, queer and straight, as casual as can be but home to dead-serious food.That Boon is so very much fun while embodying all of these things is a testament to the value of letting people tell their own stories \u2014 in this case, through food, and a space so personal and specific and inclusive it feels revolutionary.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of Boon Cafe\u2019s family farm. It is Boon Luck Farm, not Boon Farm. The article also described incorrectly Boon Cafe\u2019s reservation policy. The restaurant does accept reservations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tito Capobianco, Assertive Opera Director, Is Dead at 87", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTito Capobianco, who created groundbreaking productions at the New York City Opera in the 1960s and \u201970s, including a rare staging of Handel\u2019s \u201cGiulio Cesare\u201d that made Beverly Sills a star, and went on to became a strong-willed general director at the Pittsburgh Opera, died on Saturday at his home in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla. He was 87.Mr. Capobianco brought a diverse background to his work in opera: He was an aspiring young baritone in his native Argentina, an actor on stage and screen, and briefly a student of ballet. His best productions combined singing, acting, movement and scenic designs into finely integrated stagings.The opera, which starred a little-known 25-year-old tenor named Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, called for a large cast, an enormous chorus, brassy pageantry and psychological drama. A critic for Opera News called the production a \u201ctriumph\u201d and said \u201cits unity and discipline made one think of Bayreuth,\u201d the prestigious Wagner festival in Germany.He pushed singers out of their vocal comfort zones to explore how their psyches could bring new dimension to characters, especially familiar roles. And, more than most directors, he coaxed balletic movements from his singers, aided by his wife, a choreographer whose professional name was Elena Denda. She became Mr. Capobianco\u2019s unofficial assistant and, he wrote in his 2017 autobiography, \u201cTito\u2019s Way,\u201d his \u201cbest critic.\u201d\u201cEverything was different from opera as normally encountered,\u201d Mr. Schonberg said. \u201cInstead of plot, there was, in effect, a series of tableaux. Instead of acting, there was a curiously stylized type of balletic movement from each of the singers.\u201d By the time the first act was over, he wrote. \u201cwaves of love were washing out from the audience to the stage.\u201dMs. Sills\u2019s brilliant singing, charisma and savvy acting brought her worldwide acclaim.Tito Capobianco was born in La Plata, Argentina, on Aug. 28, 1931. His parents had moved to Argentina from Italy in the late 1920s. His father played trumpet in the local band.Tito attended a bilingual Italian and Spanish school and became an apprentice in the chorus of the Teatro Argentino de La Plata. At 16, already six feet tall, he appeared as a cardinal in a production of \u201cTosca.\u201d He studied law and philosophy as well as singing before his focus turned to directing, starting with productions at the Teatro Argentino.In 1961, Mr. Capobianco was appointed artistic director of the Cincinnati Opera Festival. The next year he was named to the same post at the Cincinnati Opera, which he held for three years.At City Opera, he also mounted productions of Boito\u2019s \u201cMefistofele,\u201d starring Mr. Treigle as a malevolent devil, in 1969, and Donizetti\u2019s Tudor Trilogy (\u201cAnna Bolena,\u201d \u201cMaria Stuarda\u201d and \u201cRoberto Devereux\u201d), staged for and starring Ms. Sills, in the early 1970s.Mr. Capobianco made his Met debut in 1978, with a new production of Massenet\u2019s \u201cTha\u00efs,\u201d starring Ms. Sills and the baritone Sherrill Milnes. His only other work at the Met was a 1984 production (borrowed from the Lyric Opera of Chicago and restaged for the Met) of Verdi\u2019s \u201cSimon Boccanegra,\u201d featuring Mr. Milnes in the title role.He became artistic director of San Diego Opera in 1975 and its general director two years later. His 17-year tenure with the Pittsburgh Opera, all but the last two as general director, began in 1983.His achievements there included founding a program for young artists, moving the company from Heinz Hall to the more commodious stage of the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts, and establishing the Pittsburgh Opera Orchestra, freeing the company from its previous reliance on the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.He brought his authoritarian manner to the task of fund-raising. \u201cI was becoming dangerous,\u201d he joked in 2000. When patrons saw him coming, he said, \u201cThey\u2019d cross the street.\u201d But budgetary restraints forced him to winnow his annual seasons from six to four productions, and to skewer offerings toward more traditional fare.Mr. Capobianco also taught acting and interpretation at several institutions, including Indiana University, the Juilliard School and, starting in 1983, the Yale School of Music.

And in 2015, the Civil Code was changed to allow people who have undergone gender reassignment to register under their new gender. A rule making that change a legal reality is now being drafted.\u201cVietnam is not behind other countries on this issue,\u201d said Ngo Duc Thinh, an expert on len dong, a Vietnamese shamanic dance tradition that has traditionally featured many gay performers. \u201cL.G.B.T. people have the right to be happy \u2014 that\u2019s a human right.\u201dLuong Minh Ngoc, the director of iSEE, a Vietnamese research outfit that advocates human rights, said that while legislative progress has been slow and the government often prioritizes other issues, she has found officials in the Justice Department and Health Ministry who are genuinely interested in improving laws that affect the gay community.\u201cWe think the support is there,\u201d she said, adding that gay rights issues are generally viewed in Vietnam within a moral context, rather than a political one.That is notable because Vietnam is an authoritarian state, where hundreds of political dissidents have been jailed in recent years and the ruling Communist Party does not allow nonprofits or the news media to operate independently.Michael DiGregorio, the Vietnam country representative for the Asia Foundation, said that gay rights issues were an \u201ceasy win\u201d for the government, and a natural fit for international donors who saw them as an important civil rights issue in the country.But Mr. DiGregorio said recent changes to legislation on gender, marriage and families had only been possible because they reflected a \u201clive and let live\u201d attitude toward gay rights that is widespread among many Vietnamese. He attributed the tolerance partly to local religious and spiritual practices that focus on ancestor worship \u2014 not a powerful God who decides what is right or wrong \u2014 and also to a Communist ideology that has never tackled what he called the \u201creligious mantles of morality.\u201dIn the trailer for the Vietnamese edition of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d the contestant Minh Thu walks offstage with her female castmate Truc Nhu after telling the show\u2019s eligible single man, Nguyen Quoc Trung, that she wasn\u2019t interested in him.

{"Headline": "What Do We Actually Know About the Economy? (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMacroeconomics is better than you think, microeconomics worse, and data are limitedOpinion ColumnistIn a couple of days I\u2019m giving a luncheon talk to the New York chapter of the National Association of Business Economists, and the title of this essay was the title I provided for the talk. To be honest, it was a bit of a dummy title, and I wasn\u2019t at all sure what I would actually say; but I\u2019ve been spending some time trying to pin things down, and found myself wanting to put it together in a little essay. So here are some meta reflections on economic knowledge, inspired in part but not entirely by the financial crisis and its aftermath.Now, obviously the crisis has inspired both soul-searching among economists and a lot of outside criticism. But I\u2019d argue that most of both the internal soul-searching and the outsider criticism is off-base.Among macroeconomists, the self-criticism seems to me to be mainly too narrow: people berate themselves for, say, not giving financial markets a bigger role in their models, but few have done what they should, which is to question the whole direction macroeconomics has gone these past four decades or so.Among economists more generally, a lot of the criticism seems to amount to the view that macroeconomics is bunk, and that we should stick to microeconomics, which is the real, solid stuff. As I\u2019ll explain in a moment, that\u2019s all wrong. In fact, in an important sense the past decade has been a huge validation for textbook macroeconomics; meanwhile, the exaltation of micro as the only \u201creal\u201d economics both gives microeconomics too much credit and is largely responsible for the ways macroeconomic theory has gone wrong.Finally, many outsiders and some insiders have concluded from the crisis that economic theory in general is bunk, that we should take guidance from people immersed in the real world \u2013 say, business leaders \u2014 and/or concentrate on empirical results and skip the models. In reality, however, advice from business leaders has generally been worse than useless this past decade, while the voices in the air heard by madmen in authority have, as usual, given very bad advice. And while empirical evidence is important and we need more of it, the data almost never speak for themselves \u2013 a point amply illustrated by recent monetary events.So let me talk about three things:The unsung success of macroeconomicsThe excessive prestige of microeconomicsThe limits of empiricism, vital though it isThe clean little secret of macroeconomicsThere\u2019s a story about quantum physics \u2013 not sure where I read it \u2013 about the rivalry between the physicists Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman. Schwinger was first to work out how to do quantum electrodynamics, but his methods were incredibly difficult and cumbersome. Feynman hit upon a much simpler approach \u2013 his famous diagrams \u2013 which turned out to be equivalent, but vastly easier to use.Schwinger, as I remember the story, was never seen to use a Feynman diagram. But he had a locked room in his house, and the rumor was that that room was where he kept the Feynman diagrams he used in secret.Now, the thing about IS-LM-type analysis is that using it isn\u2019t that big a deal in normal times, but it makes some very strong predictions \u2013 predictions very much at odds with many peoples\u2019 priors \u2014 about abnormal times. Specifically, this kind of analysis says that when there is a really big adverse shock to demand \u2013 say, from the collapse of a major housing bubble \u2013 there\u2019s a regime change, and neither monetary nor fiscal policy have the same effects they do in normal times.What about fiscal policy? Traditional macro said that at the zero lower bound there would be no crowding out \u2013 that deficits wouldn\u2019t drive up interest rates, and that fiscal multipliers would be larger than under normal conditions. The first of these predictions was obviously borne out, as rates stayed low even when deficits were very large. The second prediction is a bit harder to test, for reasons I\u2019ll get into when I talk about the limits of empiricism. But the evidence does indeed suggest large positive multipliers.The overall story, then, is one of overwhelming predictive success. Basic, old-fashioned macroeconomics didn\u2019t fail in the crisis \u2013 it worked extremely well. In fact, it\u2019s hard to think of any other example of economic models working this well \u2013 making predictions that most non-economists (and some economists) refused to believe, indeed found implausible, but which came true. Where, for example, can you find any comparable successes in microeconomics?But, you say, we didn\u2019t see the Great Recession coming. Well, what do you mean \u201cwe,\u201d white man? OK, what\u2019s true is that few economists realized that there was a huge housing bubble. But that\u2019s not a failure of fundamental models: the models certainly would have predicted that a bursting bubble that slashed residential investment by 4 percent of GDP and destroyed $7 trillion in homeowners\u2019 equity would cause a severe recession. What happened was that economists refused to believe that home prices could be that out of touch with reality.That\u2019s not exactly a problem with macroeconomics; to some extent it\u2019s a problem with financial economics, but mainly I think it reflected the general unwillingness of human beings (a category that includes many though not necessarily all economists) to believe that so many people can be so wrong about something so big.The bottom line: the past decade has been a vindication, not a refutation, of good old-fashioned macro. Which brings me to the flip side: microeconomics is not as great as advertised.The dirty little secret of microeconomicsI spent much of my academic, pre-public intellectual career straddling two surprisingly distinct economics sub-fields. To normal human beings the study of international trade and that of international macroeconomics might sound like pretty much the same thing. In reality, however, the two fields used very different models, had very different intellectual cultures, and tended to look down on each other. Trade people tended to consider international macro people semi-charlatans, doing ad hoc stuff devoid of rigor. International macro people considered trade people boring, obsessed with proving theorems and offering little of real-world use.Both sides were, of course, right.Anyway, I think it\u2019s fair to say that over the past few decades the economics profession has tended to take the micro side of this debate. Microeconomic theory, grounded in rigorous derivation of individual behavior from utility maximization, was taken as the gold standard. Old-fashioned macroeconomics, based on loose psychological propositions like the marginal propensity to consume, and often describing aggregate relationships without explicitly describing what individuals were doing, was considered dubious and uncouth.Indeed, macroeconomists were sufficiently hurt by the sneers of microeconomists that they spent several decades trying to make their field as much like micro as they could.But does microeconomics really deserve its reputation of moral and intellectual superiority? No.Even before the rise of behavioral economics, any halfway self-aware economist realized that utility maximization \u2013 indeed, the very concept of utility \u2014 wasn\u2019t a fact about the world; it was more of a thought experiment, whose conclusions should always have been stated in the subjunctive.Yes, we believe that people tend to act in their self-interest and don\u2019t usually pass up obvious opportunities to make themselves better off. So it made sense to follow that line of thought to its end point. What if we imagined individuals who knew what they wanted and pursued the optimal strategy, given the constraints they faced, to achieve as much of those goals as possible? If that were the case, what would that predict about behavior?It\u2019s an interesting and sometimes illuminating exercise. But it\u2019s not proof that the world actually works that way. And the truth is that it often doesn\u2019t. Kahneman and Tversky and Thaler and so on deserved all the honors they received for helping to document the specific ways in which utility maximization falls short, but even before their work we should never have expected perfect maximization to be a good description of reality.True, a model doesn\u2019t have to be perfect to provide hugely important insights. But here\u2019s my question: where are the examples of microeconomic theory providing strong, counterintuitive, successful predictions on the same order as the success of IS-LM macroeconomics after 2008? Maybe there are some, but I can\u2019t come up with any.The point is not that micro theory is useless and we should stop doing it. But it doesn\u2019t deserve to be seen as superior to macro modeling.And the effort to make macro more and more like micro \u2013 to ground everything in rational behavior \u2013 has to be seen now as destructive. True, that effort did lead to some strong predictions: e.g., only unanticipated money should affect real output, transitory income changes shouldn\u2019t affect consumer spending, government spending should crowd out private demand, etc. But all of those predictions have turned out to be wrong.What data can and can\u2019t tell usData are good (they are also, as far as I\u2019m concerned, plural, although this is looking like a losing battle.) Some of my best friends are data. The growing focus of economists on empirical evidence is very much a good thing.But data never speak for themselves, for a couple of reasons. One, which is familiar, is that economists don\u2019t get to do many experiments, and natural experiments are rare: the vast bulk of the data we see reflect the confounding effects of variables we aren\u2019t interested in, and reverse causation on the variables we are trying to assess.The other problem is that even when we do get something like natural experiments, they often took place under economic regimes that aren\u2019t relevant to current problems.Both of these problems were extremely relevant in the years following the 2008 crisis.Start with the effects of monetary expansion. History actually provides us with many examples of countries that rapidly expanded their money supplies, and the great majority of these examples look like, say, Brazil in the 80s and 90s:That is, you might be tempted to conclude that the empirical evidence is that monetary expansion is inflationary, indeed roughly one-for-one.But you needed a model, something like IS-LM-with-Tobin, to tell you which examples were relevant. The data didn\u2019t speak for themselves.What about fiscal policy? The raw correlation between budget deficits and real output is negative, not positive, but everyone knows that this is because most of the causation runs from GDP to the budget, not the other way around.So you wanted to look for examples of major shifts in fiscal policy that didn\u2019t reflect automatic stabilizers. For the U.S. that mainly meant wars; across a broader set of countries, you could look at the effects of austerity programs. Both these sources of sort-of natural experiments suggested a positive multiplier, but less than one, i.e., private-sector crowding out or in.I would also note that because assessing fiscal policy changes can be subject to a serious error-in-variables problem, you really want to look at extreme changes. This means, in particular, that when we\u2019re talking about austerity policies you want to look at the period 2009-2012, the post-Greece panic; everything after that is relatively small changes at the edges, subject to so much measurement error that you wouldn\u2019t expect to find clear results.The point is that empirical evidence can only do certain things. It can certainly prove that your theory is wrong! And it can also make a theory much more persuasive in those cases where the theory makes surprising predictions, which the data bear out. But the data can never absolve you from the necessity of having theories.So what do we know about the economy?Over this past decade, I\u2019ve watched a number of economists try to argue from authority: I am a famous professor, therefore you should believe what I say. This never ends well. I\u2019ve also seen a lot of nihilism: economists don\u2019t know anything, and we should tear the field down and start over.Obviously I differ with both views. Economists haven\u2019t earned the right to be snooty and superior, especially if their reputation comes from the ability to do hard math: hard math has been remarkably little help lately, if ever.On the other hand, economists do turn out to know quite a lot: they do have some extremely useful models, usually pretty simple ones, that have stood up well in the face of evidence and events. And they definitely shouldn\u2019t defer to important and/or rich people on policy: compare Janet Yellen\u2019s macroeconomic track record with that of the multiple billionaires who warned that Bernanke would debase the dollar. Or take my favorite Business Week headline from 2010: \u201cKrugman or [John] Paulson: Who You Gonna Bet On?\u201d Um.The important thing is to be aware of what we do know, and why.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Never Heard of Bolivian Wine? That May Be About to Change", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cYou could say, in a way, Bolivia won the contest,\u201d said Mr. van Casteren, who is a Master of Wine, the wine-world equivalent of a Ph.D. \u201cI wanted to prove that the best Bolivian wines can compete with the best of the world.\u201dMr. van Casteren had a horse in this race: For the past eight years, he has been a consultant for the Dutch government, helping Bolivian winemakers improve their products for export.That is changing. Exports are trickling into the United States, Brazil, Europe and China, mostly in restaurants. \u201cI think there will be much more interest in Bolivian wines in the next six to 12 months,\u201d Mr. van Casteren said.When he started to consult here, none of the country\u2019s 65 wineries exported bottles. Now, five do.Still, their reach is limited. Bolivia\u2019s vineyards total only about 1.5 percent of the 550,000 acres in neighboring Argentina \u2014 the world\u2019s sixth-largest wine producer \u2014 and Bolivia\u2019s annual production of 8.3 million liters is a molecule among the world\u2019s 25 billion liters.One doesn\u2019t usually find poverty and high-quality wines in the same place. Yet although it is one of the poorest countries in South America, Bolivia has a long tradition of winemaking, so the quality of its wines is surprisingly good. While the terrain offers its own challenges, from jungle to mountains, it also has benefits.200 milesBrazilPeruBoliviaLa PazSamaipataValle de los CintisTarijaParaguayChileArgentinaBy The New York TimesDaily temperatures can swing more than 35 degrees, which concentrates acidity, and summer rains dilute the wine, yielding a more elegant style, one \u201cmore associated with cool climates of the Old World,\u201d Mr. Roig said.No calling-card varietal has emerged. Muscat of Alexandria, a white grape, accounts for 70 percent of grapes planted in Bolivia, but most is used to distill the pisco-like spirit singani. Though the Spanish arrived with grapes in the 16th century, the modern industry is only 50 years old, so winemakers are still exploring different grape varieties.Many vineyards are banking on tannat to give Bolivia a special international identity, as did the wine that finished second in Mr. van Casteren\u2019s tasting, by the third-generation winemaker Nelson Sfarcich of Campos de Solana.There are also pockets of grape varietals that were originally brought from the Canary Islands by the Spanish, like torront\u00e9s and pedro gim\u00e9nez in whites and negra criolla in reds. Vicchoque\u00f1a is a mutant of negra criolla that yields a wine akin to pinot noir.The Valle de los Cintis, north of Tarija, is the spiritual home of small-scale traditional winemaking. There are still about 30 vineyards with parrales, or climbing vines, some 100 to 250 years old, that grow entangled with moelle and cha\u00f1ar trees. The Spanish used this system to protect the grapes from sun and diseases; it has disappeared everywhere else in the world, Mr. van Casteren said.At Cepas de Fuego, Weymar R\u00edos Cavero, who is in his mid-70s, still makes wine much the way his father and grandfather did, hand-blending fertilizer and mixing a natural spray for diseases. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve done is to put in trellises and search for grapes best adapted to here,\u201d he said. His syrah is a standout, Mr. Tottenborg said.Amane Hagiwara, 31, who grew up in Japan and North Africa and trained in France, discovered the valley while traveling and has made it his home for three years. Drawn by the terroir and tradition, he ferments old-vine moscatel de Alejandria and negra criolla in locally made clay amphoras for his label, Los Bauguales.\u201cWhat we have to do,\u201d he said, is to be true to the local terroir \u201cand not copy winemaking from elsewhere. Make it how you feel it, with your tradition, with your history; then you can transmit something real.\u201dNortheast of Valle de los Cintis, the valleys of Santa Cruz and Samaipata demonstrate the potential for growth. When Mr. Roig established his winery in this region in 2007, there were just 100 acres planted. Now there are more than 1,200. Bolivia has up to 20 times more land suitable for grape cultivation than it uses.Mr. Roig, who left Bolivia when he was 17 and now lives in Washington, D.C., is focused on exports to Europe and the United States. That the wine \u201cis recognized by people abroad brings up self-awareness and pride\u201d for Bolivians, he said.Mr. Escobar cited a study showing that for every 25 acres of grapes planted, 10 families are lifted out of poverty. \u201cOur ambitions are very big for Bolivian wine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think it can be the next region, like Georgia.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britons Pay Hundreds for H.I.V. Drugs. Why Do Americans Pay Thousands? ", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesLast week, the High Court of England and Wales announced a momentous decision: It invalidated the pharmaceutical company Gilead\u2019s patent on Truvada, opening the way to generic competition.Truvada, a combination of two drugs, is one of the world\u2019s most-used H.I.V. medicines. For treating H.I.V., it\u2019s used along with a third drug. But many H.I.V.-negative people also take Truvada daily as a preventive. That\u2019s called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.In the United States, Truvada is available only as a brand-name drug. It costs $20,000 a year.Here\u2019s how it will work in Britain\u2019s National Health Service, according to Dr. Andrew Hill, a senior research fellow at Liverpool University who studies the cost of medicines. \u201cThe N.H.S. will say to a group of generic companies: \u2018We need PrEP for 20,000 people. Give us your best price.\u2019\u201d The cost of making PrEP is $55 per year, Dr. Hill said. He believes that the generic will sell for between $100 and $200.All over the world, more and more people are taking H.I.V. drugs. These medicines are very good at their job \u2014 keeping people healthy and noncontagious \u2014 so most patients will take them until they die of something that isn\u2019t H.I.V. Patients are also starting earlier on antiretroviral therapy; the new recommendation is to start immediately upon diagnosis. And now with PrEP, a potentially enormous new group of patients has arisen: H.I.V.-negative people who are at risk for catching the virus.The National Health Service has to treat this soaring population for the same amount or less money each year. England\u2019s region of the health service spends about half a billion dollars per year on H.I.V. drugs. There are no increases for inflation, and lots of pressures for further cuts.It\u2019s lucky, then, that Truvada will have generic competition. It should allow the health service to greatly lower costs and offer PrEP to anyone who needs it.The health service does an admirable job with H.I.V. Around the world, countries measure the percentage of people living with H.I.V. who have no virus detectable in their blood. In the United States, only 49 percent have achieved this. In Britain, the number is 78 percent.While the National Health Service has a lot of problems, it has some huge advantages over the American system that allow it to provide high-quality H.I.V. care in a cost-efficient manner.So it\u2019s worth looking at what the British health service does right, because some of those strategies could work in America, even though the two systems are structured very differently.Even when brand-name drugs have no generic equivalents, the medicines in the British system cost a small fraction of what they cost in America. Most brand-name triple therapies cost about $6,500, said Dr. Laura Waters, an H.I.V. physician who is a member of the health service\u2019s H.I.V. Clinical Reference Group, which sets policy. She said that a combination pill that includes some generics would cost between $2,600 and $4,000. Full generics usually cost 70 to 80 percent less than comparable brand names. One completely generic H.I.V. regimen costs $400 per year.The National Health Service has long relied on generics to treat most diseases. But that wasn\u2019t the case with H.I.V. Once effective drugs were developed, the field moved so fast that by the time a drug went off patent, it was no longer commonly prescribed.But that\u2019s not true anymore.The first H.I.V. therapies, in 1995, were lifesaving \u2014 and toxic, with horrible side effects. Some of them required patients to take 20 pills a day.Now patients around the world take one or two pills a day. All the regimens do well at controlling the virus. They all have some side effects for some people, but patients can switch to find a regimen they can tolerate well. What used to be a big leap forward with each new drug is now a tiny step \u2014 or an advance for only a subset of patients. So older drugs are still in use. Truvada is one example.Three years ago, the National Health Service\u2019s push for generics started to cover H.I.V. drugs. Dr. Waters estimated that at the time, fewer than 5 percent of H.I.V. patients were taking a generic. Now, she said, the number is more like 30 percent.The clinical reference group recommended several specific switches, for example, moving patients off Atripla and onto Truvada plus generic efavirenz \u2014 the exact ingredients of Atripla. The only change is an extra pill each day. In other cases, similar (but not identical) drugs that were cheaper were substituted. Dr. Waters said that a switch always had to be clinically appropriate, and the result of a discussion between doctor and patient. Patients who have clinical reasons to take expensive meds can still do so, she said.For example, a patient with a history of depression or someone who works a night shift won\u2019t be started on efavirenz, which has been associated with an increase in suicidal thoughts and with sleep problems.An even larger source of cost saving is that the health service does not rush to a newer drug when it is approved, as the American system does. Take efavirenz \u2014 a first-line drug for 15 years. Many people still take it successfully.It\u2019s worth repeating that the problem with efavirenz isn\u2019t effectiveness. It\u2019s as good as, or better than, dolutegravir at controlling H.I.V. It even works pretty well when people miss doses.He said that patients are monitored closely. \u201cYou only have to say you\u2019re not sleeping well, and you should be switched,\u201d he said.Dr. Hill said that for every person who starts on efavirenz instead of dolutegravir, the National Health Service saves $5,227 each year.The health service does pressure doctors to prescribe generics. Dr. Hill said doctors are expected to meet targets. \u201cYou should be using at least a certain percentage of generics,\u201d he said, and doctors might have to justify their choices. \u201cIf you use a more expensive drug, you have to explain why you\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said.There\u2019s also modest pressure on the patient to use a cheaper regimen. For many patients, that means taking an extra pill each day.\u201cFor most people whose lives are pretty well organized, if they\u2019re together enough to take one pill a day, they\u2019re together enough to take two \u2014 as long as they can take them at the same time,\u201d said Mr. Collins. \u201cThey\u2019re taking two pills to save the N.H.S. 500 pounds a month. The inconvenience is so minimal that most people say, \u2018I can deal with that.\u2019\u201d\u201cAs long as it\u2019s discussed and explained well, the patient population is incredibly amenable to doing things to help the N.H.S.,\u201d Dr. Waters said, adding that patients who want to stick to a single tablet are allowed to do so. \u201cBut as we go forward, the N.H.S. is going to be less accepting of a \u2018no,\u2019 and put more restrictions on the single tablet.\u201dH.I.V. treatment is about much more than drugs. It also requires lab tests, doctor visits and help from social workers, nutritionists and peer counselors. Unfortunately, any money saved on drugs goes back into the health service\u2019s general kitty \u2014 not to other fronts in the fight against H.I.V.If America were to use more generics, much of the savings would stay with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers. That doesn\u2019t help people with H.I.V. \u201cThe resources saved can and should finance a more aggressive effort to fight AIDS in America,\u201d said Anil Soni, head of global infectious diseases for Mylan.Could it happen with Medicare or Medicaid? Just a few states \u2014 New York, Georgia, Florida, California and Maryland \u2014 are responsible for a large share of Medicaid\u2019s spending on H.I.V. drugs. They could lead a drive toward using more generic drugs. These drugs are already available, but doctors don\u2019t prescribe them. Like the National Health Service, Medicaid would have to find ways to encourage (or cajole, entice or force) doctors to prescribe generics. If the generics were more widely used, that would encourage competition that could further drop the price.\u201cIf the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and a few state Medicaid directors committed to make this happen, and if they worked with the H.I.V. community to use the savings to finance an aggressive push to end AIDS in America, then it\u2019s possible,\u201d Mr. Soni said.Every day, America pays for H.I.V. drugs at higher and higher prices, for more and more people. There is no choice but to reform an unsustainable system.\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why American payers don\u2019t look up reference prices,\u201d Dr. Hill said. \u201cIt\u2019s $150 in England, so why are they spending $10,000? Surely they don\u2019t have unlimited budgets in the U.S. But they behave as if they do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chronicling the Virtuosity and Struggles of 1970s Soul and Funk Musicians", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRace StoriesBruce W. Talamon photographed some of music\u2019s brightest stars for a decade. He considers himself \u201ca visual caretaker of black folks\u2019 history.\u201dThe photograph is as unusual as it is illuminating: a close-up of the bassist Louis Johnson\u2019s cut and blistered thumb after playing a concert. Taken in 1977 at Funk Fest in Los Angeles by Bruce W. Talamon, the image reminds us that there is more to the music business than glamour. It was a world driven by hard work, sacrifice and relentless ambition \u2014 one that Mr. Talamon came to know well as one of the pre-eminent chroniclers of R&B, soul and funk musicians in the 1970s.The images depict musicians onstage and off, in performance, greeting fans, in quiet reflective moments and living their lives: an exhausted Al Green, slumped against the door of his dressing room after a grueling performance; Aretha Franklin, her hand thrust gracefully into the air, white feathers cradling her radiant face, singing on a television special; Bootsy Collins, in typically outrageous costume, performing at the Forum in Inglewood, Calif.; Stevie Wonder having a late night at Roscoe\u2019s House of Chicken \u2019n Waffles in Hollywood; and Patti LaBelle, relaxing in a sleek conference room at CBS Records after a long day of interviews.Mr. Talamon, who majored in political science at Whittier College and intended to become a lawyer, began photographing musicians in 1971 on a whim and with no formal training. A chance encounter with Howard L. Bingham, the respected photographer and biographer of Muhammad Ali, led to a life-changing mentorship and an introduction to the publication that launched his career: Soul, a pioneering black-owned newspaper published in Los Angeles from 1966 to 1982.Founded by Regina and Ken Jones, Soul published interviews, articles and photographs about black entertainers. By 1972, Ms. Jones had become editor in chief, overseeing all aspects of the biweekly paper\u2019s production, which included the hiring of young writers and photographers like Mr. Talamon. His intimate and humanistic images typified Soul\u2019s sensibility, an important outlet for black artistic expression during a period when the mainstream media was not always paying attention.Ultimately, the magazine\u2019s linking of sound to image and biography transformed coverage of African-American musicians. Mr. Talamon\u2019s work for Soul, which he says gave him confidence and a platform to hone his craft, made an important contribution to its visual ethos, providing readers with a vivid window into the lives of people they respected and idolized. His well-regarded work for the magazine led to other projects and commissions, including assignments from individual artists and record companies.\u201cI\u2019ve always thought of my photographs as documents that went beyond screaming into a microphone,\u201d Mr. Talamon wrote in his foreword. \u201cMy body of work has been about the whole unvarnished process, as opposed to just that portion that publicity machines and record companies want you to see.\u201dIn the 1980s, as the music business changed and record companies started issuing work-for-hire agreements for photographers, Mr. Talamon turned his attention to other pursuits, including stills for John Singleton, Tony Scott, Steven Spielberg and other filmmakers. Yet the extraordinary archive of music imagery he left behind continues to expand our understanding of black entertainers and the significant role they played in popular culture.\u201cThese photographs are a celebration of the music, an aesthetic, a style that\u2019s gone,\u201d Mr. Talamon said. \u201cBut for that moment, it was magical. I would like to think that maybe I caught a little bit of that magic and was able to leave a record of what these musicians did and how good they were.\u201dRace Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger.

The name is demure; the scene, not so much \u2014 at least not once they pass the parking lot, the man checking tickets at the front gate and the dim corridor at whose far end blazes a rectangle of bronze sand and sea.Hijabs are unwound from heads, veils tugged from faces. Jeans and abayas evaporate, divulging string bikinis, tankinis and swim shorts. Under spindly cabanas by azure waves, two women lie chest down on lounge chairs, their bare backs implying bare fronts. All around them, gallons of tanning oil glisten on acres of copper skin.When a man on a Jet Ski buzzes past, a female lifeguard warns him off with a staccato of whistle blasts.\u201cMen,\u201d said Nada, a school bus supervisor from Beirut who was treading the Mediterranean just offshore, \u201care suffocating.\u201dIn Lebanon, a sliver of a country on the Mediterranean coast where summer sticks to your skin like moist Saran wrap, the beach is less a luxury than a utility. It is hard to imagine going without.Public and pay-by-the-day beaches line the coast from Tyre in the south to Tripoli in the north, and every other billboard on the highways out of Beirut seems to display a bikini model promoting a tanning aid. (S.P.F., evidently, is not in style.)But many observant Muslim women consider it \u201charam\u201d \u2014 forbidden \u2014 to expose their bodies in front of men who are not their husbands or, in some cases, close relatives. Other women may cover themselves in deference to conservative families and communities.For them, a mixed-gender beach is to be avoided; those who go with their families roast in the sun fully clothed in hijabs and long-sleeved shirts and pants or abayas, the full-length caftans popular among devout Lebanese Muslim women.Hence the emergence of ladies\u2019 beaches like this one, the Bellevue Beach Club in the seaside town of Jiyeh \u2014 a salt-tinged hiatus from the male gaze for $18 a day, just 20 minutes down a trash-perfumed highway from Beirut.It is a dedicated patch of sand for conservative women amid the cultural m\u00e9lange of Lebanon, which, with its 18 recognized religious sects and vigorous all-night party scene, tends to be more socially liberal than other Arab countries.At the Bellevue, there seemed to be as many different degrees of scanty cladding as there were women. For some women, religious scruples argued for more coverage. For others, style considerations, and the heat, argued for less. Each woman had made her own peace with the proportions.\u201cHere, I\u2019m free to be me,\u201d said Rabab Amhaz, 35, a housewife from the inland Bekaa Valley. She gestured to her tankini, bright with a teal floral pattern, and shimmied in the water.Seeking a second opinion on her beach visit, she had consulted her brother, a Hezbollah fighter. He had not only given her his blessing but shown her a YouTube video of a Muslim cleric explaining that swimwear was acceptable among women, so long as the women covered their lower bodies.Nada, who began wearing the veil when she married at age 14, dismissed this assessment: You could find a cleric to say anything you wanted, she said.Following her own strong conviction that all the skin on display around her was forbidden \u2014 who knew who might be watching from one of the boats that periodically splashed by, or from behind the walls of the resort? \u2014 she had looked at herself in the mirror that morning and changed into a more modest bottom. She also declined to reveal her last name to a reporter, preferring to avoid the prospect of disapproval at home.MediterraneanSeaTripoliLEBANONBEKAABeirutJiyehTyreSYRIAGOLANHEIGHTSISRAEL25 MilesBy The New York TimesBut a swimsuit was a swimsuit \u2014 in this case, a black-and-white patterned swim tank with black shorts.\u201cWhen you see me on Facebook, I look completely different,\u201d she said, her hair loose and ropy in the water. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t recognize me.\u201dAfter next year, when she planned to make the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that every Muslim who can afford it is supposed to undertake at least once, she said she would avoid even the ladies\u2019 beach; she, like many women who have completed the hajj, would adopt more modest attire.And she frowned on the women who had brought their young sons, who are allowed up to age 8 on the beach. She did not want her sons or grandsons to get used to seeing women\u2019s bodies.But still. \u201cI love to swim,\u201d she said, smiling and shrugging, \u201cso I have no other choice.\u201dNada and Ms. Amhaz agreed on one point: absolutely no beach selfies, not even to share with their husbands.\u201cNo, no!\u201d they exclaimed, high-fiving.\u201cMy husband doesn\u2019t need pictures,\u201d Ms. Amhaz said. \u201cHe sees everything anyway.\u201dCameras are banned, the better to protect the beachgoers\u2019 modesty and privacy, though cellphones are not. But visits to several other Lebanese resorts, undertaken purely for journalistic purposes, suggested few other differences between women-only beaches and mixed ones beyond the obvious.No matter the setting, gossip and hookah pipes scent the air. Snacks, water and shade are at a premium. People-watching is frequently rewarding.Several ladies\u2019 beaches fringe the coastline south of Beirut, their names redolent of sandy glamour around the world (the Laguna; the Bondi). The Bellevue Beach Club began offering women-only days in the mid-1990s after veiled women began asking for privacy.Business was good \u2014 better than on mixed days, even. It soon went all women, all the time.A man collects tickets, but no other males are allowed. Women staff the restrooms and the pool. The staff includes the Australian and Filipino wives of the brothers who run the Bellevue, who go to mixed beaches together.There is a female D.J. for the thatch-roofed poolside cabana where beachgoers undulate, hips exuberantly swaying, to the Egyptian singer Sherine Abdel Wahab and the Lebanese singer Maya Yazbek.Lebanon, where people from different sects share offices, neighborhoods and businesses, and crop tops can outnumber hijabs in some Beirut neighborhoods, might seem like a natural inventor of the ladies\u2019 beach. But women-only hours at the pool or the beach are common in other parts of the Middle East, too, including the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, where dress codes for local women are more uniformly conservative.At the Bellevue, there were no religious strictures regarding swim attire but each woman\u2019s own.Nada\u2019s 21-year-old daughter wears modest gym clothing when she goes to mixed beaches with her husband; at the Bellevue, she wore a bikini top with a short swim skirt. She had brought a Syrian friend who, taken aback at the way the other beachgoers dressed, kept a tank top on.Then there was Rana Ghalayini, a nurse from Beirut who had first put on the veil when she was 12, only to remove it because her family thought she was too young. When she married at 23, she and her husband agreed that she should be veiled. But she had resolved to keep her three young daughters unveiled until they, too, were 23.\u201cReligion is broad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal choice.\u201dHer reasons for wearing a one-piece swimsuit to the Bellevue were somewhat more earthly.\u201cIf I were skinny,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d wear a bikini.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Canada Won\u2019t Budge on Trade ", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDispute settlements and dairy tariffs go to the heart of how Canada sees its relationship with the United States.Mr. Fagan is a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, University of Toronto.That same attitude may be at work in the recent dust-up between the two countries over President Trump\u2019s efforts to revise Nafta. Mexico, the third partner in the trade deal, has already reached its own arrangement with Washington. So why is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau digging in his heels? This is not a country known for taking bold stands. The United States and Canada have had trade disputes before. In 1994, there was a case involving the trade in live swine. A recent case dealt with supercalendered \u2014 glossy \u2014 paper. Each time, the conflict was resolved through a system of international panels, established by the 1986 negotiations (and later expanded under Nafta to include Mexico).Canada had fought hard for this system in the original trade talks. We insisted that the pact build up rules as well as tear down tariffs. But the United States had demanded that disputes be dealt with in its own courts. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney refused to budge, and in the end Washington did something almost unbelievable: It agreed, and in doing so limited its own domestic authority. \u201cO.K., you can have your damn dispute settlement proposal,\u201d Treasury Secretary James Baker told the Canadian side. But Canada\u2019s victory was really a compromise. The countries agreed to a two-tiered system: Domestic courts would rule first, while countries could appeal to binational panels in limited circumstances. Now Mr. Trump\u2019s negotiators want to take back that compromise and once again let domestic courts have the first and final say.As a practical matter, this is a pretty small change: The system runs smoothly, and appeals are less important than they used to be, at least in some people\u2019s eyes. And there\u2019s always the World Trade Organization, with its own dispute resolution process, as a backstop. But practical matters aren\u2019t the point. Many Canadians believe that Mexico caved to Mr. Trump, putting Canada in a precarious position as the outlier. The real issue here, as before, is the power imbalance.The dispute-resolution issue is similar to the other main obstacles facing negotiators: Canada\u2019s protection of its culture and dairy sectors. Canadians are intensely protective of their culture, especially when it is so close to, and so often overshadowed by, the United States\u2019. Because the original trade deal included protections for what Canada considered the critical pieces of its cultural heritage, Ottawa has insisted that such protection be maintained in any new deal; Washington, obviously, disagrees.Dairy is also a case where the principle may seem more important than the practical. Canada sets domestic prices for dairy products; for this to work, it needs to place limits on how much milk and cheese it imports. Canadian negotiators are willing to loosen up on some of those limits, as long as the country\u2019s command-and-control system survives. But that system is exactly what Mr. Trump has attacked with his tweets about \u201c270 percent tariffs,\u201d which in fact are rarely applied. In other words, the reason these talks have been so hard is that the two sides see them in fundamentally different terms. To Americans, Canada seems to be making a big fuss over minor details. To Canadians, Americans \u2014 and Mr. Trump above all \u2014 seem intent on undermining hard-fought protections.Canada is perfectly happy to negotiate changes to Nafta; in fact, they\u2019re overdue. The negotiations should have been about working together in the digital age. A deal should simplify rules of origin and align regulations for trade in goods, as well as focus on trade in services. It should open up government procurement and clarify intellectual property rules. Some of these are in play, but they\u2019re hardly anyone\u2019s priority.Thirty years ago, Prime Minister Mulroney was intent on deepening trade relations with the United States. Now Prime Minister Trudeau has named a minister of international trade diversification. Diversification from what? No one in Canada need ask.Drew Fagan is a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, University of Toronto, and a former head of policy planning at Canada\u2019s Foreign Affairs Department.Advertisement"}

The cell, as I remember it, was no bigger than 20 by 30 feet. All around me were about 25 boys, as young as 5, the oldest no more than 12. The air reeked. A boy across the room from me was crying inconsolably, his head buried in his chest. Most of the boys wore dazed expressions. It was clear they had no idea where they were or why they were there.The only source of entertainment came from Mylar blankets, flimsy metallic sheets that were supposed to keep us warm. Three boys played with a blanket as if it were a toy, crunching it up into a ball, passing it back and forth.A window faced a central area where a dozen or so patrol agents were stationed, but there was not much to look at. All I could do was stare at the boys\u2019 shoes. My shoes were shiny and brand new; theirs, dirty, muddy and worn down. The only thing our shoes had in common was that none of them had laces.\u201cJose Antonio Vargas,\u201d said an agent as he walked in. \u201cI don\u2019t need you. Not yet. But we\u2019re gonna move you.\u201dThe moment the agent said my name, one of the boys playing with the blanket started speaking to me. I had no idea what he was saying. The one word I could make out was \u201cmiedo.\u201d Something about \u201cmiedo.\u201dIf I spoke Spanish, I could have told the boys the story I kept secret for years, a story that I\u2019m now asked to tell almost every day: I was born in the Philippines, a country whose colonial-imperial history is characterized as being \u201c300 years in the convent, 50 years in Hollywood.\u201d When I was 12, my mother put me on a plane to California to go live with her parents. When I was 16, while applying for a driver\u2019s permit, I discovered that the documents my grandfather had given me were fake, that I did not have legal documents to be in this country. If I spoke Spanish, I could have told the boys about the country they had arrived and been detained in, a country I\u2019ve lived in for more than 20 years, the country I did not ask to come to but where I have been educated, where I have worked since I was a teenager, where my grandparents and other relatives immigrated with documentation but where I have found myself stranded without a way to \u201cget legal.\u201d This is a country that prides itself as one founded and built by immigrants, but also one whose laws and policies have historically been anti-immigrant. Ask the Chinese. Talk to the Irish. This is a country that depends on immigrant labor, often cheap labor, especially from undocumented workers, while spending billions of dollars a year detaining, incarcerating and deporting people the government deems \u201cillegal.\u201d Undocumented workers like me pay taxes into this very system. This is a country of welcome, where people like me have been befriended, supported, even nurtured by American citizens of all racial, economic and political backgrounds, and it is a country whose citizens continue to vote for local and national officials who uphold and enact an inhumane immigration enforcement machine that locks up children.How people like us come to America because America, from its people, its politics and its products, were and are very much already in our countries.I don\u2019t understand much Spanish. The most Spanish thing about me is my name. My name is Jose because of Spanish colonialism. But my Jose isn\u2019t Jos\u00e9, because of American imperialism. (After the Americans forced the Spanish out of the Philippines, their typewriters couldn\u2019t type accented vowels.)So in that cell that night, I told the young boy holding the crunched-up blanket, \u201cNo hablo espa\u00f1ol.\u201dQuickly, I added, \u201cSoy Filipino.\u201dI am Filipino, a declaration that seemed to cause him more confusion. I\u2019m not sure he heard me when I said, almost in a whisper, like a prayer, \u201cPepeton ang pangalan ko.\u201d My name is Pepeton.It\u2019s my nickname, combining the nicknames of Jose (Pepe) and Antonio (Ton). It\u2019s the name of my past \u2014 what my mother and everyone in the Philippines who knows me calls me.After I was handcuffed at the airport, I was driven alone in a white van. Upon my arrival, two agents took everything I had: my phone, my wallet, my backpack, my luggage. I was asked to take off my leather belt and the laces in my shoes. When I asked why, one of the agents answered, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you hurting yourself.\u201dI wanted to laugh. I\u2019ve always used laughter to conceal my emotions; here, to distance and detach myself from the absurdity of this ordeal. Is this really about who has the right papers and what the laws are? Is this really about who is a citizen or not? Are we talking about the same citizenship that many Americans callously take for granted?I asked one of the guards if he spoke Spanish. He did.\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018miedo\u2019?\u201d\u201cFear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means fear.\u201dSitting on the floor, I kept thinking of the boys\u2019 parents, the fear they must have felt knowing that they needed to do what they needed to do. I also kept thinking of my mother, wondering as I had so many times over all these years what she told herself as she said goodbye to me at the airport 25 years ago.My mother and I haven't seen each other in person since 1993, but we do sometimes talk by phone or chat. We rarely talk about what happened on the day we separated, though. Sometimes I will ask about a fact here or there. What was I wearing? What was she wearing? What were her last words to me? But we never talk about how we felt, what we lost, what it means.The truth is, if my mother had known then what she knows now \u2014 that calling her on the phone is difficult, because I can\u2019t really pretend that I know the voice on the other end of the line, that seeing her on Skype or FaceTime feels like some sort of twisted joke, that the technology that easily connects us makes the divide even more acute \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if she would have said goodbye at the airport. On one of our rare phone calls she said, \u201cI look at you, now, the person you\u2019ve become, and how can I have any regrets.\u201d I\u2019m sure she meant it as a statement, but it sounded like a question.What I am sure of is that at every complicated and complicating juncture of my life in America \u2014 getting to college, getting a job, getting a driver\u2019s license so I could have a valid proof of identification so I could get a job, keeping the job \u2014 a stranger who did not remain a stranger helped me out.After telling me that my green card was fake, the curly-haired, bespectacled woman at the Department of Motor Vehicles could have called immigration officials.After finding out that I was ineligible for financial aid because I don\u2019t have any legal papers, the administrators at Mountain View High School didn\u2019t need to help me. I didn\u2019t even ask them for help, because I didn\u2019t know how to.

And that means the dish is not such a split-second operation; you can cook the cutlets and make the sauce a few hours ahead, then reheat them just before serving.All of which suggests that, like baked ziti and garlic bread, chicken francese is an Italian-American invention that was probably called \u201cFrench\u201d because of its luxurious, buttery sauce.Another thing no one knows for sure about francese is how to pronounce it. In New York and New Jersey, it\u2019s fran-CHASE; if you were saying it in Italy, it would be fran-CHAY-zay; most of America says fran-CHAYZ.At some point the dish underwent one other change. Continuing the region\u2019s tradition of giving its favorite foods less-than-appetizing names (see: garbage plate, chicken riggies, sponge candy), the dish was renamed \u201cchicken French,\u201d and so it remains.\u201cIt was called chicken French as far back as I can remember,\u201d said Kristen Hess, a food stylist in New York and Florida who grew up in Rochester. She said that chicken French was (and remains) a staple there \u2014 at white-tablecloth restaurants, diners and everything in between. \u201cI plate it with lots of parsley, on a pretty nest of linguine,\u201d she said, so the dish looks fresh and light.Or you could branch out even farther.\u201cI\u2019d guess something French is served at 80 percent of weddings, parties, everything like that,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t cook in Rochester if you don\u2019t know how to make chicken French.\u201dWith this bright, lemony dish, you want an equally shimmery dry white wine. It could be the same white you use for the sauce, with flavors that are not too assertive and lively acidity that refreshes. You could start by considering an array of Italian whites, like a good Soave or a vermentino from Liguria. You could easily select a gr\u00fcner veltliner from Austria, which is often the preferred wine with schnitzel. From France, you could try a sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley, a Chablis or an aligot\u00e9. An assyrtiko from Santorini would be both unconventional and delicious, and nothing goes better with fried chicken than Champagne, so why not try it with this dish? If you would like a red, possibilities include Valpolicella, barbera and Beaujolais. ERIC ASIMOVAdvertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.New York voters have spoken, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo remains the most powerful man in New York politics.His pick for state attorney general, Letitia James, also won big, making it likely his third term will unfold without the inconvenience of someone more independent, like Ms. James\u2019s opponent, Zephyr Teachout, examining his administration.Yet there were also signs that change was finally knocking on Albany\u2019s door.Most exciting, reformers across New York City ousted entrenched incumbents in races for Democratic State Senate nominations, all but eliminating a once-powerful group who had formed a rogue alliance that handed power to Republican senators in exchange for perks, campaign cash and other benefits. Six of the eight former members of the alliance, known as the Independent Democratic Conference, were ousted.Zellnor Myrie, a lawyer and community organizer who has fought hard for tenants\u2019 rights, won in Brooklyn, unseating State Senator Jesse Hamilton, another former I.D.C. member. If Democrats can take control of the Senate in November, these reformists can help shape an agenda for Albany that would include legislation that many felt the I.D.C. allowed Republicans to block for years: college aid for immigrant \u201cDreamers,\u201d the strengthening of reproductive rights for women and desperately needed protections for tenants in New York City.Albany was never going to change overnight.But thanks to reform-minded candidates willing to challenge powerful incumbents, and voters willing to show up to the polls to support them, New York is a little more democratic than it was yesterday. To keep the state moving forward, New Yorkers will have to vote in larger and larger numbers, for races from the governor\u2019s office to the school board.As Mr. Cuomo likes to say, \u201cExcelsior.\u201dAn earlier version of this editorial misquoted a speech by Alessandra Biaggi at her election party.

It was the first such incident that involved a different type of fruit.The Queensland Strawberry Growers Association, which said it believed a disgruntled former employee was behind the initial attacks, said the berries were most likely compromised \u201cbetween the time they were packed and the time they were purchased.\u201dThe health minister, Greg Hunt, has ordered a federal investigation, while the Queensland government has offered a reward of 100,000 Australian dollars \u2014 about $72,000 \u2014 in its search for a culprit.\u201cSadly, three are those in the community who perhaps don\u2019t understand the harm that they\u2019re doing, and the potential for serious injury or loss of life to someone who might accidentally eat one of these fruit,\u201d Ian Stewart, commissioner of the Queensland Police Service, told reporters.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Decline and Fall of New York City Ballet", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnce among the city's greatest cultural institutions, George Balanchine\u2019s creation lost its way under his successor, Peter Martins.Ms. Bentley is a former dancer with New York City Ballet.I danced with City Ballet for 10 years, under Mr. Balanchine\u2019s direction. I learned that discipline is not negotiable, grace is a consequence of humility, devotion to something greater than oneself is salvation and impossible beauty exists. The company has now formally hit its nadir after 35 years under the direction of Peter Martins, who succeeded Mr. Balanchine. As a lead dancer for Mr. Balanchine, Mr. Martins embodied a singular purity that made him one of the great male dancers of the 20th century. Yet in the Balanchine era the company was, for audience and dancers alike, about elegance and honor. And occasionally transcendence. The ironies are sobering: When Mr. Kirstein was asked what ballet was about, he explained: \u201cBallet is about how to behave.\u201dThe lawsuit adds that Mr. Finlay shared the images with a company benefactor, who wrote of wanting to \u201cget like half a kilo\u201d of cocaine and abuse female dancers \u201clike farm animals\u201d \u2014 to which Mr. Finlay allegedly responded, \u201cor like the sluts they are.\u201d Notably, the lawsuit also sues City Ballet itself, a first in 70 years, for fostering a \u201cfraternity-like atmosphere.\u201d (Mr. Finlay resigned last month.)Ms. Kistler did not press charges. Mr. Martins was picked up for driving drunk a few days later in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in the company of a board member. (He also was convicted in early August of drunken driving in a three-car crash after several such arrests.) Despite this, the board kept Mr. Martins in his job for over 25 more years as the head of both the company and the School of American Ballet, both multimillion-dollar institutions filled with young girls and women.Mr. Martins, for the most part, refused to bring any of Mr. Balanchine\u2019s lead dancers, his former peers, to teach at the company. Given that ballet is passed on physically, body to body, this amounted to a robbery from Mr. Martins\u2019s own dancers of the very tradition they inherited, hastening the erosion of Mr. Balanchine\u2019s legacy.Unsurprisingly, social media has played its predictably insidious role at New York City Ballet. The sacred fourth wall, between audience and artist, was a necessity to our work, to making the magic. Now ballerinas tweet from the wings about their injuries and vegan muffins, amassing vast Twitter and Instagram followers, with endless selfies and self-promotion.The company\u2019s recent ad campaigns showing bare midriffs and legs, windblown hair, and suggestive poses by slim young dancers \u2014 have used sex as a marketing tool, lowering the lure to the prurient. In that context, the Finlay scandal is no surprise. The current lawsuit with its allegations of appalling misogynistic behavior is on a continuum.A doting ballet mother once asked Mr. Balanchine: \u201cWill my daughter be a great dancer?\u201d He replied in his characteristically sly manner: \u201cLa danse, Madame, c\u2019est une question morale.\u201d She wanted to hear about fame. He knew it was about character.But he also knew that it wouldn\u2019t last. He liked to joke, \u201cApr\u00e8s moi, le board!\u201d Curiously, he refused to publicly name Mr. Martins as his successor and, astonishingly, he did not leave the rights to a single one of his 445 works to the company he founded.Mr. Balanchine called his dancers \u201cangelic messengers.\u201d Those of us who remain and remember are weeping.Toni Bentley, a former dancer with New York City Ballet, is the author of five books, including \u201cWinter Season, A Dancer\u2019s Journal.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Letitia James Makes History by Winning Attorney General Primary in New York", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetitia James became the first black woman to win a major party statewide nomination on Thursday, easily defeating three rivals in New York\u2019s Democratic primary for attorney general.With her win, Ms. James, 59, the New York City public advocate, has positioned herself as a prominent face of resistance to the policies of President Trump, a role that the New York attorney general\u2019s office has embraced since Mr. Trump took office.\u201cThis campaign was never really about me or any of the candidates who ran,\u201d Ms. James said in her victory speech. \u201cIt was about the people, but mostly it was about that man in the White House who can\u2019t go a day without threatening our fundamental rights.\u201dWith Democrats outnumbering Republicans in New York State by a margin of more than two to one, Ms. James will be heavily favored in November against the Republican candidate, Keith Wofford, 49, who ran unopposed. If Ms. James wins, she would be the first black woman to assume statewide office, just five years after becoming the first black woman elected to citywide office in New York.Ms. James beat out three other candidates who would also have made history if they had been elected as attorney general: Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, who was seeking to be the first openly gay holder of statewide office; and two women who would have been the first to be elected to the position: Leecia Eve, an African-American former top aide to Hillary Clinton; and Zephyr Teachout, a law professor.\u201cTish James is going to be the strong, progressive attorney general we need to stand up to Donald Trump,\u201d said Bill Lipton, the state director of the Working Families Party.Ms. James said she had received concession calls from Mr. Maloney and Ms. Teachout and that Ms. Eve had tried to reach her. Mr. Maloney, speaking at a Spanish restaurant in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea, was conciliatory.\u201cWe have so much more in common than divided us in this primary,\u201d he said.James supporters gathered at Milk River, a bar in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. As early returns appeared on a large screen, showing Ms. James with a lead, the crowd broke into cheers.\u201cShe brings a lot of hope to black and brown people,\u201d said James E. Caldwell, 67, a community leader in Crown Heights.That there was a Democratic primary for attorney general came as a big surprise to everyone, including the man who had held the office, Eric Schneiderman, who appeared to be on cruise control toward a third term.Sources say Mr. Cuomo pressured Ms. James to turn down the nomination after the W.F.P. endorsed his opponent, actress and activist Cynthia Nixon. Although they acknowledge discussing the nomination, both Ms. James and Mr. Cuomo deny there was any pressure for her to turn down the nomination.But the decision was seen as an indication of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s influence over Ms. James, something she strongly and repeatedly denied, characterizing herself in the words of Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress, as \u201cunbought and unbossed.\u201dShe said that fund-raising has always been difficult for her as a black woman and that her focus was on the attaining the major party nomination. She believed she would reconcile with the W.F.P. once she won the nomination. And the W.F.P. endorsed both Ms. James and Ms. Teachout, saying they would back the person that won the Democratic nomination.Ms. James\u2019s rivals repeatedly attacked her relationship with Mr. Cuomo and questioned her ability to be independent.She also committed a few gaffes along the way. She told The New York Times in an interview that it was \u201ccritically important that I not be known as the \u2018Sheriff on Wall Street\u2019\u201d \u2014 a nickname earned by Eliot L. Spitzer for prosecuting financial fraud, which is seen as a critical function of the New York attorney general given that the Trump administration has made deregulation a priority.Ms. Teachout, who surprised Mr. Cuomo in 2014 when she received 34 percent of the vote, used Ms. James\u2019s decision to not seek the W.F.P. line to stake out her role as an independent. She highlighted her professional experience writing about corruption and proposing legal strategies to fight Mr. Trump. She joined with Ms. Nixon and Jumaane Williams to form a ticket they believed was based on insurgency.Ms. Teachout was also criticized for just recently joining the New York State bar; being reprimanded by the North Carolina bar for moving out of state while handling a death penalty case and growing up on a farm in Vermont \u2014 with critics implying that she was out of touch with New York.Sensing a threat, the W.F.P. launched the largest amount of ad spending on the race by a party other than the candidate\u2019s campaign, spending more than $250,000 on digital ads on Facebook, Pandora and Spotify, a half-million robocalls and over 200,000 texts to highlight Maloney\u2019s voting record on legislation about bank deregulation and highlighting that he voted against President Barack Obama dozens of times.Ms. Eve, in spite of her strong credentials as a former adviser to Mr. Cuomo and Hillary Clinton, and the name recognition associated with her father, Arthur O. Eve, a longtime Buffalo assemblyman, never gained traction with voters.With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Ms. James had 40 percent of the vote, followed by Ms. Teachout with 31 percent and Mr. Maloney with 25 percent.Ms. James pledged to be the \u201cindependent individual I have been\u201d in her victory speech.\u201cNothing\u2019s going to change about Tish,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still just a girl from Brooklyn.\u201dWilliam Neuman and Sean Piccoli contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

At least two people in the province died in the storm, state media reported Sunday night.The storm headed toward China after making landfall in the northern part of the Philippines.Elsewhere, landslides buried homes, killing inhabitants who chose not to take shelter. By late Sunday, the unofficial count from the police was 59 dead, but that did not include what could be the worst toll in Benguet Province.Francis Tolentino, a senior adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, estimated that 5.7 million people had been affected by the storm, and that distributing rice and other supplies to the hardest-hit areas was a major concern.Mr. Duterte inspected part of the disaster area and met with top officials in Tuguegarao City for a televised briefing on the damage and the recovery effort.\u201cI share the grief of those who lost their loved ones,\u201d the president said.Videos posted by the Philippine Red Cross early Sunday show rescue efforts in San Fabian, Pangasinan Province. Rescuers evacuated families from their homes on boats, as the water had risen to neck-deep levels in some areas.[Here\u2019s how to help support the recovery efforts.]The authorities said more than 105,000 people had taken shelter in evacuation centers as the typhoon was nearing.Hong Kong is used to fierce storms, but when Typhoon Mangkhut struck the city on Sunday, it soon became clear that this one was different. Wind gusts as strong as 120 miles an hour swept through the city, rocking tall buildings and fueling storm swells that threatened the coastline with waves as high as 40 feet.Hong Kong residents hunkered down in their apartments, having cleared many grocery store shelves the day before in preparation.Others took refuge in shelters. The city\u2019s airport, a central transit point for much of Asia, was virtually shut down, with almost 900 flights canceled. The outdoor sections of Hong Kong\u2019s vaunted subway system were taken out of service. In Mong Kok, a crane collapsed at a construction site, but no injuries were reported.But as the storm bore down in full force, the postings became more ominous. In a city of towering apartment buildings, some reported they were becoming motion-sick as their homes twisted and swayed. Videos showed glass windows and doors smashing, pedestrians being blown off the ground and residents frantically scooping rain out of their balconies to prevent flooding.In southern China, the storm made landfall around 5 p.m. near Jiangmen City, in Guangdong Province, just across the border from Hong Kong. State television reported Sunday evening that two people had been killed, and other reports said that people had been crushed by billboards or other debris in Shenzhen and Dongguan, cities along the Pearl River.The storm crossed the southern coast with winds as high as 100 miles an hour. As night fell, the cities along China\u2019s southern coast largely emptied as residents heeded warnings to stay indoors, having already stocked up on food and water at stores on Saturday and earlier Sunday. Guangzhou ordered all restaurants to close to keep people off the streets, and high-speed rail service was suspended in the province.A NASA satellite captured the intense rainfall of 2018\u2019s strongest storm so far.The news agency Xinhua, citing government reports, said that nearly 2.5 million people in the province had been affected in some way, with some seeking protection in more than 18,000 designated shelters. Fishing boats had been ordered before the storm into anchorages, and the authorities detained several fishermen who had defied the warnings.In Qiantangshan, a coastal village south of the storm\u2019s center, residents seemed unfazed, even though officials said it was the biggest typhoon in years. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big,\u201d a woman selling fruit as the first wind and rain arrived had said on Sunday, vowing to stay through the day.Guangdong, China\u2019s most populous province, has extensive experience with typhoons, and with makes elaborate preparations for each of them. After 16 workers were killed when their shanty collapsed in a typhoon in 2003, the province pursued a strenuous campaign of demolishing or upgrading substandard housing.The broader Pearl River Delta area, which also includes Hong Kong, is one of the world\u2019s most important manufacturing hubs and home to more than 60 million people.The arrival of Typhoon Mangkhut in southern China has raised concerns about the nuclear plants that supply electricity to local manufacturers. But the area is battered by typhoons almost every year, and the Chinese government has stringent standards requiring that all critical infrastructure be able to withstand severe weather.Workers have been taking precautionary measures at two nuclear plants along the coastline, Taishan and Yangjiang. The first reactor of the Taishan complex went online this past summer, so Typhoon Mangkhut will be its first major storm. The plant\u2019s managers said they had held detailed planning meetings and a thorough safety inspection in the days before the storm.\u201cAll emergency duty personnel of Taishan Nuclear Power have been on the job, all preparations have been implemented, and the Taishan Nuclear Power Base is ready,\u201d they said in a statement on WeChat, a Chinese internet service.The management of the Yangjiang power plant, which is right on the coast, said in a separate statement on WeChat that it had been designed to withstand large storm surges. Outdoor equipment was tied down or removed to make the site more windproof, and the reactor buildings themselves, which have reinforced concrete shells, are extremely rigid, the company said.In one community after another, they reported seeing downed trees and badly damaged buildings. Signs, tin roofs and gates that had been torn free flew about.In Claveria, a corn- and rice-growing area on the northern coast, the Antonio family had fled their home about 1 a.m. for sturdier shelter. Marck James Antonio, 24, stayed behind and was struck and gashed in the right temple by flying debris. But he was conscious and still moving around.\u201cThis was the strongest and the worst storm that I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life,\u201d said his mother, Teresita Antonio, 54. \u201cI was crying before because I don\u2019t know how I will be able to afford to fix my house.\u201d\u201cIt was shaking like an earthquake,\u201d said another resident, Robert Tumaneng, 55, a fish farmer. From a road above, the area where the fish ponds once were looked like a giant lake, with the tips of submerged palm trees and thatched roofs sticking out.Further east, in Sanchez Mira, more than 270 people had sought shelter at a community hall.\u201cSome people didn\u2019t want to evacuate their homes but I forced them,\u201d said Rewin Valenzuela, 48, a local leader. \u201cWe evacuated everyone to prevent loss of life.\u201dThe winds made it difficult to stand outdoors but some residents were returning home, carrying mattresses and plastic buckets with food and other provisions. The roofs had been torn off other houses and a few that were built on stilts listed dangerously.The 12 million residents of the metropolitan Manila area, one of the world\u2019s most densely populated cities, appeared to have been spared major destruction as the center of the storm passed hundreds of miles to the north.The megacity was hit by heavy rain and strong winds, with trees uprooted and flooding in some areas. Among the inundated roads was Roxas Boulevard, a major artery that runs along Manila Bay and often floods during storms.More than 1,600 families were evacuated after the Marikina River, which runs through part of the city, began rising quickly because of runoff from nearby mountains. The police said the body of a child, about 10 years old, was found floating in the river under a bridge in Pasig, one of several cities that make up Metro Manila.By Sunday, the river had subsided and the families were allowed to return.The Manila area sits near sea level on the shore of Manila Bay, making it vulnerable to the typhoons that sweep in from the Pacific.Hannah Beech and Kimberly dela Cruz reported from Luzon Island in the Philippines; Richard C.

{"Headline": "California Lawmakers Pass Nation\u2019s Toughest Net Neutrality Law", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe California bill is viewed as even stronger and more consumer-friendly than the original measures carried out by the Obama administration and abolished in December by the Trump-era Federal Communications Commission. It is sure to set up a fight between broadband providers, which say strict rules would increase their costs, and consumer groups, which seek to ensure that all traffic on the internet is treated equally.If Gov. Jerry Brown signs the bill, California would become the fourth state to create a net neutrality law since the federal rollback, but it is considered the most significant. \u201cThis bill would set a tremendous precedent, with the power to shape the internet market not just in California but across the country for the betterment of consumers,\u201d Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, said in a statement.The F.C.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The bill was passed by the State Senate on Friday and the State Assembly on Thursday, both by large margins.\u201cWhen Donald Trump\u2019s F.C.C. decided to take a wrecking ball to net neutrality protections, we knew that California had to step in to ensure our residents have access to a free and open internet,\u201d State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat and one of the bill\u2019s authors, said in a statement.Lawmakers in California are seeking to bar internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing down the transmission of web traffic to the state\u2019s broadband customers. The bill would also prohibit promotions of free streaming for apps, a practice that can stifle the businesses of other websites that don\u2019t have the resources to offer such promotions.The bill would ensure that consumers would not be charged extra for access to websites. Consumers would also be guaranteed that video streams from any site like Netflix, Vudu or Hulu would be delivered to a mobile device or an internet television at the same speeds and quality.The bill would become California\u2019s second major internet law passed in the last few months. In June, the state adopted an internet privacy law, the first in the nation. It gave California internet users the ability to know what information a company like Facebook or Google was collecting, and how it was being used and shared with third parties. The law also gave them the right to stop data collection.The law would face fierce resistance from telecommunications companies. Through their trade group, USTelecom, broadband providers lobbied against the bill, warning that the rules on their management of traffic would stifle innovation and hinder business models.Lawmakers said internet service providers had already indicated to them that they would sue to overturn a net neutrality law. \u201cWe will fight with everything we have to defend it,\u201d Mr. Wiener said in a news conference.Some legal experts say the F.C.C. did not have the authority to prohibit state net neutrality laws. In a separate court battle, a federal appeals court will decide if the commission\u2019s rollback was legal.Federal net neutrality rules have been challenged in lawsuits several times over the past decade and the issue could eventually wind up before the Supreme Court.\u201cThe internet must be governed by a single, uniform and consistent national policy framework, not state-by-state piecemeal approaches,\u201d Jonathan Spalter, president of USTelecom, said in a statement.Governor Brown, a Democrat, has not indicated his view on the bill, but it was widely supported by Democrats in the Legislature and by federal Democratic lawmakers from California like Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader. Mr. Brown has until the end of September to decide on the bill, and he is expected to be intensely lobbied by telecommunications companies and consumer groups. In 2017, telecommunications providers fought against a state broadband privacy bill, which the Legislature never passed.\u201cTelecommunications companies have tremendous power and sway in California, so we know the fight is not over,\u201d said Barbara van Schewick, a professor of law at Stanford University, who has been a strong proponent of net neutrality laws.The California bill is the most significant victory for supporters of net neutrality rules since the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, scrapped federal regulations last year. Net neutrality advocates view broadband providers as important utilitylike services like the phone, saying that without the rules, big players with deep pockets have an unfair advantage.Mr. Pai viewed the rules as burdensome. Telecom companies said they wanted to experiment with business models such as free streaming promotions over mobile phones with business partners. The broadband providers promised they would not block or intentionally slow down other websites in an anticompetitive manner.Advertisement"}

The Democrats have not actually become radical leftists, or anything close to it.You keep hearing this story partly because Republicans have an obvious interest in promoting it and partly because large parts of the news media find it irresistible. It\u2019s a \u201cboth sides do it\u201d angle that allows us journalists to appear tough, knowing and above the partisan scrum. We love that image. But the facts don\u2019t support the story in this case.Finally, there is policy. Democrats have indeed moved somewhat to the left over the last few decades, on both social and economic issues. As Lawrence Summers, the former Treasury secretary (and no lefty revolutionary), likes to say, the last 15 years should have nudged open-minded people to the political left: The free market isn\u2019t delivering healthy increases in living standards for most Americans. In response, Democrats are focusing less on Bill Clinton\u2019s old themes, like personal and fiscal responsibility, and more on using the government to help people.For the most part, though, the Democratic agenda remains decidedly center-left: Raise taxes on the rich, and use the money to help the middle class and poor. Protect civil rights. Expand educational access. Regulate Wall Street, and fight climate change. Expand health insurance using the current system. And compromise with Republicans when necessary.If you consider yourself a moderate \u2014 whether you lean slightly right or slightly left \u2014 your choice in this year\u2019s midterms is clear.And if you consider yourself a leftist, I understand you are probably frustrated that the Democrats won\u2019t go further. But look at the big picture. The Democratic Party may not have moved nearly as much as you would like, but the party has moved.

", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySportingIn October and November, the sport exists (Laver Cup!) and doesn\u2019t exist simultaneously. I\u2019m both fascinated and irritated by this.Mr. Phillips is the writer of the forthcoming \u201cThe Circuit: A Tennis Odyssey.\u201dI love tennis. I play it (too much, maybe), and I\u2019m a big fan of the game. That said, considering myself a fan of the game increasingly feels strange to me. I can\u2019t quite put my finger on why. It\u2019s not because I\u2019m falling out of love with the sport. It\u2019s that the big picture is completely out of focus. I know what a tennis match is. But what is it that we\u2019re talking about when we talk about the game of tennis? This weekend\u2019s Laver Cup \u2014 a men\u2019s tournament being held in Chicago that features top players from around the world, including Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic \u2014\u00a0has got me wondering.But after the Open, there are still two months of tennis on the calendar. Do you care who will end the season with the No. 1 ranking? Will you keep up with October and November matches in Beijing, Tokyo and Shanghai? Is the cold autumn brutalism of the European indoor season what you endured the warm and golden days of summer for?The game of tennis promotes itself around the four majors. They are the four big events in the story of the year: Who will win the Grand Slam tournaments and what obstacles will be overcome on that journey? Stay tuned. At the Open, Naomi Osaka defeated her idol, Williams, playing off-the-charts tennis, won $3.8 million, and is now known worldwide. For 2018 that\u2019s the end of the story. How will Williams respond on the court to the controversy surrounding her defeat? Tune in next year to know. Novak Djokovic is back and suddenly dominating again. How will Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, the only two players in front of him in the rankings and career major titles, handle this? I\u2019ve been asked about this ad nauseam, but as it relates not to the Shanghai Masters tournament or the Rolex Paris Masters next month but to the 2019 Australian Open and beyond. As it stands, tennis in October and November exists and doesn\u2019t exist simultaneously. I\u2019m both fascinated and annoyed by all of this.The Laver Cup is a three-day team-tennis tournament dreamed up by Federer (and his management team) and named after his tennis idol, the Australian great Rod Laver. Last year\u2019s inaugural edition dangled the rare carrot before the public of seeing Federer and his great rival Nadal share the court as teammates. By all measures it was a rousing success. But will that success be permanent or, as Sade sang it, are things never as good as the first time?We\u2019ll know a bit after this year\u2019s version: with Nadal absent from Team Europe and Team Rest of the World once again lacking in genuine star power, the Laver Cup faces an existential question: What exactly is it, and what will it become? A genuine, competitive fixture on the annual schedule, as Federer insists it already is? Or, in a sport with a schedule already bursting at the seams and its players overextended, is it best served as an exhibition at the back end of a grueling calendar to celebrate the game?What\u2019s clear is that the Laver Cup has pounced on an opportunity in a fallow part of the tennis schedule. Those days just after the United States Open are an exit door for many casual viewers. The Laver Cup is has offered itself as a stay against the exodus, banking on Federer\u2019s presence and the novelty of rivals becoming teammates for a few days. Yes, I\u2019m as lost as you. And so, come September 2019, the three-year old Laver Cup will be the venerable old institution among a gaggle of tennis tournaments that have nothing to do with either one another or the tennis season itself. Another clot on the calendar to try to make sense of or ignore. I guess the idea is that we\u2019ll still be excited to see Roger Federer play doubles with another European player \u2014 maybe Andy Murray will be healthy again by then. Or, if not, we\u2019ll switch over to whatever consultancy-speak format Kosmos rolls out for us \u2014 I just hope it comes with an instruction manual \u2026 and a return slip.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Politicians Are Coming for Silicon Valley ", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome regulations are necessary, but others could hinder innovation and growth in what is arguably the United States\u2019 greatest industry.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. On Wednesday morning, the Senate Intelligence Committee will grill two prominent Silicon Valley leaders and a piece of furniture. Specifically: A chair. Presumably, wooden.The pair of executives will be Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer, and Jack Dorsey, the founder and chief executive of Twitter. They will be lightly pummeled about their responsibility for election meddling by foreign powers and the related use and abuse of fake news on their enormous communications platforms. The chair would have seated either Larry Page, the co-founder of Google and chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet, or Sundar Pichai, who now runs Google. But neither accepted the committee\u2019s invitation to appear. They offered up the company\u2019s top lawyer, Kent Walker, in their stead, which the senators did not like so much, and thus the empty seat. If this sounds like empty political theater (like the hearings that are going on right now over the latest Supreme Court nominee), it\u2019s not. Congress has let Silicon Valley off easy so far. If the tech companies want to avoid a raft of onerous regulation, they need to be even more forthright than they have been about what went wrong, and how they plan to fix it. Google has submitted written testimony, but the absence of its leaders, while the other two major internet platforms offer themselves up for a public smacking, is a mistake. It reveals a perfect contrast in how to deal with the increasing pressure that tech will face as Washington turns its angry eyes westward. And, oh yeah, did you know tech is also dangerously addictive and killing our global psyche, the digital equivalent of drinking a Big Gulp while lighting up a Juul?Washington is a toxic swamp for tech leaders to wade into. But they must \u2014 and carefully \u2014 lest they get eaten, drown or just end up very, very dirty. Mark Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg\u2019s boss, already endured 10 hours of interrogation by the Senate and the House commerce committees in April, from which he emerged relatively unscathed, thanks to the utter incompetence and lack of expertise of most of the politicians asking the questions. That is not the case with Richard Burr of North Carolina, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat. Unlike what has been served up so far by their counterparts in the House \u2014 I\u2019d like a dopey Devin Nunes platter, with a side order of inaccurate Trump tweets, please \u2014 their focus on the nefarious Russian influence on the American election has been laudable. And sources from all sides say that the pair have agreed to try to keep the focus on the important issues.This matters, because America needs a clear explanation of what its social media giants expect to become, before legislation forces all manner of regulations on them. Some of these will be decent, like forcing better privacy rules, but others could hinder innovation and growth in what is arguably the United States\u2019 greatest industry. \u201cIt\u2019s how democracies are done, having to justify yourself and your actions in public,\u201d an employee of one of these companies who asked to remain anonymous told me. \u201cAnd admitting you got things wrong.\u201dTruth. But it will be the drilling down \u2014 and not just the sound bites \u2014 that will be key. That includes requiring Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey to provide deep specifics on how well the platforms have cleaned up fake accounts; how transparent they have made the buying and selling of online political ads (and maybe all ads); and how much progress they have made in demoting and deleting fake news. Also critical is explaining how and why they let their platforms be so easily manipulated to begin with. This will perhaps require admitting that bad actors used them in exactly the way they were built to be used. The platforms, long focused on goosing audience and revenue, let that happen. Given all the political and media scrutiny, they now have plenty of incentives to crack down.They will also have to address crazier notions, like the obsession many politicians on the right now have with the idea that the platforms are biased against them, hiding or playing down conservative voices. After the Senate intelligence hearing in the morning, Mr. Dorsey alone will face questions later in the day from the House Energy and Commerce Committee on how Twitter manages its algorithm and moderates its content. While that will most likely produce more fireworks and plenty of dumb assertions, Mr. Dorsey will have to sit still and take it with equanimity. On other topics, tech leaders need to take what Washington throws at them more seriously because of the threat of legislation that is looming. Already, regulators in Europe and legislators in more aggressive states like California have taken tough actions on privacy, data and more, which could be a prelude to federal laws.Protecting tech platforms from abuse is only the first big challenge. These companies are going to have to manage increasingly complex issues, and this is going to require working with the government and accepting some level of regulation. How will they protect consumers from the \u201cinternet of things\u201d? Who will regulate autonomous vehicles? Should tech companies continue to get immunity from what is on their platforms? Should algorithms be transparent? What are the rules around artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, data portability \u2014 even embedded tech in people, like, say, a permanent mobile phone in your ear or screen in your eye?You get the idea. And, just to note, there is another congressional hearing set for October on antitrust issues and tech giants. That means it\u2019s going to be a very long and bumpy road for Silicon Valley leaders. They might want to strap themselves into those wooden chairs today and hold on tight. Advertisement"}

In the skillet chicken, the kale, beans and lemon cook in the fat rendered from the chicken so they can absorb its deep flavor. The salmon for the farro bowl is steamed directly on top of the grains, delivering succulent fish and saving you a pan. Eggs Kejriwal joins Serrano chile and Dijon mustard on egg-and-cheese toast, a flavor combination I wish I\u2019d trademarked.Here are five recipes for the week:Kitchen alchemy: There are only five ingredients in this recipe (not counting salt, pepper and oil), but it yields deep, savory flavors and a pleasing mix of textures. The cook time here falls on the longer side of weeknight \u2014 just shy of an hour, including prep \u2014 but it\u2019s a one-skillet meal, so dinner is done. (If you wanted a little extra something, set a pot of rice or other grains on the stove before you start browning the chicken.)This clever grain bowl pairs salmon and farro with a crunchy cucumber-radicchio salad. (If radicchio is too bitter for you or your crew, use fennel or baby spinach instead.) Creamy chunks of feta, a glug of olive oil and an extra hit of lemon juice are nice touches before serving.You won\u2019t believe how delicious this is, and how lightning-fast. A bubbling egg, cheese and chile-laced toast from Mumbai, it makes a light dinner with a robust green salad, though you could prepare two pieces of toast (and two eggs) per person for a more substantial meal.An ideal summer-to-fall soup, this one is right for the moment, conjuring neither shorts nor sweaters. You could tinker with the spices. You could add chickpeas, lentils, rice or farro to make it a more filling main course. You could make it vegan by using oil instead of butter to saut\u00e9 the vegetables. Or you could make this vibrant recipe exactly as is.Advertisement"}

A major offensive to capture Idlib, where three million people live, is expected.I wake up and watch the news. We talk relentlessly about Idlib\u2019s fate. People think Russia is going to attack no matter what.The small shops that sell bread and vegetables are still open, but most other businesses have shut down. Farming has stopped. So has construction. The warehouse that sells cement has shuttered. A few days earlier, a nearby school was bombed. Thankfully, it was closed and nobody was hurt.Some people are digging underground shelters and stockpiling food. We fear more chemical gas attacks. People are trying to make gas masks with whatever they have, but it won\u2019t even work.Turkish soldiers are still positioned in the nearby town of Morek, which is on the front line (with Syrian government forces). We keep hearing reassuring statements from Turkish officials, but most people don\u2019t think Turkey can prevent the assault.I was here in Khan Shaykhun last year when the regime attacked with chemical weapons. My family and I live on the opposite side of the city and weren\u2019t affected. I went to the site of the chemical attack the next day. The streets were empty. Many in the neighborhood had died, especially those who had hidden in shelters. Those who had climbed on rooftops had survived.America has warned the Assad regime against using chemical weapons, but we don\u2019t exclude that possibility. We are defenseless, without even the basic equipment to protect our families from such attacks.I am not preparing for the invasion. I am trying to flee to Turkey with my family. We will soon leave for the border.I was a police officer in a nearby village in 2011 when the crackdown on protesters began. We were ordered to beat them. First with sticks, then with cattle prods. Soon the government wanted us to shoot. I had to defect or kill people. I defected. Rebels took Khan Shaykhun early. We have been living here for years with aerial bombing, but now, if the regime advances, there is no other option for me but crossing into Turkey. I have to save my family. All we want is to stay in our homes and live our lives. I live in Kafranbel with my three sons and their families. My 27-year-old son dropped out of law school in Aleppo after the uprising in 2011 and became a construction worker to support us. Two years ago, an airstrike wounded his younger brother. It took a year of recovery and the insertion of metal pins into his leg for him to be able to work again.We are very tired. The war, and with it our suffering, has been going on for years. When I talk to people around me, I hear many wanting Turkey to control this area. \u201cAt least we won\u2019t worry about our children,\u201d they say. If the regime comes here, everyone will be targeted. Women I know who survived the capture of Ghouta have told us lots of stories, about murders and mass arrests. The Syrian Army rounded up young people, either to arrest them or conscript them into the army. They humiliated them. We fear nobody would be spared in Idlib.I was studying at Aleppo University when the demonstrations began in the spring of 2011, and I started attending the protests. The regime arrested many of my friends and classmates. I quit school out of solidarity with them. Quitting the university was one of the great losses of my life. Since then, the revolution has occupied my life. I grew up during \u2014 and through \u2014 the revolution.I came back to Idlib city and tried to find my place in the revolution. I couldn\u2019t fight and still don\u2019t believe in the revolution\u2019s militarization. I don\u2019t support any armed group. I became an activist. I help organize protests and I write essays, especially about issues affecting women and children.I married and divorced during the revolution. I now live with my family. They support me despite the negative views our society holds about divorced, independent women.The fighters detained me for traveling without a chaperone. When I tried to reason with them, they brought up my colorful shoes and handbag.Because of my activism, I am sure I am wanted by the Assad regime\u2019s security branches. Still, I am against fleeing. I have to stay, even when the regime soldiers come. I might die, but I prefer it to slow death in another country. For others, being killed by border guards\u2019 bullets is preferable to being arrested by the army.Although it hurts, I don\u2019t blame people who believed in our cause and our freedom but who got bored by this conflict. They didn\u2019t live our lives. People who stopped caring about Syrians after the rise of Islamist groups shouldn\u2019t have forgotten us. We need a revolution against those groups as much as we need it against the Assad regime.We won\u2019t give up after all these years. Recently, we organized and gathered for a series of demonstrations against Russia, the regime and Hayat Tahrir al Sham, and we will continue to demonstrate. Idlib is not the end. We may die, but this fight will last for generations.Marwan Hisham and Molly Crabapple are the authors of \u201cBrothers of the Gun: A Memoir of the Syrian War.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Who Wants to Eat a Gooey Jellyfish? Pretty Much Everyone in the Ocean", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterScientists had long assumed that few creatures dined on these gelatinous animals. But new research suggests that jellyfish may be an important part of the ocean\u2019s food supply.For a hungry fish in search of a meal, a jellyfish would seem to be a huge disappointment. These gelatinous animals are 95 percent water. As a result, a cup of live jellyfish provides just five calories \u2014 one-third the amount in a cup of celery.It should come as no surprise, then, that marine biologists long ago dismissed jellyfish as an insignificant item on the ocean menu. Other animals rarely bothered eating them, the idea went, and so they represented a dead end in the ocean\u2019s food web.\u201cHistorically, they were just ignored,\u201d said Thomas K. Doyle, a marine biologist at the University College Cork in Ireland.But recent research has shown this to be a mistaken view. Many species, from tuna to penguins, seek out jellyfish to eat. \u201cThe more we look, the more animals are feeding on jellyfish,\u201d said Dr. Doyle. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely, really important.\u201dIt\u2019s even possible that jellyfish help stabilize the ocean\u2019s food webs, providing a dining option to other animals when times are tough.\u201cOur perception has switched hugely,\u201d said Jonathan D.R. Houghton, a marine biologist at Queen\u2019s University Belfast in Northern Ireland. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a reboot of jellyfish ecology as a central part of the ocean system.\u201dThe meager calories in jellyfish weren\u2019t the only reason that scientists dismissed them. Animals on the hunt for prey rarely were seen catching jellyfish. When biologists cut open fish or inspected bird droppings, they almost never found jellyfish remains.There were exceptions. Leatherback turtles and ocean sunfish have long been known to gorge on jellyfish, gobbling hundreds of them every day.But leatherback turtles and ocean sunfish are exceptionally big. Leatherbacks can weigh over 2,000 pounds; ocean sunfish can reach 5,000 pounds. Many scientists considered their size to be a special adaptation for living on jellyfish. Only by filling a vast stomach with gelatinous prey could they hope to get enough food to survive.For animals without such adaptations, a diet of jellyfish would seem to be a dangerous strategy. The predators would be far better off eating other prey. Bite for bite, fish provide around thirty times more calories than jellyfish.It seemed to biologists that the ocean must hold a colossal amount of uneaten food. No one knows how many jellyfish there are, but scientists regularly come across vast hordes of them. Barrel jellyfish, for example, can form dense armadas that stretch for dozens of miles. And each one can weigh as much as sixty pounds.If other animals weren\u2019t eating all those jellyfish, then all that organic matter was being lost from the food web. \u201cThey might die and fall to the seabed, and the microbes had a good day,\u201d said Dr. Houghton.This understanding of jellyfish has come under scrutiny in recent years as marine biologists have used new tools to figure out what eats what in the sea. Prey leave a chemical signature in the predators that consume them. Elements like oxygen and nitrogen in the muscles of animals can reveal the kinds of prey they consume. As it turns out, a number of fish species carry a jellyfish signature in their muscles.Scientists have also invented new ways to peer inside the guts of ocean predators. Rather than searching for pieces of half-digested jellyfish, researchers began rummaging for their DNA. And they found a lot of it came from jellyfish. In eel larvae, for example, researchers found that 76 percent of prey DNA belonged to jellyfish. From the feces of albatrosses, scientists determined that jellyfish made up 20 percent of their diet.By mounting miniature cameras on marine animals, biologists have been capturing days\u2019 of video. Footage of penguins has revealed that they also eat jellyfish. In fact, the birds actively seek them out even when other options are available. Jellyfish may make up over 40 percent of a penguin\u2019s diet.These new techniques \u201chave allowed us to scratch the surface and get a glimpse of another world,\u201d said Julie McInnes, a biologist at the University of Tasmania. It\u2019s a world with a tremendous appetite for jellyfish. So why are many animals are eager to eat a seemingly useless food? Part of the attraction may stem from how easy it is to catch jellyfish. They can\u2019t dart away, and once an animal eats a piece of jellyfish, it can digest the meal far faster than a fish full of bones or a shrimp covered in an exoskeleton.Some animals may not swallow the entire jellyfish, instead biting off the nutritious parts. While the bell of a jellyfish is mostly water, their reproductive tissues offer calories and protein.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more to jellyfish than jelly,\u201d said Dr. Houghton.The enormous amounts of jellyfish that other animals are eating has left Dr. Houghton and his colleagues wondering about the animals\u2019 effects on the entire food web. It\u2019s possible, he said, that jellyfish keep ocean ecosystems stable.Marine animals like fish are more vulnerable to population crashes. They can only survive if there\u2019s enough food that is the right size to fit in their mouths at each stage of their life cycles.Jellyfish, on the other hand, are far more versatile. When there are small fish available, a jellyfish can capture them in its tentacles. But if these morsels are missing, jellyfish can eat tiny zooplankton \u2014 or even just feed on ooze. Then other animals may survive lean times by eating these versatile creatures.\u201cThat might bring stability to a food web,\u201d said Dr. Houghton. \u201cThey could provide a buffer for the system.\u201dDr. McInnes agreed that jellyfish are more important to the ocean ecosystem than scientists once thought. But she noted that it\u2019s still too early to say precisely how much jellyfish other sea creatures are eating.\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know,\u201d Dr. McInnes said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steeper Versus Deeper (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDid finance cause the Great Recession, redux.Opinion ColumnistMy starting point in thinking about the Great Recession and aftermath is that we clearly had a very large housing bubble. Here\u2019s the ratio of housing prices to owner\u2019s equivalent rent, the sort of housing equivalent of the P/E ratio for stocks:Housing prices went extremely high relative to rental rates (and consumer prices more generally), then suffered a long and protracted fall. This decline started well before the period of severe financial distress, which was a fairly short episode from September 2008 to around June 2009. And prices were still way down years later, which suggests that while the credit crisis surely accelerated the pace of decline, prices were going to come down and stay down regardless of what happened to the financial system.Given a housing price slump of this magnitude, you had to expect large macroeconomic impacts: a big decline in residential investment spending, a fall in consumer spending because of the wealth effect, and a decline in nonresidential investment because of the slump in demand brought on by the first two effects.In other words, something very much like the Great Recession seems like an inevitable consequence of the bursting of the housing bubble. And the magnitude of the shocks \u2014 around 4 percent of GDP for housing investment, perhaps around 2 percent for the wealth effects of the decline in home equity \u2014 looks well within the range needed to explain the whole thing.What Bernanke offers is, as I read it, mainly evidence that the pace of decline accelerated a lot during 2008-2009. Indeed it did \u2014 and no reasonable person would deny that the combination of financial disruption and sheer fear that gripped the world after September 2008 brought the slump forward and made the decline steeper than it would otherwise have been.But did it make the decline deeper as well as steeper? The unemployment rate averaged 9.6 percent in 2010 and 8.9 percent in 2011. How much did the financial crisis contribute to these extremely high levels of economic slack, long after the disruption had ended? I still don\u2019t see how to make it the main story.Now, does this mean that rescuing the financial system was pointless? Here Dean Baker and I disagree, I think. Dean says yes, because finance didn\u2019t cause the slump. I think that the slump we had didn\u2019t have much to do with finance \u2014 but the slump we would have had if the financial system had been allowed to implode might have been much worse. On precautionary grounds, bailouts were in my view the right thing to do, although the terms were too sweet for the bankers.On the other hand, the fact that we suffered such a deep, prolonged slump despite rescuing banks shows the limits of a finance-centered view.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "3-D Printed Implant Gives Patches the Dachshund a New Skull", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLast year, Patches the dachshund earned the nickname Little Unicorn after she developed a large tumor that jutted out of her forehead.Now, with the tumor gone, her Pennsylvania family calls her Titanium Top.Those terms of endearment for the 9-year-old dog trace the narrative of how Patches became a case study in 3-D medical printing, a developing frontier in the field of reconstruction surgery in animals.In March, American and Canadian veterinarians removed a tumor from Patches\u2019s head that was so large they had to carve out as much as 70 percent of her skull.So they made Patches a new \u201cskull\u201d to cover the gap. The team members used 3-D printing to tailor a titanium plate to match what was left of the bone. Then they implanted the custom-made plate in Patches\u2019s head like a puzzle piece.\u201cThe plate fit,\u201d said Dr. Michelle Oblak, a veterinary surgical oncologist with the University of Guelph\u2019s Ontario Veterinary College, who worked on Patches during the operation at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, N.Y. \u201cIt was quite jagged, so we had to follow the contour of the tumor.\u201d\u201cWe use it for surgical planning,\u201d said Dr. Frank Verstraete, a surgeon at the University of California, Davis, whose team has done dozens of lower-jaw reconstructions. \u201cIt saves us time in the actual operating room.\u201dBut it has not entered mainstream use in surgery in small veterinary clinics. The costs associated with 3-D printed custom implants in surgery for disfigured or injured animals can be prohibitive. But some animals will not survive without such an implant.That was the case with Patches, according to the team that worked on her.Patches started to develop a small bump on her head several years ago, said Danielle Dymeck, a corrections officer in Pennsylvania who has raised the dog since she was 2 months old. The bump did not seem to bother Patches when she chased cows or frolicked with Ms. Dymeck\u2019s grandchildren.But it grew quickly, alarming the family. Their local veterinarian referred them to Cornell University, where Dr. Galina Hayes, an assistant professor, took on a leading role in the treatment in February.Patches\u2019s tumor soon became so large it \u201cran out of room on the top of her head,\u201d Ms. Dymeck said. It started to invade the eye cavity and press inward onto the brain, Dr. Oblak said.\u201cIt was like a big orange on her forehead,\u201d she said.The tumor was so widespread that the veterinarians could see they needed to carve out more than half of the skull bone. But then they had to decide how to cover the vast gap. A common plate made of titanium mesh would leave too much of Patches\u2019s brain vulnerable to being compressed if it were hit by something.\u201cAnd that would be the end of Patches,\u201d Dr. Hayes said.While there are off-the-shelf implants, custom-made 3-D implants are particularly good for dogs, Dr. Oblak said, because their skulls vary in shape, from the flat snouts of boxers to the long ones of greyhounds.So the veterinarians settled on a custom 3-D printed titanium implant.On March 22, Patches went into the operating room. The team used a high-speed drill to cut around the tumor so it could be removed without damaging the brain.\u201cWe popped the plate on,\u201d Dr. Oblak said. \u201cIt was amazing. It fit like a glove.\u201dMs. Dymeck said Patches had an unrelated back injury and recently had seizures, but the family does not know if the seizures are related to the skull surgery. \u201cShe is doing really well,\u201d she said.Dr. Verstraete, who said the Cornell operation was an \u201cinteresting development,\u201d said his team uses commercially available implants in work that has involved mostly jaw reconstruction.\u201cWe have not had the need for custom printing our own plates,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is fair to say that as we make advances we will use more of it, but it will always be a small niche application.\u201dDr. Hayes said the team was preparing its work for peer review in The Canadian Veterinary Journal as a case study.She described the Patches operation as \u201cunusual\u201d rather than groundbreaking, and said its contribution could be for cases \u201cwhere there is literally nothing else you can do than euthanize the animal.\u201d\"I think this is still a technology we are figuring out how to incorporate into veterinary medicine,\u201d she said. But, she added, \u201cit is always going to be a niche demand, mainly because the cases that need it are fairly rare, but also because of the financial cost.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Looking Our Racist History in the Eye", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn exhibit about the civil rights movement in Nashville proves Faulkner was right: The past isn\u2019t dead. It isn\u2019t even past.Contributing Opinion WriterNASHVILLE \u2014 In 1960, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in this city, which was emerging as a training center for nonviolent protest. \u201cI came to Nashville not to bring inspiration,\u201d he said, \u201cbut to gain inspiration from the great movement that has taken place in this community.\u201dThat movement was the work of people who later became some of the most influential figures in the national struggle for civil rights: James Lawson, John Lewis, Z. Alexander Looby, Diane Nash. When people today think of the civil rights era in the South, they think of Birmingham, Ala. They think of Little Rock, Ark. They think of Forsyth County, Ga., which warned African-Americans passing through not \u201cto let the sun go down on your head.\u201d They don\u2019t think of Nashville.But this was the first major city in the South to desegregate public facilities, lunch counters and movie theaters. It developed a calm, one-year-at-a-time approach to integrating city schools. When Ms. Nash, confronting Mayor Ben West, asked if it was wrong \u201cto discriminate against a person solely on the basis of color,\u201d Mr. West answered, simply, \u201cYes.\u201dThese are the stories Nashville tells itself again and again: We aren\u2019t like the rest of the South. Dr. King said so.The problem with civic memory is that it is both true and deeply false. Some layer of reality inevitably undergirds a public fairy tale. A myth always contains enough truth to make it seem like the final word. But there\u2019s no such thing as the final word. That\u2019s because any history is a narrative construction, one that files off the roughest edges of the story. The past itself is shaggy, troubled, unruly. It will not be contained. William Faulkner said it best: \u201cThe past isn\u2019t dead. It isn\u2019t even past.\u201dHere\u2019s what\u2019s true: Nashville did not attack its own children with fire hoses, as Birmingham did. Tennessee did not call out the National Guard to integrate its universities, as Mississippi did. There is no \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d in our history, as there is in the history of Selma, Ala. But our stories about the orderly desegregation of schools and the peaceful desegregation of lunch counters and the benign treatment of black people by the white people in power? That\u2019s all a myth.Part of the collection is on display in the museum\u2019s ground-level public gallery, through which virtually all visitors pass. The full collection appears in a companion book just released by Vanderbilt University Press. Because of the violence depicted in them, the most troubling images appear only in the book. \u201cAs a mother of young children, I very conscientiously attempted to address the dark moments of the history, but without the images that may be viewed as most disturbing, especially for a family unprepared for what they were going to see or even participants in the movement who may still be traumatized by their experience,\u201d said exhibit curator Kathryn Delmez.One 1957 photo depicts a crowd gathered in the middle of the night outside the newly integrated Hattie Cotton School, which had been bombed shortly after midnight. A photo from 1960 shows the aftermath of a bomb set off at the home of Mr. Looby, an attorney who defended sit-in demonstrators in court. Another, from 1962, depicts the Rev. Cephus Coleman standing in front of his own house as it burns to the ground. Two 1963 photos show a girl \u2014 all of 15 \u2014 lying unconscious in the street, beaten by a police officer with a club. In another photo from 1963, an effigy of Dr. King is hung by the neck in the headquarters of the Nashville police.The civil rights era in Nashville, in other words, was \u201cpeaceful\u201d only in the context of the even greater brutality of our neighbors to the south.And to the north and west, too. People in other parts of the country like to imagine that their own histories contain nothing like the dark shame of racism that haunts the South, but that belief, too, is a myth. In 1964, the year the Civil Rights Act passed, there were protests and violence in Chicago; St. Augustine, Fla.; Tulsa, Okla.; New York City; Rochester, N.Y.; Philadelphia and Jersey City. In Cambridge, Md., National Guard troops \u2014 bayonets drawn \u2014 surrounded black people kneeling in prayer.The photography exhibit at the Frist closes Oct. 14, but this record of Nashville\u2019s past will endure: Copies of the companion volume to the photography exhibit will be distributed to all branches of the Nashville Public Library and to every public school in the city, and all members of the Tennessee General Assembly will receive a copy to deliver to the public libraries in their own communities. Here\u2019s hoping they pause to take a look first. There\u2019s a truth in these photographs that many of them have likely never seen before.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump to China: \u2018I Own You.\u2019 Guess Again. ", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Chinese are catching up to the U.S. in many ways, and the president grasps only part of the reason.Opinion ColumnistEarly in the movie \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d a Chinese-Singaporean father admonishes his young kids to finish their dinner, saying, \u201cThink of all the starving children in America.\u201d I\u2019m sure that everyone of my generation in the theater laughed at that joke. After all, we\u2019d all been raised on the line: \u201cFinish your dinner. Think of all the starving children in China.\u201dThat little line contained within it many messages: The first, which any regular traveler to China\u2019s biggest urban areas can tell you, is that rich China today \u2014 its luxury homes, cars, restaurants and hotels \u2014 is really rich, rich like most Americans can\u2019t imagine.The second is that this moment was destined to be a test of who will set the key rules of the global order in the 21st century: the world\u2019s long-dominant economic and military superpower, America, or its rising rival, China. And this test is playing out with a blossoming full-scale trade war.What does such a test of wills sound like? It sounds like a senior Chinese official telling me at a seminar at Tsinghua University in April that it\u2019s just \u201ctoo late\u201d for America to tell China what to do anymore on issues like trade, because China is now too big and powerful. And it sounds like President Trump, in effect, telling China: \u201cSays who? Show me what you got, baby!\u201d Or as Trump actually tweeted last week: \u201cWe are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. \u2026 If we meet, we meet.\u201dI guess we should be grateful that this confrontation has been confined to trade, but, as I said, it was inevitable. Because, as one top tech executive pointed out to me: \u201cChina is not a \u2018near peer\u2019 anymore. It is a peer.\u201dAs Mary Meeker\u2019s latest internet trends study noted, five years ago China had only two of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded tech companies, while the U.S. had nine. Today, China has nine of the top 20 \u2014 Alibaba, Tencent, Ant Financial, Baidu, Xiaomi, Didi, JD.com, Meituan and Toutiao \u2014 and the U.S. has 11. Twenty years ago, China had none.Do you see a trend? Do you hear footsteps? The total value of China\u2019s internet economy is already bigger than America\u2019s. And China\u2019s economy now is so cashless that many women no longer carry purses or men wallets \u2014 just a cellphone with mobile apps \u2014 to buy anything, or even donate to a beggar.And don\u2019t get me started on the biggest emerging work and services tool in the world \u2014 artificial intelligence. China\u2019s plan is to catch up to America in A.I. and surpass it as soon as possible, and it\u2019s well on its way. Because with A.I., the more training data you can feed the machine the faster it learns, the more patterns you can see and the more algorithms you can write to improve products and services or invent new ones. Because China has so many more people than we do, and so many more of them use mobile apps for their daily lives, China\u2019s ability to amass giant data sets and train more machines faster is considerable.\u201cIf data is the new oil, then China is the new Saudi Arabia,\u201d remarked Kai-Fu Lee, author of \u201cAI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.\u201dChinese companies are already the world leaders in computer vision/facial recognition and speech recognition, which can be used for commerce and for surveillance and societal control. In just the last two years there has been an explosion of fintech start-ups in China, offering mobile payments, lending, brokerage and banking. And the No. 1 and 3 drone manufacturers in the world \u2014 DJI and Xiaomi \u2014 are Chinese. France\u2019s Parrot is No. 2. At the same time, China is producing far more engineers and scientists than the U.S., and their quality is steadily rising.America today, by contrast, has become the unrivaled world leader in generating data about Donald Trump and from Donald Trump.In the daily barrage of Trump news and tweets, some Trump statements are actually true, though \u2014 like the need for the U.S. to confront China\u2019s unfair trade practices. China has grown incredibly these past 30 years with a very specific formula: hard work, unleashing capitalism, smart planning and long-range investments in education and infrastructure \u2014 but also by stealing intellectual property, forcing technology transfers and cheating on World Trade Organization rules.We have to respond. But wisely.Historically the U.S. could dominate the global scene and check a rising power like China, and set the global rules, with just our sheer physical mass \u2014 more money, more troops, more naval ships, more top-10 companies, more scientists and more universities. That is just not possible any longer, as China has become both big and smart in more and more areas. But all is not lost.It happens that we have three huge assets that China doesn\u2019t have, and is unlikely to acquire them anytime soon. We should be doubling down on our strengths: immigration, allies and values. Instead, Trump is squandering them.Also, we have real allies in a way China does not. China has clients, customers and frightened neighbors. It does not have real partners like Canada and Mexico. It doesn\u2019t have the whole Atlantic alliance with the European Union or tight relations with Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Australia \u2014 which we can leverage if we aren\u2019t doing stupid stuff, like slapping them with steel tariffs or tearing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Our nation has never been just a beacon for profit-making, which only measured countries by their trade balance with us. Our values attracted people to our shores and helped us spread our rules onto the wider world. When Trump tore up the TPP trade deal I\u2019m certain that he actually disappointed China\u2019s economic reformers, who wanted to use the pact to create pressures inside China to reform.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Scientists Are Retooling Bacteria to Cure Disease", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bymatterBy manipulating DNA, researchers are trying to create microbes that, once ingested, work to treat a rare genetic condition \u2014 a milestone in synthetic biology.In a study carried out over the summer, a group of volunteers drank a white, peppermint-ish concoction laced with billions of bacteria. The microbes had been engineered to break down a naturally occurring toxin in the blood. The vast majority of us can do this without any help. But for those who cannot, these microbes may someday become a living medicine. The trial marks an important milestone in a promising scientific field known as synthetic biology. Two decades ago, researchers started to tinker with living things the way engineers tinker with electronics. They took advantage of the fact that genes typically don\u2019t work in isolation. Instead, many genes work together, activating and deactivating one another. Synthetic biologists manipulated these communications, creating cells that respond to new signals or respond in new ways. Until now, the biggest impact has been industrial. Companies are using engineered bacteria as miniature factories, assembling complex molecules like antibiotics or compounds used to make clothing.In recent years, though, a number of research teams have turned their attention inward. They want to use synthetic biology to fashion microbes that enter our bodies and treat us from the inside. The bacterial concoction that volunteers drank this summer \u2014 tested by the company Synlogic \u2014 may become the first synthetic biology-based medical treatment to gain approval by the Food and Drug Administration.As phenylalanine builds up in the blood, it can damage neurons in the brain, leading to delayed development, intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders. The traditional treatment for PKU is a strict low-protein diet, accompanied by shakes loaded with nutritional supplements. The researchers are now going forward with a trial on people with PKU and expect to report initial results next year.Tal Danino, a synthetic biologist at Columbia University, said that a number of other researchers are working on similar projects, but no one has moved forward as fast as Synlogic. \u201cThey\u2019re leading the charge,\u201d he said.One of Synlogic\u2019s co-founders, James J. Collins, a synthetic biologist at M.I.T., published one of synthetic biology\u2019s first proofs of principle in 2000. He and his colleagues endowed E. coli bacteria with a way to turn a gene on and off when they were exposed to certain chemicals \u2014 \u201clike a light switch for genes,\u201d Dr. Collins said in an interview. Tal DaninoAt first, the scientists envisioned using rewired bacteria as environmental sensors \u2014 perhaps detecting airborne biological weapons and producing a chemical signal in response. But then came the microbiome. In the mid-2000s, microbiologists began charting our inner menagerie of microbes, the vast diversity of organisms that live inside healthy people. The microbiome is continually carrying out complex biochemistry, some of which helps shield us from diseases, scientists found. Synthetic biologists soon began wondering whether they could add engineered bacteria to the mix \u2014 perhaps as internal sensors for signs of disease, or even as gut-based factories that make drugs the body needs. \u201cYou can\u2019t overestimate the impact of the microbiome work,\u201d said Jeff Hasty, a former student of Dr. Collins who now runs his own lab at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThat, in a nutshell, changed everything.\u201d Dr. Collins and Timothy K. Lu, another synthetic biologist at M.I.T., co-founded Synlogic in 2013, and the company began looking for diseases to take on. One of their picks was PKU, which affects 16,500 people in the United States. Drugs have recently become available that can drive down levels of phenylalanine. But they only work in a fraction of patients, and they come with side effects of their own.For years, researchers have explored treating PKU with gene therapy, hoping to insert working versions of the defective gene, called PAH, into a patient\u2019s own cells. But so far the approach has not moved beyond studies in mice. To Synlogic, PKU looked like a ripe opportunity to use synthetic biology to create a treatment that might gain government approval. The researchers inserted genes into the bacteria\u2019s DNA so that once they arrived in the gut, they could break down phenylalanine like our own cells do.One of the new genes encodes a pump that the bacteria use to suck up phenylalanine around them. A second gene encodes an enzyme that breaks down the phenylalanine into fragments. The bacteria then release the fragments, which get washed out in urine.The Synlogic team wanted the microbes to break down phenylalanine only in the right place and at the right time in the human body. So they engineered the bacteria to keep their phenylalanine genes shut down if they sensed high levels of oxygen around them. Only when they arrived in a place with little oxygen \u2014 the gut \u2014 did they turn on their engineered genes.To test the bacteria, the researchers created mice with the mutation that causes PKU. When the mice received a dose of the bacteria, the phenylalanine in their blood dropped by 38 percent, compared with mice without the microbes.For their human trial, Synlogic recruited healthy people to swallow the bacteria. Some took a single dose, while others drank increasingly large ones over the course of a week. After ingesting the bacteria, the volunteers drank a shake or ate solid food high in protein.On Tuesday, Synlogic announced that the trial had demonstrated people could safely tolerate the bacteria. In addition, the more bacteria they ingested, the more bits of phenylalanine wound up in their urine \u2014 a sign the bacteria were doing their job. The next step will be to see if the microbes can lower phenylalanine levels in people with PKU. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at how fast we got to where we are,\u201d said Dr. Collins, who was not involved in Synlogic\u2019s PKU research. Dr. Danino and Dr. Hasty are currently collaborating on another project: how to use synthetic biology against cancer. One huge challenge in developing drugs for cancer is that they often fail to penetrate tumors. But microbiome researchers have discovered that natural bacteria regularly infiltrate tumors and grow inside them. Now scientists are engineering bacteria that can also make their way into tumors. Once there, they will unload molecules that attract immune cells, which the researchers hope will kill the cancer.\u201cI think anywhere there are bacteria in the body is an opportunity to engineer them to do something else,\u201d said Dr. Danino.Advertisement"}

But more than ever he\u2019s showing he\u2019s also a human being. Mr. Benedict and Mr. Keteyian are the authors of \u201cTiger Woods.\u201d Our book, \u201cTiger Woods,\u201d a biography of the grittiest and most mysterious athlete either of us has encountered in our over 50 years covering sports, came out in March. The final chapter, set in early 2018, sets the scene for Woods as he prepared to return to golf after his fourth back surgery. The last sentence read: \u201cA changed man, he stood poised to show his children \u2014 and a fresh generation of golf pros and fans \u2014 just what a living legend looks like.\u201dIn all honesty, when we wrote that, our expectations were low \u2014\u00a0very low. There is no way we would have predicted the scene last weekend at the Tour Championship, when hundreds of raucous fans overcome with euphoria swarmed down the final fairway at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta, following Woods like a human sea. We were sent back decades earlier, to 1997, to his triumphant stroll down the 18th fairway at Cog Hill during the Western Open. After he tapped in his final putt to win his first P.G.A. tournament in five years, the raucous crowd chanted \u201cTI-GER TI-GER.\u201d As recently as a year ago, we could hardly find anyone who genuinely believed that Woods would play again on the P.G.A. Tour, much less win. Woods himself confided to a former Masters winner at the Champions Dinner at Augusta in April 2017 that he was \u201cdone.\u201d Nine surgeries will do that to most people. But Woods, as we found in our extensive research on him and interviews with hundreds of people from every facet of his life, has an unparalleled determination to persevere through disappointment, adversity and pain. His comeback began this year, and as he found his swing, he quietly moved up in the World Golf Rankings. Remarkably, in July he briefly led the British Open with eight holes to play. In August he finished two shots behind the winner at the P.G.A. Championship. How unlikely was this? Just 16 months ago, Woods was found on the side of the road near his home in Florida, asleep behind the wheel of his car in the middle of the night. He was arrested for D.U.I., and a toxicology report subsequently revealed that he had taken a potentially lethal combination of drugs that included the painkillers Vicodin and Dilaudid, the anti-anxiety medication Xanax and the sleep aid Ambien. His mug shot ricocheted around the world.He had hit rock bottom, even lower than the stretch in 2009, following his infidelity scandal, when his name appeared on the cover of The New York Post for 21 consecutive days, surpassing the previous record of 20 consecutive covers devoted to the Sept. 11 terror attacks.Even worse, for a professional athlete, his body broke down. His arrest last year was ultimately the result of misusing highly addictive pain medications. He has acknowledged and overcome that situation as well. The more we thought about what he has been through, the more we admired him. For so many years, when Woods was at the pinnacle of his sport, he came off more like a machine than a man. He dispatched opponents with the cold precision of a trained assassin. He had a distant, often surly relationship with the press. He kept fans at a distance. He was so much better than everyone else and so single-minded that spectators couldn\u2019t really relate to him.But pain has changed Woods. The first visible sign of this came in January at the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines. It was his first P.G.A. tour event since his latest back surgery. As he walked off the green on the 13th hole on the first day of the tournament, he looked up and noticed the abundance of military personnel packed into the stands behind the green. A Marine in full dress had been holding the flag as players putted out. It was Torrey\u2019s tribute to a military town. Pausing, Woods acknowledged the men and women in uniform.\u201cHe never, ever, ever would have done that before,\u201d said a tour insider who witnessed the moment. \u201cHe would have had his head down and not seen a thing. Now he was looking up and taking it all in, smelling the roses.\u201dSimilarly, after winning last weekend, Woods admitted, \u201cI had a hard time not crying on the last hole.\u201dThat sentence, more than anything, reveals the new Tiger Woods. He is still the most talented golfer ever to play the game and remains the toughest competitor we\u2019ve ever seen. But more than ever he\u2019s showing he\u2019s also a human being.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Voting at Home Will Help Save Our Democracy", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll 50 states should follow the example set by Oregon and Washington.The authors served as secretaries of state in Oregon and Washington.The single best way to increase voter turnout?Abolish the polling place.A century ago, the direct election of senators sounded audacious, too. But in six states, it\u2019s already true that more than 12 million voters don\u2019t need to traipse to polling places on Election Day or apply for absentee ballots.The U.S. Postal Service delivers our ballots automatically, several weeks before each election. Voters can mail their marked ballots \u2014 sometimes even postage paid \u2014 or take them to one of hundreds of official ballot collection sites.Since most voters choose the latter option, vote-at-home is a more accurate label than vote-by-mail. At many locations, voters can also receive replacement ballots, update their voter registration and get language or other assistance. For those so inclined, some sites still have voting booths.Oregon rolled out its system in 1998 after voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure. Washington finished its county-by-county approach in 2012, while Colorado\u2019s first vote-at-home election took place in 2014. Voters today also enjoy this system in 27 of Utah\u2019s 29 counties and more than 40 counties in North Dakota, Nebraska and California.Vote-at-home\u2019s power derives from it being an opt-out rather than an opt-in election system. Election Day realities for other voters \u2014 bad weather or traffic jams, work schedules and family obligations \u2014 don\u2019t thwart our voters in exercising their most fundamental of rights.Polling place lines? Gone. Photo ID laws? Rendered moot. Election integrity is ensured by checking every voter\u2019s signature on the return envelope against voter registration records.The vote-at-home system gives voters more time and flexibility to study all the candidates and issues, including down-ballot races. They can cast more informed ballots while creating new democratic rituals, joining friends to drop off their ballots or voting with children and family members around their dining room tables.Ah, yes \u2014 but isn\u2019t such a system an open invitation to fraud and coercion?While election mischief is certainly possible in any system, Oregon has had only two dozen cases after 20 years and 100 million mailed-out ballots. None have been organized, much less consequential. Washington and Colorado\u2019s experiences are similar.Remember, too, that nary a whiff of meaningful fraud occurred in the fiercely fought 2016 election, in which a record 33 million Americans voted with mailed-out ballots.Consigning the traditional polling place to the same electoral scrap heap as hanging chads and vulnerable voting machines won\u2019t be easy.Blind partisanship is an even bigger problem. Each of us has faced fierce criticism from our respective party colleagues for promoting a reform that would supposedly advantage our partisan foes. And within each major party are factions that clearly prefer low-turnout elections, especially in party primary contests.At times, we both miss the traditional polling places. But giving up those Norman Rockwellian memories \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 of crunchy autumn leaves and smiling neighbors is a meager price to pay for a more inclusive system.When every voter receives \u2014 and a lot more cast \u2014 a ballot, the more democratic we make our society. When more of us participate, we\u2019re better able to hold our politicians \u2014 and ourselves \u2014 accountable.Let\u2019s get vote-at-home in place in all 50 states. It\u2019s not the only solution, but it\u2019s an important one to help revitalize our democracy, which for far too many Americans has devolved into a spectator sport.Phil Keisling, a Democrat, served as Oregon\u2019s secretary of state from 1991 to 1999 and is the chairman of the National Vote at Home Institute.

{"Headline": "I Came of Age During the 2008 Financial Crisis. I\u2019m Still Angry About It.", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe generation that graduated into the recession is not to blame.Mr. Miller is an editor at The New York Times. I grew up in a suburb of Detroit, in a house near a dead end, which my parents bought in 1992. They paid for it with a conventional mortgage that they had the misfortune of refinancing in January 2008. A series of disasters followed, all of which would have been previously unthinkable. Within a matter of months, investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed from having taken on too much risk, predominantly in the housing market, and by the fall of that year both of my parents had lost their jobs. In the brief interim between their refinancing and the global economic meltdown, the value of the house plummeted, so my parents owed more on their mortgage than what the property was worth.At this time, I was a senior at New York University, one of the country\u2019s most expensive private institutions and one of the reasons my parents, who, like so much of the middle class, had no real asset of value aside from their house, decided to refinance the mortgage in the first place. My parents and I always imagined we\u2019d find a way to pay for my college, through some clever combination of savings and scholarships \u2014 and, if all else failed, through one of the easily available high-interest student loans offered by major banks. All of this seemed practical enough, or at the very least as if it could be worried about later: My parents \u2014 again, like so much of the middle class \u2014 believed that any variety of worst-case scenarios didn\u2019t happen to people like them.By March 2009, about two months before my graduation, I returned to my childhood home for spring break, aware that, short of an unexpected miracle, my parents would soon have nowhere to live. The \u201cfor sale\u201d signs sticking in the front lawns of the neighbors\u2019 empty houses led me straight to the street\u2019s dead end.I return to this scene often, even 10 years later. The financial crisis remains the defining trauma of my generation, many members of which, like me, had just graduated from college or were preparing to in 2008. In the years since, the suffering from the financial crisis has become the connective tissue of a demographic routinely denounced as lazy and spoiled.And so housing reports, sociological studies and the news media have blamed grim statistics, like the shrunken class of American homeowners, on an \u201centitled\u201d millennial lifestyle, in the process producing some of the most laughable pseudoscience in recent history. Many people have and will continue to condemn me personally for my tremendous but unexceptional student debt, and the ways in which it has made the recession\u2019s effects linger for my family. I\u2019ve spent quite a lot of time in the past decade accepting this blame. The recession may have compounded my family\u2019s economic insecurity, but I also made the conscious decision to take out loans for a college I couldn\u2019t afford in order to become a journalist, a profession with minimal financial returns. The amount of debt I owe in student loans \u2014 about $100,000 \u2014 is more than I make in a given year. I am ashamed and embarrassed by this, but as I grow older, I think it is time that those profiting from this country\u2019s broken economic system share some of my guilt. It\u2019s an awfully nice thought, but I wonder where this realization was 10 years ago, when it would have meant something. Being forced to witness this halfhearted apology tour among high-ranking officials is another prominent feature of having grown up during the crisis, one that brings me back to a different scene from 2009, which I tend to revisit a great deal.

{"Headline": "Micheline Rozan, a Force Behind a Theater Master, Dies at 89", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMicheline Rozan, a behind-the-scenes force who helped the director Peter Brook found the renowned International Center for Theater Research in Paris and produced many of its trailblazing productions, died on Sept. 7 in Paris. She was 89.\u201cMicheline lives and functions game by game,\u201d Mr. Brook wrote in \u201cThreads of Time: Recollections,\u201d his 1998 memoir. \u201cImpatient and sharply intelligent, she is bored by long-term planning, and even success is not particularly rewarding. But she is like a general: give her a crisis or even a disaster and at once her very best qualities come into play. Whether the problem comes from human friction, lack of funding, or illness, a simple phone call and she is on the spot, mobilized, mobilizing, finding solutions.\u201dMs. Rozan learned the ins and outs of theater working under Jean Vilar when he ran the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National Populaire in Paris in the mid-1950s. She then became an agent, representing actors like Jeanne Moreau.In his book, Mr. Brook recalled his first encounter with Ms. Rozan. In 1956 he had staged Tennessee Williams\u2019s \u201cCat on a Hot Tin Roof\u201d at the Antoine Theater in Paris with Ms. Moreau as Maggie, to a mixed reception. Simone Berriau, the theater\u2019s artistic director, nonetheless asked him to return to direct Arthur Miller\u2019s \u201cA View From the Bridge,\u201d which he had staged in London.\u201cI was very reluctant to repeat work that was already in the past, and despite all the emotional pressure she brought, I refused,\u201d Mr. Brook wrote. \u201cThen a forceful young woman who was just beginning her career as an agent came to see me in my Paris hotel. \u2018Don\u2019t be under any illusion,\u2019 she began bluntly. \u2018Your work hasn\u2019t made a good impression here. If you want to work again in Paris, do \u201cA View From the Bridge.\u201d It can\u2019t fail to be a big hit.\u2019 Her name was Micheline Rozan, and her frankness so impressed me that I listened.\u201dThroughout the 1960s Ms. Rozan continued to work as an agent and producer in her own right, including serving as a producer of \u201cThe Immortal Story,\u201d a 1968 film directed for French television by Orson Welles and starring him and Ms. Moreau.In 1970, though, Ms. Rozan and Mr. Brook formally joined forces in creating the International Center for Theater Research, which sought not only to stage productions but also to inquire into the purposes of theater and how best to achieve them.For the first few years the theater group traveled internationally, but Mr. Brook and Ms. Rozan then began to search for a permanent home. In his book, Mr. Brook said it was Ms. Rozan who first heard about the Bouffes du Nord, which opened in the 1870s but had fallen into disrepair and was boarded up.\u201cSo one day she and I crawled through a hoarding on hands and knees,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand when we stood up, we found ourselves contemplating a forgotten, battered shell within which was a space that fulfilled all the requirements.\u201d\u201cThe minister of culture at the time told us it would take two years and a vast budget to reopen it,\u201d he continued. \u201c \u2018Very well,\u2019 said Micheline, \u2018we will do the minimum in three months for a quarter of the sum.\u2019 \u201dOverseeing the restoration, Ms. Rozan often grew exasperated as the date for their opening approached, Mr. Brook wrote.\u201cOne day I saw her hurl a plank across the scarred concrete floor of the theater in anger and frustration over some postponement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut she kept her promise, and right on the dot this theater that would become renowned for its uncomfortable seats but loved for its ruined splendor was ready to open with \u2018Timon of Athens.\u2019 \u201dThat was in 1974. Among their many collaborations since, \u201cCarmen\u201d \u2014 Mr. Brook\u2019s first foray into opera in years \u2014 was one of the most challenging, especially in the casting.\u201cWe had to fly people in and out of Paris from everywhere,\u201d Ms. Rozan recalled in a 1983 interview with The New York Times, partly because of the technical demands on the singers and partly because they needed performers who were open to experimentation and could adapt to Mr. Brook\u2019s unconventional methods.Information about Ms. Rozan\u2019s survivors was not immediately available.In his book \u201cPeter Brook: A Biography\u201d (2014), Michael Kustow quotes the writer and actor Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re, another frequent Brook collaborator, on the relationship between the director and Ms. Rozan.\u201cHe could never have done what he has without her,\u201d Mr. Carri\u00e8re said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t always like Peter\u2019s shows, but she\u2019s been miraculously well placed to help him, and together they made a moment of theater history.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The court even apologized for Indian society\u2019s past mistreatment of gay people.Such an outcome was not foreordained in India, a socially conservative nation of 1.3 billion people where the law has often been used for intimidation and where the government, a broadly right-wing Hindu national coalition, is not known for defending minority rights.

Of all the teachers I had coming up in school after I emigrated to the States from Trinidad and Tobago at age 6, she stood out.She was stern, she was fair. She would give you Lucky Bucks at the start of the week. When you behaved badly, she would take one away. If you had the most Lucky Bucks by the end of the week, you would get to participate in some sort of fun activity. If you did not, there would be punishment.Ms. Harris was the only teacher I remembered having in America who was, like me, black.It is difficult to say what impact it had on me that nearly all of my teachers in primary and high school were white. I was among the fortunate people who grew up with parents who would not settle for anything but the best from me when it came to academic performance. As such, my grades were high, I got into a great university and, thankfully, landed a great job.Why is that?There does not seem to be a clear answer, but in the research, some of the usual suspects pop up: unconscious bias, the role-model effect, cultural sensitivity.Here, some of my colleagues reflect on their experiences.I was born in Ghana and moved to the States when I was 4. The first time I had a white teacher I was 12 years old.I had just transferred from my local public school to Riverdale, a bucolic private day school in the Bronx. The experience of being surrounded by students and educators who did not look like me was a shock to the system.At P.S. 106 and M.S. 127, the two schools in Parkchester that I had previously attended, my teachers were mostly black and brown women from in and around the Bronx. I remember Ms. Seabrooks, my African-American homeroom teacher, with her tight braids and encouraging smile, who activated my love of literature. And Ms. Durant, my Jamaican math teacher, who firmly believed that girls, just like boys, could excel in her class.While I loved these women, I did not fully appreciate their impact on my education until I no longer had access to them.At Riverdale, most experiences felt charged. Oftentimes a simple classroom discussion could easily be cloaked in thick racial tension. In 8th grade, while reading \u201cBlack Boy,\u201d Richard Wright\u2019s memoir about growing up in rural Mississippi in a Jim Crow South, my white female teacher abruptly turned to me. \u201cLovia,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have anything you want to add?\u201dThe question took me by surprise. Why, I thought at the time, would I have anything to add? No one else had been asked so directly about their opinion.I often think about this moment and whether or not the burden of publicly stating my views on this book would have fallen on me if I were not black. In a class filled with a teacher and students who did not look like me, her question felt like less of an invitation to share my thoughts, than a demand to explain what it means to be black.\u2014 Lovia Gyarkye, editorial staff member of the Book ReviewI\u2019m Latina, my experience is a Latinx experience. I am light-skinned, but I am still a person of color. White skin and whiteness are not the same thing.But never once in high school was I told that I was a \u201cperson of color.\u201d We were just Latino. And that\u2019s a problem.\u2014 Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz, news assistant, PoliticsMy husband and I are not black. I am South Asian. Never once, from nursery school through my undergraduate years, did I have a teacher of South Asian descent. My parents provided me with the finest education that they could, and I\u2019m sure that it never occurred to them to fret over the fact that the majority of my teachers were white.When it came time to choose a school for our boys, the diversity of its faculty was a factor, but one that I deemed less important than the quality of the school itself \u2014 the academic rigor, the approach to discipline, the community values. This is a luxury, I know. Our sons are not disadvantaged; my husband and I have the benefit of our own education and resources.I have made peace with the fact that I did not have teachers who looked like me, in part because my parents served as my examples of what success as a brown person might look like. Both my husband and I want to be sure that our sons have the same thing \u2014 black adults who they can turn to for inspiration, motivation, and support. Our pediatrician and dentist are both black; we have black friends who can show them what their adulthood might look like. There\u2019s a wider circle of my sons\u2019 friends\u2019 parents, and our neighbors \u2014 both those we know and those who we don\u2019t.But I have little doubt that every student\u2019s experience in the classroom would be enriched if we had a corps of teachers as diverse as this country.

Thanks to aging baby boomers, the older retirement-age white population will grow by one-third over the next 15 years and, with it, the need for the government to support Social Security, Medicare, hospitals and the like. Revenue for these programs will have to come from the younger minority population. If the census does not accurately count this population, then all the services that support children and future workers, such as public education, Head Start, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and Medicaid, will be shortchanged.Although the slowly growing, rapidly aging white population will be accurately counted, the fast-growing minority school-age and young adult populations that represent the nation\u2019s future will not get their due \u2014 demographically, politically or economically.Let\u2019s assume that one in three people in Hispanic and Asian noncitizen households refuses to answer the census. If that\u2019s the case, the Hispanic share of the United States population would drop by 2.1 percentage points (from 17.3 to 15.2 percent) and the total white population share would rise by 2.2 percentage points (from 62 to 64.2 percent).This imbalance would influence congressional reapportionment, hurting large, immigrant-heavy states. It will also shape how congressional and state legislative districts are drawn, favoring rural and small areas at the expense of large metropolitan areas, since noncitizen households are far more prevalent in the latter.The underenumeration of racial minorities would also misallocate billions of dollars in state and federal funds for housing assistance, job training, community development and a variety of social services that should be distributed on the basis of census counts. It would provide a faulty framework for surveys that will inform thousands of policy and business decisions, such as where to locate schools, hospitals, employment sites or retail establishments catering to different population groups, over the next decade.William H.

Hey, this is important. Grow up and pay attention.Young, left-leaning candidates are revolting against older, traditional Democrats in primary elections around the country. Meanwhile, the best-known, most talked-about potential presidential candidates are Bernie Sanders, 77; Joe Biden, 75; and Elizabeth Warren, 69.And in the House, where the top three Democratic leaders are in hailing range of 80, there\u2019s a certain, um, restlessness on the part of the young folks.We have had political generation gaps before. Back in the day, student protesters yelled \u201cNever trust anybody over 30!\u201d The people who did the yelling are now in their 70s, and I dare say have a more expansive view. The current gap is much more polite. (The millennials are coming!) In the House, it seems pretty much confined to the Democratic side of the aisle.Meanwhile her fellow Californian, Kamala Harris (53) was lacing into Kavanaugh with as much fire as possible, as was New Jersey\u2019s Cory Booker (49). Both are regarded as possible presidential contenders \u2014 the Democratic field may look rather advanced in years now, but once we get to 2019 we will have 10,000 candidates of every conceivable age. Honestly, if you didn\u2019t have to be 35 to run, there would be 12-year-olds raising money this very minute.At the hearing, Booker demonstrated that it was possible to go too far in being fearsome when he made some allegedly confidential Kavanaugh records public and compared himself to Spartacus for his daring.Excuse me. We were talking about age and politics. The age situation in the House is a definite problem. Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader, is 78. She\u2019s a fund-raiser of manic capacity and energy, and a truly formidable leader. However, the Republicans have made her the symbol of All That Is Evil In Washington, and a lot of the Democrats running in swing districts are vowing to vote against her if they\u2019re elected. Part of this is pure, scaredy-cat ambition. If you want to get points for being Not A Liberal, what\u2019s easier than disavowing Pelosi?But part of the uprising is Pelosi\u2019s own fault. She has been the top Democrat in the House for 16 years. Her two deputy leaders are 78 and 79, and the party is captive of a seniority system that would make a 52-year-old like Himes, with a mere nine years in the House, despair.\u201cI think I\u2019ll be 184 before I\u2019m in range of being Financial Services chairman,\u201d said Himes in a phone interview. If the Democrats take control in 2019, the head of the Financial Services Committee would presumably be the current ranking member, Maxine Waters, 80.The Republican system is to rotate chairmen out after six years. That seems a tad excessive \u2014 six years does not seem like quite enough time to become super-skilled at the job. In a rational world you could surely come up with a plan somewhere between revolving chairs and the Democratic theory that no virtue counts unless it involves seniority.Nobody\u2019s better proof that age doesn\u2019t matter than our current president. Donald Trump is 72, but he was already terrible when he was 50. It\u2019s just that back then, we didn\u2019t notice him much.

{"Headline": "Democratic Insurgents Topple 6 New York Senate Incumbents", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYears of anger at a group of Democratic state senators who had collaborated with Republicans boiled over on Thursday, as primary voters ousted nearly all of them in favor of challengers who had called them traitors and sham progressives.The losses were not only a resounding upset for the members of the Independent Democratic Conference, who outspent their challengers several times over, but also a sign that the progressive fervor sweeping national politics had hobbled New York\u2019s once-mighty Democratic machine, at least on a local level.\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t prove that political currency is people over money, I do not know what does,\u201d Ms. Biaggi, who spent one-tenth as much as Mr. Klein, said at her victory party. \u201cWe have now cut the head of the I.D.C. snake.\u201dMr. Klein did not appear at his watch party.Also defeated were five other former I.D.C. members: Senators Tony Avella and Jose Peralta in Queens; Senator Jesse Hamilton in Brooklyn; Senator Marisol Alc\u00e1ntara in Manhattan; and Senator David Valesky in Syracuse. They fell to John Liu, Jessica Ramos, Zellnor Myrie, Robert Jackson and Rachel May, respectively.The only former I.D.C. members to survive the primary were Senator Diane Savino, of Staten Island, and Senator David Carlucci, of Rockland County.\u201cThis is a victory for workers,\u201d Ms. Salazar told supporters at a party in Bushwick.In reality, the challengers\u2019 victories alone will have little effect on the fate of progressive legislation in Albany. The true test of that will come in November\u2019s general election, when Democrats seek to flip several Republican-held Senate seats.But the challengers\u2019 wins sent a resounding symbolic message: The restless, impatient mood that has swelled within the national Democratic Party this year had come for local incumbents, too.Ms. Salazar in particular drew comparisons to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned vigorously for Ms. Salazar, dispatching her own volunteers to Brooklyn to canvass for her and promoting her to her large Twitter following.\u201cI think young women are a very visual, but also functional, embodiment of a rebuke of basically New York\u2019s old-boy network,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview at Ms. Biaggi\u2019s party. \u201cAnd voters get that.\u201dThe I.D.C. challengers also allied themselves with Ms. Nixon\u2019s opposition to Mr. Cuomo, and to Zephyr Teachout\u2019s attorney general bid. The Working Families Party, a progressive minor party and frequent antagonist of the governor, endorsed all the challengers and provided training and staff for their campaigns.Bill Lipton, the state director of the W.F.P., cast the I.D.C. losses as a major triumph, even in the face of Ms. Nixon\u2019s defeat.\u201cThe center of gravity has shifted, and Andrew Cuomo will face a radically different Albany,\u201d he said.Still, the divergent fates of the challengers, compared to Ms. Nixon and Ms. Teachout, suggested that the I.D.C. upsets spoke more to the strength of anti-Republican antipathy across the Democratic Party, than of anti-establishment sentiment in its far-left flank.At a polling site in the Bronx, several voters who said they had chosen Ms. Biaggi also picked Mr. Cuomo over Ms. Nixon, citing the governor\u2019s experience.That was also true of many of the establishment figures who endorsed the challengers yet backed Mr. Cuomo, such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Representative Carolyn Maloney and the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson.Indeed, for allies of the insurgent slate that had challenged the Democratic Party machine, the anti-I.D.C. candidates emerged as the only electoral victors of the night.The I.D.C. members had faced primary challenges before, and they had long been a target for Democratic activists. But that anger, for years restricted to only the most politically attuned New Yorkers, crested over the past few months, in tandem with the surge of progressive energy nationwide after the 2016 presidential election.Activists began calling the I.D.C. members \u201cTrump Democrats\u201d and sought to educate voters who knew nothing about their senators\u2019 so-called betrayal.\u201cWe didn\u2019t exist a few months ago, and now we\u2019ve raised over $250,000,\u201d said Jim Casteleiro, the campaign manager of No I.D.C. NY, a volunteer group.Nearly all the voters at the Bronx poll site who backed Ms. Biaggi cited Mr. Klein\u2019s role in the I.D.C. as a motivating factor.\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time for ushering in another Republican majority,\u201d Peter McHugh, 59, said of Mr. Klein.The challengers\u2019 victories boosted the emerging progressive narrative that the old political model \u2014 buying expensive television ads, cozying up to real estate, corralling union support \u2014 had been displaced by vigorous grass-roots organizing.Each challenger outspent his or her opponent on Facebook advertisements, sometimes by a huge margin. Ms. Biaggi and her allies spent between $14,500 and $93,800 on Facebook ads since May, while Mr. Klein and his supporters spent between $2,400 and $14,796.Ms. Salazar adopted similar tactics against Mr. Dilan, who although he was not a member of the I.D.C. was successfully portrayed as another out-of-touch corporate Democrat. The Democratic Socialists of America, of which Ms. Salazar is a member, deployed its full organizing power for her in Brooklyn.A string of negative headlines about Ms. Salazar in the final weeks of the campaign \u2014 suggesting that she had misled reporters and voters about her immigration status, religious background and socioeconomic status \u2014 seemed to have little impact.Still, Lina Newton, a political-science professor at Hunter College, noted the geographic limitations to the grass-roots organizing that has propelled the insurgent candidates to victory. Ms. Nixon, after all, deployed similar tactics in a statewide race to no avail.\u201cPersonal outreach is much more important on a local level,\u201d Professor Newton said.And on that local level on Thursday, it was potent. Ms. Biaggi, in an interview, gestured to the sneakers on her feet, calling the previous hours \u201cthe most exhausting day in my life.\u201dFor Mr. Klein, she had a simple message: \u201cIt was a tough fight. And, I should also say, we should thank him for his service,\u201d she said. \u201cBut his time is up.\u201dMariana Alfaro, Nate Schweber and Angela Macropoulos contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Originalism Matter Anymore?", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo the \u2018originalists\u2019 on the Supreme Court, apparently not.Mr. Segall teaches constitutional law at Georgia State University.Much has been made over whether Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an originalist.But does it really matter? Not much, if you look at the recent rulings of other Supreme Court justices who have said they interpret the Constitution by reading its provisions as they were understood at the time they were written. For the record, Judge Kavanaugh was asked at his confirmation hearing Wednesday whether he was an originalist. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered, \u201coriginal public meaning, as informed by precedent.\u201d But will Judge Kavanaugh actually be a justice who will follow that approach? A look at the two justices who have professed fidelity to the doctrine is instructive.The problem with these appeals to originalism, and the impartiality they connote, is that they have not held true in practice. Which is why to critics, and I\u2019m one of them, the label of originalist strikes us as a cover for imposing conservative value judgments. Justice Gorsuch has only been on the court for a term and a half, but he has already joined with Justice Thomas (and the other conservatives) several times to strike down state laws without relying on originalist sources. In the union and political apparel cases, Justices Thomas and Gorsuch joined majority opinions written by Justices Samuel Alito and John Roberts that did not rely on original meaning. In the union case, for example, Justice Alito wrote that we \u201ccan safely say that, at the time of the adoption of the First Amendment, no one gave any thought to whether public sector unions could charge nonmembers agency fees.\u201d One prominent originalist, Michael Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego, and a former clerk to Justice Scalia, said about this case, \u201cI do not see the originalist argument for the challengers in this case.\u201d The reality is that, as the law professors Will Baude of the University of Chicago and Eugene Volokh of U.C.L.A. argued in an amicus brief, neither free speech principles nor prior case law supported the justices\u2019 decision to overrule the policy judgments of almost half the states on how to regulate public sector unions.All of which is to say that, for these originalists, originalism didn\u2019t figure very importantly, if at all, in how they cast their votes on some of the court\u2019s most consequential recent cases. Instead, they used, for their own ends, the same type of values-based living constitutionalism that they and other conservative jurists and politicians typically decry.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s why the Merrick Garland process \u2014 or the lack of one \u2014 still enrages so many people.Yes, indeed. Term limits for the court are an excellent idea. It would take a constitutional amendment, but that\u2019s O.K. The United States has already amended its Constitution 27 times \u2014 or an average of about once every nine years. We are overdue for at least one more amendment.The most appealing idea to me is staggered 18-year terms on the court, with each four-year presidential term automatically bringing two appointments. Such a system would be more consistent with democratic principles. It would have several ancillary benefits, too. Aging justices would no longer hang on to their jobs past the point when they should (which has been a real problem in the past).

{"Headline": "Leaked Google Video After Trump\u2019s Win Adds to Pressure From Conservatives", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A video posted to the right-wing media site Breitbart on Wednesday showed Google executives bemoaning the election of President Trump at a company meeting in 2016.The hourlong video of a companywide meeting in November 2016 shows a parade of senior executives from Google and its parent company, Alphabet, expressing dismay about the election. Google often holds all-hands gatherings it calls T.G.I.F. meetings. They are usually streamed over the internet to company offices all over the world.Among the people who spoke were Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer. Both appeared to become emotional, choking up while speaking. Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder, said that he was \u201cdeeply offended\u201d by the election of Mr. Trump and that his victory was in conflict with many of the company\u2019s values. Mr. Brin, who immigrated from the Soviet Union as a child, said, \u201cAs an immigrant and refugee, I certainly find the selection deeply offensive.\u201dAlso, Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s head of people operations, said some conservative employees had told her that they were uncomfortable with being open about their political views. She encouraged employees to be tolerant of other views.\u201cWe value perspectives from all sides of the political spectrum,\u201d she said.In a statement, Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, said that at the regularly scheduled session, some Google employees \u201cexpressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season.\u201d She added that \u201cnothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.\u201dRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, tweeted that Google needed to be questioned in front of Congress about the email and potential plans for a censored search engine for China. Other conservatives seized on the video as evidence of Google\u2019s bias and echoed Mr. McCarthy\u2019s sentiments.Google has also added to the political pressure. The company offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global policy, to last week\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. The committee balked and said Google, like Facebook and Twitter, should send a top executive like Mr. Pichai or Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder and the chief executive of Alphabet.His dismissal became a rallying point for conservatives who saw Silicon Valley companies as dominated by liberal political and social views. Mr. Damore is suing Google for workplace discrimination, claiming that Google is biased against white men with conservative views.The company also upset conservatives when thousands of Google employees protested the company\u2019s work on developing artificial intelligence for the Pentagon. Google responded to the dissent by agreeing to not renew a contract with the Pentagon when it expired.Advertisement"}
