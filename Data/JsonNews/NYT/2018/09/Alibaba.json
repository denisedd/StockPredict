{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Chairman, Jack Ma, Plans to Step Down", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 The Alibaba Group said on Monday that Jack Ma would resign as chairman, unveiling a leadership succession plan for the Chinese e-commerce giant as it faces a more uncertain environment at home.Mr. Ma, who co-founded Alibaba in his apartment 19 years ago and has led it ever since, will step down as chairman a year from Monday, the company said. He will be succeeded by Daniel Zhang, currently Alibaba\u2019s chief executive.Alibaba said the move was meant to foster long-term growth and reduce its dependence on any one person. At the same time, it took pains to stress that Mr. Ma would remain involved with the company. It said he will remain on its board until 2020 and would remain in the Alibaba Partnership, a group of senior longtime managers who exercise significant control over the business and its affiliates.\u201cThis transition demonstrates that Alibaba has stepped up to the next level of corporate governance from a company that relies on individuals, to one built on systems of organizational excellence and a culture of talent development,\u201d Mr. Ma said in a company statement.In an interview with The Times on Friday, Mr. Ma said his retirement would be \u201cthe beginning of an era\u201d and that he would focus on education. \u201cI love education,\u201d he said.In exchanges with The Times after the article was published, Mr. Ma said his decision had nothing to do with some of the issues it mentioned, such as the Chinese government\u2019s growing role in businesses or the weakening business environment.Some investors in New York and Hong Kong said over the weekend that they aren\u2019t overly concerned about Alibaba\u2019s business and its leadership transition. But the confidence in China\u2019s economic and political conditions is so low that the departure of an iconic figure like Mr. Ma has made them wonder how they should evaluate their investment portfolios.On Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, Alibaba posted an image of Mr. Ma\u2019s new business card. It listed 12 titles, including teacher, Alibaba\u2019s No. 1 employee, founder of the Jack Ma Foundation and spokesman for village teachers. It did not list Alibaba executive chairman.An Alibaba spokeswoman said it was not a formal business card and was intended to highlight Mr. Ma\u2019s other roles.Under Mr. Ma, Alibaba became one of the world\u2019s largest and most powerful technology companies. It dominates e-commerce in China, the world\u2019s largest single market of internet users. Hundreds of millions of Chinese use Alibaba\u2019s electronic payment affiliate, Alipay, to buy clothing and gadgets, order out lunch and invest their money. In recent years, as China\u2019s internet use has surged, Alibaba\u2019s market capitalization has risen to levels that rival Facebook\u2019s.It hasn\u2019t stopped there. Alibaba\u2019s sprawling businesses also include brick-and-mortar stores, online video, movies and other enterprises, and it has sought to expand in promising new markets like Southeast Asia and India.But investors have begun to worry in recent months that Alibaba\u2019s road is getting tougher, and shares of Alibaba and some of its rivals have fallen significantly in recent months.Alibaba and Mr. Ma on Monday portrayed the succession plan as a sign that the company isn\u2019t dependent on one person. Mr. Ma\u2019s involvement in the company isn\u2019t likely to end with his resignation, however. He has a stake of more than 6 percent in the company\u2019s shares. Crucially, he will also have considerable sway in the company and its affiliates thanks to its complicated legal structure. Under Chinese law, crucial licenses to do business in certain industries must stay in control of Chinese nationals when a company lists its shares overseas, as Alibaba has done.\u201cI also want to return to education, which excites me with so much blessing because this is what I love to do,\u201d he said in the company statement. \u201cThe world is big, and I am still young, so I want to try new things \u2014 because what if new dreams can be realized?!\u201dAdvertisement"}

Two of the three forces, globalization and marketization, that have propelled Alibaba to its current $500 billion valuation are dissipating. The third force, technology, is mired in the trade war between China and the United States, and its prospects in China are now uncertain.Alibaba didn\u2019t just transform e-commerce in China; it transformed the entire economy by helping build up the private sector. Mr. Ma\u2019s departure from the company now \u2014 though he claims to have been planning it for a while \u2014 adds to a gathering sense that China\u2019s private sector, the engine of the economy, is losing steam \u2014 and faith.But today globalization is under assault. The Chinese government is enforcing more strictly regulations over V.I.E.s that it had long ignored, creating uncertainty for foreign investors. And the trade war between the United States and China is disrupting Chinese exports, threatening the supply chains of which Alibaba is an integral component.Under increasingly tight financial and regulatory pressures, China\u2019s private sector today arguably is facing the most challenging environment since the early 1990s.In conversations I had in Guangdong, business leaders from various sectors \u2014 product design, investment, technology \u2014 called the current situation \u201cdire.\u201d They said they were making far fewer deals, as much as 50 percent less, now than during the same period last year and complained about the toll of increasing taxes.These are not the conditions that allowed Alibaba to succeed. The company was a pioneer in adopting Western technology and business models \u2014 using online commerce, data analytics, website tools \u2014 to the Chinese context. Although it is often called China\u2019s Amazon, the comparison vastly understates its true significance. Alibaba started out as a business-to-business operation but, really, it gave market opportunities to private entrepreneurs in a statist system heavily stacked against them.So why is the Chinese government clamping down on the private sector when liberalizing it has served the economy so well? The reasons are varied and complex: rising authoritarianism at home, statism, the trade war. But the effects already are clear, with ominous implications for the entire economy. Could there even be a new Alibaba today?Yasheng Huang is a professor of international management at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Advertisement"}

Mr. Chakrabarti said the team was particularly on guard for posts that manifested \u201creal-world harm,\u201d and planned to remove posts that tried to disenfranchise voters by giving incorrect polling data or spreading hoaxes like encouraging people to vote by text message. \u201cThe best outcome for us is that nothing happens in the War Room,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything else we are doing is defenses we are putting down to stop this in the first place.\u201dThe Federal Reserve is slowly raising interest rates to prevent the U.S. economy from overheating \u2014 a plan President Trump has publicly criticized.

{"Headline": "Jack Ma\u2019s American Dream Runs Up Against China First", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsJack Ma\u2019s American dream has woken up to a bitter reality. Alibaba\u2019s retiring founder rescinded a promise to create 1 million jobs in the United States. He blamed tariff tensions between the United States and China, but his $420 billion company has not given foreigners a level playing field on his international e-commerce site. Like any exporter, Mr. Ma\u2019s public championing of free trade blends enlightenment with self-interest.Alibaba.com was originally built to connect small Chinese wholesale manufacturers to overseas buyers. As domestic consumption boomed, however, the export operation was eclipsed by Taobao, Alibaba\u2019s eBay-like marketplace, and the complementary Tmall, which hosts stores for bigger retailers. When Mr. Ma met Donald Trump in January 2017 before his inauguration, the Alibaba chairman vowed that 1 million small American businesses would gain access over five years and lead to a similar number of jobs, helping rebalance trade in the process.Most of those smaller merchants would have set up shop on Tmall Global. Theoretically, this subsite provides an easier channel to sell directly to Chinese customers, without the hassle and expense of creating an onshore entity, as required by Tmall. It attracted Costco, Gerber and most recently U.S. grocery chain Kroger, which began peddling a modest line of vitamins and nuts in August.The portal hosts around 18,000 vendors, so 1 million more would have been impressive. Since shopkeepers pay for the privilege of a storefront, Alibaba\u2019s fees were more likely to rise than sales or jobs.The company does not break out specific sales figures for Tmall Global, describing it as a \u201ctesting ground.\u201d While Tmall.com is the fourth most-visited website in China, Tmall.hk, the domain for Tmall Global, ranks 357th, according to Alexa data. In essence, it\u2019s a smaller shopping center located far from where the Chinese action is. Why isn\u2019t exactly clear, but domestic vendors on Taobao might not be so receptive to foreign competition.Even the mainstream Tmall has lost some foreign interest of late. Some Western companies have complained about the cost, others of the grey marketeers reselling their brands \u2014 or counterfeits \u2014 next door at Taobao.Alibaba has gotten better at helping Chinese merchants sell overseas. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that per se, but it\u2019s hardly a solution to imbalanced trade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Has Put the U.S. and China on the Cusp of a New Cold War", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump is confident that the United States is winning its trade war with China. But on both sides of the Pacific, a bleaker recognition is taking hold: The world\u2019s two largest economies are in the opening stages of a new economic Cold War, one that could persist well after Mr. Trump is out of office.\u201cThis thing will last long,\u201d Jack Ma, the billionaire chairman of Alibaba Group, warned a meeting of investors on Tuesday in Hangzhou, China. \u201cIf you want a short-term solution, there is no solution.\u201dThe diplomatic stalemate has many in the business and policy communities considering the possibility that the United States may be in a protracted and economically damaging trade fight for years to come and wondering what, if anything, America will gain.Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia and an expert on China, said in an interview that 2018 signaled \u201cthe beginnings of a war of a different type: a trade war, an investment war and a technology war between the two great powers of the 21st century, with an uncertain landing point.\u201dThe latest tit-for-tat leaves little room for concessions, at least in the interim, as both countries dig in their heels and China tries to remain strong, despite an economic softening that Mr. Trump clearly sees as an opening to force Beijing\u2019s hand.Chinese growth in investment, factory production and consumer spending have all slowed this year, and its economic growth has slowed alongside. The situation is expected to worsen as effects of the escalating American tariffs ramp up.While the United States made overtures toward China in recent days to talk trade in Washington this month, some officials said they now doubted Beijing would engage again at a high level until after the midterm elections in November, when President Xi Jinping may meet Mr. Trump on the sidelines of an economic summit meeting in Buenos Aires.Mr. Trump himself seemed to dangle the prospect that he, and he alone, could broker a resolution that threatened to cause economic pain to companies and consumers on both sides of the Pacific.\u201cHopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection,\u201d Mr. Trump said in his statement announcing the tariffs.The Chinese side has its own political reasons to avoid capitulation. Acceding to Mr. Trump would be considered a sign of weakness for Mr. Xi, according to analysts.And they see no sign that China is willing to give up on Made in China 2025, an industrial program that aims for dominance in robotics, artificial intelligence, and other high tech industries that have been the domain of the United States and Europe and that Mr. Trump has identified as a policy initiative that must be stopped.While Chinese officials have expressed a willingness to get rid of the name Made in China 2025, they have been much more cautious about accepting limits on some of the crucial features of the country\u2019s industrial policy, like big loans from state-owned banks at very low interest rates to favored industries.Inside the White House, there remains a pitched battle between those who want to make a deal with Beijing and those who are determined to keep piling on pressure to force a more radical change in its trade practices. At the moment, the hard liners have Mr. Trump\u2019s ear.\u201cYou would expect the administration to have tabled a negotiating text with a clear set of commitments, but that has apparently not been done,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThere are some in the administration who see tariffs as an end in themselves.\u201dMr. Price said the Trump administration had done a good job of cataloging China\u2019s abuses: theft of intellectual property, forced transfer of technology from foreign companies, predatory joint venture agreements. But it has failed to marshal a coalition to confront China, instead provoking separate trade fights with the European Union, Japan, Canada and Mexico by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum and threatening additional taxes on imported cars.\u201cDoing this without the E.U. and Japan fully on board as though Chinese unfair trade practices were only a bilateral problem is wrongheaded and certainly less effective,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very hard to galvanize your allies when you impose steel and aluminum tariffs on them and threaten auto tariffs.\u201dFor China, a complicating factor is figuring out who has influence in Mr. Trump\u2019s White House. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been leading the negotiations, invited China\u2019s top trade negotiator, Liu He, to Washington for a meeting next week, even though his last visit ended badly when Mr. Trump spurned a deal that would have cut the American trade deficit with China.Mr. Mnuchin believes the United States must be open to talks as long as China is willing to address structural issues, including the trade gap between what America exports and what it imports, pressure on American companies to hand over valuable technology as a condition for doing business in China and intellectual property theft.Other senior officials, notably Peter Navarro, who oversees the office of trade and manufacturing policy, have told colleagues that inviting the Chinese now was a sign of weakness. Mr. Navarro, an economist who made his name with book titles like \u201cDeath by China,\u201d is among those who favor putting more pressure on China to force a change in its behavior.It is not clear whether Mr. Liu will visit Washington next week. But even if he does, people who have spoken to Chinese officials said the unraveling of the agreement Mr. Liu believed he had struck on his last visit would make him reluctant to make any deal this time.\u201cThe Chinese deep learning from that is, \u2018We should not substantively re-engage until the administration has its internal house in order,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Rudd, who is now the president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.After months of bruising encounters with Mr. Trump, Mr. Rudd said Chinese officials recognized that they would need to change their policies on trade and market access. But he said Mr. Xi was no less likely than Mr. Trump to risk losing face by giving in to American pressure.\u201cChina has politics too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole notion of \u2018back down\u2019 and \u2018face\u2019 is as live a consideration within internal Chinese politics as it is within U.S. politics.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s aggressive moves drew intense criticism from some quarters at home. Fred Smith, the chief executive of FedEx and an enthusiastic supporter of the president\u2019s tax cuts, called his trade policy a form of mercantilism that was \u201cworrisome to everyone.\u201dBut Mr. Trump has shown little sign of changing course. While there are differences among members of his economic team, there is a broad consensus in the administration about taking a hawkish stance toward China. Some point to evidence that the trade pressure on China was making it less adventurous in the East China Sea, where it spars regularly with Japan.Mr. Trump has forged ahead with tariffs even while saying that the trade tensions were making China less cooperative in pressuring North Korea on its nuclear arsenal \u2014 a claim that puzzles some of his own advisers.\u201cThey have been helpful; I hope they\u2019re still helpful,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference Tuesday with the Polish president, Andrzej Duda. \u201cThere\u2019s a question about that.\u201dBut the president added, \u201cIt got to a point where the numbers were too big.\u201d China \u201crebuilt their country with tremendous amounts of money pouring out of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve changed that around.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "JD.com Chairman Richard Liu Arrested in U.S. in Sexual Misconduct Case", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The billionaire founder of JD.com, one of China\u2019s largest and most successful online retailers, was arrested Friday in Minnesota for alleged sexual misconduct before being released a day later, police records show.Police officials in Minneapolis said they were treating the case as an active investigation.The matter is an another unwelcome bit of publicity for a company that symbolizes the business potential of China\u2019s rising middle class. The accusation could also be a test of JD.com\u2019s stability, as well as the ability of a Chinese technology company to rebound from the problems of its leaders. China\u2019s most powerful technology companies are still tightly controlled by their founders, so the fortunes of businesses worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars are closely intertwined with the fates of a small number of executives.JD.com, whose shares trade in the United States, has prospered by catering to the increasing sophistication of Chinese shoppers. Big global brands such as Nike, Prada and Levi\u2019s use JD.com\u2019s sales platform to reach the country\u2019s burgeoning middle class, and the company is closely watched as an indicator of consumer confidence.A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department said Mr. Liu was released \u201cpending formal complaint.\u201d Spokesman John Elder said the police could have held Mr. Liu in custody through Tuesday, but did not feel that was necessary while they conducted their investigation.The police will, after the investigation, recommend to prosecutors whether Mr. Liu should be charged with a misdemeanor or felony or face no charges, at which point the case would be closed.The company said that Mr. Liu\u2019s trip would continue as planned, but a spokeswoman declined to comment further. When asked when Mr. Liu would return to China, the spokeswoman said she did not have that information. Mr. Liu did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Liu has not been charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing in that case. But he tried to get an Australian court to prevent the release of his name in connection with the case by citing potential damage to his marriage and business, court documents show. In July, a judge in Australia rejected his request for a suppression order.JD.com is a heavyweight in China\u2019s technology scene, and Mr. Liu, its chairman and chief executive since its 2004 founding, is one of its leading lights. Legal troubles for Mr. Liu could darken perceptions overall of JD.com, whose shares trade on the Nasdaq stock market in New York and have a market value of around $50 billion.The company competes with Alibaba, the country\u2019s largest e-commerce provider, for the attention of China\u2019s increasingly affluent middle class, and says it has more than 300 million customers. It specializes in electronics such as smartphones and appliances.Alibaba and JD.com are both trying to lure high-end global brands to open virtual stores on their sales platforms. Alibaba says it has more than 570 million customers across its Chinese marketplaces.Whereas Alibaba operates platforms on which outside merchants sell their wares to consumers, JD.com\u2019s business model is more like Amazon\u2019s. It typically buys products from manufacturers and stores them in its own warehouses. JD.com has also invested in its own logistics network, which the company says helps provide quicker, more reliable delivery than Alibaba can offer. The company\u2019s major shareholders include Google and the Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent.For many companies with shops on the platform, JD.com offers a way into an exciting market. China\u2019s dramatic economic rise has meant that hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers are no longer content with shoddily made goods, and are ready to pay more for quality.But as the economy has shown signs of a slowdown in recent months, JD.com has suffered too. Last month it reported disappointing financial results, citing increasing competition.China\u2019s technology scene is young \u2014 many of its most influential companies were founded only in the past two decades \u2014 and company founders like Mr. Liu tend to retain outsize influence on their businesses, even as they grow large and list on public stock exchanges. Founders control voting rights and have ultimate say in matters large and small. Their personalities seep into the corporate culture.Mr. Liu was born in a poor part of Jiangsu Province in eastern China in the 1970s. When he earned a place at the prestigious Renmin University in Beijing, other people in the village scraped together cash and boiled eggs to sustain him in the capital.In the past, Mr. Liu has spent one day a year wearing JD.com\u2019s red uniform, riding an electric bike and making home deliveries. He likes to say that as the son of a poor family, he wants to treat his employees with fairness and respect.Raymond Zhong reported from Beijing, and Li Yuan from Hong Kong.

That legal battle was also settled Sunday night, and the company added six new directors, including three women.Not much will change for CBS in the short term, with Mr. Moonves\u2019s top lieutenant, Joseph Ianniello, taking over as interim C.E.O.His departure comes at a tough time for Alibaba and its peers. Beijing is tightening control of tech companies, which has squeezed a top rival, Tencent. And the Chinese economy is slowing, wounding competitors like JD.com.Volvo\u2019s C.E.O., Hakan Samuelsson, told the FT that \u201cconditions right now are not optimal,\u201d adding that outcomes of trade discussions between China, Europe, and the U.S. were \u201creally difficult to predict.\u201d He said that prospective investors, particularly Swedish pension funds, could be hurt by a drop in valuation. Instead, Volvo would prefer \u201cstable market conditions.\u201dThe company is taking steps to avoid U.S. tariffs, including shifting production of some models to Sweden to avoid a levy on Chinese-made vehicles. Mr. Samuelsson said that an I.P.O. was still in the cards \u2014 but that there was \u201c no hurry.\u201dRobert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, are trying to reach an agreement on a plan to cut tariffs on industrial goods to zero and prevent President Trump from carrying out a threat to impose 25 percent levies on car imports. An accord is unlikely on Monday, but businesses on both sides of the Atlantic will be looking for signs that the two sides are making progress.A German court will start hearing evidence today in a lawsuit filed by Volkswagen shareholders over the carmaker\u2019s emissions-testing scandal. The plaintiffs say that Volkswagen violated its responsibility to them when it used illegal software to cheat on emissions tests \u2014 and they\u2019re seeking billions of euros in damages.A victory may make amends for Elliott\u2019s failed bet in 2008 against Volkswagen shares. The hedge fund has claimed that market manipulation was to blame in that case, but courts never agreed.Higher prices would mean China\u2019s leaders would have to be careful as they seek ways to bolster slowing growth, lest their efforts drive up prices still further. The trade war with the United States could also lead to higher prices for Chinese consumers and companies as tariffs raise the cost of imported goods.Chinese economists say that there is no cause for alarm, and that some price increases may be temporary. But the consumer price index may understate the situation, so expect close scrutiny of prices over the coming weeks.Some investors and employees have said that the approach has stunted growth. But the company is worth $12.3 billion, its user base is expanding and there is wide speculation that it will go public next year. Which side is correct? As Ms. Griffith writes:If Pinterest continues its trajectory, it could change the narrative of what it takes to build a successful company in Silicon Valley, a meaningful feat at a time that the start-up world is seeking new templates for leaders. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll serve as another example of wasted potential, or worse, a cautionary tale.DealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

Mr. Ma turns 54 on Monday, which is also a holiday in China known as Teacher\u2019s Day.The retirement makes Mr. Ma one of the first founders among a generation of prominent Chinese internet entrepreneurs to step down from their companies. Firms including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com have flourished in recent years, growing to nearly rival American internet behemoths like Amazon and Google in their size, scope and ambition. For Chinese tycoons to step aside in their 50s is rare; they usually remain at the top of their organizations for many years.Mr. Ma, a natural salesman and charismatic leader, co-founded Alibaba with 17 others \u2014 some of them his students \u2014 out of his apartment in Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province in 1999.Alibaba started as an online marketplace for businesses to sell their products to other businesses. But it did not take off until it began the Taobao marketplace in 2003, which merchants used to sell goods directly to consumers. Alibaba later rolled out Alipay, an online payment service, to facilitate transactions in a country where few people had credit cards. Alipay later became Ant Financial, the financial subsidiary that Mr. Ma also controls.Today, Alibaba\u2019s empire encompasses e-commerce, online banking, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment \u2014 and even a corporate messaging service similar to Slack. The company owns or holds stakes in some of China\u2019s most important media assets, including the Twitter-like social media site Weibo and the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper The South China Morning Post.Among China\u2019s biggest companies, Alibaba is viewed as one of the firms with the deepest ranks of management talent. Many of the co-founders are still around, and professionals who joined the company later are now in charge.While Alibaba has become dominant in China, it has faced a tougher time expanding internationally. The company has increased its presence outside of China by investing in e-commerce and online finance companies in India and Southeast Asia. But its efforts to muscle into the United States largely have not been successful.As Beijing has increased its involvement in the private sector, Mr. Ma has shifted what he has said about China\u2019s government. He used to say that businesses should be in love with the government but never get married to each other, indicating that an arms-length relationship was preferred.At a conference last November, Mr. Ma was more positive. \u201cThere\u2019s no country like China in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWith political stability, social safety and 6 percent-plus economic growth, we have the best business environment.\u201dAs Alibaba has flourished, Mr. Ma has talked many times about how he did not want to spend his whole life at the company, saying he would retire one day and go back to teaching.In 2014, he created the Jack Ma Foundation, which has worked to improve education in rural China. Mr. Ma\u2019s Weibo social media handle is \u201cspokesman for village teachers \u2014 Jack Ma.\u201d Within Alibaba, he is known and referred to as \u201cTeacher Ma.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "China\u2019s Internet Obsesses Over Arrest of JD.com Founder Richard Liu", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldRichard Liu, the Chinese technology executive arrested in the United States on suspicion of sexual misconduct, has returned to China \u2014 where he is the No. 1 topic of conversation.Chinese news outlets and social media users were consumed on Monday by details of Mr. Liu\u2019s arrest. His mug shot, taken by law enforcement officials in Minnesota, was everywhere online. Chinese netizens speculated about how his wife \u2014 a celebrity in her own right, known as Sister Milk Tea \u2014 might respond, and parsed unfamiliar legal terms.The intense reactions to Mr. Liu\u2019s legal troubles reflect the public\u2019s fascination with China\u2019s self-made tech tycoons, who have become symbols of the country\u2019s rise as a global power and its upward social mobility. Their books are best sellers. Their private lives are tabloid fodder. Their speeches on success and entrepreneurship are perpetually running on TV screens at airports.In effect, they are the rock stars of China\u2019s Gilded Age, and Mr. Liu is one of the brightest. His company, JD.com, courts the country\u2019s growing middle class with quality brand products instead of the shoddy copycats that are common on the Chinese internet. Today, its shares trade on the Nasdaq at a market value of about $50 billion.John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, said Monday that the investigation was \u201creally in its infancy.\u201d\u201cWe are trying to ensure his rights while respecting the rights of the person who made the complaint,\u201d he said of Mr. Liu. Mr. Elder said the police had no legal authority to keep Mr. Liu from leaving the country as the investigation continued, but he expressed a \u201cvery strong belief we will be able to connect with him later.\u201dChinese internet users have obsessed over the minutiae of the case, many of them getting a crash course in the American legal system in the process.\u201cThis photo of Liu Qiangdong is called a mug shot,\u201d a blogger and journalist who goes by the name Michael Anti wrote on WeChat, the ubiquitous Chinese messaging and social media platform. He went on to explain that mug shots were considered public information in the United States, and can be released to the media.Descriptions of \u201cprobable cause\u201d and \u201creleased pending complaint\u201d were also widespread. There were even photographs and audio recordings of Mr. Elder.Others speculated over Mr. Liu\u2019s marriage to Zhang Zetian, who rose to fame as a student when a photo of her holding a cup of milk tea was widely shared on social media. Nicknamed \u201cSister Milk Tea,\u201d Ms. Zhang met Mr. Liu while she was studying in the United States, and they married in 2015. The couple have been both praised and criticized in China for cataloging online the intimate details of their lives, including their wedding and Ms. Zhang\u2019s pregnancy.Mr. Liu\u2019s arrest also prompted derision. In a previous video interview, he had insisted he had not married Ms. Zhang for her looks. \u201cI am face blind,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell who is pretty and who is not.\u201dReferring to those remarks, one online user joked, \u201cMaybe he mistook the other woman as Sister Milk Tea. He is face blind, after all.\u201dBeyond online comments, the case also put a spotlight on JD.com\u2019s fierce rivalry with the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and in particular the clash of personalities between the companies\u2019 founders.If the most intense reality show in the United States is national politics, business feuds take top billing in China. The workings of the government are carried out in a black box, off limits to media scrutiny and public discussion, but antagonism in the business world is carried out in the open. Among the business tycoons, the heads of China\u2019s internet companies are the hottest stars, the leaders of JD.com and Alibaba chief among them.Where Mr. Liu is like an aggressive boxer \u2014 a straight talker and a formidable disciplinarian \u2014 Alibaba\u2019s executive chairman, Jack Ma, is more of a tai chi master, skillful at gentle maneuvering. Even before his arrest in Minnesota, Mr. Liu was in the news a lot with a colorful private life and blunt speaking style.Born in a poor part of the eastern province of Jiangsu, Mr. Liu has made much of his Everyman credentials. Able to afford meat only once or twice a year, his family typically ate sweet potatoes and corn as dinner staples. Until recently, he would put on a helmet and JD.com\u2019s red uniform to make deliveries on a three-wheeled electric bike. He calls the 100,000-odd deliverymen who work for JD.com his \u201cbrothers,\u201d and often trumpets how much better they are paid than those employed by competitors.Both companies have tried to lure popular brands to open virtual stores on their sales platform, a battle playing out most aggressively in fashion, traditionally Alibaba\u2019s stronghold. Mr. Ma\u2019s company scored a major victory in 2015 when Uniqlo, the Japanese casual wear company, quit JD.com to sell its wares on Alibaba\u2019s platform. Last year, a group of apparel merchants also made the jump, a move that JD.com\u2019s chief financial officer said on a recent earnings call that the company was still recovering from. (Alibaba has denied it pressured any brands into exclusive arrangements.)There is no love lost between the two men, either. Mr. Ma famously once said that JD.com would eventually end as a \u201ctragedy,\u201d because its business model was excessively labor and capital intensive. Mr. Liu, for his part, has accused Alibaba of not doing enough to fight fakes on its platform, a charge Mr. Ma has denied.It is little wonder, then, that many Chinese internet users responded to the news of Mr. Liu\u2019s arrest by posting photographs of Mr. Ma laughing.Dave Philipps contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump to China: \u2018I Own You.\u2019 Guess Again. ", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Chinese are catching up to the U.S. in many ways, and the president grasps only part of the reason.Opinion ColumnistEarly in the movie \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d a Chinese-Singaporean father admonishes his young kids to finish their dinner, saying, \u201cThink of all the starving children in America.\u201d I\u2019m sure that everyone of my generation in the theater laughed at that joke. After all, we\u2019d all been raised on the line: \u201cFinish your dinner. Think of all the starving children in China.\u201dThat little line contained within it many messages: The first, which any regular traveler to China\u2019s biggest urban areas can tell you, is that rich China today \u2014 its luxury homes, cars, restaurants and hotels \u2014 is really rich, rich like most Americans can\u2019t imagine.The second is that this moment was destined to be a test of who will set the key rules of the global order in the 21st century: the world\u2019s long-dominant economic and military superpower, America, or its rising rival, China. And this test is playing out with a blossoming full-scale trade war.What does such a test of wills sound like? It sounds like a senior Chinese official telling me at a seminar at Tsinghua University in April that it\u2019s just \u201ctoo late\u201d for America to tell China what to do anymore on issues like trade, because China is now too big and powerful. And it sounds like President Trump, in effect, telling China: \u201cSays who? Show me what you got, baby!\u201d Or as Trump actually tweeted last week: \u201cWe are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. \u2026 If we meet, we meet.\u201dI guess we should be grateful that this confrontation has been confined to trade, but, as I said, it was inevitable. Because, as one top tech executive pointed out to me: \u201cChina is not a \u2018near peer\u2019 anymore. It is a peer.\u201dAs Mary Meeker\u2019s latest internet trends study noted, five years ago China had only two of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded tech companies, while the U.S. had nine. Today, China has nine of the top 20 \u2014 Alibaba, Tencent, Ant Financial, Baidu, Xiaomi, Didi, JD.com, Meituan and Toutiao \u2014 and the U.S. has 11. Twenty years ago, China had none.Do you see a trend? Do you hear footsteps? The total value of China\u2019s internet economy is already bigger than America\u2019s. And China\u2019s economy now is so cashless that many women no longer carry purses or men wallets \u2014 just a cellphone with mobile apps \u2014 to buy anything, or even donate to a beggar.And don\u2019t get me started on the biggest emerging work and services tool in the world \u2014 artificial intelligence. China\u2019s plan is to catch up to America in A.I. and surpass it as soon as possible, and it\u2019s well on its way. Because with A.I., the more training data you can feed the machine the faster it learns, the more patterns you can see and the more algorithms you can write to improve products and services or invent new ones. Because China has so many more people than we do, and so many more of them use mobile apps for their daily lives, China\u2019s ability to amass giant data sets and train more machines faster is considerable.\u201cIf data is the new oil, then China is the new Saudi Arabia,\u201d remarked Kai-Fu Lee, author of \u201cAI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.\u201dChinese companies are already the world leaders in computer vision/facial recognition and speech recognition, which can be used for commerce and for surveillance and societal control. In just the last two years there has been an explosion of fintech start-ups in China, offering mobile payments, lending, brokerage and banking. And the No. 1 and 3 drone manufacturers in the world \u2014 DJI and Xiaomi \u2014 are Chinese. France\u2019s Parrot is No. 2. At the same time, China is producing far more engineers and scientists than the U.S., and their quality is steadily rising.America today, by contrast, has become the unrivaled world leader in generating data about Donald Trump and from Donald Trump.In the daily barrage of Trump news and tweets, some Trump statements are actually true, though \u2014 like the need for the U.S. to confront China\u2019s unfair trade practices. China has grown incredibly these past 30 years with a very specific formula: hard work, unleashing capitalism, smart planning and long-range investments in education and infrastructure \u2014 but also by stealing intellectual property, forcing technology transfers and cheating on World Trade Organization rules.We have to respond. But wisely.Historically the U.S. could dominate the global scene and check a rising power like China, and set the global rules, with just our sheer physical mass \u2014 more money, more troops, more naval ships, more top-10 companies, more scientists and more universities. That is just not possible any longer, as China has become both big and smart in more and more areas. But all is not lost.It happens that we have three huge assets that China doesn\u2019t have, and is unlikely to acquire them anytime soon. We should be doubling down on our strengths: immigration, allies and values. Instead, Trump is squandering them.Also, we have real allies in a way China does not. China has clients, customers and frightened neighbors. It does not have real partners like Canada and Mexico. It doesn\u2019t have the whole Atlantic alliance with the European Union or tight relations with Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Australia \u2014 which we can leverage if we aren\u2019t doing stupid stuff, like slapping them with steel tariffs or tearing up the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Our nation has never been just a beacon for profit-making, which only measured countries by their trade balance with us. Our values attracted people to our shores and helped us spread our rules onto the wider world. When Trump tore up the TPP trade deal I\u2019m certain that he actually disappointed China\u2019s economic reformers, who wanted to use the pact to create pressures inside China to reform.Advertisement"}
