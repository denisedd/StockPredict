{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s China Fight Puts U.S. Tech in the Cross Hairs", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says his trade war with China will protect America\u2019s dominance and derail Beijing\u2019s plan for technological and economic supremacy.Mr. Trump\u2019s next round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods goes into effect on Monday, hitting thousands of consumer products from handbags to refrigerators to bicycles. The tariffs will also hit the tech and telecom companies that provide much of the gear that powers the internet, mobile networks, data storage and other technology. United States customs will begin collecting a tax on circuit boards, semiconductors, cell tower radios, modems and other products made and assembled in China and exported into America.Those tariffs, Intel warned in a letter last month, are \u201ca game changer for the American consumer.\u201d The tariffs begin at a rate of 10 percent and increase to 25 percent next January.Like American automakers and other manufacturers, the tech sector has increasingly outsourced production to China, where manufacturing and assembly of products is cheaper than in the United States. In recent decades, Intel, Dell, and Apple began shifting manufacturing overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and align operations closer to customers in emerging markets.Intel, for instance, designs and manufactures most semiconductors in the United States but relies on Chinese facilities for assembly of their chips, which will now be taxed. Moving those manufacturing and assembly operations outside of China is unrealistic, the company has warned, saying \u201cit is too expensive to relocate established and integrated supply chains.\u201dGoogle, Dell, IBM and others say the tariffs will increase costs for companies and consumers, hindering America\u2019s ability to dominate the next generation of technology, like 5G wireless networks. Rising prices, the industries say, will slow business growth, increase costs for consumers and put other nations, like China, in a more competitive position to dominate tech.\u201cThe tariffs affect the heart of the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank financed by tech companies including Microsoft, Google and Intel. \u201cIf we are going to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, we should impose them on items that hurt the Chinese, not us.\u201dMr. Trump does not share that view, seeing the tariffs as a weapon to force China to change trade practices that the administration \u2014 and many companies, including tech firms \u2014 say are unfair.\u201cChina is engaged in numerous unfair policies and practices relating to United States technology and intellectual property \u2014 such as forcing United States companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement last week.Tech companies agree that China has long pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business in China or engaged in outright theft of intellectual property. But they argue that using tariffs as a retaliatory measure will hurt American companies while doing little to change China\u2019s ways.Tech and telecommunications products are among the fastest growing imports from China. In 2014, electronics accounted for 40 percent of all Chinese imports, according to the United States International Trade Commission. While the total value of telecommunications parts affected by the latest round of tariffs is unclear, the Telecommunications Industry Association estimates \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in extra costs for companies.The impact on the industry is amplified by the timing, as the United States and China race one another to dominate the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks, known as 5G. The faster networks will fuel the use of artificial intelligence in driverless cars and robotics and other technologies used by military. Companies have warned that the administration\u2019s tariffs will undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s stated plan to lead in those areas.\u201cThese latest duties threaten to raise the cost of 5G infrastructure in the U.S. by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Nokia officials told the F.C.C., according to public filings.\u201cOf course, this is related to some of the product that we import into the U.S. that is manufactured in China, and we are very much focused on mitigating that manufacturing,\u201d Micron\u2019s chief executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in an interview on CNBC.Other companies are weighing legal options. A leading trade group, the Consumer Technology Association, which represents 2,000 tech companies, said the administration is overstepping its authority on trade policy and is considering legal action against the administration.\u201cWe are exploring all options,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the association\u2019s president, said when asked if his group would sue the administration. \u201cThe tariffs will stifle our global leadership in 5G, create and internet tax on business and cause uncertainty for companies.\u201dThe inclusion of tech products only increased tension between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Silicon Valley has sparred with Mr. Trump on immigration. Mr. Trump accused tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google of political bias against conservatives and Amazon of avoiding tax payments. The companies have refuted the president\u2019s claims.Some companies have been partially spared. After intense lobbying by Apple and Fitbit, the Trump administration removed several consumer electronics products from the latest round of tariffs. Left off the list are technologies that affect Apple\u2019s Watch and other fitness trackers, AirPod earbuds and wireless speakers. The administration spared a total of 300 products from an earlier proposal drafted in July.On Friday, a senior administration official who has been engaged in trade negotiations defended the decision to offer relief to Apple\u2019s products. In a briefing with reporters at the White House, the official rejected the notion that winners and losers were being determined based on lobbying power.\u201cThis has been talked about a lot as an Apple issue, Apple has been very vocal about it, but the tariff lines that have been exempted, they applied to a whole range of companies in addition to Apple,\u201d the official said, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the trade battle with China would be resolved.When asked about the exemptions of Apple\u2019s products, Mr. Cook said that while the iPhone is assembled in China, many parts are made and developed in the United States. The tariffs would cost a company like Apple when it imports devices assembled in China.\u201cI think they looked at this and said that it\u2019s not really great for the United States to put a tariff on those type of products,\u201d Mr. Cook said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Nokia\u2019s headquarters.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Doesn\u2019t Like Trump. It Can Still Work With the Government.", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAlex Karp grew up in a liberal household and considers himself a progressive. He voted for Hillary Clinton, and he lives and works in Silicon Valley.Yet Mr. Karp, the chief executive of Palantir, has found himself increasingly at odds with his peers in the technology industry as it publicly distances itself from the government, particularly the Department of Defense, under President Trump.Mr. Karp readily admits he would prefer that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t occupy the Oval Office. But he believes that Silicon Valley \u2014 already facing something of a crisis of user confidence over issues including privacy and foreign influence \u2014 is setting itself up for a fall.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very significant problem for the Valley,\u201d Mr. Karp, who rarely speaks publicly, said in an interview in his Manhattan office.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you stand up and talk to a Marine or a special operator and explain to them how you have a piece of software that will allow them to come home \u2014 or more likely allow them to come home \u2014 and you\u2019re not going to allow them to use it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a nearly impossible argument to make outside the Valley without people being legitimately pretty upset.\u201dAll of this has set off a quiet \u2014 but growing \u2014 debate across corporate America in the age of Trump: What does it mean to be a patriotic company when you vehemently disagree with your nation\u2019s leader?In truth, the ethical arguments are a diversion. This is political.And there is a real danger in letting politics undermine the storied relationship between the government and Silicon Valley \u2014 Hewlett-Packard built sonar, radar and aviation equipment for the government during World War II, for example \u2014 that has led to much of the innovation we enjoy today.Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School and a member of the Defense Innovation Board, an independent federal advisory committee set up under President Barack Obama, said he believed that the partisanship that was contributing to the debate would ultimately stifle innovation.\u201cI worry that it will stall progress,\u201d he said. \u201cInnovation has been fueled for decades by private-public partnerships. It smacks of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Even if you\u2019re not a fan of the president, you can still serve your country.\u201dMr. Karp, whose parents met at a civil rights demonstration, said he believed that American companies, including those in Silicon Valley, had a moral obligation to support the country and its military, no matter who was living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201cWe\u2019re proud that we\u2019re working with the U.S. government,\u201d he said.Of course, Mr. Karp certainly has an interest in maintaining relationships between the government and the technology sector. Palantir, which uses technology to analyze vast troves of data, was founded with the help of $2 million from the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s venture capital arm, and much of its business model was to use data to help the government in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. But that makes his willingness to be so forthright about his view of the president refreshing when his peers who may have similar views stay quiet.\u201cI obviously am very biased,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a problem if I go to a cocktail party in Silicon Valley because they want to know, \u2018Is it true that your product is used to target terrorists?\u2019 Yes. And some people don\u2019t agree with that. That\u2019s fine, by the way. I don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with that.\u201dHis outspokenness is even more surprising given that a co-founder of Palantir is Peter Thiel, a serial entrepreneur who has publicly supported Mr. Trump.\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the same people,\u201d Mr. Karp said without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to vote for the same people.\u201dStill, even if it is political allegiances that have prompted tech workers to push back, the ethical issues around artificial intelligence are not insignificant. Everyone from Elon Musk to Stephen Hawking has raised questions about technological warfare in the future. But we are still most likely decades away from those extreme kinds of worries being realized.Reid Hoffman, who founded LinkedIn and sold it to Microsoft, where he now sits on the board, said there were real worries about how the government would use powerful technologies like artificial intelligence.\u201cI think that the majority of Silicon Valley people have a strong worry/reflex against weapons,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who is a member of the Defense Innovation Board with Mr. Grant. The Trump administration, he said, has \u201camplified\u201d concerns over \u201cpossible bad government action.\u201dBut Mr. Karp said claims that a president could steer us toward an authoritarian world powered by artificial intelligence were too extreme.\u201cAmerica is a complicated modern democracy with numerous checks and balances so that no one person has the ability to do insane things,\u201d Mr. Karp said. With government work, he added, \u201cyou\u2019re buying into the inherent fabric and structure of the country.\u201dLost in the conversation in Silicon Valley is its own history. The internet itself was originally funded by an arm of the Defense Department that is now called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. As recently as the Obama administration, Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest technology giants embraced roles advising the government.But there is a difference between today\u2019s tech giants like Google and Facebook and those who turned the Santa Clara Valley into Silicon Valley. A bond with the government \u201cwas clearly not part of the founding of the consumer internet in any relevant way,\u201d Mr. Karp said.It is a connection that should be better understood by the employees now pushing for it to be severed. Those bright minds are able to have this debate in part because of the work done by their predecessors.And given the very real questions that have emerged about the benefits \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that the biggest tech companies truly offer society, those workers might want to rethink their position.As Mr. Karp pointed out when we talked about the big technology companies, \u201cIf actually the narrative was \u2018We are helping also with our defense,\u2019 then people would understand the value of these other things\u201d they do.There could come a time when Silicon Valley wishes it was waving that flag.Advertisement"}

Doing so may provide financial security, but there\u2019s no way to prevent new owners from exerting more editorial control in the future. And if the outlets can\u2019t make money, benefactors could sell them or shut them down.American financial titans like the Blackstone Group\u2019s Steve Schwarzman often lobbied presidents to go easy on China. Their hope: winning business in China, from advising on mergers to lending money and selling financial services. But Wall Street\u2019s influence in Washington isn\u2019t helping to ease trade tensions.Even as they win tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress, they appear to be able to do little to stop the trade war. \u201cWhat\u2019s really surprising is that the connections that used to work, the formula that used to work, just don\u2019t work at this point,\u201d said Marshall W. Meyer, an emeritus professor of management at the Wharton School of Business.Senior finance executives held talks with Chinese officials and bankers over the weekend. But with Wall Street holding less sway in Washington, the trade war (which could escalate this week; more on that below) might mean that such relationships won\u2019t pay off.The Tesla C.E.O. famously said that the company would have to endure \u201cproduction hell\u201d to speed up manufacturing of its Model 3 sedan.

{"Headline": "Once a Summer Camp, Now a Family Home", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the Connecticut wilderness, the Portuguese hotel designer Alexandra Champalimaud has created an unexpected respite.SUMMER CAMP HAS lodged itself in the collective American imagination as deeply as corn on the cob and the white picket fence. Close your eyes and you can see it: children cannonballing into a chilly lake, lariats and potholders being loomed, marshmallows toasting in the fire beneath a canopy of pines.The aesthetic inspirations for the traditional sleepaway, in all its puritanical rigor, were likely the 19th-century ur-WASP family \u201cgreat camps\u201d \u2014 those grand but rustic compounds built by wealthy industrialists in the Adirondacks. But American summer camp as we know it was largely an early 20th-century creation of social reformers concerned about the welfare of middle-class children in the city. After World War I, the cause was taken up by East Coast Jews with roots in Eastern Europe: Borrowing from both Yankee simplicity and the naturalist movement that gave birth to the Boy Scouts of America in 1910, they opened hundreds of camps in wooded lake areas of New England and Pennsylvania. Children could escape places like the Lower East Side and Brooklyn and learn sports and quintessentially American hobbies including archery and horseback riding, thus helping their assimilation. The now wince-inducing Native Americanisms (and, for that matter, ersatz Native Americanisms) that became the overnight camps\u2019 lingua franca \u2014 Color War! \u2014 were intended to evoke a simpler, more natural time.Many camp cultists will tell you that the bonding rituals and singalongs of Okeechobee and Minnehaha shaped their character, but their experiences were also defined, if more subtly, by the radically pared-down structures and their barely furnished interiors, sited to take advantage of the waterside and the woods. The minimalist camps were neither unimaginative nor merely austere: Instead, they symbolized an earlier America of slow and humble pleasures, where a preindustrial, even feral, childhood was still attainable. Uninsulated cabins, called bunks, made of two-by-fours, sometimes without electricity or indoor plumbing, ringed a central wash house. The dining hall, where \u201cbug juice\u201d \u2014 watered-down Kool-Aid \u2014 flowed, was cavernous and dark, with raw wooden struts. Ramshackle outbuildings often were lovingly referred to as shacks \u2014 the art shack, the nature shack \u2014 itself sometimes a generous characterization.The dream of resurrecting such simple summer pleasures is precisely what attracted Bruce Schnitzer, an erudite Texas-born private-equity investor, now in his 70s, to Camp Kent, a defunct summer camp on 270 acres off the pristine South Spectacle Lake in South Kent, in Litchfield County, Conn., two hours north of New York City. In 1984, recently separated, he had been looking for a modest lake cottage to share with his two young daughters \u2014 an occasional summer getaway from their weekend house, a 1754 national historic landmark Georgian colonial in the nearby town of Litchfield. Instead, he fell in love with the sprawling camp, opened in the 1920s as Camp Milford, a getaway for adults that later converted to a children\u2019s camp attended mostly by teenagers from Long Island until it closed in 1982. He convinced a handful of partners to buy the property \u2014 which included about 30 tiny, mostly disintegrating bunkhouses and a couple dozen other structures in various stages of decay \u2014 with him, but he retained the heart of the camp for himself.The key was to preserve that magic, says the couple, who married 23 years ago. Thus they have maintained as many of the original quirks as possible \u2014 signs painted willy-nilly on walls by campers of yore, an errant fern growing through the foundation, original beams and off-kilter window frames \u2014 while also adapting it for their blended family, which comprises four adult children and their spouses, as well as nine grandchildren. Champalimaud is known for intense historical research, channeling a panoply of styles and creating supremely luxurious hotels honed to a fine, modernist edge. So she considers her deep dive into the summer camp vernacular a joyful escape from the compulsion to smooth away rough edges \u2014 a chance to embrace imperfection. Her time at Camp Kent may be, she says, among her purest, finest moments. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize, but this really is more of the real me,\u201d she says. \u201cI took four teenagers down the Rio Negro in the Amazon as a single mom. I can really rough it. I know it\u2019s not what you\u2019d think, but I find over-the-top, obvious luxury a bit revolting.\u201dOver the years, the couple has done significant work to the property \u2014 foundations dug, buildings razed or moved. And yet, even as you run your hands along the rough, untreated pine walls, it is virtually impossible to parse what has been replaced or reimagined from what is original. \u201cBruce\u2019s main need was that it not be overdone \u2014 or really \u2018done\u2019 at all,\u201d says Champalimaud.The kitchen, located in what was once the theater\u2019s backstage area, is pointedly free of gleaming marble. Instead, there are cabinets painted coral and counters in wood, stainless steel and what Champalimaud calls \u201csome early form of Formica.\u201d Anyone who put sweat equity into the house \u2014 which includes many of the couple\u2019s and their children\u2019s friends \u2014 was invited to paint their name on the walls, adding to decades of campers\u2019 monikers already there.For living quarters, they moved one of the still-sound bunks to create an insulated three-bedroom, two-bath wing, which they connected to the theater. Above the original trusses, they added a \u201csugar house\u201d roof, a raised addition with windows based on the roofs of maple syrup distilling shacks, to let in more light. The d\u00e9cor in these rooms feels native to the place and definitively sparse: a mix of good 18th-century and midcentury antiques and rustic indigenous touches \u2014 there\u2019s a pair of red leather Danish Kaare Klint chairs in the master bedroom, but there\u2019s also a bed frame built from still-barked narrow tree branches from the property.The couple is known for throwing rowdy parties where a local band plays Grateful Dead covers, though the house has seen more formal moments as well: Lopo was married with a candlelight dinner for 150 in the theater and both of Schnitzer\u2019s daughters, Eliza and Annabel, also celebrated their weddings at Camp Kent. Still, on most summer weekends there is just a jumble of small children and a lot of food. You can hear the sounds of gin rummy echo through the theater and smell corn roasting outside on the grill. Champalimaud dons a wet suit daily \u2014 a nook in the theater holds an array of watersport gear for guests, as well Ping-Pong paddles and yoga mats \u2014 and pushes off from the T-shaped dock to swim across the lake. \u201cI think of this place as a testimony to the absurdity of the notion that everything has to be embellished,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople knew that when they built these camps. Making things fancy just gets in the way of a good time.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Most Fun (and Useful) Things You Can Do With an Amazon Echo or Google Home", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySmart home devices will tell you the weather and answer trivia questions, sure, but they can do so much more. Try these tips to streamline your day, relax a little or just have some fun.If you\u2019re an Amazon Echo or Google Home owner, you may only ask your device for the weather or to play music. That\u2019s O.K., but these devices can do so much more \u2014 and they can offer more than a few useful tricks to make you feel as if you\u2019re living in the future.Both the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa offer a \u201croutines\u201d skill, which automates certain tasks based on a single command. For example, you can ask your Amazon Echo or Google Home to tell you the weather and what\u2019s on your calendar for the day, after saying \u201cAlexa, start my day\u201d or \u201cHey Google, good morning.\u201d With this particular routine, there are nine actions the Google Home can perform, including reading the day\u2019s top stories or local news, and then transition into six other actions like playing your favorite music or a preferred podcast to finish up your \u201cmorning.\u201d On the Echo, there are four basic options, but you can add eight more to lengthen the routine.The Google Home has six ready-to-go routines that you can customize in the Google Home app, and the Amazon Echo has one. You can also create completely custom routines on both devices.Parents, this one might be a lifesaver \u2014 for your voice: Both products let you broadcast an announcement across other devices in your home. So, if you have an Echo in the kitchen, living room and a child\u2019s bedroom, you can say, \u201cAlexa, announce that dinner is ready,\u201d and Alexa will repeat the message on each device in your voice \u2014 no skill necessary. With the Google Home and Google Home Mini, you can do a similar command: \u201cHey Google, tell everyone it\u2019s time to go.\u201d If you\u2019re an iOS user and want to do this but you\u2019re away from home, you\u2019ll have to separately download the Google Assistant app (Android users already have the Assistant enabled if they have the latest version of the operating system).You might\u2019ve heard of this but were dubious whether hands-free calling was actually possible, or easy. The good news: It is. The so-so news: There are a few steps you need to take before your hands-free calling dreams come true.For now, both devices don\u2019t support calling emergency services, so no \u201cAlexa, call 911\u201d for you. Hands-free calling with Alexa works only in the United States, Canada and Mexico and only in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. for the Google Home.You may already know you can add items to a shopping list with both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, then pull it up to review when you go shopping later. What you may not know is you can shop directly from both devices. They work with takeout restaurants like Pizza Hut and Dominos and traditional retailers like Target and Walmart.On the Amazon Echo, predictably you can shop only at Amazon. Also, while anyone with an Amazon account can shop by voice and add items to the Amazon cart, Amazon Prime Members get a special benefit. They can ask the smart assistant, \u201cAlexa, what are your deals?\u201d to hear exclusive deals just for them \u2014 and deals that are available only through voice shopping year-round.If you\u2019re learning a new language, or just encounter a word you\u2019d love to translate into another language, both devices can help.Both devices can also help you calm down with commands like \u201cO.K. Google, help me relax,\u201d and sounds like rain falling will play \u2014 or white noise if you\u2019re using it to go to sleep. The Echo is similar, but you can pick and choose what types of sounds you want to hear from the skills store. Google can also play \u201csleep sounds,\u201d which are really lullabies meant for children, while the Echo offers white or ambient noise. Just say \u201cAlexa, help me sleep\u201d for options.Sure, these devices can play music and add items to your cart, but it\u2019s a little annoying to start every single request with \u201cAlexa\u201d or \u201cO.K. Google.\u201d Thankfully, Amazon and Google realized this. On the Google Home, the \u201cContinued Conversation\u201d feature allows you to ask your device a question, and the microphone stays on for eight additional seconds to see if you\u2019ll ask a follow-up. (You do need to enable this in the settings of the Google Home app, as the feature is turned off by default.) The Amazon Echo also has the feature, except Amazon calls it \u201cFollow-up mode\u201d and you also have to turn it on in the app before using it.Once it\u2019s on, you can ask questions like \u201cWho sang \u2018In My Feelings?,\u2019\u201d and once your device responds with \u201cDrake,\u201d you can ask \u201cHow old is he?\u201d and the device will not only know who \u201che\u201d refers to but also answer without missing a beat. (Spoiler: Drake is 31.)This feature has also paved the way to ask the device to do multiple things in one command. For example, with \u201cmultiple actions\u201d on Google Home devices, you can say something like \u201cHey Google, turn up the thermostat and tell me the weather.\u201d On the Echo, you can\u2019t do it in a single sentence, but with follow-up mode you can just ask the two different commands one after the other.Google\u2019s later start in the smart home arena wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. The extra time allowed it to come up with some truly useful exclusive features. For example, if you download and use the Google Assistant app in addition to Google Home, you can ask Google to remind you to do something at a certain location. So, if you need to buy milk at the grocery store, you can say \u201cHey Google, remind me to buy milk at the grocery store,\u201d and as soon as you\u2019re near your preferred store (which Google will ask you to specify), your phone will let you know what you need.And if you\u2019re in the mood for a nice story at the end of a long workday, just say \u201cHey Google, tell me something good,\u201d and Google Assistant will read some \u201cfeel-good\u201d stories.With these new commands, you and your home should be on the way to becoming smarter \u2014 and more useful. Sure, these devices can play music and set timers, but these tips can help you get even more of your money\u2019s worth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Dominates as a Merchant and Platform. Europe Sees Reason to Worry.", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many independent merchants who sell their goods on Amazon, there has long been deep concern that if the e-commerce giant saw a particular product selling well, the company would duplicate it, but at a lower price.The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief said on Wednesday that there may be reason for worry.Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s competition commissioner, announced the start of an investigation into whether Amazon is unfairly using data collected about third-party sellers to make its own decisions about products to sell \u2014 information that would give it a potentially anticompetitive edge.Ms. Vestager, the world\u2019s most aggressive regulator of American technology giants, said that Amazon\u2019s dual position as host of the largest online platform for third-party sellers and as a retailer of goods deserved a closer look from European investigators. Her office has sent a number of questionnaires to market participants to learn more about Amazon\u2019s practices.\u201cThe question here is about the data,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at a news conference on Wednesday. She said that she wanted to know whether Amazon used data collected from merchants to make its own calculation about \u201cwhat is the new big thing, what it is that people want, what kind of offers do they like to receive, what makes them buy things?\u201dShe called the investigation \u201cpreliminary,\u201d and noted that a formal inquiry had not been started. European antitrust investigations can take years to complete.\u201cIt is very early days in this antitrust investigation into Amazon\u2019s business practices,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Amazon had no immediate comment.Most of the products sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers who use the platform to find customers. The practice has been mutually beneficial: Merchants get access to Amazon customers they would not otherwise be able to reach, while Amazon is able to offer a wider range of products and to collect a fee from any goods that are sold. Just over half of the company\u2019s unit sales globally come from third-party sellers.Amazon, she added, can use sales data about other merchants to improve its offerings.This is not the first time Amazon has been in Ms. Vestager\u2019s sights. Last year, her office ordered Luxembourg to collect 250 million euros, or about $290 million at current exchange rates, in back taxes from the online retail giant.An earlier version of this article, using information from an Amazon spokesman, referred incorrectly to the proportion of Amazon\u2019s sales that come from third-party sellers.

{"Headline": "Anthony Hopkins Returns to \u2018King Lear,\u2019 Finally Up to the Challenge", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAMPHIRE HOE, England \u2014 High above the sea, on the white cliffs of Dover, soldiers hoisted equipment and secured tents in what looked like a military encampment. A man appeared at the edge of a tent, his white hair close-cropped, his grizzled face shadowed by a ragged beard. \u201cShall we get on with it?\u201d Anthony Hopkins said.This \u201cKing Lear\u201d \u2014 a production from the BBC and Amazon and co-starring Emma Thompson, Emily Watson, Florence Pugh and Andrew Scott \u2014 is directed by Richard Eyre, who also adapted the text, shrinking a play that usually runs three hours or more into an action-driven 115 minutes. Mr. Eyre has placed his Lear in a contemporary Britain where the king is a military dictator. Viewers are first greeted with sweeping views of the glass-and-steel skyscrapers and bridges of the London skyline, before Mr. Eyre\u2019s camera alights on the Tower of London, a symbol of military might since William the Conqueror erected fortifications on the site in 1066.And Mr. Hopkins\u2019s Lear is at first every inch the tyrant; a blunt, gruff, arrogant man used to obedience and obeisance, incapable of reflection or empathy. Or as he put it pithily between takes, \u201ca punchy old guy.\u201dIt\u2019s a bit of a shock to see Mr. Hopkins playing Lear at all; after all, he had forsworn the stage (and Shakespeare, for the most part) nearly 30 years ago. But time, along with some family memories and the proliferation of well-funded prestige TV, has spurred him to tackle the role once again.A much younger Mr. Hopkins took on the challenging part in a 1986 production at London\u2019s National Theater, directed by David Hare. \u201cIt was a terrific production, but I soon realized I wasn\u2019t going to hit the mark,\u201d Mr. Hopkins said in a telephone interview from his home in Malibu, Calif., at the end of August. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to have muscular, lumpen energy to play Lear. Or any part.\u201dSoon after Lear, he played Antony to Judi Dench\u2019s Cleopatra. \u201cI thought at that point: These are proper actors who can speak verse. I\u2019m not in their league. I knew I was in the wrong world.\u201dIn an email after the interview, Mr. Hopkins offered further ruminations on the decision to leave the stage, which he did in 1989. \u201cI think there was and still is, probably, something in me that balked against the dark \u2018seriousness\u2019 of everything to do with acting,\u201d he wrote. He added that a \u201cproblem of my own creation was a feeling of alienation, not being up to the mark, not educated \u2014 all that mishmash of insecurity.\u201d\u201cWhen we filmed those scenes, it was the first time in around 30 years that Tony had been on a stage,\u201d said Mr. Callender, whose company Playground has produced \u201cKing Lear\u201d with Sonia Friedman Productions and Lemaise Pictures Limited. \u201cIt was extraordinary and very moving. I went to Richard and said, \u2018Would you do it?\u2019\u201dMr. Eyre had directed the play in 1997 and was hesitant about revisiting familiar territory, but he was finally persuaded by the chance to direct Mr. Hopkins. For 18 months before the rehearsal and filming period began, he said he received and replied to almost daily emails from Mr. Hopkins about the role.\u201cRichard may have got bored of my notes, but I had total recall of what I did and what I did misguidedly,\u201d Mr. Hopkins said. \u201cNow I think Lear is afraid of the feminine \u2014 in himself and in his daughters. I think he treated Cordelia like a tomboy, a chip off the old block, and when she rejects him, I think it releases something in him. He rampages through the rest of the play until he ends up on skid row, a tramp wheeling a shopping trolley.\u201d (Mr. Callender said that several people mistook Mr. Hopkins for a homeless man during the filming of these scenes.)Mr. Hopkins added that he had drawn from memories of his father and grandfather. \u201cThey were very instrumental in my life \u2014 very tough men, old school: Pull yourself together, man up, nothing touchy-feely,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cMy father was a baker, very rough around the edges but with a great lust for life. My Lear feels very much like him, particularly in the storm scene. I laugh at the storm, laugh at the elements and in the face of faith. And Richard encouraged me to follow my instincts and go over the top.\u201dAlthough he is known for his intense preparation for his roles, Mr. Hopkins is matter of fact about his methods. \u201cThe text is like a cobbled street,\u201d he said. \u201cI pull the stones out, see what\u2019s underneath and how they connect, then replace them. It\u2019s not complicated. When I hear people talking on television about \u2018process,\u2019 I think, shut up and get on with it.\u201dA two-week rehearsal period allowed the cast to bond and \u201cexamine the themes that Richard wanted to draw out,\u201d said Ms. Thompson, who plays Goneril. These themes, she said, centered on the notion \u201cthat cruelty in parenting undoes the family but also the state; that a state without love and wise leadership is a nihilistic, baleful place.\u201dMs. Thompson, who has starred alongside Mr. Hopkins before, in \u201cHowards End\u201d and \u201cThe Remains of the Day,\u201d said that the entire company of actors felt \u201cprivileged to witness him tackle the part.\u201d\u201cThere was this sense of something ultimate, an apogee of some kind,\u201d she added. \u201cTony is one of our greatest actors, and here he was, playing one of the greatest roles ever written.\u201dMr. Hopkins brushed aside these accolades. \u201cYou have to be very careful about the narcissism of the lead actor,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I liked about Richard\u2019s \u2018Lear\u2019 was the lack of lack of ceremony, no kowtowing and bowing. I liked the raw, brutal approach; come in, speak your lines and get off.\u201dHe added: \u201cI was trying too hard the first time. Now I have more experience, and I wanted to prove I had the stamina and the chutzpah. As Goethe said, every old man knows what Lear is about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \u201cIt creates conflicts of interest. Journalism, business and politics don\u2019t mix.

You\u2019re going to turn off a nice chunk of your customers.\u201dThe purchases of struggling journalistic institutions by billionaires and other wealthy executives, whether their motives are selfless or selfish, have repercussions for the companies whose success provided the cash. Boards of directors must wonder whether such purchases are good for business, and shareholders might have their own concerns.Mr. Benioff said he had notified his board when he was considering buying Time.\u201cI always bring my board into everything I do,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in an email. \u201cAs for the board, I am for over-communication and complete transparency.

Investments in newspapers and other media companies were typically seen as adding a halo to executives\u2019 other work \u2014 and possibly even giving them, and by extension their company, leverage in local or national politics.But that was a different time, one that ended with Mr. Trump\u2019s election.\u201cI think it fair to ask whether the problem here is correctly framed as Bezos\u2019 and Benioff\u2019s ownership of media properties, or whether the problem is President Trump\u2019s reaction to media criticism, regardless of ownership,\u201d said Joseph A. Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School and a director at the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.The Benioffs have taken pains to emphasize that the purchase was theirs alone, and that they will be caretakers of the brand, not editorial decision makers.That last sentence would normally be intended to reassure Time\u2019s journalists, but in this environment, it may also be a message to those in Washington.Of course, whether media owners meddle in the journalism or not, they are invariably painted as if they did. For years, conspiracy theories were floated that Carlos Slim Hel\u00fa, the Mexican billionaire who bought a stake in The New York Times after the financial crisis, was somehow pulling the levers of the newsroom. That was not the case, but the belief nonetheless persisted among opponents of the newspaper.Mr. Bezos and The Post\u2019s leadership have repeatedly said he has no involvement in any coverage decisions, yet on any given day opponents of the paper offer theories online about how an article was skewed to do Amazon\u2019s bidding.The Post\u2019s coverage of Mr. Trump has helped put \u2014 or at least keep \u2014 Amazon in Mr. Trump\u2019s cross hairs. He has complained loudly that Amazon pays too little in taxes, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hinted over the summer that the administration might take \u201ca position\u201d on tax policy related to the company. Mr. Trump also issued an executive order to have the United States Postal Service\u2019s finances evaluated as part of his assertion that Amazon receives special subsidies.So while that all appears to be just talk so far, it could have an economic impact on Amazon.And that makes corporate governance experts ask whether a company like Salesforce may want to add a new item to its \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in its annual report. It might read: Our leader owns Time magazine, which writes articles that sometimes upset and offend all sorts of people, including regulators, politicians and, often, the president of the United States, which could create additional political or regulatory issues.\u201cIt adds risk,\u201d said Bill George, a director of Goldman Sachs and a senior fellow at Harvard Business School. \u201cIt can draw feedback from the president.\u201dMr. George said board oversight of outside purchases was a matter of \u201cdiffering opinions.\u201d While certain combinations of businesses would create clear conflicts of interest, he said, a tech mogul\u2019s buying a news outlet didn\u2019t look like a problem to him. Even so, he recognized the potential for executives\u2019 investments to create a problem.\u201cI don\u2019t know where you draw the line on C.E.O.s\u2019 personal investments,\u201d Mr. George said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very gray area.\u201dFor now, let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t become a genuine problem given the number of journalistic institutions that may need a benefactor.Advertisement"}

But few have been as perplexing to New Delhi, or left as bitter a taste, as President Trump\u2019s tendency to mock Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s accent in English.This is the diplomatic headache that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will confront when he arrives in the Indian capital on Wednesday with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. Tiptoeing around the president\u2019s indiscretions is one in a suddenly long list of challenges to a relationship that, according to senior State Department officials, Mr. Pompeo would very much like to preserve \u2014 and even improve.Under Mr. Mattis, the Pentagon has been equally committed to the partnership. It has even renamed its Hawaii-based American combatant command that oversees the Pacific region as the Indo-Pacific Command as a lure for India to increase its partnership with the United States and other allied forces.India\u2019s rise was seen as such an obvious win for the United States that previous presidents mostly overlooked New Delhi\u2019s reflexive trade protectionism. And if the Indians wanted to get some military equipment from Russia, that was seen as acceptable to Washington \u2014 as long as it meant India was becoming more powerful.But a November summit meeting between them went poorly after Mr. Trump berated Mr. Modi over trade issues, particularly India\u2019s tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Mr. Trump\u2019s decisions in recent months to impose sanctions on Iran and Turkey had spillover effects on India, pushing down the value of the rupee.\u201cThe Americans are suddenly telling us that we can\u2019t buy missiles and oil, and nobody knows what to do about it,\u201d said Mohan Guruswamy, a distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in India.\u201cThe White House approach to every country now is that we want you to cave on these random issues we have chosen, which are prioritized by nothing more than presidential whim,\u201d said Michael Green, a top Asia adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cAnd you have to visibly lose on them. There are no win-wins.\u201dStill, there is a good chance ties will continue to improve.Even Pakistan, India\u2019s traditional rival, is increasingly being seen in New Delhi as little more than a Chinese proxy.\u201cThe thinking inside and outside government has changed radically, with China now seen as our biggest threat,\u201d said Lalit Mansingh, once India\u2019s top career diplomat. \u201cAnd if you look at China as a threat, you look around to see who can help us to defend against China. And it\u2019s the U.S.\u201dBut no one in the upper echelons of Mr. Modi\u2019s government is quite sure how to deal with Mr. Trump, whose moods and demands even American diplomats seem unable to predict, Indians say.Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mattis must reassure the Indians without dismissing Mr. Trump\u2019s concerns or promising that he will not latch onto some new concern \u2014 a test Mr. Tillerson failed.\u201cThe erratic quality of this White House leaves everyone in the position not of trying to maximize the gains of the relationship, but instead trying to minimize the risks,\u201d said Ashley J. Tellis, who was one of Mr. Bush\u2019s top diplomats. \u201cEveryone is struggling to deal with it, and India is no exception.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Thumps Don\u2019t Cause Stock Slumps", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWall Street is learning to live with President Trump\u2019s criticism of prominent companies.Mr. Trump has made a habit of attacking well-known public corporations, including Amazon, Harley-Davidson and Google. In some cases, his supporters have piled on with threats to boycott the companies\u2019 products or services. The stocks of those firms have come under pressure as investors worry that business will suffer.But a look back at months of critical presidential tweets, and their effect on stock prices, suggests that investors are shrugging off Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides. The stocks of targeted companies typically recover, and there is little, if any, discernible harm done to their business.Nike is the latest firm Mr. Trump has singled out. The sportswear company confirmed this week that it had entered into a new marketing deal with Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback. Mr. Kaepernick made headlines in 2016 for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, and has not played in the N.F.L. since the end of that season.Nike may yet suffer. The same people boycotting the N.F.L. because of player protests during the national anthem may shun its products. Companies selling a narrow range of items to consumers are most at risk to a buyers\u2019 strike. But Nike may also benefit. Mr. Trump\u2019s castigations, and Nike\u2019s support of Mr. Kaepernick, may generate higher sales.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms can at times seem to affect the shares of the companies he targets.Even so, the company\u2019s shares have recently rallied and now trade at more or less the same price they did just before the announcement of its production shift.This suggests that investors may have adopted a simple rule: Keep an eye on what the government does, not what the president says.And even if the Trump administration were to threaten more actions against companies, it may not succeed in doing much harm to the firms, or it may simply fail to follow through.Investors may hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets amount to little more than noise, and that the rule of law and other constraints will prevent him from taking actions that could harm corporate profits.Any tweets from the president on this battle could move markets.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Farhad Manjoo, your technology columnist \u2014 and more important for our purposes today, I\u2019m a guy who has been to every Apple iPhone-unveiling event since the first one, all the way back in 2007. (If I were single, this would make a killer Tinder profile, right?)But I come to you today to praise rather than complain. Because this year, I did find myself getting a little out of my seat and my picture of the future expanded to include possibilities I hadn\u2019t considered viable before. For the first time in years, I was truly surprised.There\u2019s just one catch: I felt this way about Apple\u2019s new watch, not its smartphone. The phones were fine. Apple\u2019s going to sell a lot of them and make a lot of money, as it does every year. But it\u2019s the watch that might change the future most arrestingly.The big deal: The new Apple Watch packs a slew of sensors to make it a truly novel kind of wearable device \u2014 something like a \u201cStar Trek\u201d tricorder on your body. The new watch can administer a medically accurate electrocardiogram, a test of a person\u2019s heart rhythm that can help detect dangerous health conditions. It also detects and alerts rescue personnel to dangerous falls, a leading cause of injury, especially for older people.One detail was particularly compelling. Apple received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its device, meaning that when you take your watch\u2019s data to your doctor, there will be some basis for accepting its pronouncements.By themselves, these features won\u2019t change the world. But they may play a significant role in some people\u2019s lives, even saving some from an early death.It is significant that Apple is consulting with regulators as it does so. The prevailing ethos across much of the industry is to charge forward with new tech \u2014 to beg forgiveness from the world when things go wrong, instead of asking permission first. How refreshing it is, then, that Apple went through proper channels here. When it comes to health, moving fast and breaking things isn\u2019t an option.There was some other news in tech this week:And that\u2019s it, folks! See you next week.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Fetching a High Price, Time Magazine Moves Into a New Era", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Time magazine started in 1923, it hit upon a popular formula: short, punchy items that aggregated the week\u2019s events and came in an entertaining package. But the newsweekly could never compete with the digital version of its own blueprint: the internet\u2019s bloggers, explainers, listicles and 30-second videos.Time\u2019s sales and profits, like those of most print publications, have been shrinking every year, a situation that made it difficult to sell the magazine, even with its storied past.The auction was more complex than Meredith executives had expected. The Des Moines-based publisher specializes in titles focused on home and lifestyle topics, and its advertising business is not designed for news and sports publications. Selling the four publications had always been the plan.Alan Murray, the chief content officer of the former Time Inc. brands, who helped lead the process, and Meredith\u2019s banking adviser, Citigroup, placed potential bidders into tiered groups. The groups were based on several factors, including the ability to pay and the level of seriousness. Meredith considered selling all the titles together but soon settled on individual transactions. Money will most likely be bundled with Fortune when it is sold.\u201cIt was a learning process for me, and these things just take a lot longer than you think they would,\u201d Mr. Murray said.Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money should be sold by the end of the year, he said. \u201cThere are very healthy, advanced conversations going on,\u201d he added, though he declined to comment on specific suitors. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic.\u201dMeredith fended off a $325 million offer for Time from David J. Pecker, the media executive who has become a key witness in a federal investigation into President Trump. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Pecker, who publishes The National Enquirer, suppressed the story of a former Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, according to federal prosecutors.Until a few weeks ago, Mr. Benioff was nearing an agreement to acquire Fortune and Money, according to four people familiar with the sales process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. He switched his preference to Time when he decided its business was stronger, one of the people said.Reed Phillips, a longtime investment banker specializing in media transactions, said the purchase price was surprisingly high.\u201cFor a business in decline, that\u2019s a big number,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that when billionaires buy media assets, it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re making a nonprofit donation. They\u2019re not doing this as a moneymaker. This is more of a cause.\u201dMeredith had been asking as much as $200 million for Fortune as recently as May, two of the people said. Fortune benefits from a lucrative conference business, but a big share of those profits comes from an event it produces in China for which a municipality pays most of the cost, the people said.Sports Illustrated, which was priced in the area of $150 million, has drawn intense interest from multiple suitors, including sports figures, the people said. Endeavor, the powerhouse agency representing sports clients and Hollywood talent, considered buying the title but backed off after it decided the magazine wasn\u2019t a fit with its main business, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.Mr. Benioff is the latest tech billionaire to take the reins of a historic news brand. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013, and last year, Laurene Powell Jobs, who heads the Emerson Collective and is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, bought a majority stake of The Atlantic magazine.But the re-emergence of billionaire media proprietors isn\u2019t a sign the news profession is bouncing back, said Kyle Pope, the editor in chief of the Columbia Journalism Review.\u201cLet\u2019s not read anything more into this about the health of newsmagazines,\u201d he said. \u201cMost papers and magazines across the country are still desperate.\u201dHe added: \u201cIconic magazines like Time will always have a suitor because people like Benioff will always want to own these things. It's a good way to keep these titles going, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s good for journalism writ large.\u201dWith Time, Mr. Benioff and his wife will face challenges. The magazine\u2019s revenue inched past $170 million last year with profits around $25 million, according to two of the people familiar with its finances.Expenses at Meredith\u2019s magazine division grew by more than $566 million with the addition of Time Inc., while profits shrank by more than a third to $98 million in the 12 months ending in June, when the company reports its fiscal year.As part of the Time deal, Meredith will continue to provide shared services for the magazine, helping Mr. Benioff save on print and ink costs. Marketing and subscription fulfillment will also be included in that agreement.Walter Shapiro, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who spent over 10 years at Time during the 1980s and \u201990s, said he had stopped reading the magazine after Meredith acquired it but was considering renewing his subscription after the sale.\u201cThey need to go back to a much more traditional word-filled product,\u201d he said, comparing Time with The Economist, a text-heavy magazine that has fared well. \u201cThey need to take a deeper look and not just with investigative reporting.

The store has been a significant source of revenue for the company, selling vitamins and nutritional supplements, as well as Infowars-branded apparel. PayPal has also handled donations that Infowars receives from its supporters.PayPal said it had made its decision not because of any policy violation but because Infowars\u2019 \u201cpromotion of hate and discrimination runs counter to our core value of inclusion.\u201d\u201cOur values are the foundation for the decision we made this week,\u201d PayPal added.The aggressive steps against Infowars have become fodder for claims that Silicon Valley companies are biased against conservative voices \u2014 an opinion expressed by President Trump and a number of Republican officials. Jeff Sessions, the United States attorney general, plans to meet with Republican state attorneys general next week to discuss the tech industry, competition and free speech.After the phaseout period of 10 business days, PayPal will stop doing any business with Infowars and its subsidiaries, like the site Prison Planet, a PayPal spokesman said.The spokesman declined to cite any specific problems that had led to the decision, but said that after \u201cextensive reviews\u201d the company had \u201cfound many instances of content that promoted hate and discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions.\u201dThis is not the first time that PayPal has waded into politically fraught territory. In 2010, the company cut off payments to WikiLeaks. More recently, PayPal stopped working with neo-Nazi and alt-right websites.Since being barred from Facebook and Twitter, Infowars has had to find new online platforms, and its audience has fallen off significantly. But PayPal\u2019s decision may be particularly damaging, because it will be much harder for Infowars to find another company to handle transactions for the site.For now, Infowars is still able to sell at least some of its goods on Amazon and eBay, where its payments are not handled by PayPal.An article on the Infowars site that announced PayPal\u2019s decision said the move was a \u201cpolitical ploy designed to financially sabotage an influential media outlet just weeks before the midterm elections.\u201dThe article said PayPal had told Infowars that the decision was made because Infowars had violated its \u201cacceptable use policy.\u201d PayPal\u2019s spokesman said its decision went beyond the violation of any single policy.Infowars did not respond to an email requesting comment.videoAdvertisement"}

CHARLES, Mo. \u2014 The prosperity is apparent on the way into town: the 21-floor casino resort and spa on one side of the interstate, and on the other a freshly built retail quarter of boutiques, a brand-new Hilton hotel and a P.F. Chang\u2019s. It unfolds from there along the highways heading west with more gleaming office parks and multiplying subdivisions.This is not the Trump country of the popular imagination, the land of shuttered plants and the economically left behind. St. Charles County, in the suburbs northwest of St. Louis, has had the highest median household income in Missouri for several years.But in 2016, Donald J. Trump won the county by 26 points, and he is still popular among people like Tom Hughes, a homebuilder whose business was rebounding from the recession before Mr. Trump took office. But, Mr. Hughes said, \u201cNow there\u2019s an optimism that I haven\u2019t seen, maybe ever.\u201dMr. Trump rode to office in part by promising economic revival to sputtering towns across America. Economic growth has accelerated since he took office, from the final year of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, and Mr. Trump frequently claims credit for it.But the growth under Mr. Trump has not helped everywhere. It has lifted wealthy areas, like St. Charles County, which were already growing before he took office. And it has left the most economically troubled swaths of the country, the ones that Mr. Trump promised to revitalize, waiting for their share of the good times.The divide is pronounced between the high- and low-income counties that helped deliver Mr. Trump the White House.St. Charles County, which sits in the most prosperous slice of American counties, saw job growth of nearly 2 percent last year, and business growth of 6 percent. By contrast, about 200 miles north in Illinois, Knox County ranks in the bottom fifth of prosperity nationwide, according to the Economic Innovation Group\u2019s rankings. It flipped in 2016 from supporting Mr. Obama, a Democrat, to Mr. Trump, a Republican.In Mr. Obama\u2019s final year in office, according to data from the Labor Department, Knox County lost 1 percent of its jobs and businesses. In Mr. Trump\u2019s first year, it lost more than 5 percent of its jobs \u2014 and nearly 7 percent of businesses. Knox County also continues to see higher unemployment than the nation as a whole. Its unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in July, down only slight from its rate of 5 percent in July 2017. The people in Knox County, at least those who have stayed, have seen factories close up and move to Mexico or Mississippi. They have seen wages stagnate and young people leave. And in 2016 the residents, or enough of them at least, thought Mr. Trump might be able to turn things around.\u201cThere\u2019s always that hope,\u201d said Johnny Holland, 40, on his way to work at Target in Galesburg, the Knox County seat. \u201cIt\u2019s a gamble,\u201d he said of his vote. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed yet.\u201dBut there may be a more complicated dynamic: a difference between places like St. Charles, which mainly want government to get out of the way, and places like Knox County, which are looking for rescue. While many in St. Charles give Mr. Trump only partial credit for a boom that preceded his arrival in office \u2014 and most of that for simply not messing it up \u2014 Trump supporters in hard-hit Knox are still holding out hope that he can turn things around.St. Charles has prime geography, with available space near railroads and highways, and close to a major city at the center of the country. Local leaders have been zealous recruiters of business. The county has landed aerospace contractors, IT companies, small manufacturers and operations centers for corporations, including Mastercard. A huge Amazon distribution center is coming next year.Like suburban counties everywhere, St. Charles was gut-punched by the recession \u2014 Mr. Hughes\u2019s business went from 173 employees to five. But growth picked up again around 2012, and in the last few years started into overdrive.\u201cInvestors held off for a long period of time, and eventually they just decided that the economy was going to be solid for a while,\u201d said Greg Prestemon, president of the Economic Development Center of St. Charles. \u201cThat certainly has happened under the Trump year-and-half. But also before that.\u201dMr. Trump came to St. Charles last November to rally supporters for his signature tax law as it was speeding through Congress. He boasted that it would be great for construction workers and other middle-class Americans, and that his wealthy friends hated the plan.Mr. Prestemon said the tax cuts were broadly welcomed here, though they did not appear to be driving major business decisions. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anybody say, \u2018Now, that this has happened, I\u2019m going to make a $5 million investment,\u2019\u201d he said.St. Charles is a stalwartly Republican county in any year. Federal bailouts saved two of the biggest employers, Citigroup and General Motors, in the teeth of the recession, and stimulus funds paid for most of a critical highway project. But when Washington\u2019s involvement regards regulations, conservatives in the county have bristled.Tariffs Mr. Trump has imposed on certain imports \u2014 and retaliatory tariffs levied by countries such as China on farm goods and a wide variety of American exports \u2014 have been somewhat disquieting, given the county\u2019s significant agriculture business.But many local Trump supporters said they trusted the president had a worthy long-term goal, even if it involved some short-term pain. And they appreciated his efforts to roll back regulations.\u201cIt\u2019s truly his economy, I don\u2019t care what anybody says,\u201d said John Haake, an Ayn Rand-quoting conservative sitting in the conference room of his laser technology shop. After the 2016 election, \u201ca whole euphoria was going through the business community.\u201dIn Knox County, a three-and-a-half-hour drive up the Mississippi River, that confidence is harder to come by. Once a redoubt of solid union manufacturing careers, the county was pummeled by plant closings from the 1980s until the early 2000s. Most brutal was the shuttering of a Maytag factory in 2004 that employed around 5,000 people, leaving a giant warehouse that still sits \u201cAvailable,\u201d as a banner pleads to passing drivers.\u201cThis town\u2019s really gone downhill,\u201d said Brian Ledbetter, 45, who works at the state prison across from the old Maytag factory. That trajectory is why he, along with nearly 60 percent of the county, voted in 2008 for Barack Obama. Mr. Obama visited Galesburg multiple times in his political career; he spoke of its struggles in his star-making 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention and mentioned it again in his 2010 State of the Union address.But nothing happened. And in 2016 Mr. Ledbetter, along with a narrow plurality of voters in Knox, voted for Mr. Trump.\u201cThe one thing he kept keying on was bringing jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jobs going away is what tore this county apart. Jobs might bring it back.\u201dHad anything changed here since 2016? No, he said. Not yet. But it would take time, he said, and the fact that the economy elsewhere, in wealthier places, is doing so well means the benefits would eventually trickle down to here. \u201cThey can only build so much,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019ll be a group of people always that want to go back to the good old days of the 1920s or the 1880s or whatever,\u201d said John Pritchard, the mayor of Galesburg, who insists that the Labor Department figures about Knox County are simply wrong. \u201cBut the reality is I think most people are feeling better about how things are moving. It\u2019s just a challenge to keep people here.\u201dMarisa Miller, 23, who plans to be a physician assistant, was sitting in her car in the vast parking lot of the old mall, where the last department store was having an out-of-business sale. Her parents worked at Maytag and her grandparents worked at the Butler factory that closed down in 2005.\u201cHonestly we\u2019re bringing new places here,\u201d she said of the stores opening in the other parts of town. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing other places leave.\u201dMs. Miller said she was not surprised that economic revival had not yet washed over her town. She hadn\u2019t expected Mr. Trump to bring one in the first place, she said. The only thing that had changed since the election seemed to be that certain people around town were angrier. As soon as she can, Ms. Miller said, she plans to leave town herself.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Designers Envisioning a Bold New Kind of Japanese Architecture", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA freethinking firm makes its mark exploring the intersections between public and private, indoors and out, function and form.In a departure from convention, they built a workspace entirely open to the public: If someone could bring her laptop to a coffee shop and call it her office, couldn\u2019t an office do the reverse, inviting people in from the street for an obsessively crafted cup of cold brew? Suppose even branded its own bags of arabica beans for this exercise, lining them up beside a library of design books, which customers can browse while drinking espresso near high windows that look onto the sidewalk. In the back of the 2,058-square-foot room, beyond a steel coffee bar, a dozen architects meet in small groups or draft plans on computers in rows on long tables, performing their jobs in plain view of a largely disinterested audience. Sitting in the cafe can be an odd and exhilarating experience, like sneaking backstage in the tense moments before a play begins. But after a few sips, you ease into it, enjoying the quiet bustle; you become part of a human machine that toggles between labor and leisure.Architecture, after all, dictates behavior: Public or private, indoor or outdoor, extravagant or humble, old or new, fake or real \u2014 these are a few of the obvious binaries by which we assess the spaces we inhabit. They are also the edges against which most architects hone their signature styles. But since their firm was founded 18 years ago, Tanijiri and Yoshida have instead devoted themselves to the liminal place where these elements break down; their designs (from a suburban house in Higashi with a dirt floor to a Tokyo cafe that transforms into a hostel) unite concepts that seem opposed. They aren\u2019t interested in referencing the codes of Japan\u2019s architecture establishment \u2014 nor in iterating upon their own past successes, as many distinguished firms do \u2014 but rather in envisioning new spaces that rest somewhere between the disquieting and the thrilling.THIS ETHOS IS perhaps best captured in Tanijiri\u2019s own apartment, designed in 2015. (As might be expected from a pair that specializes in indistinct boundaries, the two were once romantic partners as well, though this was never Yoshida\u2019s residence.) On the fifth floor of a mid-1970s building in Hiroshima \u2014 now a bicycling haven on the southern shore of Japan, where they both grew up \u2014 Tanijiri wanted to find \u201ccompleteness in incompletion.\u201d Rather than build a home, he unbuilt one, dismantling nearly all the existing walls, exposing rusty pipes and cement foundations. He then subtly demarcated the 1,270-square-foot space, employing casement doors and windows, shelving and entryway arches \u2014 all in steel. The furniture is little more than a huge cushion covered in patchwork indigo denim atop matching steel floors and a few wooden dining chairs.As with most contemporary Japanese architecture, simplicity does not necessarily mean ease or lack of complexity: Tanijiri\u2019s home requires constant upkeep. Like a good Japanese knife, all of the steel demands incessant cleaning and polishing or it will rust before acquiring its desired blue-gray patina over the next few years. The metal\u2019s transformation, though beautiful, is actually a form of controlled decay; the process speaks to Suppose\u2019s obsession with permeable materials, such as concrete and unfinished wood, which require constant maintenance, and then, despite care, still diminish over time.But perhaps the most compelling aspect of the disassembled apartment is the one that escaped destruction: Located near a window at the back corner of the living area is a traditional Japanese-style room that came with the place, with tatami-mat floors and shoji-screen walls. Without this flourish, the home might feel like the industrial lofts that have overtaken New York, London and other Western capitals. But by integrating the local vernacular, the project helps demonstrate why dozens of corporations have hired Suppose to bring their Western sensibilities east: In 2015, for the 40th anniversary of the French fashion brand Agn\u00e8s B., Suppose skinned the company\u2019s Ginza flagship store in pine plywood, which will wear over time to mirror the natural textures of the line\u2019s custom fabrics; when Airbnb opened its Tokyo office in 2016, the architects created internal parks dappled with delicate Amazon olive trees.This being Japan, that last part is critical. In the countryside, much of the terrain is hilly; within the cities, the destruction wrought by World War II and the rezoning brought by the 1980s economic bubble have resulted in development sites that are narrow, perilously close to streets or shorelines, abandoned or otherwise left in disarray by storms or residents who couldn\u2019t afford to maintain them. Instead of concealing these blemishes, Suppose highlights them. Forty minutes east of Hiroshima, a couple asked for a house in 2004 where they could relax and play their grand piano, even though their tiny plot hugged a constantly rattling rail line. Rather than hide the sights and sounds of passing trains, the architects designed a giant glass wall that put them on display (along with the mountainous island Miyajima across the nearby sea). The window is mounted seamlessly into a cantilevered, 968-square-foot concrete box, which is folded in an origami-inspired style that allows its three rooms to zigzag upward. The exterior is stained a rusty hue; over the decades, as the whooshing trains kick up reddish metallic dust, it will further burnish the building.Initially, it was hard for me to understand what they meant; we could only communicate with the help of translators, hovering between two languages, so Tanijiri grabbed a pen and began drawing. With a few crude lines, he sketched a stick figure standing inside a child\u2019s version of a house \u2014 square walls, triangle roof \u2014 with a branchy, leafless tree out in the yard. He then drew the same house a second time, but this time he extended the roof until it encompassed the tree, bringing the outside in, or the inside out, neither and both at the same time.He had more or less depicted Anjo House, an 1,818-square-foot home for a family of five that Suppose finished in 2015 in the foggy Aichi prefecture, near the Pacific coastline. The interior of the asphalt-shingled structure is made almost entirely from plywood, down to the light-switch plates that follow the grain of the walls in which they\u2019re inset. Half of the open-plan, triangular home is al fresco \u2014 with a dramatically pitched, skylight-punctured roof that partially covers a garden, dining area and kitchen where the family cooks, eats and lounges throughout the year. There is an outdoor hammock for sleeping. (There are also upholstered pieces, including a leather couch, which can be enclosed from the elements with sliding doors.) Unusual for a Japanese architecture firm, Suppose designed and sourced furniture, too, as they do for most of their projects. The result is not the sort of indoor-outdoor fantasy the clients likely first envisioned but a more elemental version of it: Three sides of the exterior have giant, rectangular holes where the walls would normally be, as if the family had chosen to live, mouselike, inside a set of conjoined garages with their doors left open.A dramatic answer to a request for a home that embraces nature, Anjo House is also a manifesto of sorts. No matter how closely the architects listen to clients\u2019 desires and plans to use the space, working with such a firm ultimately requires that the inhabitants leave much of that behind. Even its name, Suppose, dares them to question their own assumptions. Earlier this year, Tanijiri and Yoshida themselves decided to further challenge the notion of what an architecture practice should be: Rather than merely improve real estate for others, they created their own construction firm. Their next project, in Hiroshima, into which they will move their offices, will crash together public and private domains, just as their cafe-meets-back-office in Tokyo does. In addition to a restaurant, the building will have a hotel and a gallery. With this ambitious concept, Suppose will straddle an indistinct line: somewhere between what an architecture firm is \u2014 and what it could be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.T.C. Hearings Add to Efforts That Threaten Tech Industry", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have fought regulators in Europe on privacy, antitrust and taxes. In the United States, the tech titans were on friendly terrain.But on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission kicked off a series of hearings to discuss whether the agency\u2019s competition and consumer protection policies should change to better reflect new technologies and companies.Joseph J. Simons, the agency\u2019s chairman, expressed openness to a new approach.\u201cThe broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cI approach all these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what we see and hear at these hearings.\u201dThe F.T.C. hearings, the first of 15 to 20 over the next several months, are one of several efforts underway on the federal and state level that threaten to limit the expansion and power of tech companies. Later this month, Congress will bring executives from top tech companies to testify on proposals for privacy laws. The Justice Department has warned it may start investigations into whether Google and other social media sites are biased against conservative voices.The spotlight on the giants of Silicon Valley is a major shift for regulators in the United States. For years, they held up the growth of these firms as an emblem of American business leadership and ingenuity. But after a string of crises over privacy and misinformation on social media, a growing chorus of regulators from both political parties is casting a more skeptical eye on the industry.New regulations in the United States are unlikely to arrive anytime soon, and any new federal policies will probably be weaker than those in Europe and states like California. Tech companies have lobbied the Trump administration for voluntary rules and government officials have indicated their desire for light-touch regulation that would pre-empt some state laws.\u201cIt will be a slow-moving ship, faster on privacy than on antitrust, but it\u2019s an important moment,\u201d said Blair Levin, a senior adviser at the research firm New Street and a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission.Reaching an agreement on changes to antitrust policy will be particularly difficult.The field of antitrust law has focused for 30 years on whether prices increase when there is limited competition. Some academics and consumer groups have called for regulators to rethink that gauge. Amazon and Google, they say, defy that metric of antitrust law because the companies are gaining power even as they offer cheap or free goods.\u201cThe issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It\u2019s about the \u2018new economy\u2019 and the degradation of the human spirit \u2014 breaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies,\u201d Mr. Sanders said last week in a Twitter post.Amazon has disputed Mr. Sanders\u2019s accusations, saying the company offers stable pay and benefits for its employees. It has also disputed concerns the company has violated antitrust laws, saying it does not have a dominant market share of the retail market.Some Republicans have also voiced concerns about the industry, and a growing number of economists are studying whether technology\u2019s leading companies are increasing wage inequality. The economists are focused on whether the concentration of workforces at companies like Amazon have a disproportionate effect on wages, inflation and growth.\u201cThese concerns raise a challenge to antitrust agency leadership, the courts and legislators,\u201d Mr. Simons said on Thursday.Companies have argued against broad changes. Google, for instance, says that it offers free search services and that consumers can easily switch to rival search engines online. Companies argue that the tech market is fast changing and regulations could quickly become outdated.The F.T.C. hearing, held at the Georgetown University School of Law, was filled with antitrust lawyers, some of whom had ties to the tech companies. Many warned that changes could make decisions on mergers and antitrust enforcement vulnerable to politics.Janet L. McDavid, a panelist at the F.T.C. hearing and a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, said simply going after companies because they were big was dangerous.The \u201camorphous\u201d concepts of big and fair in antitrust law could lend itself to political decisions, Ms. McDavid said.\u201cWhich we certainly should eschew, especially now in the current political environment,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

Is China\u2019s Economy Losing Steam?", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Huang teaches international management at M.I.T.Maybe Mr. Ma, 54, knows something that Mr. Putin does not. Two of the three forces, globalization and marketization, that have propelled Alibaba to its current $500 billion valuation are dissipating. The third force, technology, is mired in the trade war between China and the United States, and its prospects in China are now uncertain.Alibaba didn\u2019t just transform e-commerce in China; it transformed the entire economy by helping build up the private sector. Mr. Ma\u2019s departure from the company now \u2014 though he claims to have been planning it for a while \u2014 adds to a gathering sense that China\u2019s private sector, the engine of the economy, is losing steam \u2014 and faith.But today globalization is under assault. The Chinese government is enforcing more strictly regulations over V.I.E.s that it had long ignored, creating uncertainty for foreign investors. And the trade war between the United States and China is disrupting Chinese exports, threatening the supply chains of which Alibaba is an integral component.Under increasingly tight financial and regulatory pressures, China\u2019s private sector today arguably is facing the most challenging environment since the early 1990s.In conversations I had in Guangdong, business leaders from various sectors \u2014 product design, investment, technology \u2014 called the current situation \u201cdire.\u201d They said they were making far fewer deals, as much as 50 percent less, now than during the same period last year and complained about the toll of increasing taxes.These are not the conditions that allowed Alibaba to succeed. The company was a pioneer in adopting Western technology and business models \u2014 using online commerce, data analytics, website tools \u2014 to the Chinese context. Although it is often called China\u2019s Amazon, the comparison vastly understates its true significance. Alibaba started out as a business-to-business operation but, really, it gave market opportunities to private entrepreneurs in a statist system heavily stacked against them.So why is the Chinese government clamping down on the private sector when liberalizing it has served the economy so well? The reasons are varied and complex: rising authoritarianism at home, statism, the trade war. But the effects already are clear, with ominous implications for the entire economy. Could there even be a new Alibaba today?Yasheng Huang is a professor of international management at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Antitrust Antagonist Has a Breakthrough Idea", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "With a single scholarly article, Lina Khan, 29, has reframed decades of monopoly law.Supported by\u201cAntitrust Dilemma.\u201d \u201cThe Antitrust Impulse.\u201d \u201cAntitrust in an Expanding Economy.\u201d Shelf after shelf of volumes ignored for decades. There are a dozen fat tomes with transcripts of the congressional hearings on monopoly power in 1949, when the world was in ruins and the Soviets on the march. Lawmakers believed economic concentration would make America more vulnerable.At the end of the antitrust stacks is a table near the window. \u201cThis is my command post,\u201d said Lina Khan.It\u2019s nothing, really. A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon.If competitors tremble at Amazon\u2019s ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon\u2019s customers, it is safe to say, spend much time thinking they need to be protected from it.Amazon has more revenue than Facebook, Google and Twitter put together, but it has largely escaped sustained examination. That is beginning to change, and one significant reason is Ms. Khan.Ms. Khan disagreed. Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, she presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the economy.Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: \u201cThe thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon\u2019s rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.\u201dThe paper got 146,255 hits, a runaway best-seller in the world of legal treatises. That popularity has rocked the antitrust establishment, and is making an unlikely celebrity of Ms. Khan in the corridors of Washington.She has her own critics now: Several leading scholars have found fault with Ms. Khan\u2019s proposals to revive and expand antitrust, and some have tried to dismiss her paper with the mocking label \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201d Unwilling or perhaps unable to accept that a woman wrote a breakthrough legal text, they keep talking about bearded dudes.\u201cAs consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.\u201dAt the S.M.U. library in Dallas, Ms. Khan was finding that vocabulary. These dead books, many from an era that predated the price-based era of monopoly law, were an influence and an inspiration. She was planning to expand her essay into a book, she said in an interview here in June.Then her life shifted, and she abruptly went from an outsider proposing reform to an insider formulating policy. Rohit Chopra, a new Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, pulled her in as a temporary adviser in July, at a time when urgent questions about privacy, data, competition and antitrust were suddenly in the air. The F.T.C. is holding a series of hearings this fall, the first of their type since 1995, on whether a changing economy requires changing enforcement attitudes.\u201cIdeas and assumptions that it was heretical to question are now openly being contested,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it.\u201dGenuinely original voices are rare in Washington policy circles, and Mr. Chopra is pleased to have Ms. Khan in his camp. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to come across a legal prodigy like Lina Khan,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing about her career is typical. You don\u2019t see many law students publish groundbreaking legal research, or research that had such a deep impact so quickly.\u201d\u201cIt takes time to crush men who are pursuing legitimate trade. But one of Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s most impressive characteristics is patience. \u2026 He was like a general who, besieging a city surrounded by fortified hills, views from a balloon the whole great field, and sees how, this point taken, that must fall; this hill reached, that fort is commanded. And nothing was too small: the corner grocery in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipeline. Nothing, for little things grow.\u201dWhen Ms. Khan read that, she thought: Jeff Bezos.Her Yale Law Journal paper argued that monopoly regulators who focus on consumer prices are thinking too short-term. In Ms. Khan\u2019s view, a company like Amazon \u2014 one that sells things, competes against others selling things, and owns the platform where the deals are done \u2014 has an inherent advantage that undermines fair competition.\u201cThe long-term interests of consumers include product quality, variety and innovation \u2014 factors best promoted through both a robust competitive process and open markets,\u201d she wrote.The issue Ms. Khan\u2019s article really brought to the fore is this: Do we trust Amazon, or any large company, to create our future? In think tanks and universities, the battle has been joined.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that antitrust enforcement has gotten far too weak,\u201d said Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan scholar who doesn\u2019t agree with Ms. Khan but credits her with opening up a much-needed debate. \u201cIt\u2019s a bridge much further to say we should go back to the populist goal of leveling playing fields and checking \u2018bigness.\u2019 \u201dThe analogies with Amazon are explicit. Don\u2019t let the government pursue Amazon the way it pursued A.&P., Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein warned.\u201cAmazon has added hundreds of billions of dollars of value to the U.S. economy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is a brilliant innovator\u201d whose \u201cbreakthroughs have in turn helped launch new waves of innovation across retail and technology sectors, to the great benefit of consumers.\u201dAmazon itself could not have made the argument any better. Which isn\u2019t surprising, because in a footnote on the first page, the authors noted: \u201cWe approached Amazon Inc. for funding to tell the story\u201d of A.&P., \u201cand we gratefully acknowledge its support.\u201d They added at the end of footnote 85: \u201cThe authors have advised Amazon on a variety of antitrust issues.\u201dAmazon declined to say how much its support came to in dollars. It also declined to comment on Ms. Khan or her paper directly, but issued a statement.\u201cWe operate in a diverse range of businesses, from retail and entertainment to consumer electronics and technology services, and we have intense and well-established competition in each of these areas,\u201d the company said. \u201cRetail is our largest business today and we represent less than 1 percent of global retail.\u201dHer father was a management consultant; her mother an executive in information services. Ms. Khan went to Williams College, where she wrote a thesis on the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. She was the editor of the student paper but worked hard at everything.\u201cWe were routinely emailing each other on separate floors of the library as it was closing at 2 a.m.,\u201d said Amanda Korman, a classmate.Like many a wonkish youth, Ms. Khan headed to Washington after graduating in 2010, applying for a position at the left-leaning New America Foundation. Barry Lynn, who headed the organization\u2019s Open Markets antimonopoly initiative, seized on her application. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to teach public policy to people who already know how to write than teach writing to public policy experts,\u201d said Mr. Lynn, a former journalist.Ms. Khan wrote about industry consolidation and monopolistic practices for Washington publications that specialize in policy, went to Yale Law School, published her Amazon paper and then came back to Washington last year, just as interest was starting to swell in her work.\u201cPolls show huge concerns about concentrated power, corporate power, but if people are asked, \u2018Do we have a monopoly problem?\u2019 they answer, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Lynn. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the language for it.\u201d\u201cThe whole country has been struggling to understand why the economy is not operating in the right way,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said. \u201cWages have remained stagnant. Workers have less and less power. All we\u2019re trying to do is create a level playing field, and that\u2019s harder when you have megacompanies that make it virtually impossible for small competitors.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning of solutions to this.\u201dSomewhere in the midst of all this, Ms. Khan found the time to marry Shah Ali, a doctor now doing a cardiology fellowship in Dallas, which explains why she was camping out at the S.M.U. law library. The honeymoon was in Hawaii. Dr. Ali took Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPersuasion,\u201d because he hadn\u2019t reread it in a while. Ms. Khan brought a book on corporations and American democracy.The battle for intellectual supremacy takes place less these days in learned journals and more on social media, where tongues are sharp and branding is all. This is not Ms. Khan\u2019s strong suit. She is always polite, even on Twitter. One consequence is that she didn\u2019t give much thought about what to call the movement to reboot antitrust. Neither did anyone else.\u201cAntitrust Hipsterism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything old is cool again.\u201dMr. Medvedovsky, who calls Ms. Khan\u2019s article \u201cthe face of this movement,\u201d said the term was designed to be \u201cplayful rather than pejorative.\u201dAdmirers of Ms. Khan and her fellow reformers have sometimes called them the New Brandeis School or the New Brandeisians, after Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era foe of big business. As brands go, these are somewhat less catchy than \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201dThe Hipster issue was sponsored by Facebook, another sign that Big Tech is striving to shape the monopoly-law debate. The company declined to comment.Things are moving fast, so there is a lot to write papers about.Contemporary antitrust regulation, the commissioner wrote, is conducted in the courts, which makes it numbingly slow and dependent on high-paid expert witnesses. He called for the agency to use its authority to issue rules that would \u201cadvance clarity and certainty\u201d about what is, and what is not, an unfair method of competition.These rules would not be \u201csome inflexible prescription\u201d but standards, guidelines, pointers or presumptions, he wrote. Since everyone affected by a proposed rule would have the opportunity to weigh in on it, the process would be more democratic.There is more than an echo here of Ms. Khan\u2019s notion that the past can help rescue the future.\u201cThese are new technologies and new business models,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cThe remedy is new thinking that is informed by traditional principles.\u201dMs. Khan was not the first to criticize Amazon, and she said the company was not really her target anyway. \u201cAmazon is not the problem \u2014 the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon depicts that in an elegant way,\u201d she said.From Amazon\u2019s point of view, however, it is a problem indeed that Ms. Khan concludes in the Yale paper that regulating parts of the company like a utility \u201ccould make sense.\u201d She also said it \u201ccould make sense\u201d to treat Amazon\u2019s e-commerce operation like a bridge, highway, port, power grid or telephone network \u2014 all of which are required to allow access to their infrastructure on a nondiscriminatory basis.Ms. Khan put those ideas out there, which is how Rachel Tsuna found them.Last fall, the Barnard College senior was casting about for a subject for her senior thesis. \u201cWhat is really interesting to you?\u201d her adviser asked. Ms. Tsuna, now 22, had worked for a chewing gum start-up \u2014 yes, there are such things \u2014 that sold through Amazon, and knew firsthand the retailer\u2019s tight grip. \u201cAmazon is scary!\u201d she exclaimed.This impulsive declaration suggested a topic: Did the F.T.C. have the grounds to move against Amazon? Ms. Tsuna made little progress until she came across Ms. Khan\u2019s paper.\u201cI finally felt like I was pursuing something valid,\u201d Ms. Tsuna said. \u201cLina Khan gave me the confidence I needed.\u201d The thesis, which is quite fair to Amazon, got an A minus.That\u2019s the way movements begin. Little things grow.\u201cThis is a moment in time that invites a movement,\u201d said Ms. Khan. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than antitrust, bigger than Big Tech. It\u2019s about whether the laws serve democratic ends.\u201dIt was late at night in late July, and she was eating a burrata concoction at a popular restaurant near the Washington apartment she uses when not in Texas with her husband. After the death of Judge Reinhardt, her options opened up. She had the Columbia fellowship. Maybe she would also write the book. Or go back to the F.T.C. full time. Or somehow do it all.\u201cAmazon is a monopoly, and I worry that it monopolizes Lina,\u201d said her husband, Dr. Ali. \u201cI learn about what she is doing from looking at her Twitter feed.\u201d\u201cI throw myself into things,\u201d Ms. Khan agreed. \u201cMy life is spread out now.\u201dWith some cajoling, she revealed her Amazon account. There were just three purchases in 18 months. An altimeter for her father, who has taken up hiking, is the only one she will agree to have mentioned, although the other two are incredibly benign. One attribute Ms. Khan shares with Amazon is a strong desire to control the flow of information.Balancing the attention and the achievement, the expectations and the demands, is difficult, perhaps impossible.\u201cI don\u2019t think of my work in grandiose terms. I feel an urgency but I\u2019m also wary of hubris,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cNobody has been expecting this to succeed. I\u2019m awed by the challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The commission said Wednesday that these deals did not constitute illegal state aid.The profits under scrutiny had not been taxed in Luxembourg or the United States, according to the commission, but it said that this was a result of a mismatch between the countries\u2019 tax laws rather than special treatment from Luxembourg, and that no rules had been broken. Still, Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s competition commissioner, said that it was important that Luxembourg change its laws to ensure profits do not go untaxed regularly.McDonald\u2019s and the government of Luxembourg welcomed the decision from the European Commission. \u201cWe pay the taxes that are owed and, from 2013-2017, McDonald\u2019s companies paid more than $3 billion just in corporate income taxes in the European Union with an average tax rate approaching 29 percent,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in a statement.The country had granted McDonald\u2019s Europe Franchising, a subsidiary, a ruling that said it did not need to pay corporate tax in Luxembourg since the profits would be taxed in the United States. Luxembourg then said in a second tax ruling that it did not need to prove that the income had actually been taxed in the United States.The Luxembourg government has since drafted legislation aimed at preventing such situations.Advertisement"}

It proved to be the most critically divisive movie of 1968 and for some the kickiest. The Daily News dismissed it as \u201ca grisly melodrama,\u201d while, jumping on the movie\u2019s bandwagon, Time magazine\u2019s critic saw \u201ca sly, jaundiced look at swinging youth and the pervasive American climate of violence.\u201dCovert antics become sinister once Dennis lose his job and decides to sabotage the factory that he believes is polluting the local river with colorful toxins. That\u2019s one meaning of the movie\u2019s title. The other refers to sprightly Sue Ann who, despite her infectious giggle, turns out to be far more pathological than her suitor. Before the movie ends Sue Ann\u2019s turquoise Sunbeam roadster will seem as menacing as the Creature from the Black Lagoon.\u201cPretty Poison\u201d also became an issue in the longstanding feud between New York\u2019s two most influential movie critics, Kael and Andrew Sarris. Newly installed at The New Yorker on the strength of her impassioned defense of \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d Kael fought to have \u201cPretty Poison\u201d rereleased and, according to Brian Kellow\u2019s biography, masterminded the movie\u2019s New York Critics Circle award. Sarris began his Village Voice review with a dig: \u201cA covey of high-flying, high-sounding critics have managed to save \u2018Pretty Poison\u2019 from a fate worse than death in the fleshpots of 42nd Street.\u201d Noting that the movie had reopened at the Eighth Street Playhouse, a showcase for European art films, he joked that \u201cunfortunately, \u2018Pretty Poison\u2019 turns out to be too pretentious for 42nd Street but not pretentious enough for Eighth Street.\u201dSarris viewed \u201cPretty Poison\u201d as an inflated B-movie, tricked out with \u201cnew wave\u201d shock cuts and imitation Alain Resnais flashbacks. Indeed, Mr. Black\u2019s movie benefited from the au courant notion that B-movies could be a form of Pop Art. Reviewers naturally bracketed \u201cPretty Poison\u201d with \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d \u2014 not least because Ms. Weld, who declined the role of Bonnie to spend time with her newborn, here showed what she might have brought to the part. More surprising in a review as knowledgeable as Sarris\u2019s was the lack of acknowledgment for the B-movie classic \u201cGun Crazy\u201d (1950), a film he had praised as superior to \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d in his 1968 history, \u201cThe American Cinema.\u201dThat, it would seem, was the movie\u2019s point. It\u2019s no surprise that \u201cGun Crazy,\u201d like \u201cPretty Poison,\u201d attained cult status in the late 1960s when it was said that violence was as American as cherry pie.Both \u201cPretty Poison\u201d and \u201cGun Crazy\u201d are available for streaming on multiple platforms, including Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play, Vudu and iTunes.

{"Headline": "I Would Interview Steve Bannon", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHe may be a wandering plague ship of a man, but journalists should talk to him. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Despite being doused by floods of vitriol, Mr. Bannon rose days later like some particularly insistent zombie to talk with reporters about \u201cAmerican Dharma,\u201d a new documentary about him by the filmmaker Errol Morris. No surprise, Mr. Morris, who did 16 hours of interviews over three days with Mr. Bannon, was soon receiving the same criticism Mr. Remnick had gotten. How could he give someone whom many see as a white nationalist a platform that legitimizes and normalizes him?\u201cThe first job of journalism is to investigate,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be pundits in a room saying things that they all agree with.\u201dI might as well be plain because no one who likes me or what I do is going to like this: Mr. Morris is right, and I would do the exact same thing.I felt that our audience could benefit from seeing Mr. Bannon questioned in a pretty tough stage interview. The denizens of Silicon Valley live in a bubble, which Mr. Bannon\u2019s acid theories would surely penetrate.In the end, we never invited him for one simple reason: He had been hip-checked out of the administration (we had Linda McMahon, the head of the Small Business Administration, instead). But had we proceeded, I was well aware of the anger we would have faced. The objections are substantive and deserve to be taken seriously. They include: that he\u2019s a liar, and you cannot interview a liar who is only playing you; that he is a racist and a Nazi \u2014 or at least affiliates with racists and Nazis \u2014 and deserves no place on any stage; that mainstream journalists, especially white ones, do not grok the harm Mr. Bannon does to people of color and are talking to him simply for the ego gratification of maybe being the one to finally break him; and, perhaps most important, that we would have been giving him a space that could have been occupied by those too often ignored by the media. Many made these points in response to my tweet. While some more delicate media figures whine about out-of-control Twitter mobs, I actually think most social media mobs serve an important role these days. They make journalists think hard about their choices and their words. If you write or say something controversial or more likely dumb, you should not be surprised, aggrieved or sanctimonious if a lot of people on social media tell you you\u2019re an idiot. As soul-sapping as it can be, we need to suck it up and take it. That doesn\u2019t mean we have to back down, as Mr. Remnick did. I still want to interview Mr. Bannon. Coincidentally, just before the New Yorker debacle, I had emailed him asking him to come on my podcast, largely because a lot of what he had previously said about tech was now emerging from the mouth of Mr. Trump. Mr. Bannon\u2019s squeal has a real-world impact, and we can\u2019t make him go away by not looking at him. In that vein, Mr. Morris added one more thing to his explanation about why he went ahead with the Bannon documentary, despite the wrenching compromises he was making: \u201cIf I\u2019ve done anything to help us understand who he is \u2014 I don\u2019t want to go overboard here, but I think it\u2019s an important service. It\u2019s part of what journalism should be doing.\u201dWhat he said. Oink.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Trump\u2019s Trade War Finally Hits Consumers", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA refresher on why this is happening: The tariffs aim to pressure China into changing longstanding trade practices that Mr. Trump says hurt the U.S. The administration says China could win relief by giving U.S. companies more access to its markets, among other things.What is clear is that U.S. consumers will start to bear the cost of American protectionism.In approving the deal, the Justice Department decided that combining an insurer and a pharmacy benefit manager wouldn\u2019t reduce competition. It appears to be another sign that vertical mergers, where two companies in different industries combine, are acceptable to the Trump administration. (Its effort to block AT&T from buying Time Warner increasingly looks like a political anomaly.)The move augurs well for CVS\u2019s bid to acquire the insurer Aetna \u2014 and for many more potential tie-ups. With Amazon looming over the sector, other companies may be tempted to take the merger plunge.Coke would be a different player. The company is openly pushing into new markets to offset slowing soda sales. (See: its $5.1 billion deal for Costa.) The company says it\u2019s watching the growth in cannabis-infused drinks for now, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine buzz-inducing Coke products hitting store shelves.In a note to clients, the analyst, Mark May, said that breaking up the company could yield two successful businesses: a retail company with an enterprise value of $400 billion and a cloud-computing business worth $600 billion. It would also help Amazon avoid antitrust scrutiny at a time when President Trump appears to be focused on the company.So far, investors appear uneasy with the idea. Amazon shares fell 3 percent after the report was published.The sting isn\u2019t necessarily that Lucid secured funding from the Saudis when Elon Musk couldn\u2019t (though that has to hurt a little). It\u2019s that Tesla, already grappling with competition from traditional carmakers like General Motors and Daimler, must now contend with a well-funded upstart that wants to grab the luxury end of market.Tesla investors can only hope that Mr. Musk, who has seemed distracted lately, can focus on beating the competition.The timing of the trip is uncertain: Elon Musk, SpaceX\u2019s C.E.O., said that the so-called B.F.R. spacecraft would not be ready until 2023 at the earliest.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Maezawa would talk about the cost. But Mr. Musk did say that developing the rocket would cost $2 billion to $10 billion, and that Mr. Maezawa\u2019s ticket was a significant investment in the project.First: \u201cSo you are a charity?\u201d This view suggests that women need help from altruistic donors to get their businesses going. Second: \u201cAh! You are a social impact fund!\u201d This response insinuates that women cannot possibly make you rich, so there needs to be a social mission attached to give an investor something virtuous to talk about at dinner parties. Third: \u201cGreat, but why would you limit yourself?\u201d This may seem like a fair comment, but if you asked me about my deal flow I would tell you that I reviewed more than 100 opportunities in six months and was blown away by the quality of applications.In fact, she writes, she wants to make money, and the firm\u2019s approach allows her to identify opportunities that \u201care largely overlooked \u2014 and therefore attractive.\u201dDealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Alex Jones Said Bans Would Strengthen Him. He Was Wrong.", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe more I\u2019m persecuted, the stronger I get,\u201d Mr. Jones said on his live internet broadcast three days later. \u201cIt backfired.\u201dYet a review of traffic on Infowars several weeks after the bans shows that the tech companies drastically reduced Mr. Jones\u2019s reach by cutting off his primary distribution channels: YouTube and Facebook.In the three weeks before the Aug. 6 bans, Infowars had a daily average of nearly 1.4 million visits to its website and views of videos posted by its main YouTube and Facebook pages, according to a New York Times analysis of data from the web data firms Tubular Labs and SimilarWeb. In the three weeks afterward, its audience fell by roughly half, to about 715,000 site visits and video views, according to the analysis.The analysis did not include traffic to the two-month-old Infowars app or views of videos that Mr. Jones posted on Twitter, where his accounts remain active. He also still shares posts inside private Facebook groups, and his followers repost his content from their social-media accounts. But data suggest that those sources of traffic are smaller than Mr. Jones\u2019s main Facebook and YouTube pages.That Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, muffled one of the internet\u2019s loudest voices so quickly illustrates the tremendous influence a few internet companies have over public discourse and the spread of information.Now that access to Infowars is mainly through its website or app, Mr. Jones\u2019s ability to reach new viewers is severely limited because they will no longer come across his videos while scrolling through Facebook or YouTube, said Monica Stephens, a geography professor at the University at Buffalo who has studied the spread of misinformation online.\u201cThis increases the likelihood Infowars is preaching to a filter bubble versus reaching new audiences,\u201d she said.In an email, he wrote, \u201cSocial justice warriors machinate to get speakers canceled, and social networks purge conservatives, for the same reason: no-platforming works.\u201dNeither Mr. Jones nor Infowars responded to requests for comment.The main Facebook pages for Mr. Jones and Infowars, meanwhile, had drawn 668 million views of their videos over the past three years, according to Tubular Labs.YouTube erased Mr. Jones\u2019s channel for flouting a penalty for a previous punishment for hate speech. YouTube also quietly deleted more than a dozen other channels associated with Infowars for trying to circumvent its rules.Since then, Mr. Jones has made the companies a central theme of his near-daily show. In recent shows broadcast on his website, he has falsely accused YouTube and Facebook of being controlled by the Chinese government and assisting in an elaborate global conspiracy to control the world\u2019s population.\u201cIt is a panopticonic, total internet-of-things-integration, global-social-score, complete command-and-control system,\u201d Mr. Jones said three days after the ban. \u201cIt is the virtual-reality, A.I. weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies blocking Trump\u2019s resistance of the program.\u201dHe added, \u201cI have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information.\u201dMr. Trump has since accelerated his criticism of Silicon Valley and how it surfaces information, alleging that Google doctored search results for his name. Google has denied the claim.For a brief period after the bans, Mr. Jones enjoyed a bump in publicity. Traffic to Infowars.com soared 67 percent to about 777,000 visits a day in the two weeks after the ban, compared with the previous two weeks, SimilarWeb said. Downloads of the Infowars app surged sixfold to 25,500 downloads a day over the same period, according to Apptopia, which tracks app data.But both figures have since fallen to nearly pre-ban levels. And the spike could not replace the lost traffic from the top three Facebook and YouTube channels for Infowars, which together averaged roughly 900,000 video views a day in the three weeks before the ban, according to Tubular Labs.Other outlets have not helped much. Even as Mr. Jones\u2019s account has remained on Twitter, his videos there attract 21,000 views on average, compared with 44,500 views per YouTube video, according to NeoReach, which helps brands market on social media. The Infowars accounts on other sites, such as Dailymotion, Amazon\u2019s Twitch and BitChute, a video site mostly for people barred from YouTube, garner views in the hundreds for videos \u2014 and often fewer.NeoReach said an analysis of Mr. Jones\u2019s followers on social media showed that most were white married men, with an average age of 28 and average annual income of $46,500. NeoReach said his Twitter account \u201chas a notable audience concentration in New York.\u201dDespite Mr. Jones\u2019s early pronouncements that the bans would make his Infowars operation stronger, there are signs he is concerned.On one recent show, he ranted without evidence that Silicon Valley companies gave liberals like the billionaire George Soros access to their users\u2019 personal data, including \u201cyour film roll, what you did with your wife, your kids, you know, in the bathtub, Grandma.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all theirs,\u201d he shouted. \u201cAnd everybody\u2019s lining up to kiss these monsters\u2019 disgusting satanic souls.\u201dSeconds later, the show went to a break, cutting to a recorded promotion in which Mr. Jones urged his followers to share Infowars\u2019 videos on social media and to sign up for its newsletter \u201cso there\u2019s no way the censors can get between us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Sometimes unconsciously and often deliberately, a generation of tech leaders attempted to ape the Apple and Microsoft founders\u2019 charisma, their quirks, their style and above all their irrepressible, hard-charging confidence, to say nothing of arrogance.That is, Mr. Dorsey sounded less like a quotable visionary who can see beyond the horizon and more like what he actually is and ought to be \u2014 a thoughtful, accessible, transparent and, despite the beard and nose ring, kind of boring manager of a serious company whose decisions have world-changing consequences.When it comes to tech C.E.O.s, boring is the new black. Under the glare of global scrutiny, the daring, win-at-all-costs ethos that defined so much of the tech industry in the last couple of decades has been undergoing a thorough metamorphosis.Google once played up the nerdy antics of its founders, but now the company\u2019s leaders are almost unidentifiable ciphers. Larry Page, who runs Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has become a recluse, and even Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s achingly pleasant chief, declined to appear at last week\u2019s hearings.Oh, and I almost forgot about Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O. In my defense, everyone forgets about Mr. Nadella.\u201cA start-up that has five million people using it \u2014 that\u2019s small for Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s a tremendous number of people, and so even they have a large amount of responsibility in the world,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.The tech press has also gotten tougher. Once, novelty alone would merit coverage, but in the social media age, even the tiniest misstep can be ruinous. It has become crucial to get a leader who doesn\u2019t speak out of turn.Mr. Musk\u2019s odd behavior underlines the tensions at play as understated style takes over tech. There is a reason that a big, Jobsian personality was once so prized. Tech companies are leaps of faith. In their early days they exist on the knife edge of oblivion, and it is often only through a founder\u2019s force of personality that investors, employees and the media take any notice. The most beloved founders possess an uncanny genius for selling the world on ideas that look useless, pointless or impossible before we all realize we can never live without them.Though he has made good on only some of those points \u2014 Tesla is now struggling to fulfill orders for the Model 3, the \u201ceven more affordable\u201d car in the plan \u2014 posting the plan was part of an impish ploy to generate publicity for what looked like an outlandish idea. That ploy worked; ever since, Mr. Musk has leveraged his growing celebrity as if it were a currency.Every few months, he makes new promises about this or that amazing thing coming soon. Each time, he reaps more attention and financing and, eventually, builds real cars that are sold to real people. In this way, Mr. Musk\u2019s personality became a key element of not just his companies\u2019 brands, but their business models.But it\u2019s a tricky, high-stakes gamble. For one thing, Mr. Musk has to deliver on his promises. More recently, another problem has eaten at this strategy: The future has been getting less obviously wonderful, so it\u2019s hard to take any tech chief\u2019s assurances that their new thing will indeed be as great for the world as they say.\u201cI tried to convince people to slow down A.I.,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cThis was futile. I tried for many years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.\u201dThus, the tension: On one hand, Mr. Musk wants us to believe that everything he\u2019s building is going to turn out wonderfully. On the other, he\u2019s telling us to be very scared. This sounds like a contradiction, but in its admission of doubt and complexity, it\u2019s actually a pretty good picture of the future.No wonder he sounds crazy. No wonder everyone else is going for boring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "SiriusXM to Buy Pandora for $3.5 Billion in Bid to Expand Reach", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPandora rose to success with radio stations, tailored to users, that were sprinkled with ads. In recent years it has struggled to compete with rival services like Spotify and Apple Music, which dominated music streaming by offering paid on-demand content \u2014 something Pandora was slow to replicate.SiriusXM, one of the first commercial enterprises to sell radio service through satellite systems, has been partly hampered by the high capital costs of its business. Acquiring Pandora would give SiriusXM access to the fast-growing online segment of listeners, those who prefer streaming music through mobile phones. Fewer people are listening to traditional programming, whether over terrestrial or satellite radio.\u201cIt would allow Sirius to reach a much broader audience,\u201d said Justin Patterson, a music industry analyst. He likened the situation to DirecTV, the satellite service owned by AT&T, which also sells a streaming version of its product known as DirecTV Now. The online package is cheaper than the satellite offering and has the potential to reach many more households through existing broadband connections.On a call with analysts, Jim Meyer, SiriusXM\u2019s chief executive, said the acquisition would enable Sirius to try to keep listeners who did not want to pay for music by diverting them toward Pandora\u2019s free ad-based model.\u201cThe truth is the majority of \u2018trial-ers\u2019 ultimately decide not to pay for our service,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times, we would benefit from having a free funnel.\u201dSiriusXM has 36 million subscribers across North America and more than 23 million listeners on trials. The companies said that combined with the 70 million monthly active users on Pandora, this would create the largest digital audio audience in the United States.The $3.5 billion offer is a steep valuation given Pandora\u2019s losses. The company is expected to post a loss of $150 million this year and about $83 million next year.Pandora does stand to benefit from the potential passage of a bill that would make it easier for publishers and artists to earn royalties while also protecting streaming services from lawsuits.SiriusXM\u2019s deal for Pandora allows other potential bidders to emerge in what is known as a go-shop period when the company could attract other buyers. Rivals like Spotify or big tech players like Amazon could come in with a spoiler bid, but Mr. Patterson said he expected Sirius to ultimately close the deal. \u201cThere\u2019s a high probability this goes through,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "8 Ways to Make Your Flight Better", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom scoring the best seat assignment to zipping past security lines: how to make air travel more tolerable.Whether traveling with a spouse or partner, children or solo, the most frequent of fliers know how to ease the pain points and maximize the joys. Below, a primer on how to make air travel more affordable, fun and comfortable so you can once again marvel at being able to soar. As many travelers know, one of the smartest ways to rack up miles is with a credit card that earns you points for the things you spend money on every day.Members can also use their card, points, or both, to book trips \u2014 airfare, hotels, rental cars \u2014 through Chase\u2019s Ultimate Rewards online portal. In August, Chase said it was improving Ultimate Rewards by partnering with Expedia, allowing card holders to use Expedia\u2019s inventory of flights, hotels and vacation rentals, car rentals, and experiences and activities. The new Ultimate Rewards has been rolled out to members of some Chase cards and will be available to Chase Sapphire users in the coming months.When it comes to using points you accrue, some of the biggest wins can be had by booking business or first class award tickets, often through international rather than United States carriers. You will need to find out which international airlines have relationships with your domestic carrier, sign up for the international carriers\u2019 frequent flier programs, and then get your ticket through whichever partner charges the fewest miles.Traveling internationally with an infant? Flying with a \u201clap infant\u201d (usually defined as under 2 years old), can still cost hundreds of dollars, even if you don\u2019t buy a seat for your baby, Ms. Hull said, because you are typically required to pay 10 to 25 percent of the adult fare. But some loyalty programs allow you to use miles for your infant\u2019s fare if the adult is also using miles for the trip. British Airways, for example, charges 10 percent of the miles that the adult award ticket costs, she said. Many credit cards with annual fees come with trip delay coverage \u2014 reimbursement for hotel rooms, meals and misplaced bags \u2014 that people often don\u2019t realize they have. If your flight is delayed a certain number of hours, or overnight, the issuers of these cards will provide several hundred dollars in expenses (for things like lodging and toiletries) for each purchased ticket. Such cards typically pay you for lost baggage as well.Airlines will rarely put you up in a hotel room, and even if they do, Mr. Leff said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay in the hotels they\u2019re offering.\u201d He goes online and books himself a hotel room instead, then sends the receipt, along with receipts for meals, taxis or ride-sharing, to his credit card company. A number of things are excluded from coverage, though, so read the fine print. In order to be reimbursed, you typically have to provide proof of your delay, along with receipts for related expenses. The process isn\u2019t always smooth. In some ways, it\u2019s \u201cno different than dealing with the cable company,\u201d said Mr. Leff. \u201cSo often people feel powerless in travel,\u201d Mr. Leff said. \u201cHaving a few of these tactics just changes that mind-set.\u201dHungry, but short on time before your flight? At some airports, food apps allow you to order a meal, snack or coffee and have it delivered to your departure gate, or elsewhere in the terminal. \u201cIf you travel with a family and don\u2019t yet have PreCheck,\u201d said Ms. Hull, \u201cyou just like being miserable.\u201d A number of rewards cards \u2014 Chase Sapphire Reserve, Citi Prestige and certain American Express cards, among them \u2014 offer statement credits to customers who charge the application fee ($100 for Global Entry; $85 for PreCheck, each for five years). Yet even if your card doesn\u2019t cover such fees, Ms. Hull said, it\u2019s less than $20 a year to avoid a longer, slower, domestic security line. \u201cKids 12 and under can piggyback with approved adults in the PreCheck line,\u201d she said (though they do need to get approved for Global Entry if traveling internationally).Flight delays and cancellations build up throughout the day, and as things get pushed back there\u2019s a risk flight crews will run out of allowable work hours. Want the best chance of taking off? Leave early.Given that some airports are outfitting their common spaces with pretty eateries, power outlets, table top tablets and children\u2019s play areas, hanging out in communal spaces can be more relaxing than a crowded domestic lounge with busted power outlets. Still, what you often get with an airline\u2019s domestic lounge is slightly better customer service, roomier bathrooms and free snacks.

It\u2019s the end of New York as the lodestar for new and uncomfortable ideas. Ms. Romano is a former columnist for The Village Voice and is working on a book about it.The death last week of The Village Voice, the storied alt-weekly, was in some ways to be expected. When its latest owner, Peter D. Barbey, who bought it in 2015 to restore it to its early glory, stopped print publication almost a year ago, it seemed that it would be only a matter of time before its online presence ceased as well. The Voice didn\u2019t appear to have a strong sense of identity anymore, in part because the New York that it covered \u2014 downtown, the underground, bohemia and its ephemera \u2014 didn\u2019t exist anymore, neither in a physical sense nor as a state of mind. SoHo, once the stomping ground of artists and punk rockers, is a high-end shopping mall. CBGB, which The Voice covered religiously when Blondie and Television were at their apex, has been turned into a John Varvatos store and lives on as a T-shirt. The East Village is \u2026 I don\u2019t know what it is anymore. At least Spike Lee is still in Brooklyn.The death of The Voice isn\u2019t just about the end of a newspaper. To some of us at least, it\u2019s about the end of New York as a cultural and political center, as the place that the world turned to for art, for music, for leadership in new and uncomfortable ideas, often perceived by the mainstream to be dangerous or weird. Fred McDarrah, the paper\u2019s photographer for the much of its first three decades, and who remained a part of the paper until his death in 2007, liked to affectionately call it \u201cthe commie, hippie, pinko rag.\u201d The place was filled with characters, and I loved every one of them, even as I was terrified of them. I spent eight years at The Voice. After I interned, I started as a fact checker and became a columnist, writing \u201cFly Life\u201d and \u201cClub Crawl,\u201d two weekly columns about New York night life. It was a dream job \u2014 I had an amount of creative freedom and a filing schedule (weekly) that now seems extravagant and luxurious.But with every passing year, the New York I knew and loved was changing, and eventually, like many others, I left. The city had ceased to be affordable \u2014 and more important, interesting. The night life I had come there to partake in became sanitized by bottle service and Wall Street money. There are now pockets of creativity in parts of the city, mainly in Brooklyn, but even that borough has become more and more gentrified. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Merger of Cigna and Express Scripts Gets Approval From Justice Dept.", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal officials on Monday gave the go-ahead to the proposed merger between Cigna, one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, and Express Scripts, a major pharmacy benefit manager.The Justice Department continues to review the deal between Aetna and CVS, although the two companies are also expected to receive a green light soon.The deals also represent a recognition by established companies that they need to change their business model in response to customer demands that prices are better controlled. Both insurers and pharmacy benefit managers serve as middlemen for employers and governments, and the proposed mergers are an attempt to convince their customers that they are working to reduce costs.The entrenched industry has also been buffeted by a new alliance among the corporate giants Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase, which have created a separate health care entity out of their frustration with big insurers and the major pharmacy managers. Those companies want to develop new ways to cut through the seemingly intractable, expensive systems of coverage for their employees.The decision by federal antitrust officials to allow Cigna to buy Express Scripts signals an acceptance of so-called vertical mergers in which companies, although in the same broad line of business, do not directly compete. The nation\u2019s big health insurers, including Aetna and Cigna, had previously tried to combine with other insurers, only to have those deals blocked over concerns about the possible impact on consumers.In approving the Cigna-Express Scripts deal, federal officials emphasized that they did not believe the merger would damp competition in the pharmacy business.Both companies argue that the merger will benefit consumers by allowing Cigna and Express Scripts to better manage their customers\u2019 health by sharing information about both their medical and drug expenses. The other major insurers, UnitedHealth Group and Anthem, have also moved away from using outside benefit managers, posing major threats to CVS and Express Scripts.Rising drug prices are forcing the issue for the insurers, said Terry Stone, a managing partner for Oliver Wyman, a consultant. Many were unprepared for the onslaught of new, very expensive medications, she said, and were \u201ccaught off guard\u201d when the new hepatitis C drugs were introduced a few years ago at a cost of tens of thousands of dollars to treat a single individual.She argued the combination of these large insurers, with expertise in managing costs for chronic diseases, and the pharmacy managers offer \u201ca huge amount of synergy.\u201dBoth the insurers and pharmacy companies are under tremendous pressure to prove they can deliver cost-conscious results, said Jim Winkler, a senior executive at Aon, a benefits consultant. \u201cIt is reasonable to say both models have to change and will change,\u201d he said.But the parties will have to do more than merge to convince employers that they are offering something of greater value than they do separately, said Mr. Winkler, who noted that many employers said they did not intend to change their benefits strategy when the mergers were first announced.Cigna and Express Script may say they will now be able to share information about patients, but it is unclear whether the combined companies will be able to negotiate lower drug prices and better manage people with expensive diseases, he said. These are \u201cinteresting questions without answers,\u201d Mr. Winkler said.The deals also reflect an increasing interest in the business of providing private plans under the Medicare program, where drug benefits represent a critical component of an insurers\u2019 offerings, Mr. Winkler said. Cigna\u2019s purchase of Express Scripts allows the company, which is not considered a major player in Medicare Advantage, to increase its presence, he said.Cigna and Express Scripts said they had already received approval from 16 state insurance departments and were working with regulators in the other states to get the necessary approval. Shareholders of both companies have already voted to go ahead with the deal, and the companies said they expected the deal to close by the end of the year.Advertisement"}

Then it turned and trotted toward a brick building, climbing over a curb and stopping within inches of a floor-length window. Pausing for several seconds, it seemed to eye its own reflection in the glass.The scene was mesmerizing \u2014 so mesmerizing, it was easy to forget that a woman was guiding the four-legged machine from across the parking lot, a joystick in her hands and a laptop computer strapped to her waist.Even now, it is not entirely clear what someone would do with one of these robots. That makes it hard to get past a question people have been asking about Boston Dynamics for years: Is this a business or a research lab?\u201cWe think the technology has reached a point where it can be deployed productively,\u201d Marc Raibert, the company\u2019s founder, said during a recent interview inside his robotics lab, about 10 miles from Boston. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know what the big application is.\u201dBut if driverless cars are still years away from everyday use, walking robots are even further. Though these machines are shockingly lifelike, they have limits. They can handle some tasks on their own, like spotting a curb and climbing over it. But when moving across unfamiliar spaces, like the parking lot outside the Boston Dynamics lab, they still need a human guide. In person, they stumble and fall more often than they do on YouTube. Walking through the Boston Dynamics lab, Mr. Raibert, 68, wore bluejeans and a Hawaiian shirt, as he does nearly every day. He wants to build robots that can do what humans and animals can do. That was his aim in the early 1980s, when he founded the Leg Lab at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. And it was his aim when he moved the lab to M.I.T.In 2013, Google acquired Boston Dynamics during a broad push toward driverless cars and other robotics. But just four years later, Google, known for its \u201cmoonshot\u201d bets on long-term tech projects, sold Boston Dynamics to SoftBank.Mr. Raibert declined to say how much Google or SoftBank had paid for the company. He said both owners had provided ample funding for its research, and their involvement shows the potential of his work.No machine comes closer to his vision than Atlas, a 165-pound anthropomorphic robot that can run, jump and even do back flips. Mr. Raibert would not let us shoot video of Atlas or other robots while inside the lab. But he did give a brief demonstration of the machine.Like the SpotMini, Atlas is controlled by a joystick, a laptop computer and a wireless radio. When Mr. Raibert signaled for the demo, an engineer touched the joystick and the 165-pound robot crashed to the floor. Atlas is so large and so lifelike, you feel bad for it.Mr. Raibert and his colleagues put the machine back on its feet and tried again. When the engineers touched the joystick, Atlas crashed to the floor a second time.Eventually, the engineers got Atlas up and running \u2014 and sprinting and jumping and crashing headlong into an orange pylon. The excitement was mixed with discomfort when an engineer shoved its chest with the end of a broom handle and it stayed on its robotic feet. \u201cWe subconsciously treat robots like living things \u2014 and I don\u2019t think that effect will go away as we get used to the technology,\u201d said Kate Darling, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab who specializes in the ethics of robotics. \u201cIn some ways, we are biologically hard-wired to respond in this way.\u201dWith its YouTube videos, Boston Dynamics plays with this phenomenon. The videos rarely reveal the human operators who guide the machines.SpotMini is smaller and cheaper and has better balance than Atlas. It can carry (small) items on its back, and it can open doors (provided the doors have the proper handles). This requires an extra limb that attaches between its shoulders.The sales plans for SpotMini seem vague. It will be priced like a car \u2014 cars, Mr. Raibert added, have a wide range of prices \u2014 and it will be sold to businesses like construction companies. He talked in general terms about the machine\u2019s lugging stuff across rough terrain or into places unsafe for humans.As the technology improves, it could be a delivery robot, walking packages down the street, up your front steps and onto your porch. Mr. Raibert showed how a SpotMini could serve as a kind of automated security guard. Boston Dynamics has created a three-dimensional map of its lab, and the SpotMini can use this map to navigate the lab on its own. It could, in theory, patrol after everyone else had gone home.When Google acquired Boston Dynamics, it ended the company\u2019s military contracts. Now that the company is owned by SoftBank, Mr. Raibert said, it could also return to military work. Boston Dynamics does seem to have an owner willing to wait until the business gets figured out. And with a $100 billion investment fund, a partnership with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, SoftBank is betting on technologies that require years of work. Before buying Boston Dynamics, it acquired a French robotics company, Aldebaran, which also is working on machines that are a long way from completion. At Boston Dynamics, Mr. Raibert wants to sell robots to businesses, governments and all sorts of other customers. He calls himself \u201ca lifer\u201d in his quest to build machines that can do everything animals and humans can do. And if that means finding a way to make money from his experiments along the way, so be it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "You May Be Surprised to Hear That Restoration Hardware Is Doing Great", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydomainsRestoration Hardware seemed doomed. Now, it\u2019s a vast and booming bricks and mortar empire. What gives?On the second Saturday in September, the new RH Gallery opened its doors to the Meatpacking District, looking just as you\u2019d expect: a glowering, 90,000-square-foot landscape of poured concrete flecked with bronze, stone and glass, through which sails a flotilla of enormous gray velvet and white linen sofas. This shopper became entangled in the downy raft of a massive sectional called Cloud, and struggled to right herself. Alongside her, a pair of tween siblings were curled over their devices; when they lurched up and wandered away, sales associates darted in to fluff the pillows. Along the charcoal-colored walls, armies of classical statuary and framed plaster intaglios offered a whiff of the Grand Tour. (\u201cIntaglios can flex modern and classic at the same time,\u201d noted a design associate.)But here were faux-shagreen consoles, chest-high urns stuffed with bright green moss and geodes glowing on the black bamboo tables, as if the Perseids had just whooshed through. Glassy conference rooms \u2014 more intaglios, more moss \u2014 were equipped with heavy black curtains, for those desiring to shop in private, with separate entrances to admit celebrities. Department stores like Bendel, with its Street of Shops, and Bloomingdale\u2019s, with its themed extravaganzas, used to offer wares as an Indian bazaar does: a sensory overload of artisanal objects, along with pieces by upcoming designers. It\u2019s clear that Gary Friedman, RH\u2019s chairman, C.E.O. and brand avatar, is influenced by that model. But a closer match is the empire Ralph Lauren built, where stylists scout thrift stores and old magazines, and produce simulacra of alternate worlds.To make the business scalable, the worldview is pretty narrow. \u201cRemember in the 90s when everyone started saying they wanted to live in a hotel?\u201d said Stephen Drucker, the longtime lifestyle editor. \u201cGary was the first person to put that idea into a brand. What if you could live in an Aman in Thailand all the time? The downside is that nobody can stomp a good idea like RH,\u201d Mr. Drucker continued, invoking RH\u2019s infamous catalogs. \u201cYou love it on Page 1, but you\u2019re sick to death of it by Page 784.\u201dMichael Cox and Felipe Bastos, both interior designers, were also inspecting the Clouds that Saturday. Mr. Bastos liked the fact that the sofas looked like unmade beds. \u201cThey invite you to sit down again,\u201d he said. Mr. Bastos was shopping, as was this reporter, against the advice of an opinionated friend who insisted that \u201cwhite was the color of fear.\u201d What did Mr. Cox think?\u201cIt\u2019s a Freudian thing,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cIt has to do with retention, and holding your breath.\u201d The designers responsible for the RH empire may be suffering from what the Scottish artist David Batchelor describes as \u201cchromophobia.\u201d (Mr. Friedman would counter that neutrals are 80 percent of the furniture business.) In his book of the same name, from 2000, Mr. Batchelor warned of a creeping colorlessness in high-end interiors. \u201cStrategic emptiness,\u201d he wrote, was a Western problem \u2014 and a sign of intellectual sloth \u2014 that telegraphed a fear of the other. (Like Melville\u2019s discourse on the whiteness of the whale, it\u2019s worth a read.) Mr. Batchelor would likely be appalled by a visit to an RH Gallery.In any case, Mr. Cox, a principal at the design firm Foley & Cox who in his youth was design director of furniture at Polo/Ralph Lauren, had other concerns besides the 50 shades of gray and white palette in the store. He was impressed by the designer collaborations \u2014 Fortuny chandeliers and tables by Wyeth \u2014 and yet, he said later, he was reminded of Garanimals, the \u201970s era children\u2019s clothing line you could mix and match. \u201cIt\u2019s for someone who doesn\u2019t feel confident putting together an interior on their own,\u201d he said, \u201cand so the pieces are simplified so that it\u2019s almost impossible to go wrong. In some ways it\u2019s related to the dumbing down of so much of life: an instant pudding interior so you don\u2019t have to think about what you want or define your personality.\u201dThe new RH store was seven years in the making. It opened with a flashy party that had caviar bars and dewy-faced models, Martha Stewart and Ryan Seacrest, and Mr. Friedman, now 61, said it brought tears to his eyes.\u201cI was a stock boy at the Gap,\u201d he said, speaking from London, where he hopes to open more Galleries. \u201cI got booted out of junior college. I thought being a store manager was the best it was going to get. I though rich people had color TVs.\u201dMr. Friedman\u2019s origin story is worth knowing. His father died when he was five, and he was raised by his mother in a one-bedroom apartment in Sonoma, Calif. She was schizophrenic, and unable to work by the time he was 15. He carried a D-average at community college, and supported himself and his mother by working at the Gap. There, he was spotted by Millard \u201cMickey\u201d Drexler, the veteran retailer who was then remaking the Gap into a multibillion dollar company. He promoted Mr. Friedman to store manager, and he then worked his way up to become the youngest regional manager there. After the Gap, Mr. Friedman was hired by Williams Sonoma, where he took over Pottery Barn, among other brands, and turned its tabletop business into a billion-dollar home furnishings company. He spent 14 years at Williams Sonoma, and left when he wasn\u2019t chosen to be its C.E.O., to take over a company that was careering toward bankruptcy.Restoration Hardware opened in 1979 as a source for old house restorers but by the late \u201990s had been reimagined as a quirky housewares store, selling objects with nostalgic narratives \u2014 Italian fans and Stickley furniture, garden gnomes and office-style pencil sharpers, e.g. \u2014 to baby boomers pining for their lost youth. By 2001, it was floundering. When Mr. Friedman took it over, he shook out the gnomes and the pencil sharpeners and the board games, and brought in supersized versions of stuff that was reminiscent of the work of designers like Axel Vervoordt or Christian Liaigre. There was a steam punk period, where every object was made from riveted aluminum, and a deconstructed period, when he sold shredded French balloon chairs. It was easy to parody. It was also appealing to a new shopping cohort, men like Mr. Friedman, who wore bluejeans and T-shirts with their blazers and maybe a silver bracelet and wanted interiors to match.\u201cHe identified a customer who appreciates good design and doesn\u2019t have the budget to go to an interior designer and spend $15,000 on a couch,\u201d said Warren Shoulberg, who covers the retail and trade furniture business, of Mr. Friedman. \u201cMore importantly, he\u2019s created a physical environment that nobody else is doing in the home business that takes people off their computers and into a store where they buy more stuff.\u201dRH\u2019s revenues soared, post-IPO, and dipped again two years ago. But then a few things happened: the company consolidated its back-end operations and introduced a membership model, like Amazon Prime or Costco: $100 a year for 25 percent off all sales. Those customers, 405,000 to date, are now driving 95 percent of revenue. Additionally, RH has morphed into a hospitality business, with profitable restaurants and even a food, wine, art and design compound, to use RH parlance, in the Napa Valley. Next year, its first hotel, the RH Guesthouse, is planned to open on Gansevoort Street. Last year, in a collision of lifestyle brands that surely tore some corner of the universe, an RH team designed the new Goop headquarters in Santa Monica.RH projects sales of nearly $2.5 billion for 2018, up about a billion from 2013. According to Furniture Today, a trade publication that ranks furniture and mattress companies by revenue each year, RH was number six in 2017, up from 13 five years ago. (Ashley HomeStore, a midpriced home store that also sells mattresses, was number one with over $4 billion in sales. Ikea, number three.)\u201cI like to say that retail has a shelf life, but Gary is only in his third or fourth inning,\u201d said Mr. Drexler, who now runs his own venture capital firm, of his former pupil. \u201cIt\u2019s guaranteed that every fashion business will hit a wall, and frankly Gary has hit a number of walls, and he bounces back.\u201dLately, RH\u2019s appropriation efforts have gone into reproducing decorative items like spiral narwhal tusks, Congolese brass ankle bracelets and carved Ethiopian bowls. There are even a few originals to fit your inner Peter Beard, like antique fisherman\u2019s paddles from Indonesia. The reproductions are quite good, but tablescaping your home with such very particular objects that nonetheless have been scaled for a company with sales in the billions does present a challenge, taste-wise. How many bachelor pads can or should sport the same narwhal tusk, set of framed intaglios and cluster of geodes?On Saturday, Judith Bodnar, an internist from outside Albany, was trying out the Italia slope arm sofa in white linen for a pied-\u00e0-terre she\u2019s bought in Virginia Beach to be near her grandchildren. (\u201cI don\u2019t want to be nana in the back bedroom,\u201d she said.) Would she be buying the spiky purple geode in front of her, too? She would not, because it turns out she already has a few. Dr. Bodnar and her late husband were adventurous travelers, she said, and avid collectors. In addition to geodes, they amassed fossils of trilobites, ferns and fishes, as well as an authentic poison blow gun from the Amazon that includes a piranha jaw to sharpen the darts.\u201cAll I need is a sofa my girlfriends can sleep on,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos Cites a Big Number, but Few Details, in Plan for Low-Income Montessori Preschools", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Jeff Bezos announced last week that he and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, would create and operate a national network of Montessori preschools, few were more surprised than Montessori organizations and leaders themselves.News of the initiative, called the Bezos Day One Fund, came with an eye-popping commitment: $2 billion, some of which will support organizations that help homeless families.Rebecca Pelton, president of the Montessori Accreditation Council for Teacher Education, said a key challenge would be recruiting and training enough quality teachers to staff the network\u2019s schools. She warned against online-only teacher-training programs, which have proliferated, but may not offer hands-on student teaching experience in Montessori classrooms.Still, Dr. Pelton said, \u201cI have faith that he\u2019s going to do the research and ask the right questions.\u201dMontessori\u2019s unique combination of freedom and rigidity \u2014 a famously \u201cchild-centered\u201d practice with a host of rules and restrictions \u2014 can make its classrooms look drastically different from traditional ones.Students span a three-year age range, say, between 3 and 5. Dressing up or talking about fairies or superheroes is not allowed. Instead of a play kitchen, there may be a real one, where students might pour their own juice into a glass cup, not a plastic one, so that they will learn the lesson that a glass can break if they are careless.And every day, students get three-hour blocks of unscheduled, uninterrupted \u201cwork\u201d time \u2014 the word \u201cplay\u201d is not used \u2014 in which they are free to choose their activities, whether finger-painting or sorting wooden pegs.It is unclear how many schools Mr. Bezos\u2019 network will consist of, where they will be located and whether they will cooperate or compete with existing Montessori programs that aim to serve children from low-income families. Those schools are typically funded through a mix of taxpayer dollars, philanthropic support and tuition from parents who can afford to pay.Of the 5,000 Montessori schools in the United States, only about 10 percent are public. Tuition at private Montessori preschools in urban centers can reach $30,000 per year. For schools, the start-up costs are significant, with a full set of Montessori materials costing between $25,000 and $50,000 per classroom.Mr. Bezos said his schools would be \u201cfull scholarship,\u201d implying, some observers thought, that the network would be fully private, with seats reserved for poor children, as opposed to a more common public-private partnership, with an integrated mix of students from different backgrounds.A model that forgoes government dollars and parent tuition would most likely serve fewer children than the hybrid approach. But it would also free Mr. Bezos from some of the bureaucratic burdens that public schools must contend with.An Amazon spokesman, Drew Herdener, declined to answer questions about plans for the preschools.Some Montessori advocates said that despite their mystification over the details, they were thrilled with news of the fund and its potential to inspire policymakers and other donors.\u201cThe first reaction is, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a ton of money,\u2019\u201d said Keith Whitescarver, executive director of the National Center for Montessori in the Public Sector. \u201cIt leads to changing the ecosystem.\u201dWith little else to parse, Montessori leaders pored over Mr. Bezos\u2019 brief statement, which described the planned schools as \u201cMontessori-inspired.\u201d The term \u201cMontessori\u201d is not copyrighted, and any school can choose to describe itself as such.But the movement has always faced challenges in appealing to parents who desire a more traditional education for their children. In a classic Montessori school, teachers generally do not lecture in front of the classroom and instead impart lessons on phonics or counting by engaging students individually or in small groups. They may invite children to participate in an activity, but do not require them to do so.That is counterintuitive for many traditionally trained educators. \u201cInstead of having one lesson plan, you have 24 different lesson plans, one for each child in the classroom,\u201d said Katie Kitchens, a Montessori specialist at a public school in Austin, Tex., and the vice president of Montessori for Social Justice, which seeks to expand the movement\u2019s reach. \u201cIt\u2019s a really humbling process. You\u2019re no longer the center of that conversation anymore, the keeper of all the information. It\u2019s this constant process of stepping back.\u201dThe first Americans to embrace Montessori were in fact affluent, white suburbanites. But by the 1960s, black and Latino parents were opening Montessori schools in many cities, attracted by the idea that a child-centered education could combat racism. Those programs often had trouble winning the philanthropic support they needed to survive, according to Mira Debs, executive director of the education studies program at Yale.Faybra Hemphill, director of racial equity, curriculum and training at City Garden Montessori School in St. Louis, said she was curious to see what the Bezoses have planned. On a small scale, City Garden is already doing the work Mr. Bezos said he aspired to; about 40 percent of the school\u2019s students come from low-income families and half are nonwhite.Ms. Hemphill said she had some advice.The Bezoses should come to the work, she said, with \u201cradical listening and radical humility. Go to the communities, talk to parents, talk to children, talk to teachers and administrators and ask them: \u2018What do you need? What are your hopes and dreams for education and for your children?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Takeover of Shazam Is Cleared by European Regulators", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 European authorities on Thursday cleared Apple\u2019s acquisition of the popular song-recognition app Shazam, after months of study into whether the deal would give the iPhone maker an unfair advantage over rival streaming music services like Spotify.Apple said in December that it had agreed to buy Shazam, prompting European regulators to scrutinize the proposed takeover as part of a broader effort to examine the value of data when evaluating mergers.In the case of Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam, regulators questioned whether the app held important information on Apple competitors. The focus on data transfer is a departure from typical antitrust enforcement, which tends to zero in on how a deal may affect customers in terms of a product\u2019s cost.The Apple deal, Ms. Vestager said, would not impede competition.The case was a rare instance in which European antitrust authorities have passed on an opportunity to act against an American technology giant. The region has gained a reputation as the world\u2019s strictest overseer of the technology industry.When starting their investigation of the Apple-Shazam deal in February, regulators said they were concerned that Apple would block Shazam from referring customers to rival services, or that it would use the app to poach customers.On Thursday, the European Commission said that after a six-month review, it had concluded that the app did not give Apple an unfair advantage that merited government intervention.\u201cAccess to Shazam\u2019s data would not materially increase Apple\u2019s ability to target music enthusiasts and any conduct aimed at making customers switch would only have a negligible impact,\u201d the commission said in a statement.Spotify, a major rival to Apple\u2019s own music-streaming service, declined to comment.Shazam was an early hit in Apple\u2019s App Store thanks to its novel ability to quickly identify a track after using a smartphone\u2019s microphone to \u201clisten\u201d for only a few seconds. The two companies established closer ties in 2014, when Shazam was integrated into Apple\u2019s voice-powered digital assistant Siri, allowing users to ask, \u201cHey Siri, what song is playing?\u201dThe app mainly makes money by selling advertisements and collecting fees when it refers users to a music service like Apple and Spotify. Shazam is also a valuable source of data, giving music companies insight into what songs and artists are performing well, and in which regions.Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam has been seen as a possible test case for Ms. Vestager, who has said antitrust enforcement must evolve to consider the value of data.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers effectively pay with their data, and that they are not always getting a fair deal.Broadening the interpretation of antitrust law would have consequences for future acquisitions. But whether such an argument would hold up in a courtroom has not yet been well established, making it harder for authorities to step in.Working in Apple\u2019s favor was the fact the European Commission had previously approved acquisitions between several data-rich companies, including Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of LinkedIn.Advertisement"}

Season 2 made me chuckle more often than any other recent non-comedy.And Mr. Pearce is supported by a crack cast that includes Marta Dusseldorp as Irish\u2019s mostly off-again journalist girlfriend, Linda; Roy Billing as Harry, Irish\u2019s bookie and occasional employer; and Aaron Pedersen as Harry\u2019s enforcer and Irish\u2019s reluctant sometime accomplice, Cam.Harry and Cam carry the second season\u2019s primary subplot, a lighthearted but bone-cracking account of a squabble among racetrack rivals. Unlike other streaming-era shows that struggle to fill out their eight- or 10-episode runs, \u201cJack Irish\u201d stuffs an extraordinary amount of plot into its half-dozen hours. Irish, with help from Linda, Cam and other regulars (including the endearingly acerbic hacker Simone, played by Kate Atkinson), unravels a byzantine case on several continents while helping out at the track and looking after a surly new acquaintance who threatens to become a surrogate daughter.The students\u2019 travails are primarily a device to get Irish\u2019s conscience working, and they don\u2019t exactly mesh thematically with the show\u2019s overarching nostalgia for Melbourne\u2019s simpler, funkier, more honest (perhaps imaginary) past. The season is consequently a little less satisfying on an emotional level than the earlier stories, where Irish\u2019s motivations were more personal. But whether you\u2019re caught up or a binge-ready newbie, it\u2019s a show that should be on the noir fan\u2019s watch list.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article described incorrectly the role played by Guy Pearce. His character, Jack Irish, is the show\u2019s protagonist; he does not carry the primary subplot involving rivals at a racetrack.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "When Cryptocurrencies Fluctuate, He Uses These Tech Tools to Keep Track", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nathaniel Popper, who covers cryptocurrencies and financial technology for The Times from San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.There are many cryptocurrencies and they often fluctuate in value. What tech products do you use to keep your finger on the pulse?Most conversations about cryptocurrencies tend to start with the price, and there are now countless services that track the ups and downs of the thousands of digital tokens out there.For communicating with sources, I have to use way too many messaging apps. In China, where cryptocurrencies are big, everyone is on WeChat. Most other sources outside the United States are on either WhatsApp or Telegram. In the United States, the anti-government folks \u2014 and the privacy advocates who are concerned about surveillance \u2014 only want to chat on Signal, which encrypts messages in both directions.You also cover financial tech. How has technology changed the way people do banking and what do you think of all the fintech start-ups?There have been several advances in online financial services that seem like real progress to me and I\u2019m always surprised that more people don\u2019t take advantage of them. At the most basic level, the advent of online check deposits has made it so that I don\u2019t need to go into a bank, which I\u2019ll be happy to never do again.Online banking has also made it easier to shop for better interest rates and benefits. Guided by sites like Bankrate and Nerdwallet, I\u2019ve moved my money around quite a bit as I look for the best deals. I currently have an account with Ally, which is giving me 1.8 percent on my cash \u2014 compared with the 0.1 percent that Wells Fargo is offering \u2014 and reimburses me for any fees I get charged when I use out-of-network ATMs.I do the same shopping for credit cards, often following the advice of The Points Guy to find the best perks and free miles. For people with good credit, there\u2019s little reason not to be getting back 2 percent on everything you purchase, and for people with worse credit, it is now much easier to find lower interest rates.Beyond these banking services, though, I\u2019ve been somewhat underwhelmed by the products being offered by the enormous crop of fintech start-ups that have popped up over the last decade. I\u2019ve tried lots of apps and tools to get my financial life in order, but few of them are sufficiently intuitive, or add much beyond what you can get from traditional providers like Vanguard and Mint \u2014 or a simple Excel spreadsheet.When I was house hunting last year, I did use Credit Karma to stay on top of my credit score. But beyond that, financial arrangements are incredibly personal, which seems to make it difficult to automate. It\u2019s also harder for people to experiment with financial apps than with other online services because it often requires entering lots of banking details that people don\u2019t want to share. At this point, the only financial apps I regularly use beyond my bank are Venmo and Square Cash, which have made it so much easier to send money to friends and family.You\u2019re not allowed to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for ethical reasons. But if you could, would you? I do make an exception for people who are genuinely interested in the novel qualities of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, like the ability to hold money on a shared ledger, rather than in a bank, and to send money without going through intermediaries. But even for these folks, the place to start is by buying a very small quantity \u2014 say $50 of Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 to try it out and see what it can do. If, at that point, you still think this is going to take over the world, then buy more \u2014 but only what you are willing to lose.Cryptocurrencies have tanked recently. Will the likes of Bitcoin, Ether and XRP ever be worth nothing?For most other coins, which have weathered many fewer attacks and unexpected hurdles, the chances are undoubtedly higher. There are still basic questions about whether the technology underlying virtual currencies can scale to take on more users and preserve the privacy of those users. There are also economic questions about how the prices will behave, and how users will respond to the changing prices if and when more people start using the coins.At this point, these are all still experiments in what happens when you put together a bunch of cutting-edge cryptography, legal theory and economics. But that is also what makes it so interesting.What tech products do you obsess over in your personal life? My love of music has me constantly searching for better streaming radio stations without ads or talk. I am also always trying to make better playlists on Spotify in the hopes that it will help Spotify better find new music for me. I am fascinated with why Spotify doesn\u2019t give me better suggestions and generally just offers up the most boring version of what I\u2019ve already listened to.Around the house, we use an Amazon Echo and a Google Home device to set timers and play music for my kids. But I also love testing all the ways that these \u201csmart\u201d devices are still terrible at answering the most basic questions and completing the most basic tasks. One of my favorites was when I asked Alexa to play a symphony by Beethoven and she said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t find any symphony songs by Beethoven.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "To Restore Civil Society, Start With the Library", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis crucial institution is being neglected just when we need it the most.Is the public library obsolete? A lot of powerful forces in society seem to think so. In recent years, declines in the circulation of bound books in some parts of the country have led prominent critics to argue that libraries are no longer serving their historical function. Countless elected officials insist that in the 21st century \u2014 when so many books are digitized, so much public culture exists online and so often people interact virtually \u2014 libraries no longer need the support they once commanded.Libraries are being disparaged and neglected at precisely the moment when they are most valued and necessary. Why the disconnect? In part it\u2019s because the founding principle of the public library \u2014 that all people deserve free, open access to our shared culture and heritage \u2014 is out of sync with the market logic that dominates our world. But it\u2019s also because so few influential people understand the expansive role that libraries play in modern communities. Libraries are an example of what I call \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d: the physical spaces and organizations that shape the way people interact. Libraries don\u2019t just provide free access to books and other cultural materials, they also offer things like companionship for older adults, de facto child care for busy parents, language instruction for immigrants and welcoming public spaces for the poor, the homeless and young people.I recently spent a year doing ethnographic research in libraries in New York City. Again and again, I was reminded how essential libraries are, not only for a neighborhood\u2019s vitality but also for helping to address all manner of personal problems.For older people, especially widows, widowers and those who live alone, libraries are places for culture and company, through book clubs, movie nights, sewing circles and classes in art, current events and computing. For many, the library is the main place they interact with people from other generations.For children and teenagers, libraries help instill an ethic of responsibility, to themselves and to their neighbors, by teaching them what it means to borrow and take care of something public, and to return it so others can have it too. For new parents, grandparents and caretakers who feel overwhelmed when watching an infant or a toddler by themselves, libraries are a godsend.In many neighborhoods, particularly those where young people aren\u2019t hyper-scheduled in formal after-school programs, libraries are highly popular among adolescents and teenagers who want to spend time with other people their age. One reason is that they\u2019re open, accessible and free. Another is that the library staff members welcome them; in many branches, they even assign areas for teenagers to be with one another.To appreciate why this matters, compare the social space of the library with the social space of commercial establishments like Starbucks or McDonald\u2019s. These are valuable parts of the social infrastructure, but not everyone can afford to frequent them, and not all paying customers are welcome to stay for long.This is not to say that libraries are always peaceful and serene. During the time I spent doing research, I witnessed a handful of heated disputes, physical altercations and other uncomfortable situations, sometimes involving people who appeared to be mentally ill or under the influence of drugs. But such problems are inevitable in a public institution that\u2019s dedicated to open access, especially when drug clinics, homeless shelters and food banks routinely turn away \u2014 and often refer to the library! \u2014 those who most need help. What\u2019s remarkable is how rarely these disruptions happen, how civilly they are managed and how quickly a library regains its rhythm afterward.The openness and diversity that flourish in neighborhood libraries were once a hallmark of urban culture. But that has changed. Though American cities are growing more ethnically, racially and culturally diverse, they too often remain divided and unequal, with some neighborhoods cutting themselves off from difference \u2014 sometimes intentionally, sometimes just by dint of rising costs \u2014 particularly when it comes to race and social class.Libraries are the kinds of places where people with different backgrounds, passions and interests can take part in a living democratic culture. They are the kinds of places where the public, private and philanthropic sectors can work together to reach for something higher than the bottom line. If we have any chance of rebuilding a better society, social infrastructure like the library is precisely what we need. Correction: September 11, 2018An earlier version of this essay included outdated information about a policy at the public libraries in San Jose, Calif. Patrons are prohibited from borrowing books and using computers once their overdue fees surpass $20, not $10.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Big Tech, a Comeuppance We\u2019ve Seen Before: On Wall St.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When I moved to the Bay Area two years ago, it was with a sense of relief.Relief from New York winters and deteriorating subways, yes. But also relief after six years of covering Wall Street, an industry that had moved from one crisis to another after the financial crash of 2008, drawing the unending wrath of the public.In California I was joining a growing team of reporters covering Silicon Valley, which had quickly become the new engine of the economy. Just like Wall Street before it lost its luster, the tech industry had become the destination of choice for the top college graduates. I would be writing about a place where everyone was focused more on the future than on the past.Now, just two years after getting here, and a decade after the start of the financial crisis, I have a creeping sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I go about my job.Admiration of the tech world has, in the wake of a growing list of scandals, quickly soured into an intense suspicion that manages to cross partisan lines, similar to what Wall Street faced after 2008.As was true after the financial crisis, the backlash against tech rises out of a public awakening to the integral role that these huge companies occupy in our society \u2014 with Facebook, Uber and Twitter playing the part that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase did a decade ago.\u201cPeople talk about bankers being amoral,\u201d said Charlie Beckett, the director of the Truth, Trust and Technology Commission at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey are starting to talk about tech people in similar language. Where before they were kind of heroes \u2014 they were people who brought us these wonderful products \u2014 they are now starting to be blamed for the ills of the world.\u201dIt often feels as though these companies took on their pivotal positions so quickly that no one \u2014 not even their employees \u2014 had a chance to understand how they really worked or how much influence they had.Ana Bot\u00edn, a longtime executive at the giant Spanish bank Santander, recently wrote on LinkedIn that the tech companies were losing the same basic thing that banks lost in 2008: the public\u2019s trust.\u201cSome in big tech are beginning to accept what we in banking learned some years ago: We don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d Ms. Bot\u00edn told me last week.The storm that Ms. Bot\u00edn and other bank executives faced after 2008 and the one we are witnessing now are obviously different.The crisis precipitated by the banks was a financial one that caused markets to crash, and threatened to bring down the global economy.The crisis involving the internet giants is not hitting our pocketbooks \u2014 it is straining our confidence in what we know about the world. If Russian hackers can create and amplify fake news stories across the many sites we have come to rely on, where can we go for reliable information?In public surveys, like the Harris Poll Reputation Quotient, the tech giants are still polling well ahead of Goldman and Wells Fargo, and some, like Amazon and Apple, seem to be mostly flying above the fray.The exact ills that people assign to the industry tend to differ based on their politics. While people on the right, including President Trump, have expressed the most concern about political bias and censorship, the left has worried more about the way the companies opened the door to election interference and have exacerbated income inequality. But nearly everyone is voicing unease about the way our children have been turned into digital addicts.The broad shift in perception is inevitably piling more blame onto the shoulders of one industry than it should bear. Like the mortgage meltdown, our current crisis of confidence is the result of factors that go beyond any one player in the drama \u2014 from the polarization of the media landscape to the growing economic inequality that has led to distrust of elites of all sorts.Whatever the reality, political momentum is building behind some sort of broader regulatory response, similar to what came together in the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The current push has begun with talk of legislation that would protect our privacy \u2014 but much bolder steps are being considered.What I wonder now is whether any regulatory response will follow a similar path to what came after the financial crisis.A long list of new laws in the United States and Europe did seem to make the banks safer and another crisis less likely.But the regulations also appear to have cemented the status of the biggest banks in our economy. The largest financial institutions now control a bigger proportion of the industry\u2019s assets than they did before the crisis. These big banks are regulated as if they were more like utilities, but the high regulatory costs provide a kind of barrier against most competitors.It is easy to imagine something similar happening in the technology industry, and European authorities have already taken some steps in that direction.If tech companies are forced to be more responsible for the content on their platforms, they will most likely need to build a significant apparatus for compliance. That would cut into profitability. It would also make it very hard for upstarts to challenge them.\u201cThere\u2019s an increasingly loud call for the platforms to get involved in content moderation,\u201d said Cory Doctorow, a special adviser with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s well intentioned, but the outcome of that is very likely to be pretty disastrous.\u201dMr. Doctorow has been part of a growing chorus of people calling for antitrust actions to break up the biggest companies, rather than tweaking their operations.Whatever steps the government takes, they are unlikely to help recover the trust that has already been lost. As I know from those years of covering the banks, confidence, once gone, is not easily regained.As for me, the familiar problems have not allowed for the change of pace I was expecting. And in truth, the subways out here are no better. But the weather is still very nice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Beating Disney for Sky, Comcast Remains in the Game", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byComcast and the Walt Disney Company have long been rivals. But Brian L. Roberts, who runs Comcast, has recently become the Magic Kingdom\u2019s nemesis in chief.For Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive, the loss of Sky and its vast European customer base to Mr. Roberts has to sting. It was perhaps the first time during his ultrasuccessful 13-year tenure that Mr. Iger was denied such a prize, one he called \u201ca crown jewel\u201d when first pursuing it.But the realities of the entertainment business make the outcome more complicated.\u201cI am happy that Disney didn\u2019t get it,\u201d Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email. \u201cComcast paid a very expensive price for this, and I think it\u2019s hard to justify.\u201dComcast\u2019s offer for the majority stake in Sky puts that total value of the company at $48 billion including assumed debt, or 15 times expected 2018 earnings.Mr. Nathanson added, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t stop Disney.\u201dMr. Iger could also refuse to sell, which would put more pressure on Mr. Roberts because there will be a smaller pool of Sky investors from which to cobble together a majority stake.Sky shareholders must agree to sell their stock to Comcast in the weeks ahead. Comcast needs more than 50 percent of shares to complete its offer.Hulu could emerge as another chess piece. Disney is poised to own about 60 percent of that service after it closes the deal for 21st Century Fox, but Comcast would remain a minority shareholder with 30 percent. Hulu, which has over 20 million subscribers, is a pillar in Mr. Iger\u2019s new strategy to sell Disney\u2019s shows and films directly to consumers.Comcast, however, is keen on keeping its Hulu investment and would be willing to continue selling streaming rights for its NBC series to the service, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. That stance could change, they acknowledged.Analysts have bandied about the possibility that Disney could sell its 39 percent stake in Sky if Comcast were willing to sell its 30 percent ownership of Hulu. British takeover laws, however, would forbid such a tit-for-tat maneuver. A Hulu transaction would have to be a parallel deal and not contingent on the Sky stake.In the battle with Mr. Roberts, Mr. Iger won the big prize: 21st Century Fox. That\u2019s a purchase that, in addition to Hulu and the Sky stake, includes assets like a leading TV studio with more than 30 series in production, the \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cAvatar\u201d franchises and overseas TV providers like Star of India. Absorbing those businesses \u2014 a huge task given disparate corporate cultures \u2014 will allow Disney to become one of the few traditional media companies with enough scale and intellectual property to compete against Netflix and tech giants like Apple and Amazon, both of which are moving aggressively in Hollywood.In fighting to the end for Sky, Disney forced Comcast to pay 27 percent more than it initially offered, essentially returning the favor for driving up the 21st Century Fox price. Comcast expects cost savings of about $600 million after folding Sky into its business.Mr. Iger can still use his world-class collection of content rights \u2014 Marvel superheroes, the Disney Princesses, \u201cStar Wars,\u201d Pixar\u2019s beloved characters \u2014 to roll out Disney\u2019s planned streaming service (known in industry parlance as an \u201cover the top\u201d business) in Europe.\u201cThey can use their rights to go over the top in the long run in Europe,\u201d Mr. Nathanson said.In Sky, Comcast gets one of Europe\u2019s largest media companies, with nearly 23 million customers across five countries, including Britain, Germany and Italy. For British viewers used to living in a media universe long dominated by the Murdoch family, the potential Comcast takeover signals a notable shift in ownership.Indeed, the most stinging loss may belong to the Murdoch family, which has been fighting for control of Sky for the better part of a decade. Mr. Murdoch, 87, co-founded the satellite TV company in 1989 to compete with the British Broadcasting Corporation. Sky, which has 31,000 employees and generated about $17 billion in revenue last year, ranks as one of the most popular TV brands in Europe. It creates its own original shows, runs an influential news channel and has exclusive partnerships in Europe with HBO, Showtime and Warner Bros.Mr. Roberts and his advisers began looking at Sky as an acquisition as early as July 2017, long before engaging in the bidding war against Disney for 21st Century Fox assets. Fox\u2019s 39 percent stake in Sky was the primary reason that Mr. Roberts went after the company, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.For Comcast, pursuing Fox was always about building its international businesses. Mr. Roberts cared much less about other assets that the Murdoch family was selling, including the FX and National Geographic cable networks. Cable companies like Comcast, which primarily operates in the United States, have grappled with a decline in pay-TV subscribers who have flocked to streaming services like Netflix. Mr. Roberts, who fashions himself as his company\u2019s principal dealmaker, identified Sky as one way to keep Comcast growing.He was particularly taken with Sky\u2019s technology. The British broadcaster sells a set-top box that streams its programming over a broadband connection and includes apps like Netflix or Spotify. Sky built the technology to become its key engine for delivering programming, a setup similar to Comcast\u2019s Xfinity program.Sky also owns valuable sports rights, including a large chunk of the English Premier League. That was seen as a nice fit with Comcast since its NBCUniversal division owns the American rights to those matches. In addition to sports, the deal gives Comcast some Disney and Fox content. Sky owns streaming rights to films from both studios for the European markets in which it operates for the next two to three years.At least 10 investment banks advised the various parties. Five law firms were involved, as were consultants from four outside public relations companies.Mr. Roberts and a band of Comcast executives, including its chief financial officer, Michael J. Cavanagh, set up a war room in a London hotel before the weekend to wage their battle for Sky. To win, Comcast needed to submit a clearly superior bid \u2014 high enough to persuade Sky shareholders to tender their stock in the weeks ahead.When it was over, Mr. Roberts had his victory.Disney had no comment.And 21st Century Fox said in a statement that it was \u201cconsidering its options\u201d regarding its 39 percent stake in Sky and \u201cwill make a further announcement in due course.\u201dMr. Roberts allowed himself a few moments to celebrate.\u201cThis is a great day for Comcast,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cThis acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally. We couldn\u2019t be more excited.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just Don\u2019t Call It Privacy", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisAmazon, Google and Twitter executives are heading to Congress. Should legislators give consumers control over the data companies have on them?Ms. Singer is a technology reporter at The New York Times.There\u2019s just one flaw with this setup.In a surveillance economy where companies track, analyze and capitalize on our clicks, the issue at hand isn\u2019t privacy. The problem is unfettered data exploitation and its potential deleterious consequences \u2014 among them, unequal consumer treatment, financial fraud, identity theft, manipulative marketing and discrimination.In other words, asking companies whose business models revolve around exploiting data-based consumer-influence techniques to explain their privacy policies seems about as useful as asking sharks to hold forth on veganism.The Senate Commerce hearing, however, doesn\u2019t seem designed to investigate commercial surveillance and influence practices that might merit government oversight.For one thing, only industry executives are currently set to testify. And most of them are lawyers and policy experts, not engineers versed in the mechanics of data-mining algorithms.That may be because Congress is under industry pressure.Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the Senate Commerce Committee, said the group planned future hearings that would include other voices, such as consumer groups. But \u201cfor the first hearing,\u201d Mr. Hill said, \u201cthe committee is bringing in companies most consumers recognize to make the discussion about privacy more relatable.\u201dMany consumers know that digital services and ad tech companies track and analyze their activities. And they accept, or are at least resigned to, data-mining in exchange for conveniences like customized newsfeeds and ads.And that leads to a larger question: Do we want a future in which companies can freely parse the photos we posted last year, or the location data from the fitness apps we used last week, to infer whether we are stressed or depressed or financially strapped or emotionally vulnerable \u2014 and take advantage of that?(Amazon said it does not use Alexa data for product recommendations or marketing.)It\u2019s tough to answer those questions right now when there are often gulfs between the innocuous ways companies explain their data practices to consumers and the details they divulge about their targeting techniques to advertisers.Here\u2019s what it means in practice: AT&T can find out which subscribers have indigestion \u2014 or at least which ones bought over-the-counter drugs to treat it.Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for AT&T, said the company\u2019s privacy policy was \u201ctransparent and precise, and describes in plain language how we use information and the choices we give customers.\u201dBut consumer advocates hope senators will press AT&T, Amazon and other companies this week to provide more details on their consumer-profiling practices. \u201cWe want an inside look on the analytics and how they\u2019re categorizing, ranking, rating and scoring us,\u201d Professor Citron said.Given the increased public scrutiny, some companies are tweaking their tactics.AT&T recently said it would stop sharing users\u2019 location details with data brokers. Facebook said it had stopped allowing advertisers to use sensitive categories, like race or religion, to exclude people from seeing ads. Google created a feature for users to download masses of their data, including a list of all the sites Google has tracked them on.Government officials in Europe are not waiting for companies to police themselves. In May, the European Union introduced a tough new data protection law that curbs some data-mining. It requires companies to obtain explicit permission from European users before collecting personal details on sensitive subjects like their religion, health or sex life. It gives European users the right to see all of the information companies hold about them \u2014 including any algorithmic scores or inferences. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "JD.com Chairman Richard Liu Arrested in U.S. in Sexual Misconduct Case", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The billionaire founder of JD.com, one of China\u2019s largest and most successful online retailers, was arrested Friday in Minnesota for alleged sexual misconduct before being released a day later, police records show.Police officials in Minneapolis said they were treating the case as an active investigation.The matter is an another unwelcome bit of publicity for a company that symbolizes the business potential of China\u2019s rising middle class. The accusation could also be a test of JD.com\u2019s stability, as well as the ability of a Chinese technology company to rebound from the problems of its leaders. China\u2019s most powerful technology companies are still tightly controlled by their founders, so the fortunes of businesses worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars are closely intertwined with the fates of a small number of executives.JD.com, whose shares trade in the United States, has prospered by catering to the increasing sophistication of Chinese shoppers. Big global brands such as Nike, Prada and Levi\u2019s use JD.com\u2019s sales platform to reach the country\u2019s burgeoning middle class, and the company is closely watched as an indicator of consumer confidence.A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department said Mr. Liu was released \u201cpending formal complaint.\u201d Spokesman John Elder said the police could have held Mr. Liu in custody through Tuesday, but did not feel that was necessary while they conducted their investigation.The police will, after the investigation, recommend to prosecutors whether Mr. Liu should be charged with a misdemeanor or felony or face no charges, at which point the case would be closed.The company said that Mr. Liu\u2019s trip would continue as planned, but a spokeswoman declined to comment further. When asked when Mr. Liu would return to China, the spokeswoman said she did not have that information. Mr. Liu did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Liu has not been charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing in that case. But he tried to get an Australian court to prevent the release of his name in connection with the case by citing potential damage to his marriage and business, court documents show. In July, a judge in Australia rejected his request for a suppression order.JD.com is a heavyweight in China\u2019s technology scene, and Mr. Liu, its chairman and chief executive since its 2004 founding, is one of its leading lights. Legal troubles for Mr. Liu could darken perceptions overall of JD.com, whose shares trade on the Nasdaq stock market in New York and have a market value of around $50 billion.The company competes with Alibaba, the country\u2019s largest e-commerce provider, for the attention of China\u2019s increasingly affluent middle class, and says it has more than 300 million customers. It specializes in electronics such as smartphones and appliances.Alibaba and JD.com are both trying to lure high-end global brands to open virtual stores on their sales platforms. Alibaba says it has more than 570 million customers across its Chinese marketplaces.Whereas Alibaba operates platforms on which outside merchants sell their wares to consumers, JD.com\u2019s business model is more like Amazon\u2019s. It typically buys products from manufacturers and stores them in its own warehouses. JD.com has also invested in its own logistics network, which the company says helps provide quicker, more reliable delivery than Alibaba can offer. The company\u2019s major shareholders include Google and the Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent.For many companies with shops on the platform, JD.com offers a way into an exciting market. China\u2019s dramatic economic rise has meant that hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers are no longer content with shoddily made goods, and are ready to pay more for quality.But as the economy has shown signs of a slowdown in recent months, JD.com has suffered too. Last month it reported disappointing financial results, citing increasing competition.China\u2019s technology scene is young \u2014 many of its most influential companies were founded only in the past two decades \u2014 and company founders like Mr. Liu tend to retain outsize influence on their businesses, even as they grow large and list on public stock exchanges. Founders control voting rights and have ultimate say in matters large and small. Their personalities seep into the corporate culture.Mr. Liu was born in a poor part of Jiangsu Province in eastern China in the 1970s. When he earned a place at the prestigious Renmin University in Beijing, other people in the village scraped together cash and boiled eggs to sustain him in the capital.In the past, Mr. Liu has spent one day a year wearing JD.com\u2019s red uniform, riding an electric bike and making home deliveries. He likes to say that as the son of a poor family, he wants to treat his employees with fairness and respect.Raymond Zhong reported from Beijing, and Li Yuan from Hong Kong.

Cambridge breeds them as if they were really smart rabbits.

Presented with a bin full of stuff, they can grab and pick up individual objects, even if they haven\u2019t seen them before. This is just what a company like Amazon need inside its massive distribution centers.But companies like RightHand are still perfecting the art of picking. And the next task \u2014 deciding where each object should go \u2014 is even harder. Right now, RightHand is leaning on systems that scan the bar code attached to each item.

{"Headline": "Loss of Indigenous Works in Brazil Museum Fire Felt \u2018Like a New Genocide\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "The destruction of indigenous artifacts and documents was a personal blow for the descendants of Brazil\u2019s oldest inhabitants, who had long fought to preserve their heritage.Supported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 A handful of indigenous activists and researchers were celebrating a birthday huddled around a small pit fire when they noticed the flames devouring a building a few dozen yards away.\u201cIt\u2019s the museum that\u2019s on fire!\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Urutau Guajajara, a member of the Teneteh\u00e1ra-Guajajara tribe who had been researching his people\u2019s heritage in the archives of Brazil\u2019s National Museum for more than a decade. \u201cWe can still manage to put it out with buckets.\u201d\u201cThis is like a new genocide, as though they had slaughtered all these indigenous communities again,\u201d Mr. Guajajara said. \u201cBecause that was where our memory resided.\u201dTo many Brazilians like Mr. Guajajara, it was a tragedy foretold.In recent years, Brazil has gone to great lengths to present itself as a forward-looking country. As it prepared to host the 2014 men\u2019s soccer World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics, it invested billions in state of the art stadiums, sports equipment and imposing public projects that showed it as a modern and capable nation, on par with global powers.Mr. Calatrava\u2019s gleaming white creation, which appears to hover like a spaceship over the bay in Rio de Janeiro, broke ground in 2015 and cost $59 million, with a yearly budget of $4 million.Chronic underfunding left its halls with jury-rigged wiring, infiltrated ceilings and bat droppings along walls and shelves. A termite attack forced the closing of a dinosaur exhibit in late 2017. At one point there was not enough money to pay the cleaning crew \u2014 much less to install a fire suppression system.Antonio Carlos de Souza Lima, a historian and anthropologist at the museum, said Brazil\u2019s leaders had long regarded culture as a commodity and invested mainly in areas that could become profitable.\u201cThey think of culture as a business,\u201d Mr. de Souza said. \u201cNot the soul of a nation.\u201dWhen the museum celebrated its 200th anniversary in June, Alexander Kellner, its director, flew to Bras\u00edlia to invite the president and ministers to attend the celebration. None of them showed up.The National Museum\u2019s collection of indigenous artifacts included 40,000 items pertaining to more than 100 ethnic groups. Among them were delicate pieces gathered during expeditions into remote stretches of the Amazon in the 19th and 20th centuries.A mask made by Tikuna tribesmen, which had been a gift to the Brazilian emperor Dom Pedro I, was probably the oldest item in the collection, according to researchers, who believe it was collected by Bavarian scientists in 1821.There was also an ornate feather headpiece made by members of the Munduruku tribe, which was first exhibited in 1882.Tonico Benites, an anthropologist and member of the Guarani-Kaiow\u00e1 tribe who did his doctoral research at the museum, said the fire had consumed a trove of material that he had hoped indigenous elders would one day help researchers understand.\u201cWe certainly lost many pieces that we never managed to identify,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were pieces there from indigenous groups that are believed to be extinct.\u201dAmong them was a Guarani-Kaiow\u00e1 instrument used to pierce the lips of teenage boys, a ritual that represented the end of youth. Mr. Benites said indigenous elders were moved when they saw the tool, which is no longer in use.\u201cThey were happy to find it again, because they hadn\u2019t seen it in 50 years,\u201d Mr. Benites said.But perhaps the most consequential loss for researchers of indigenous affairs was the collection of the German ethnologist Curt Nimuendaj\u00fa. Born Curt Unckel in the German town of Jena in 1883, Mr. Nimuendaj\u00fa was adopted by members of a Guarani tribe in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo who gave him the new name, which means \u201cone who created his own place.\u201dHe died among the Tikuna people in 1945, leaving behind a trove of notes, letters, expedition journals and a map he created one year before his death detailing the location and languages of the groups he had come across.\u201cEach year of his life he did a new expedition,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Pacheco, who curated the ethnological exhibition for the last 20 years. \u201cHe was the premier Brazilian ethnographer.\u201dThe original map was copied and an adapted version was published by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics.But \u201cthere was another map, a unique one, where he made corrections,\u201d said T\u00e2nia Clemente, a linguist at the National Museum. \u201cThat is lost.\u201dThe indigenous collection included audio recordings of indigenous leaders who died several years ago, and writings about languages that have long become extinct, including Mura and Tupiniquim.Such documents provided an essential lifeline to the past for Brazilians who have sought to discover or better understand their indigenous roots. In recent decades, many have been discouraged, if not outright banned, from doing so.Mr. Guajajara, who was among the first researchers to reach the museum as it burned, remembers being hit with a candlestick in school for speaking Ze\u2019egt\u00e9, the language of his people.\u201cOut of spite I\u2019m going to learn about it, and I\u2019m going to write it,\u201d he remembered thinking. He got a master\u2019s degree at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, which ran the museum, in 2013, and wrote his thesis on the Ze\u2019egt\u00e9 language.The archaeologist Denise Gomes lost indigenous ceramic pieces from the 12th and 16th centuries that she spent eight years excavating in Santar\u00e9m, a city in the Amazon. She did pioneering research locating and dating fragments, some of which were stored in her office.Doing that kind of work fulfilled a longtime dream. Now she is among scores of scholars waiting for police officials to allow them to enter their ravaged work space to sift through debris, now that their office has essentially become an archaeological site.\u201cWe have hope we will find everything,\u201d she said, even as she acknowledged that it would be difficult, as her office was destroyed.The National Museum had struggled financially in recent decades and experienced calamities in the past, including a flood that drenched precious Egyptian mummies in 1995.The 1990s were a particularly trying era for the institution, which charged visitors a nominal entrance fee.\u201cWe didn\u2019t even have money for toilet paper,\u201d said Mr. de Souza, the anthropologist, who has worked at the museum for 38 years.There were a handful of missed opportunities that could have enabled museum personnel to take better care of the building and its contents.University officials and the World Bank discussed the possibility of securing a loan in the 1990s, but the talks fizzled. In 2014, the federal government approved an $8.6 million package to modernize the museum. But the money ultimately was not disbursed.In recent years, the museum turned to Brazil\u2019s National Development Bank for help. After a protracted negotiation, the bank this year committed to funding a series of improvements worth $5 million, which would have included a fire suppression system.The overhauls were due to start late this year.After the fire, Daniela Alarcon, an anthropologist at the National Museum who studies the Tupinamb\u00e1 people from the northeastern state of Bahia, collected statements about its loss from leaders from the tribe.\u201cThat place was like a memory, a computer hard drive, that at any moment, any ethnic group, from any people, could access to get information, to know where they were, to not feel lost,\u201d one of those leaders, Glic\u00e9ria Jesus Silva, told Ms. Alarcon.To her, the building felt like a homecoming.\u201cYou came from here, this is your origin,\u201d she said, describing what the museum meant to her. \u201cWhat was there won\u2019t ever come back, no one can replace it.\u201dA previous version of this article misidentified Dom Pedro I. He was Dom Pedro I, emperor of Brazil, not the Portuguese emperor Dom Pedro I.A previous version of this article misstated the cost of the Museum of Tomorrow.

{"Headline": "On Fire Island Ferries, Aging Mariners Seek Successors", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBAY SHORE, N.Y. \u2014 With a smooth spin of the heavy iron steering wheel, Capt. Ernie Villing backed the Fire Island Belle out of its ferry slip and set course for a thin, gauzy strip on the hazy horizon across the Great South Bay.Mr. Villing, a lifelong ferryman who is 70, has spent the past 55 years helping people reach that sandy Shangri-La known as Fire Island, on summer weekends.From his wheelhouse, he glanced back at passengers lounging on powder blue benches on the Belle\u2019s upper deck. The sun-starved hordes storm these ferry docks all summer, armed with cases of wine, bodyboards and little yappy dogs.The captains run relentlessly repetitive routes to Fire Island until Labor Day, when the summer-long frenzy finally relents, the seasonal workers leave and the veterans focus on off-water maintenance of the 26-vessel fleet.These seasoned hands each have more than four decades of ferry experience, having broken in as teenage deckhands when regulations were scarce and the ferries were wooden vessels usually converted from military crafts or rumrunning boats. Many of the senior captains are approaching retirement, taking with them more than two centuries of experience. The aging mariners worry there will be no replacements when they leave.\u201cWe\u2019re finding very few millennials interested in doing this kind of work,\u201d said Luke Kaufman, the ferry company\u2019s senior operations manager. Mr. Kaufman grew up tinkering with bicycles and cars and gaining a basic grasp of mechanical trades that he said has largely been replaced by an obsession with technology in teenagers and young adults today.\u201cThe iPhone is the new torque wrench,\u201d said Mr. Kaufman. \u201cWe\u2019re trying our darnedest to find replacements, but they\u2019re just not there.\u201dIt is not a job that is learned overnight.Many of the older captains were schooled in all phases of the trade by hands-on apprenticeships under salty old-timers dating back to the company\u2019s beginnings in the late 1940s, Mr. Kaufman said.This included vital skills like handling heavy weather, navigating without GPS technology and safely executing the 30-minute crossing of a bay with hidden shallows and sandbars.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of water in the Great South Bay,\u201d Mr. Kaufman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just spread out real thin.\u201dLearning to make repairs on weathered ferries was also part of the on-the-job training.\u201cThey were hodgepodged together and we often had to fix them while we were underway,\u201d recalled Mr. Kaufman, 59.In the off-season, the captains also learned staple boatyard skills such as hauling the hulking ferries out of the water and swapping out brass propellers the size of truck tires. They learned welding, hull repair, carpentry, bottom-painting, electrical work, plumbing and engine mechanics, which is done in a shop that bears a large sign that reads \u201cQUITCHERBELLYAKIN!\u201dThe shortage of workers is a problem afflicting the wider industry, as ferry operators nationwide search for younger people to fill jobs vacated by retiring captains and other ferry hands, said John Groundwater, executive director of the Passenger Vessel Association, which has begun working with maritime academies to increase interest in captain jobs.This limits the salaries available to attract full-time captains. The company has been managing to find qualified captains to work only summers for part-time pay, Mr. Mooney said, and it relies on teenagers who take deckhand jobs, handling the rope lines and ticket lines.Some teenage deck hands go on to earn captain\u2019s licenses and enjoy working summers at the helm, but many decide they cannot support themselves on the salaries and wind up searching for more lucrative Civil Service jobs, Mr. Kaufman said. He stressed the need for seasoned captains who are able to navigate the shallow water as easily as they dispatch hassles over baggage from fussy vacationers and disturbances caused by hard-partying day-trippers who hit the bars in Ocean Beach and become unruly during late-night return trips.Security guards now help keep order on board on weekends, but the captain is ultimately responsible for passenger safety, said Dave Anderson, 56, the ferry company\u2019s general manager.\u201cIt\u2019s a whole other job after dark,\u201d Mr. Anderson said. \u201cYou have fights, people jumping off the boat. It\u2019s a drinking crowd, and when someone dares his friend to jump off the boat, it\u2019s the captain\u2019s job to go and rescue that guy.\u201dCapt. Brianna Riley, 26, started at 18 as a deckhand with the company and obtained her captain\u2019s license, which involves accumulating time as a deckhand, taking maritime classes and passing a certification test.Plenty of young deckhands now have the opportunity to attend college, she said, \u201cand then they have student loans, and the full-time captain\u2019s job just don\u2019t pay well enough.\u201dMs. Riley has a college degree in marketing and hopes to find an office job in that field.\u201cRealistically, I wouldn\u2019t be able to support myself as a full-time captain,\u201d she said, bringing a nod of agreement from Dylan Molnar, 18, a fellow deckhand on the Fire Island Belle.Mr. Molnar said he hoped to work summers as a captain but planned on attending college and pursuing a more lucrative career.Many of the ferry company workers followed a family path.Don Guinta, 60, the company\u2019s freight manager, brought his daughter Kristen Chance, 27, into the business. She\u2019s eight months pregnant, but recently helped him log in a mountain of packages being sent over to Fire Island, a task he called \u201corganized chaos.\u201dFavorite parcels included food sent from Dean & Deluca, Zabar\u2019s, Citarella and other Manhattan markets, he said, standing next to a pile of Amazon deliveries, a surfboard and a tall bass fiddle.The traditional Sunday-morning freight boat is known as the \u201cbagel boat,\u201d for its principal cargo.Another tradition is spotting celebrities who use the ferries, often disguised by hats and sunglasses. The list of passengers with boldfaced names includes the actors Tina Fey, John C. Reilly and Katie Holmes.\u201cEvery personality in the world comes through these boats,\u201d said Captain Villing, as he steered the 85-foot Belle up the West Channel toward Fair Harbor.He got a welcoming hug from Fred Fahrbach, 77, who has a summer home nearby and who said of Captain Villing: \u201cI don\u2019t think the ferry would run without him.\u201d Then Captain Villing headed for the mainland, with Fire Island astern.\u201cIt\u2019s been a good living,\u201d he said, adding that he hoped to remain working as a summertime captain. \u201cAs long as they got a space for me, I\u2019ll be here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can the People Who Almost Brought Down the News Business Save It?", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "OpinionMarc Benioff has bought Time, becoming the latest technology mogul to invest in a media property. Supported byMs. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer.\u201cThis is a start-up,\u201d Marc Benioff told me loudly over FaceTime, leaning in and out of the frame on a bumpy ride to the airport. \u201cThey have been opportunity constrained,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we are here to unshackle them.\u201dWas the billionaire founder and chief executive of Salesforce, the digital enterprise hotshot of San Francisco, talking about a new bitcoin company he was interested in investing in? Or perhaps a big opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a cool artificial intelligence start-up?No. Mr. Benioff was enthusiastically touting one of the oldest and most storied publications in the United States, which he and his wife, Lynne, had just forked over $190 million in cash to buy.Its owner, Time Warner, tried. Remember Pathfinder, its ill-conceived online portal? What about the AOL-Time Warner merger, designed to be the spectacular marriage of analog and digital but fated to be one of the worst ever?After endless corporate restructurings, management upheavals and sales, last year Time Inc. ended up with Meredith Corporation in a $2.8 billion all-cash deal. Then Meredith turned around and started peddling off the parts it did not want. That included Time, as well as Sports Illustrated and Fortune.Mr. Benioff said he had been looking to extend the active personal investing \u2014 sometimes he calls it philanthropy \u2014 his family was doing already, in areas like climate change, public schools and health care for children. He said he looked at all the assets, such as Fortune, but was soon attracted to Time\u2019s broader audience and wider circulation, as well as its pedigree of excellence. He claims that it is profitable, too, which was also an attraction.\u201cTime is a name that was most trusted for a rapidly changing society,\u201d he said, one that still has \u201cthe ability to reach readers on a multidimensional level.\u201dTicking off stats on the magazine\u2019s readership, video views, event successes and digital impressions, Mr. Benioff sounded like a man on a mission to make us all understand that this brand of the past is surely the brand of the future.And the jovial billionaire, who was wearing one of his endless supply of Hawaiian shirts, said he would be putting his copious money \u2014 $6.6 billion \u2014 where his voluble mouth is. He plans to give Time \u201cas much investment as it needs\u201d to succeed.This media-buying binge can be explained in three simple words: Because they can. And maybe four more: Because media is cheap.But there is more here, too, since each of these billionaires could afford to buy just about anything at all. Why a magazine and not a sports team, when media is a messier and less certain bet? Perhaps it\u2019s because it offers a heady mix of altruism, power and ego.But Mr. Benioff cautioned against the impulse to \u201clump all of us together,\u201d noting that \u201ceach of us has different aims.\u201dMr. Benioff describes his motivations like this: \u201cI want Time to continue to be able to tell important stories.\u201d He insisted he would not call the shots. \u201cHonestly. I hope to not be operationally involved at all, because I have a high level of trust in the management there,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cI can communicate my vision, but I don\u2019t expect to have much involvement.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much the map set by Mr. Bezos, who has stuck to his promise to help The Washington Post financially and with tech and business advice since he acquired it in 2013 for $250 million. According to those there, he has been nearly silent even as President Trump has attacked him, Amazon and the newspaper regularly \u2014 and often in one all-encompassing tweet.Mr. Trump often accuses Mr. Bezos of having bought the media company for influence and lobbying purposes, but so far it looks as if he just likes to own a paper that is now firing on all cylinders under his tenure.It\u2019s still too early to judge the stewardship of Ms. Jobs or Mr. Soon-Shiong, but both have indicated that they are just there to help and strengthen the Fourth Estate.And while this is a laudable thing, journalists can\u2019t help feeling slightly queasy for having to rely on the largess of a people whose wealth is a direct result of the same digital age that has chastened the once powerful media business.It\u2019s the ultimate irony: Those who almost killed us are making us stronger.And it brings up another question: Can these media properties still serve as a check on their powerful tech owners? I asked Mr. Benioff this. After all, his industry has come under some much deserved scrutiny of late. Salesforce itself had gotten into some trouble over its contract with Customs and Border Protection to provide recruiting software. Despite protests by employees, Mr. Benioff declined to end the relationship, arguing that the products Salesforce provided were not directly related to the family separations at the Mexico border. Salesforce then pledged $1 million to help reunite families and matched employee donations to the cause.\u201cWe welcome all these kinds of discussions wherever they occur and should not be afraid of them as an industry,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. \u201cWe have to be open to talking about whose values, whose ethics and whose standards should prevail.\u201dThat sounds a lot like how a capital-M Media Mogul should sound, I told him, which caused him to cackle.\u201cWell, maybe you can teach me how to be a better one?\u201d Mr. Benioff joked.No, I cannot. But I can teach him one famous aphorism about what the true job of the news media is: To comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.Don\u2019t get too comfortable, Marc Benioff. A previous version of this article misidentified a federal agency that Salesforce has a contract with. It is Customs and Border Protection, not Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Aren\u2019t We Eating More Insects?", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey\u2019re high in protein, low in cost, eco-friendly and tasty. And only in the West have we resisted them.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations estimates that two billion people, more than a quarter of the world\u2019s population, eat bugs as part of their standard diet. In Kenya, termites are drummed out of their mounds \u2014 the sound evokes rain, to trick them into emerging \u2014 and eaten live and juicy or dry-roasted. Peruvian Amazon weevil grubs, which live inside rotted aguaje palms, are charred over an open flame; lush from feeding on palm tissue and oil, they quickly caramelize. Shaken from mango trees in the Isan region of northeastern Thailand, red weaver ant larvae bear a distant memory of fruit, and pop in the mouth like tiny water balloons.Related: How (and Why) to Cook With Bugs, According to Three ChefsSo Europeans, and by extension European settlers in North America, never had a bug-eating tradition. Indeed, we largely consider insects dirty and drawn to decay, signifiers and carriers of disease; we call them pests, a word whose Latin root means plague. Although the Christian Bible condones the consumption of certain bugs \u2014 John the Baptist survived on locusts in the desert \u2014 Leviticus 11:8 is clear: \u201cEvery swarming thing that swarms on the ground is detestable; it shall not be eaten.\u201dBut secrecy isn\u2019t the way to persuade a wary public: The anticipated billion-dollar market worldwide isn\u2019t reliant on camouflaged products. Rather, gains are predicated on increasing demand for insects qua insects, in their natural physical state. The price of giant water bugs, for example, has risen in Thailand \u2014 where the pheromone secreted by males is considered an aphrodisiac \u2014 as the species has declined due to the use of agricultural pesticides. And other cultures around the world have for millenniums consumed insects at every stage of life, from egg to larva to pupa to adult, sometimes as rudimentary protein but more often as seasoning or nuance. They\u2019ve been prized for the very qualities that make some people shudder: their crunch, chewiness and final deliquescence on the tongue.Can bugs undergo a similar makeover? Some 2,100 insect species worldwide have been identified as edible, from leafhoppers and water boatmen to stink bugs and agave worms; the most popular globally are beetles, followed by caterpillars. Their nutritional benefits, while varied across species, are substantial: high in energy yield, rich in essential amino acids and comparable and sometimes superior, per ounce, to beef, chicken and pork in amounts of protein, omega-3 fats, iron, magnesium, calcium and zinc. Bugs also don\u2019t require much nurturing by parents or space to develop, and they generate far fewer greenhouse gases than conventional livestock: one-tenth the methane and one-three-hundredth of nitrous oxide. Almost all of an insect can be consumed, as opposed to less than half of a cow (nose-to-tail eating notwithstanding). And they reproduce and grow from larvae to adult with startling swiftness \u2014 a horror story if we think of them as enemies, but a blessing if we recognize that they could keep us alive when the world\u2019s population hits 9.7 billion in 2050 and other sources of protein run out.While robots may eventually take over the cultivation of bugs, a crop like palm weevil larvae doesn\u2019t require significant overhead or sophisticated equipment, making it ideal for small-scale family enterprise and offering a path out of subsistence poverty. Aspire has also trained hundreds of local farmers in Ghana to rear palm weevil larvae as a way of earning stable, yearlong incomes. In the past two decades, villagers in impoverished northeastern Thailand have started housing crickets in concrete pens in their backyards. As demand for the insects has risen, so have profits: One farmer reportedly went from selling 10 kilograms to more than two tons a day. Now around 20,000 such farms have been established, collectively earning more than $3 million a year.ENDING HUNGER AND POVERTY, protecting the environment: These are sound arguments, even if they smack a little of \u201ceat your vegetables.\u201d But it seems archaic to be presented with cricket flour and mealworm powder \u2014 insects as abstractions \u2014 in an era when chefs have been minding the seasons and favoring the honest ugliness of gnarled vegetables over the Plasticine perfection of factory farms. We\u2019ve shown a willingness to embrace suspect foods in the name of reducing waste, taking delight in animal parts once discarded, like pig\u2019s feet, sweetbreads and other organs. As insects enter our larders, shouldn\u2019t we accept them as they are?It\u2019s useful to remember that our ancestors didn\u2019t eat bugs simply out of proximity or necessity or perceived impending apocalypse. They also did it out of desire: for the crackle of the exoskeleton and the gooeyness within, followed, perhaps, by a Thai silkworm\u2019s underlying lilac must; or the cosseted funk of dried shrimp, evoked by a Ugandan katydid; or the clean, clarifying aroma of bruised lemongrass, as with an Amazonian sa\u00fava ant. They ate insects because insects are delicious.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Maya Rudolph Became the Master of Impressions", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "FeatureThe actress and comedian can move up and down the scales of race, age and gender with hilarious ease \u2014 a talent that grew from finding her place in a world where no one looked like her.Supported bySeparate from the irrefutable fact that God looks like Maya Rudolph is the equally remarkable revelation that Maya Rudolph looks like God \u2014 that is, she looks at you the same way, you must imagine, that God takes in his creation: happy to see it, while somehow existentially disappointed in it, but forgiving of it and still maintaining affection for it, even though it has absolutely let him down in some indefinable way only he can understand. Her wide eyes, which lend themselves so easily to bald astonishment or mania in her comedy, turn down one fraction of one degree at the outer corners when at rest, lending a suggestion of ruefulness to her neutral gaze. The effect is offset by Rudolph\u2019s cautious, closemouthed smile, which rests on her face as easily as powder on a puff. It\u2019s invigorating to find yourself the subject of a look so wistful, even if the expression is inadvertent. It makes you want to be the better version of yourself Maya Rudolph apparently knows you can be.Traditionally, one of the slipperiest things about talking to God is trying to tell someone else about it after the fact. It\u2019s the same with Maya Rudolph. Her comedy is so rooted in elasticized facial expressions and meticulously off-kilter impressions that attempts to recreate conversations with her inevitably fall flat. One of the funniest things Rudolph said at our first meeting, as we sat in a San Fernando Valley French bistro tucking into hot, pricey fries so good they could have been from McDonald\u2019s, was: \u201cO.K., well.\u201dShe was telling the story of the time she was bitten by a black-widow spider while getting a massage on a girls\u2019 vacation that many comedy fans might commit real-life murder to attend, with her \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d friends Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Rachel Dratch and Ana Gasteyer and the writers Paula Pell and Emily Spivey. Rudolph was doing an impression of Gasteyer the moment Rudolph explained to her that she was possibly about to die.Her Gasteyer was a 120 percent concentration: angular head movements; precise intentional blinks; a modulated operatic voice \u2014 classic Gasteyer, but swirled with the essential oils of her performance as a tightly wound 1990s Martha Stewart. Rudolph\u2019s account of the fiasco was bursting with rollicking impressions \u2014 Poehler taking charge with peppy fortitude; Dratch trying to discreetly escape to a shower \u2014 but to print the transcript would be a disservice to Rudolph, because the transcript is simply not funny. The element that brings tears of laughter to your eyes is not the words themselves, but the curious, thrilling sensation of witnessing other people\u2019s faces and voices emerge from Rudolph\u2019s own.It\u2019s tough to put a finger on exactly when Maya Rudolph became someone Americans love to love. They liked her on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d when she demonstrated a particular knack for impersonating musical divas across time and race. They liked her, too, in the 2011 film \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d when she turned the part of the ostensible straight-woman \u2014 the bridal tether against which the titular maids jostle like Mylar balloons in the wind \u2014 into a character at once heartfelt and grotesque. At some point, though, viewers began to regard Rudolph with an enthusiasm normally reserved for a three-day weekend. Like those holidays, she comes around fairly regularly: stealing scenes in movies, turning up for delightful guest arcs in prime time. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like everybody has a song,\u201d Poehler told me, \u201cand I think Maya\u2019s song is like a really good popular song that will stand the test of time.\u201dNearly 20 years in, Rudolph\u2019s career appears to be entering a platinum era. Earlier this summer, she wrapped filming on a 2019 Netflix movie directed by Poehler, inspired by their real-life vacations: \u201cWine Country.\u201d This year, she\u2019s up for an Emmy for playing, well, God; Rudolph captivated viewers in a two-episode stint on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d as an all-powerful cosmic decider. Her \u201cJudge\u201d was goofy, charming and sinisterly unreadable \u2014 perhaps her strongest-ever flexing of her ability to embody multiple personalities concurrently. This month, she\u2019ll star in \u201cForever,\u201d a new streaming series for Amazon. Less a traditional comedy than a surreal minimalist comedy, it offers an opportunity for Rudolph to display a quality rarely seen in two-minute comedy sketches about space travel: pathos.Why has the nation now decided to pine for Maya Rudolph? Perhaps it\u2019s not so much a sudden appreciation for the chameleonic ability to slide up and down the spectrum of races, ages and personae that she\u2019s always possessed, but that a more fundamental aspect of her character is just now coming into view: the groundedness behind the fun-house reflections. In a world that seems increasingly, exhaustingly unpredictable \u2014 unbound by rules of any sort \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it be nice to crawl into a bottle of wine with Maya Rudolph, wearing matching silk jumpsuits, and listen to her canny assessments of what\u2019s really going on?Two years after Rudolph\u2019s birth, her father, working alongside Stevie Wonder, produced Riperton\u2019s album \u201cPerfect Angel,\u201d featuring the song that would be Riperton\u2019s biggest hit: \u201cLovin\u2019 You,\u201d a spare, dreamy number that showcased Riperton\u2019s mastery of the so-called whistle register \u2014 precariously high notes at the upper upper reaches of what can be produced in the human vocal tract. The song\u2019s origins as a lullaby for Rudolph are preserved in vinyl grooves; the album cut ends with Riperton cooing, \u201cMaya.\u201d \u201cLovin\u2019 You\u201d hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1975, generating intense, sometimes rattling public interest in Riperton.\u201cWhen I was a kid, and people would come up to me or stare at me because of my mom, I didn\u2019t like it. I really didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Rudolph told me. \u201cI used to think, Oh, they\u2019re staring at my hair, because it\u2019s so big and ugly,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I didn\u2019t realize people were just staring at my mother, like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s her daughter!\u2019 I didn\u2019t know; I was a kid. And kids always personalize things.\u201dIn the early \u201970s, when Rudolph\u2019s parents wed, there were about 65,000 black-and-white married couples in the United States. Rudolph and her older brother, Marc, are members of what is sometimes called the Loving generation \u2014 a miniature population boom of mixed-race individuals born in the years immediately following the 1967 Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court decision, which struck down state laws criminalizing interracial marriage. Marc was born a year after the ruling, when their parents were living in Chicago. Rudolph recalls hearing stories about the racism that permeated the family\u2019s lives; when her father entered the apartment building where they lived, she said, he would have to conceal her brother so that the landlady wouldn\u2019t see him entering with a black child. When Riperton became pregnant a second time, the family determined to quit Chicago for a new environment. To choose a nesting spot, they visited friends in various cities across the United States (a tactic employed by Rudolph\u2019s pregnant character in the 2009 film \u201cAway We Go\u201d) before settling in Gainesville, where Rudolph was born.\u201cNo,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI don\u2019t think I did.\u201dAfter her mother signed with Epic Records, the family moved to Los Angeles, where most of the people she knew were, she recalls, \u201ceither black or white-slash-Jewish.\u201d She embraced the closest analogue she could find on television: Lisa Bonet, an actress just a couple of years older, who played the daughter of two black parents, despite having a white mother in real life. \u201cI was obsessed with \u2018The Cosby Show,\u2019 but mainly because of Lisa Bonet,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cThere is no prettier creature in the universe.\u201d Their shared racial background afforded Rudolph an opportunity to brag. \u201cI\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019m mixed, too!\u2019\u2009\u201d She rolled her eyes at the implied physical comparison. \u201c\u2009\u2018Just like Lisa Bonet!\u2019\u2009\u201dI asked Rudolph if she was often asked the question perennially posed to mixed-race kids, in what always feels like a sleazy attempt to catch you in a lie about being multiple things simultaneously: Which side do you identify with? \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. I admitted that, more than black or white, I\u2019ve always felt closest to other mixed people \u2014 regardless of race \u2014 because they\u2019re the ones who grow up being asked questions like that. Rudolph nodded. \u201cMeeting other mixed kids has always affected me. It was like part of a secret society.\u201dHold your heart carefully before you read this next sentence: Rudolph\u2019s father \u2014 in her words, a \u201cpretty adorable Jew\u201d \u2014 did not know how to do his daughter\u2019s hair after his wife\u2019s death. \u201cSo much of my childhood was dealing with my hair and being super embarrassed by it, mainly because I grew up being the only mixed kid,\u201d she said. Rudolph and her brother were raised in an affluent part of the Westwood neighborhood in Los Angeles. The school Rudolph attended was so white that one of her grade-school friends was Gwyneth Paltrow. To the white people outside their family, she and her brother looked black. But their black relatives lived halfway across the country in Chicago; they saw them only on visits. \u201cI never felt like my black cousins,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt loved, but I didn\u2019t feel culturally. ...\u201d She trailed off. \u201cI was the kid that lived in California who didn\u2019t grow up around the family.\u201dHer independent attempts to style her \u201csuper, super, superthick and supercurly\u201d hair were hapless. \u201cI was just completely lost,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom died when I was 7, so when you don\u2019t have a woman \u2014\u201d She cut herself off. \u201cFirst of all, hair products that exist today did not exist when I was a child. The detangling system that I use now on my children is light-years beyond anything that would\u2019ve ever happened to me growing up in Westwood.\u201dRiperton\u2019s sisters would perform labor-intensive black-hair maintenance on their niece during their California sojourns. \u201cMy neighbors used to say, \u2018We could hear you screaming across the street.\u2019 My aunties would come to town from Chicago and get the marcel iron out,\u201d she said.Her hair remained an object of fascination for strangers into adulthood. In college, a student came up to her and remarked: \u201cYour hair is so ethnic. Can I touch it?\u201d (\u201cNo.\u201d) \u201cI actually have an aversion to that word, way more than people say they hate the word \u2018moist.\u2019 I hate the word \u2018ethnic\u2019 in that way. It\u2019s like they\u2019re talking about a print.\u201dFrom a young age, comedy was Rudolph\u2019s defense against other people\u2019s intrusions. \u201cI know that part of owning being funny was an armor, and was, like, to literally not cry,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cIt\u2019s a protection. Just be like: \u2018Oh, yeah! I\u2019m the lady with the crazy hair!\u2019\u2009\u201d Intentional zaniness, she said, is \u201cso much better than the painful alternative. The alternative is I\u2019m an ugly duckling. I\u2019m just a weirdo.\u201dIf people were familiar with her mother, they \u201cwanted to know why I wasn\u2019t as black as my mother, more or less,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t seem as culturally black.\u201d They also knew that her mother was gone. \u201cIt really didn\u2019t help that it was a public experience,\u201d Rudolph said, of growing up in the aftermath of her death. Two months after the event, Rudolph appeared on the cover of Jet magazine alongside her father and brother; an inside spread featured photographs and a detailed description of her motherless seventh-birthday pool party. \u201cIt was weird to grow up that way, thinking, I\u2019m the kid whose mom died, and everybody knows it \u2014 or at least you feel like everybody knows it.\u201dIt was fitting, then, that Rudolph, who before second grade had already been assigned two seemingly permanent identities \u2014 the kid who looked different and the girl without a mother \u2014 would develop a virtuosic talent for becoming other people, transforming herself, in the process, into someone it was impossible to exactly pin down.One of the people Rudolph memorably became was the Italian fashion designer Donatella Versace. On \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d where Rudolph was a cast member from 2000 to 2007, she portrayed Versace, with a satin-flat mantilla of white-blond hair, as hazy and psychotic, frequently possessed by whiplash bursts of anger yet ultimately softhearted. Her Versace was held captive by her own industriousness, forever taking on new projects (a tape of Versace children\u2019s songs sung by herself, a line of Hot Pocket-inspired Versace Pockets) yet also Champagne-drunk and quite sleepy. While not by any stretch a flattering portrait, it hovered just north of cruel. In Rudolph\u2019s hands, Versace was not dumb \u2014 merely too glamorous for the world and occasionally hampered by a thick Italian accent. It was an impression in the truest sense of the word \u2014 not an identical copy but a blend of heightened tics and imagined quirks that felt so true to the idea of a person that the real version paled by comparison.You didn\u2019t even have to exist for Rudolph to inhabit you fully; her character Megan, the anxious, awkward, striving-to-be-noticed teenage host of her school\u2019s morning news program, \u201cWake Up, Wakefield,\u201d was such an accurate depiction of a poor-postured adolescent that it was almost physically painful to watch Megan\u2019s dreams of being cool fail to come true in every one of her sketches.Rudolph joined \u201cS.N.L.\u201d at the tail end of the 1999-2000 season, and it swiftly took over her life. \u201cIt was literally my everything,\u201d she recalled. \u201cMy baby and my husband all at once. I cared about it more than my laundry or my food, which \u2014 neither were being well taken care of. I gave all my energy to that show. Plus you\u2019re creating a new show every week, so it was just really intense \u2014 in a good way. In a way that I liked.\u201dBlack women have been habitually underrepresented in the cast of \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d Rudolph was only the fourth since the show\u2019s 1975 debut. \u201cWhen I did \u2018S.N.L.,\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like I was hired to be the black lady, which can happen a lot,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cWho knows? Maybe I was and no one told me.\u201dRudolph describes \u201cS.N.L.\u201d as a positive experience but concedes that there were moments of disappointment, when the writing was out of her hands. \u201cThere were times I was frustrated, like, \u2018Why can\u2019t I [expletive] just play that role?\u2019 But obviously the person next to me that\u2019s white is going to play that white character.\u201dAs in her childhood, her hair marked her as an outsider. In her limited on-camera experience before \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d she recalled, \u201cevery time I\u2019d work, they\u2019d be like, \u2018I really don\u2019t \u2014 like, can I touch? \u2014 I really don\u2019t know what to do with your hair.\u2019 They would just say the most awful, disgusting things.\u201d When she arrived at Studio 8H, she encountered a new obstacle: \u201cMy hair was natural when I started \u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019 but it was so thick to get under the wigs.\u201dShe began devoting several hours a week to altering its texture, including a standing Friday-night blowout appointment with her friend Jodi Mancuso, who ran the hair department. The blow-dry station \u201cwas on the same hallway as a lot of the dudes\u2019 dressing rooms. And every [expletive] Friday night, we\u2019d hear some [expletive] white guy walking down the hall going, \u2018Is something burning in here? What\u2019s burning?\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cI\u2019m like\u201d \u2014 Rudolph\u2019s lips and voice tensed, and she enunciated every exasperated syllable \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018I\u2019m. Get-ting. My. Hair. Done.\u2019\u2009\u201d\u201cIt was too hard,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd nobody else understands or cares, when they don\u2019t have kids. They\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s cool!\u2019\u2009\u201d she said, turning away with a distracted nod. \u201c\u2009\u2018What are you guys doing tonight?\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re going to see Justin Timberlake because Andy\u2019s doing \u201cDick in a Box\u201d with him! What are you doing?\u2019 And I was like\u201d \u2014 Rudolph affected the faraway stare of a revenant \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018My daughter\u2019s sick. I\u2019m going home.\u2019\u2009\u201dMembers of the public familiar with the careers of Rudolph and Anderson react to their long-term relationship in one of two ways: Either they are surprised to learn that Rudolph and Anderson have been a couple since 2001 or they knew that but are surprised to remember it. Perhaps it\u2019s that a high-minded film auteur would not seem to possess a wacky enough personality to pair with a woman who earned a living parodying Beyonc\u00e9 from Destiny\u2019s Child as \u201cBritanica\u201d from \u201cGemini\u2019s Twin\u201d; perhaps it\u2019s that Maya Rudolph is not Daniel Day-Lewis. Often people\u2019s response to the couple takes the form of jocular fetishization, as when New York Magazine\u2019s The Cut published a short opinion piece titled \u201cPaul Thomas Anderson and Maya Rudolph Are the Greatest Celebrity Couple,\u201d affectionately citing, as a piece of evidence, an unsmiling candid paparazzi photo of them walking side by side. There have been instances, however, when the teasing has overreached and Rudolph has, like her parents, found her interracial relationship the object of prurient interest. She recalled a comedy writer who told her that her and Anderson\u2019s children were \u201cquadroons or octoroons\u201d \u2014 \u201cbecause people think that being aggressive is funny, I guess.\u201dAlthough they are not married, Rudolph refers to Anderson as \u201cmy husband\u201d in conversation, as when a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 told her that a man once introduced himself to the restaurant\u2019s staff as \u201cthe unofficial mayor of the Valley\u201d and Rudolph instantly blurted, \u201cI hope it wasn\u2019t my husband.\u201d She said it felt \u201cooky\u201d to keep referring to her long-term partner as her \u201cboyfriend\u201d after the birth of their daughter (they now have four children); she likes \u201chusband\u201d because \u201cpeople know what that means. It means he\u2019s the father of my child, and I live with him, and we are a couple, and we are not going anywhere.\u201d\u201cForever\u201d asks a lot of its viewers. It doesn\u2019t require them to have a casual familiarity with centuries of fake monarchical successions or jump through multiple tangled timelines. Instead it tests their capacity for existential dread \u2014 but funny. As a unit of time, the concept of forever is inherently unsettling to humans; an idea of which we have a broad working definition, but which none of us can actually experience. On the show, forever is a state that is quiet to the point of being sepulchral, with no electronic distractions (though there is shuffleboard). It is suffused with slowly deepening panic, unhurried but increasingly restless. Most TV shows are something you turn to to escape real life, but this one almost works the opposite way; real life is a pressure release valve for \u201cForever.\u201dLike Rudolph, Armisen is mixed-race \u2014 a fact to which she partly attributes their closeness. His background is Venezuelan, German and Korean. On \u201cForever,\u201d their union of blends adds a further layer of ambiguity to the environment; June and Oscar are residents of a nondescript California suburb, but they look as if they could be from anywhere.\u201cHis impression of me is the most upsetting impression I\u2019ve heard,\u201d she said, hunching her shoulders. In a voice that sounded like an irritated version of her own, but colored with Armisen\u2019s intonation, she looked askance and asked: \u201c\u2009\u2018Why am I cold?\u2019\u2009\u201d Everyone, she said, tells her the impression is valid. \u201cLiterally, I have more fun working with him than, like, most things in life.\u201d While Armisen and Rudolph\u2019s close friendship inspired them to collaborate again, the result is surprisingly macabre. \u201cForever\u201d is saturated with death.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of death. But I\u2019ve been more fearful in the past, and lately I\u2019ve been more like, \u2018Oh, I hope we all get to go somewhere.\u2019\u2009\u201d Rudolph said this as we sat across from each other in a pair of human-size bird cages. We\u2019d been wandering around a brand-new outdoor plaza in search of a quiet spot to talk. In classic upscale-California-mall style, that ended up being these bird cages. We each crawled inside one. \u201cThe show feels like scratching an itch to me a little bit,\u201d she said.Rudolph\u2019s performance in the second episode of \u201cForever\u201d is heart-rending. Without betraying key elements of the plot: Her character is in a consumer-electronics store, trying to make a purchase, when she breaks down in tears. It\u2019s a depiction of grieving that will prick anyone who has ever been caught off guard by a sudden longing for a lost person. It also feels like a distinctly adult moment of mourning. I asked Rudolph if she recalls what grieving was like as a 7-year-old.\u201cFor many, many years,\u201d she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t even touch this conversation. Like my mom was always \u2014 it was such a painful \u2014\u201d She changed course. \u201cI don\u2019t remember if I ever did proper grieving. I know I did, but it came out in ways \u2014 like when I was a kid, I went to a new school and I kicked people. I was like the kicker for a year. And then people tell me stories that I don\u2019t remember, like I\u2019d be crying at a roller-skating party, and they were like: \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying?\u2019 And I wanted to skate with a boy, and they said that I was like\u201d \u2014 she quaked with sobs \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018My grandma died.\u2019 Which wasn\u2019t true! But I was [expletive] laying it on thick. I definitely think that children process very differently. And I\u2019m genuinely fascinated by it, so I wish I knew all the ways that I do or did, but I don\u2019t. But I know that the place that I was with it most of my life was more of a, \u2018Poor me, why me?\u2019It was less fun to be the child of a famous person when she wasn\u2019t backstage. Rudolph repeated multiple times her request that any pleasantries I may or may not have exchanged with zero to four of her children at any point during our interview sessions (all of which took place in public spaces, rather than at her home) not be described. \u201cI grew up with people knowing who my mother was,\u201d she added, \u201cand that isn\u2019t lost on me. I understand that I probably have more of an awareness of strangers\u2019 recognizing me.\u201dAfter her mother\u2019s death, strangers started stopping Rudolph to share their emotional reactions with her, \u201cabout things,\u201d she said, \u201cthat were really kind of intense, sometimes. Complete strangers would just be like: \u2018I felt like she was this angel!\u2019 And you\u2019re like: \u2018I\u2019m 16. Why are you telling me about my dead mother?\u2019\u2009\u201d It happened so often that Rudolph wondered if she were drawing them out. \u201cHonestly, I used to think \u2014 I was like, Do I have, like, a power?\u201dOne sun-dappled morning in late August, she and I sat on a bench under a canopy of plane trees, looking out over the concentric circles of gardens at the Getty Center. I asked her if she can usually tell when someone has recognized her but hasn\u2019t said anything.\u201cIt just happened,\u201d she said, not moving her head. Rudolph was wearing a tiered sundress in a muted rainbow geometric pattern and no makeup. Even behind her white cat-eye sunglasses, her freckled face was still familiar. I asked her to tell me the next time she saw someone spot her, and almost immediately, she nodded at a cluster of women on a lower level of the garden. \u201cThis group is the group,\u201d Rudolph said. \u201cThe lady that\u2019s second to last, with the white shirt, she\u2019s letting all her friends know where we\u2019re sitting.\u201d As Rudolph narrated, the group\u2019s pace slowed. \u201cThey\u2019re all checking us out.\u201d They continued to walk back and forth over the same patch of path, like a gang of Ms. Pac-Mans trapped between two walls. \u201cSo they\u2019re just getting a better peek,\u201d Rudolph continued. \u201cBut you know what, they\u2019re not bothering \u2014 oh!\u201d She interrupted herself as one of the women jumped to the back of the line to walk the path yet again. \u201cShe\u2019s getting a second peek! Look at that. But they\u2019re not taking pictures.\u201d She can\u2019t ask for more than that.As we watched, the group of women exited their well-worn patch of garden and moved to the upper level, where we were seated, a bold maneuver that allowed them to pass directly in front of us, as close as polite American society would permit.This is the thorny part of finding yourself in the public role of people\u2019s fantasy friend: Your friends are everywhere, and they\u2019d love to see you. Rudolph seems as if she could be your pal because maybe she could be. She is fun and casual. Poehler says people sense \u201ca really warm mother and maternal thread\u201d in Rudolph. \u201cThey\u2019re sensing it correctly,\u201d she added. Rudolph doesn\u2019t travel with a team in tow; there is no bodyguard lurking at a discreet distance. But because she\u2019s so approachable, she is approached \u2014 probably more than any one person approaching her would realize. (Almost never when she\u2019s with a man, she has noticed; people wait for \u201cthe minute the man steps away.\u201d) The daily life of Maya Rudolph is jam-packed with people\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to meet Maya Rudolph, because she\u2019s not quite aloof enough to seem off limits.Instead, she\u2019s a canvas \u2014 for herself, in her impressions, but more exceptionally, for others as well. She is strangers\u2019 down-to-earth friend, if only they could meet her. She is their unwitting emotional confidante. She is black, unless she\u2019s not black enough, in which case she is weird. She is smiling slightly and regarding the manicured garden in peaceful contemplation, or perhaps so she will not inadvertently make affable eye contact with a gawking visitor and embolden them to invite themselves over. It can be exhilarating to be universal. But it\u2019s also a little exhausting.Rudolph estimates that about half the people who come up to her aren\u2019t exactly fans. She is, she said, more \u201crecognizable\u201d than famous. They just want to confirm her identity.Usually, she tells them who she is. But recently a woman interrupted her when she was in a department store searching for a pair of shoes. \u201cI was in a zone,\u201d she told me, and mimed inspecting a shoe in her hand. The woman tapped her on the shoulder, so that Rudolph would face her. \u201cShe said, \u2018Excuse me, aren\u2019t you that lady?\u2019\u2009\u201dWas she?\u201cI just looked quizzical.\u201d Rudolph made the expression you might make if someone asked you what time it was on Mars. \u201cShe said: \u2018No? Aren\u2019t you the lady from \u201cBridesmaids\u201d?\u2019 And I went\u201d \u2014 she gave an understated, bewildered head shake \u2014 \u201c\u2009\u2018No.\u2019\u2009\u201dCaity Weaver is a writer at large for the magazine and a writer for the New York Times Styles section.

{"Headline": "Amazon Sets Its Sights on the $88 Billion Online Ad Market", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVerizon doesn\u2019t sell its mobile phones or wireless plans over Amazon. Nor does it offer Fios, its high-speed internet service. But Verizon does advertise on Amazon.On Black Friday last year, when millions of online shoppers took to Amazon in search of deals, a Verizon ad for a Google Pixel 2 phone \u2014 buy one and get a second one half off \u2014 could be seen blazing across Amazon\u2019s home page. And on July 16, what Amazon calls Prime Day, an event with special deals for its Prime customers, Verizon again ran a variety of ads and special offers for Amazon shoppers, like a mix-and-match unlimited service plan.Amazon, which has already reshaped and dominated the online retail landscape, is quickly gathering momentum in a new, highly profitable arena: online advertising, where it is rapidly emerging as a major competitor to Google and Facebook.The push by the giant online retailer means consumers \u2014 even Prime customers, who pay $119 a year for access to free shipping as well as streaming music, video and discounts \u2014 are likely to be confronted by ads in places where they didn\u2019t exist before.In late August, some gamers were angered when Twitch, a video game streaming service acquired by Amazon in 2014, said it would soon no longer be ad-free for Prime members unless consumers paid an additional $8.99 a month for a premium service called Twitch Turbo.Amazon derives the bulk of its annual revenue, forecast to be $235 billion this year, from its e-commerce business, selling everything from books to lawn furniture. Amazon is also a leader in the cloud computing business, with Amazon Web Services, which accounts for around 11 percent of its revenue but more than half of its operating income. But in the company\u2019s most recent financial results, it was a category labeled \u201cother\u201d that caught the attention of many analysts. It mostly consists of revenue from selling banner, display and keyword search-driven ads known as \u201csponsored products.\u201d That category surged by about 130 percent to $2.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2017.Much of online advertising relies on imprecise algorithms that govern where marketing messages appear, and what impact they have on actual sales. Here, Amazon has a big advantage over its competitors. Thanks to its wealth of data and analytics on consumer shopping habits, it can put ads in front of people when they are more likely to be hunting for specific products and to welcome them as suggestions rather than see them as intrusions.\u201cGoogle and Facebook have been slow to create the standards that advertisers want to see,\u201d said Collin Colburn, an analyst at the research and advisory firm Forrester. \u201cThey are concerned about what sort of content their ads are going to be placed next to.\u201dHe added, \u201cAmazon is different because it has a much more controlled environment on its e-commerce site where the products are being sold, and Amazon\u2019s reach into the rest of the World Wide Web is pretty small.\u201dAmazon has sold some forms of advertising for years, including sponsored product listings tied to search keywords on its site, and ads on properties it owns like IMDb and Zappos. The company will also sell advertising spots on the Thursday-night National Football League games it live-streams to Prime customers this fall.But some analysts who follow the company closely say Amazon is now focusing more on advertising, rapidly hiring and building out its capabilities in a business with high profit margins for Google and Facebook.In turn, brands are increasingly recognizing Amazon\u2019s vast customer reach, particularly to its more than 100 million Prime subscribers. In a study conducted last summer by Catalyst, the search and social media marketing company, only 15 percent of the 250 brands marketers polled felt they were making the most out of advertising on Amazon\u2019s platform, and 63 percent of the companies already advertising there said they planned to increase their budget in the coming year.Many big brands that sell products on Amazon have increased their advertising on the site this year, including General Mills, Hershey and Unilever, according to an analysis of display ads by the research firm Gartner L2.But the bigger surprise is the increase in advertising on Amazon by companies, like Verizon, AT&T and the insurer Geico, that don\u2019t directly sell any product or service on the site. In the first half of 2018, Geico ran six times as many display ads as it did during the same period last year, according to Oweise Khazi, associate director of Amazon IQ research at Gartner L2. (Geico declined to comment.)Verizon said the reason for its increased advertising spending on Amazon was simple: It\u2019s where the shoppers are.\u201cThey have people who are in a shopping mind-set, so that\u2019s valuable for Verizon to be seen as a resource within that mind-set,\u201d said John Nitti, the chief media officer at Verizon.Thanks to the vast amount of data Amazon collects from its customers, it can target ads not only to basic demographics \u2014 say, women over the age of 35 \u2014 but to a more precise segment of customers who are likely to be shopping for cellphones or barbecue grills.Amazon is not just selling ads online. For Verizon, the opportunities to advertise over Amazon may increase as the e-commerce giant continues to build its internal media group and opens new advertising spots on various platforms or devices. Verizon, for instance, will soon be running a test: It will put Fios advertisements on Amazon packages being delivered to ZIP codes where Verizon offers the service.In many cases, the advertising dollars that are moving to Amazon are being diverted from other digital players.In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Levi\u2019s said the company had increased its marketing investment across all channels, including television, traditional digital and newer digital platforms, including Amazon.For some brands, the increased spending is most likely directly linked to increased competition on Amazon\u2019s platform from Amazon itself. As Amazon introduces more of its own private-label goods, many companies are expanding their advertising spending to raise the visibility of their products.On a recent afternoon, a consumer who typed \u201ccereal\u201d into the search bar of Amazon\u2019s browser would first see an ad for JoyBol, followed by similar ads for General Mills\u2019 Corn Chex and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But just below those ads, in a box labeled \u201cTop Rated From Our Brands,\u201d a number of cereals from 365 Everyday Value were featured. That is the private label of the grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in 2017.General Mills declined to comment.Kellogg Company, which faces much of the same competition, said it had been generally shifting advertising dollars toward digital platforms.\u201cWith Amazon\u2019s platform now being a leader in many elements of advertising \u2014 including, for many categories, search \u2014 it makes sense for part of those ad dollars to be allocated there,\u201d said Monica McGurk, Kellogg\u2019s chief revenue and e-commerce officer, in an emailed response to questions.But for Kellogg\u2019s, what sets advertising on Amazon\u2019s platform apart from others, like Google or Twitter, is the online retailer\u2019s data.\u201cWe can reach the right consumer at the right time using their wealth of data to target,\u201d Ms. McGurk said. \u201cOther traditional digital platforms do not have the level of purchase data that Amazon has on their customers.\u201dAnalysts say some brands, however, particularly those whose products now face competition from Amazon private-label goods, remain reluctant to advertise on the e-commerce giant\u2019s platform.\u201cI do hear some brands saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want to work with Amazon too much because they\u2019re going to get too much information from us,\u201d said Will Margaritis, a vice president for e-commerce at the ad agency 360i. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s overthinking it. Amazon has enough data to understand everything about any category it wants to be in.\u201dSapna Maheshwari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Opera in Film Takes On a New Note in \u2018Bel Canto\u2019 (It\u2019s Not Evil)", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClassical music often gets a bad rap in movies. When you hear Mozart in a James Bond film, chances are the villain is using his trusty feed-foes-to-the-sharks contraption. Wagner is a soundtrack for violence. Bach? Dinner music. For Hannibal Lecter.So the release on Sept. 14 of \u201cBel Canto\u201d \u2014 an adaptation of Ann Patchett\u2019s hugely successful 2001 novel of the same name, starring Julianne Moore as an American diva caught up in a hostage drama in South America \u2014 gives opera a welcome chance to return to the screen in a very different key.\u201cBel Canto\u201d is the rare film that does not use opera to comment ironically on bloodshed, or signal sinister depravity, or provide the sonic equivalent of a heart-shaped box of chocolates in a moment of slightly cloying Valentine\u2019s Day-style romance. Mixing elements of thriller and romantic drama, \u201cBel Canto\u201d is not exactly an opera film. But it uses music as character and catalyst, a vital force uniting artist and fan, hostage and guerrilla, plutocrat and revolutionary.\u201cIt\u2019s about the power of art to humanize,\u201d the star soprano Ren\u00e9e Fleming, who recorded the arias by Dvorak and Puccini that Ms. Moore lip-syncs to in the film, said in an interview.The use of Ms. Fleming\u2019s voice in the film is a wheel-coming-full-circle moment. Ms. Patchett has said that while she was writing the novel and creating the character of Roxane Coss, the American diva at its center, she was inspired by listening to recordings of Ms. Fleming. Now moviegoers will be able to hear Roxane\u2019s singing voice as imagined by her creator.It is the beauty of that voice that sets the plot in motion.It is the key to understanding the obsession that drives the superfan played by Ken Watanabe, a Japanese industrialist who flies to an unnamed South American country to hear his favorite diva sing at a private party. When guerrillas take diva, fan and assembled guests in formal wear hostage, in an incident loosely inspired by the 1996 hostage crisis in Peru, the beauty of that voice becomes one of the elements that brings captives and captors closer together.It is a far cry from the typical Hollywood use of music. Ms. Fleming said that she tends to think of opera in film as \u201csomething incredibly romantic,\u201d pointing to the role \u201cLa Boh\u00e8me\u201d plays in \u201cMoonstruck\u201d or \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in \u201cPretty Woman.\u201d But she agreed that classical music had been adopted by quite a few cinematic bad guys recently. \u201cIt\u2019s the villains who are the most in control in their villainy who tend to be classical music fans,\u201d she observed.\u201cCunning, evil directors almost always use classical music as an ironic foil, a tool for dissociation,\u201d Mr. Denk wrote. \u201cThis perpetuates a stereotype: Classical music is unnatural. It is not the music for normal events; it\u2019s for massacres and deceptions of the soul (\u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d \u201cClockwork Orange,\u201d the end of \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d).\u201dMaking a film like \u201cBel Canto\u201d in an age of irony gave pause to its director, Paul Weitz, who co-directed with his brother Chris \u201cAbout a Boy\u201d and \u201cAmerican Pie,\u201d and got a feel for the classical music world while working on the Amazon series \u201cMozart in the Jungle.\u201d\u201cThe film is romantic and tragic in a way that is completely out of step with the amount of irony that one generally brings to serious subjects in contemporary storytelling,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat I came to realize,\u201d he said, \u201cwas that the whole plot of the movie is essentially operatic.\u201dHis diva, Ms. Moore, said in an interview that opera had been foreign territory for her before she signed on to play Roxane in \u201cBel Canto\u201d \u2014 and confessed that years ago she had ducked out of the first opera she ever saw, Mozart\u2019s \u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d before it was over.But she said that she had warmed to opera \u2014 and particularly to Dvorak\u2019s lush and soaring \u201cSong to the Moon\u201d from \u201cRusalka,\u201d a calling-card aria for both the real Ren\u00e9e Fleming and the fictional Roxane Coss \u2014 as she worked on \u201cBel Canto.\u201dTo prepare for the role she took field trips to the Metropolitan Opera; studied singing with Ms. Fleming\u2019s coach, Gerald Martin Moore, to help her lip-sync; spoke with Ms. Fleming; and went to the recording session to watch up close as she recorded arias for the film.So how much of Ms. Fleming is there in her portrayal?\u201cYou know, Ren\u00e9e is not a diva,\u201d Ms. Moore said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing imperious or arrogant or withholding about Ren\u00e9e. She\u2019s very present; she\u2019s not mysterious or pretentious. She\u2019s really direct. And what you feel from Ren\u00e9e is this is a human being who is a tremendous musician. All that I took from her, for Roxane. But certainly none of the imperiousness, none of the attitude. None of that. That was all from the Roxane of the book.\u201dAnd at least one line in the film comes directly from Ms. Fleming, Mr. Weitz said \u2014 from her explanation of the plot of \u201cRusalka.\u201d\u201cRen\u00e9e said, \u2018Well, you know it\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d but it\u2019s opera, so in the end everyone dies,\u2019 \u201d he recalled. He thought it was funny, and added it to the script. \u201cI think it says a lot about Roxane\u2019s character \u2014 that she\u2019s unpretentious, but she has an accurate sense of both how opera swings for the fences, and that it\u2019s slightly amusing that it is swinging for the fences.\u201dOpportunities for opera to burst into the broader popular culture through films and television are rare. But it was not always this way. Opera interested moviemakers even before film had sound: Cecil B.

{"Headline": "F.D.A. Targets Vaping, Alarmed by Teenage Use", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday declared that teenage use of electronic cigarettes has reached \u201can epidemic proportion,\u201d and it put makers of the most popular devices on notice that they have just 60 days to prove they can keep their devices away from minors.The order was part of a sweeping government action that targeted both makers and sellers of e-cigarettes. If Juul Labs and four other major manufacturers fail to halt sales to minors, the agency said, it could remove their flavored products from the market. It also raised the possibility of civil or criminal charges if companies are allowing bulk sales through their websites.E-cigarette users inhale far fewer toxic chemicals than do smokers of traditional cigarettes. But they can take in higher levels of nicotine, which is addictive.\u201cThe developing adolescent brain is particularly vulnerable to addiction,\u201d the F.D.A. said in its statement announcing the actions.In an emailed statement, a Juul spokeswoman said: \u201cJuul Labs will work proactively with F.D.A. in response to its request. We are committed to preventing underage use of our product, and we want to be part of the solution in keeping e-cigarettes out of the hands of young people.\u201dIf such \u201cstraw sales\u201d are happening, it should be readily apparent to the manufacturers, he said. \u201cIf the companies don\u2019t know, or if they don\u2019t want to know, we\u2019ll now be helping to identify it for them.\u201dThe other four products facing the 60-day deadline are RJR Vapor Co.\u2019s Vuse, Imperial Brands\u2019 blu and devices made by Logic. They said they were working with the F.D.A. as well.RJR, Imperial and Altria are all major tobacco companies. As smoking rates have declined, the industry sees e-cigarettes as an important piece of its survival, a fact that makes some in public health mistrustful.\u201cThey say they\u2019ve changed from the days of Joe Camel,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said. \u201cBut look at what\u2019s happening right now, on our watch and on their watch. They must demonstrate that they\u2019re truly committed to keeping these new products out of the hands of kids.\u201dDr. Gottlieb has said many times he believes that e-cigarettes and similar products known as electronic nicotine delivery systems may be effective options for adults who want to stop smoking but still crave nicotine. But he said teenage vaping has become so concerning that regulators may have to curb the availability of the devices to keep them out of the hands of youths.\u201cInevitably what we are going to have to contemplate are actions that may narrow the off-ramp for adults who see e-cigarettes as a viable alternative to combustible tobacco in order to close the on ramp for kids,\u201d Dr. Gottlieb said. \u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate trade-off.\u201dDr. Gottlieb\u2019s aggressive approach against private industry is unusual for an official in the business-friendly Trump administration which has sought to roll back numerous environmental and health regulations. But critics said that his decision last summer to extend a deadline for e-cigarette manufacturers to demonstrate that their products comply with public health concerns helped perpetuate the current problem.She also pointed to the popularity of vaping among young adults. Researchers generally believe that the adolescent brain continues to develop through age 26. \u201cIt\u2019s a big epidemic among people ages 18 to 30, too,\u201d she said.And while the F.D.A.\u2019s announcement struck many as tough, legal experts said the agency could face a protracted legal fight if it follows through on its threats to ban flavors and curtail marketing.While the actions against the industry are alarming to the e-cigarette companies, they are also problematic for the F.D.A.In July 2017, as part of a broad plan to reduce tobacco deaths in the United States, the F.D.A. extended the deadline for e-cigarette makers to comply with new tough federal guidelines, which, among other things, require companies to prove the e-cigarettes are beneficial to public health. In granting the five-year extension till 2022, Dr. Gottlieb said he would also force manufacturers to cut nicotine levels in traditional cigarettes, to render them nonaddictive. For that to work, he said, smokers needed more and better cigarette substitutes.But in an interview, Dr. Gottlieb said the immense popularity of vaping among teens and the growing addiction among young people was not something he foresaw last summer, and the agency must rethink its policy \u2014 perhaps moving the deadline closer and requiring companies to gain F.D.A. approval to stay on the shelves.\u201cI\u2019m highly concerned now,\u201d Dr. Robinson said. Beyond nicotine, the addition of heat to the e-liquid flavors generates chemicals that have not yet been studied in depth, she added.The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, who recently began an investigation into the marketing and sale of e-cigarettes to minors, praised the F.D.A.\u2019s action.\u201cWe\u2019ve worked too hard over the past 50 years to reduce smoking rates among young people to let these companies profit off of getting them hooked on nicotine,\u201d Ms. Healey said. \u201cThis move by the F.D.A. is a good first step to shut down companies targeting minors.\u201dA Juul spokeswoman, Victoria Davis, said recently that the company had already stepped up its own patrol of retailers who advertise to youths or who don\u2019t enforce age requirements, as well as social media posts. But it\u2019s not always easy.From Jan. 1 through July 28, Ms. Davis said, Juul asked Instagram to remove over 5,500 posts, and the social media company complied on 4,562. Facebook Marketplace was less agreeable. The company agreed to remove 45 of 144 posts. Amazon took down 13 of 33.Dr. Gottlieb said he was not impressed by the measures Juul and the other companies have taken.\u201cIt didn\u2019t have the intended impact or I wouldn\u2019t be viewing the statistics I\u2019m now seeing,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "23andMe Said He Would Lose His Mind. Ancestry Said the Opposite. Which Was Right?", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Hercher is a genetic counselor.In many ways, Matt Fender, a 32-year-old resident of New York City, is the prototypical 23andMe customer: tech-savvy, educated, a bit of a worrier. But he wasn\u2019t worried last December when he clicked a button to dump all the raw data from his 23andMe genetic test into a DNA search engine called Promethease, which sorts through data for gene variants that have received a mention in the medical literature.Mr. Fender didn\u2019t expect any revelations. He had already spent $5 on a Promethease report in 2016, which he\u2019d found interesting but not life changing. But the company had recently emailed customers asking them to re-enter their data to be used for future research and quality control. In return, they were offered a free update.Mr. Fender\u2019s update included something new: the terms \u201cPSEN1\u201d and \u201cpathogenic.\u201dMr. Fender is a coder, not a geneticist, but he had spent enough time scrolling through his 23andMe results to know he had gotten some bad news.The PSEN1 mutation is associated with an early-onset form of Alzheimer\u2019s, and it is often described as \u201c100 percent penetrant,\u201d which he quickly came to understand meant no exceptions \u2014 everyone with the variant gets the disease. Most show signs by their mid-40s. Mr. Fender, who describes himself as \u201cthe kind of guy who gets excited about responsible financial planning,\u201d saw all his carefully crafted plans for the future slip away.Genetic health tests are often criticized for providing weak or marginal information about a person\u2019s risk for common conditions like heart disease or diabetes. But while many customers get less than they bargained for, some, like Mr. Fender, get quite a bit more.These reports come plastered with lawyerly admonitions to \u201cconsult your doctor.\u201d But it\u2019s not as easy as that suggests. Most doctors are distrustful of direct-to-consumer testing. They aren\u2019t trained \u2014 or paid \u2014 to go through complicated genetic reports with patients. And they\u2019re leery because the information rarely leads to improved treatments.When Mr. Fender first approached a doctor about his genetic test results, it was 2013, and it was \u201clike he was annoyed at me,\u201d Mr. Fender says.Mr. Fender had purchased the original 23andMe test in part because he had a sister who died of a pulmonary embolism at 23 and he worried about his own risks. The test didn\u2019t tell him anything about his chance of having an embolism, but it did say that he carried two copies of a gene variant called ApoE4, which greatly increases one\u2019s chance of getting late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease by age 85.This information was disturbing but manageable. His doctor wasn\u2019t much help, but that limited advice, combined with a lot of online research, led Mr. Fender to look for ways to improve his health through diet, exercise and supplements.This time, Mr. Fender was prepared for skepticism. His email to his primary care physician was borderline apologetic. \u201cI know this is an area of medicine that is maybe half-baked and possibly annoying to you,\u201d he began, before reviewing what he had learned and requesting advice.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the issue being half-baked,\u201d the doctor replied, \u201cbut what the heck do we do about it, once we know, other than create high anxiety?\u201d The doctor referred Mr. Fender to a geneticist, but it turned out he did not see patients under 50 who were not symptomatic and had no family history of the disease.Mr. Fender then tracked down Jill Goldman, a genetic counselor specializing in dementia at the Taub Institute at Columbia University Medical Center, who described a multistep process of counseling and confirmatory testing that\u2019s been the standard of care for 25 years. She typically serves people at high risk of inheriting a disease, and insurance usually covers both the consultations and the tests. But it was unlikely to cover the costs in the absence of family history.\u201cIt was like a chicken-and-egg thing,\u201d Mr. Fender observes. \u201cI needed a medical test to prove to them that it was real, but I couldn\u2019t get a medical test until I could prove to them that it was real.\u201dMeanwhile, he happened to see a holiday special \u2014 $69 \u2014 for Ancestry\u2019s genetic risk test. He realized he could use it to, in effect, get a second opinion about his PSEN1 variant.Five weeks later, the results were ready. He downloaded his raw data and returned to Promethease. An hour later, he had a new report. He looked for PSEN1 at the top of the list. It wasn\u2019t there.Dumbfounded, Mr. Fender searched for the variant he was looking for: rs63749911. This time, his genotype was listed as common/normal.It was good news, and yet, the two tests were at odds. He had heard that both 23andMe and Ancestry were 99.9 percent accurate. Which one should he believe?\u201cI always think it is important to point out that a 99.9 percent accuracy can still mean errors,\u201d Stacey Detweiler, a medical affairs associate at 23andMe, explained via email. \u201cEven if every variant included in our chip was validated for an accuracy of 99.9 percent (which they are not), that still would mean potential for about 600 errors in the 600,000 variants.\u201dIn other words, the number of mistakes can be as high as 600 per customer.Greg Lennon, a co-founder of Promethease, says the company occasionally catches mistakes and warns customers.Mr. Fender found himself left to grapple with the discordant results on his own. He felt more than ever in need of a doctor\u2019s advice.The direct-to-consumer genetic testing marketplace is a regulatory Wild West. The F.D.A. stopped a proposed deal between Pathway Genomics and Walgreens in 2010 that would have put the tests in drugstores nationwide. It cracked down on 23andMe in 2013, after the company\u2019s first major advertising campaign. But these regulatory efforts look like a game of whack-a-mole.Now the bar is getting lower. A new regulatory structure announced in November by the F.D.A.\u2019s commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, will allow 23andMe and other vetted providers to introduce some tests for health risks without premarket review. This change is expected to usher in a rapid expansion of the consumer genetics industry.And however limited the rules are for direct-to-consumer genetic testing, they are downright draconian in comparison with the free-for-all world of third-party interpretive services like Promethease, which bills itself as a \u201cliterature retrieval system,\u201d with no responsibility for the testing or results themselves.At first Mr. Fender tried to just believe that the Ancestry results were true and that the 23andMe finding was a mistake. It seemed more probable; the PSEN1 variant linked to early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, he learned, is usually inherited, and Mr. Fender\u2019s parents are in their 60s and healthy. If he was wrong, he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know. But he found the lingering doubts disquieting, and eventually persuaded his doctor to order a clinical test of the PSEN1 gene. It was negative.Mr. Fender, relentlessly upbeat, expresses gratitude for the experience. \u201cIt was very motivating,\u201d he says, citing how he has improved his diet and learned to cook. It gave him empathy for people suffering from dementia, and he is thinking about developing an app using voice-activated personal assistants like Siri and Alexa.\u201cPeople with Alzheimer\u2019s lose track of what they are doing and may empty every drawer in the kitchen because they don\u2019t remember that they are looking for their keys. Alexa could ask them what they\u2019re planning to do and then give them reminders.\u201dHe pauses, and it is suddenly easy to imagine what it has been like, spending every day for months picturing a future with dementia. \u201cLike, how\u2019s it going looking for your keys, Matt?\u201d he adds.His story, as bad as it was, could have been much worse. He had both the temperament and the skill to gather crucial information in a relatively short time. A person with fewer resources or different inclinations might have lived for years under that cloud, waiting to get sick.Mr. Fender\u2019s was the first direct-to-consumer surprise that Ms. Goldman encountered but, she acknowledges, it will not be the last. Tens of thousands of people most likely used services like Promethease in 2017, and those numbers are climbing.\u201cPeople are going to need help,\u201d Ms. Goldman says. \u201cAnd we are not ready to handle it.\u201dAdvertisement"}

As with most episodes of \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d the results were decidedly mixed. Performers like Mr. Thompson and Leslie Jones enlivened the evening, but several bits, like a running gag featuring Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen as inept Emmy experts, fell flat.As the hosts, Mr. Jost and Mr. Che reprised the give and take of their \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segments on \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d cracking wise about subjects like Ronan Farrow, Roseanne Barr and the death of traditional television.\u201cOur network NBC has the most nominations of any broadcast network,\u201d Mr. Che said. \u201cWhich is kind of like being the sexiest person on life support.\u201dAs has become typical at Emmy telecasts, there were also plenty of Netflix jokes.With the perennial winner \u201cVeep\u201d out of the running this year, the Emmy Awards were guaranteed to crown a new top comedy. But the competition seemed like an even split between FX\u2019s whimsically avant-garde \u201cAtlanta\u201d and Amazon\u2019s period charmer \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201dIn the end, it wasn\u2019t close. \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d dominated the category, taking home five awards Monday night, the most of any program. The haul included the top award as well as best comic actress for Rachel Brosnahan and best comedy writing and directing for the creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino. When Alex Borstein was announced in the supporting actress category, she ascended the stage in delightfully dramatic fashion:\u201cOh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god!\u201d said an ecstatic Mr. Winkler, 72, who\u2019d leapt onto the stage to accept his award for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series, bringing the audience to its feet. He played Gene Cousineau on HBO\u2019s dark comedy \u201cBarry.\u201d\u201cI wrote this 43 years ago,\u201d he said of his acceptance speech. Mr. Winkler was first nominated in 1976 for his role as Arthur Fonzarelli, who exemplified midcentury American cool in a black leather jacket, on \u201cHappy Days.\u201dIt has become commonplace for award shows to highlight the exclusion of minorities with a knowing wink at how far things have (sort of) come, and the Emmys were no different. In addition to the opening musical number, Mr. Che appeared in a pretaped bit in which he handed out \u201creparation Emmys\u201d to veteran black performers who have been overlooked by the voting academy.Jaleel White (\u201cFamily Matters\u201d), Marla Gibbs (nominated five times for her role as Florence on \u201cThe Jeffersons\u201d), Tichina Arnold (\u201cMartin,\u201d \u201cEverybody Hates Chris\u201d) and Kadeem Hardison (\u201cA Different World\u201d) were among the famous faces who happily accepted Mr. Che\u2019s acknowledgment of their impressive careers.The catch: The co-host \u201cstole\u201d the statues from the four-time winner Bill Cosby. But Mr. Cosby\u2019s wins did not actually have anything to do with those performers not having their own awards. Rather, these actors remain unsung by Emmy voters because of a system that has largely overlooked black artists for decades.Going into the Emmy Awards, fans of \u201cThe Americans\u201d could be forgiven for indulging in some quixotic wishful thinking: Might the great FX spy series, virtually ignored by the Emmys throughout its run, claim the top drama award for its final season?He started his speech paying tribute to his mother, who he said had passed away two weeks ago. \u201cMom always believed in finding the sunshine in things, and she adored my girlfriend, Jan,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.Mr. Weiss was referring to Jan Svendsen, the chief creative officer at Charity Network, and added: \u201cYou wonder why I don\u2019t like to call you my girlfriend? Because I want to call you my wife.\u201dMs. Svendsen\u2019s jaw dropped, and she said yes before Mr. Weiss had even popped the question. The crowd cheered as Ms. Svendsen walked to the stage. Once she arrived, Mr. Weiss told her, \u201cThis is the ring that my dad put on my mom\u2019s finger 67 years ago.\u201dHe knelt and said, \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d\u201cThe only white people that thank Jesus are Republicans and ex-crack heads,\u201d Mr. Che joked, regarding acceptance speeches at predominantly white awards shows. As the night went on, there were a few callbacks to his comment, but the \u201cWestworld\u201d star Thandie Newton, who won for best supporting actress in drama, had the best one.This is not normal. The world\u2019s gone a bit crazy. I mean, for somebody like me, a nobody from nowhere, gets this sweet gig \u2014 free suit, new boots \u2014 just because I don\u2019t like men. That\u2019s a joke, of course. Just jokes, fellas. Calm down. #Notallmen, but a lot of them. It is just jokes, but what are jokes these days? We don\u2019t know. Nobody knows what jokes are, especially not men. Am I right, fellas? That\u2019s why I\u2019m presenting alone. There is a winner and the Emmy goes to Stephen Daldry, \u201cThe Crown.\u201d And of course Stephen could not be with us tonight to accept the Emmy on his own behalf because of probably me. So I think I\u2019ll just leave now and that\u2019s well done, him.And just like that, he was gone. It wasn\u2019t clear if that was Mr. Glover beneath all that makeup \u2014 he hadn\u2019t walked the red carpet earlier in the evening. But then a few categories later, Mr. Glover, looking like his normal self, did finally appear in the same seat once occupied by the creepy character.Advertisement"}

The shorts are very much a product of their time (as with other animated shorts produced during World War II, there are a few cringe-inducing moments of Japanese stereotyping), but the animation still holds up very well. The shorts are notable for their use of rotoscoping, an animation technique that allows animators to trace over live-action footage in order to produce more realistic action.

In keeping with her comic book origins, Diana is living on Paradise Island with her fellow Amazons when a pilot named Steve Trevor (Lyle Waggoner) crashes his plane and lands on the island. Steve recruits Diana, and she leaves the island to go fight Nazis. The show flashed forward in time to the 1970s for later seasons, which allowed Carter to wear some truly fantastic costumes.

Steve recruits Diana, and she leaves the island to go fight Nazis. The show flashed forward in time to the 1970s for later seasons, which allowed Carter to wear some truly fantastic costumes.

Tired of being defined more by her offscreen aura than by her acting \u2014 hello, she was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe \u2014 Ms. Sevigny produced \u201cLizzie\u201d so that she could, for the first time in her 50-film career, play the lead part.

Ms. Sevigny said her worst moment came during an audition, when a female casting director, using vulgar language, told her, \u201cYou have to make men want to\u201d have sex with you \u201cand women want to be you.\u201d\u201cI left that room, which was full of people, and cried in the parking lot,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cI\u2019d never been made to feel like such a commodity.\u201d She added, \u201cPTSD is too strong, but that moment affected me for years, and it still does.\u201dAnother tight smile.Yet \u201cLizzie\u201d also seems to represent an effort by Ms. Sevigny to push into more populist territory.\u201cI have been very calculated in my career, and now I\u2019m kicking myself for some of those decisions \u2014 the things I didn\u2019t do,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cI used to be afraid to do anything that might be seen as frivolous or silly.

{"Headline": "After a Primary on the Fringe, Georgia Republican Tacks Toward the Center", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut that was then. In his latest TV ad, playing now in the Atlanta Metro market for the November general election, Mr. Kemp, in a check-print, button-down shirt, speaks to the camera in a kindly, drawly baritone about \u201cgrowing jobs, not government,\u201d investing in education (of the locally controlled variety), and \u201crewarding legal \u2014 not illegal \u2014 behavior.\u201dIn many Republican primaries, it seemed impossible to be too far right as long as the candidate succeeded in getting President Trump\u2019s endorsement, as Mr. Kemp did. But now, locked in a competitive general election race against the Democrat Stacey Abrams, Mr. Kemp has been trying to gravitate to the center, attempting at least one strategy for surfing the volatile, polarizing energy that permeates the 2018 election season.Mr. Kemp\u2019s pivot has been both stylistic and substantive, and it comes as Ms. Abrams, 44, a Yale Law School graduate and former state house minority leader, has been campaigning around Georgia arguing, with wonkish delight, that her progressive policy ideas \u2014 including robust investment in public education, gun control and the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare \u2014 amount to mainstream common sense. Her campaign calls it an \u201copportunity\u201d agenda, and believes it will resonate more widely than the hot-button conservative agenda that Mr. Kemp is still known for that focuses on issues like illegal immigration and the Second Amendment.Ms. Abrams is also hoping to appeal to moderate voters, placing decidedly more emphasis on her plans to create jobs and invest in education than her criticism of some Confederate memorials, which she has modulated recently.On policy, Mr. Kemp, 54, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, recently made a small but important tweak to his longstanding promise to sign a state version of a federal religious freedom law, a possibility that frightens many in the Atlanta business community who fear that it could prompt harmful boycotts and backlash from liberals who believe such a law would be used to discriminate against the lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender community.Various iterations of a similar state law have been promoted by Georgia conservatives in recent years as a way to protect people of faith from being forced to engage in practices they deem contrary to their beliefs. In 2016, Nathan Deal, the current governor and a Republican, vetoed a religious freedom bill that did not exactly mirror the federal law, pleasing some of Georgia\u2019s most powerful corporations.It was an example of how Mr. Kemp must simultaneously placate the social conservatives and rural Georgians who responded to his primary messages, as well as white suburbanites and the powerful Atlanta corporate community, whose sensitivities have been heightened by the fact that metro Atlanta is among those cities trying to attract a second Amazon headquarters.Mr. Kemp will have to walk a fine line from here on out, said Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia.\u201cIf Kemp moves too far to the center he risks alienating some of his strong supporters from the primary,\u201d he said. \u201cThey may feel they\u2019ve been betrayed, or lied to, once again.\u201dBut others say Mr. Kemp\u2019s excesses in the primary were more in terms of atmospherics than positions he might have to walk back, and that he faces few risks of losing rural white conservatives in a race against an African-American liberal woman from Atlanta.Josh McKoon, a Republican state senator who is leaving office in January, said that Mr. Kemp had done a good job of \u201cchecking the boxes\u201d with conservatives in the primary, while leaving himself space to bring a broader message to the general-election voter.\u201cI think you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks him rolling out some things that have very broad appeal,\u201d said Mr. McKoon, who mentioned a plan to support veterans that Mr. Kemp announced last week. The plan proposes, among other things, eliminating the state income tax on military retirement income.Voters have taken note of Mr. Kemp\u2019s shift in tone. On Sunday at an exotic car show in the parking lot of Perimeter Mall, in the Atlanta suburbs north of downtown, Jimmy Heisler, a contractor, said he found Mr. Kemp\u2019s primary ads funny, and an effective way to get across the importance of gun rights and a strong immigration policy.Mr. Heisler, 46, votes for both parties but said he was leaning toward Mr. Kemp. He said Mr. Kemp might risk some authenticity if he went too far to the center. At the same time, he said, Mr. Kemp needed to appease the more buttoned-up conservative Georgian. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to appeal to the people who thought that was a little too much,\u201d said Mr. Heisler, 46, referring to the primary ads.Reco Edwards, 31, the owner of a custom car shop, thought that it was too late for Mr. Kemp to change his image \u2014 but that it didn\u2019t matter, given how conservative much of Georgia is beyond metro Atlanta.Even so, Mr. Kemp\u2019s shift is a sign that Georgia voters in the middle are not being abandoned by either campaign, even as the candidates work to energize their respective bases.Ms. Abrams, who hopes to be the first African-American woman elected governor in U.S. history, is hoping to ride to the governor\u2019s mansion on a wave of minority and less-than-frequent voters. But she will also need white voters, particularly in the Atlanta suburbs, and her team is convinced that her message will resonate with many of them.Soon after announcing her candidacy, Ms. Abrams called for the removal of the giant Confederate-themed carving on Stone Mountain, east of Atlanta. It was a bold move in a state where some whites still see such markers as tributes to Confederate heritage and not, as Ms. Abrams has put it, monuments that were \u201cby and large put up post-Reconstruction to terrorize African-Americans.\u201dMr. Bullock calls the position \u201can unforced error\u201d on Ms. Abrams\u2019s part, arguing that it could cost her some crucial white votes if the race turns out to be a tight one. And while Ms. Abrams has not backed down from the position, she has been speaking more lately about her desire to find common ground on the issue.Still, for all its visibility as an issue, the Confederacy is not likely to be among the chief points that Republicans raise when they argue that it is Ms. Abrams, rather Mr. Kemp, who is out of touch with the Georgia mainstream.Mr. Shepherd said that the program could become \u201cinsolvent\u201d if the state expanded it to such immigrants based on \u201ca very left-wing ideology.\u201d\u201cI think Brian Kemp\u2019s message needs to be based on that,\u201d Mr. Shepherd said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A New Spotify Initiative Makes the Big Record Labels Nervous", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, the path to stardom in the music industry has usually gone through a major record company.Almost every artist today who reaches the top of the charts \u2014 whether Kanye or Adele, Beyonc\u00e9 or Drake \u2014 has gotten there with help from one of the three conglomerates that control around 80 percent of the business: Universal, Sony and Warner.Now Spotify is experimenting with another approach, one that is making those labels nervous.Over the last year, the 12-year-old company has quietly struck direct licensing deals with a small number of independent artists. The deals give those artists a way onto the streaming platform and a closer relationship to the company \u2014 an advantage when pitching music for its influential playlists \u2014 while bypassing the major labels altogether.Although the deals are modest \u2014 with advance payments of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to several people involved \u2014 the big record companies see the Spotify initiative as a potential threat: a small step that, down the line, could reshape the music business as it has existed since the days of the Victrola.According to six people in the music industry who have been briefed on the recent deals, but were not authorized to discuss them publicly, Spotify has paid advances to management firms and other companies that represent artists who are not signed to a record label. For now, that means up-and-coming acts and older artists who have gained control over their vintage hits.Spotify is offering artists two advantages: a bigger financial cut and ownership of their recordings. The deals, furthermore, are not exclusive, leaving the artists free to license their songs to other streaming companies, like Apple Music and Amazon.Spotify typically pays a record label around 52 percent of the revenue generated by each stream, or play, of a given song. The label, in turn, pays the artist a royalty of anywhere from 15 percent to, in some cases, 50 percent of its cut. By agreeing to a direct licensing deal with Spotify, artists and their representatives are able to keep the whole payout.He was careful to add that such deals did not mean Spotify was turning into a record company \u2014 something that Spotify\u2019s contracts with the big labels forbid, according to people briefed on the terms of those contracts.\u201cLicensing content does not make us a label, nor do we have any interest in becoming a label,\u201d Mr. Ek said on the call. \u201cWe don\u2019t own any rights to any music, and we\u2019re not acting like a record label.\u201dThe next Ed Sheeran or Ariana Grande may be attracted by the very thing Mr. Ek cited in arguing that Spotify is not becoming a label. With its 83 million subscribers \u2014 and nearly 100 million more who listen free \u2014 the service can offer significant exposure to artists without asking them to give up something that traditional record companies demand as part of any deal: ownership of their recordings.Spotify\u2019s decision to forge closer relationships with artists comes with a big risk, however. In the end, it may not be worth antagonizing the labels that the company depends on, said Amy Yong, a media analyst at Macquarie.\u201cThey are treading carefully,\u201d Ms. Yong said. \u201cThey do not want the Big Three to shut then out from their library of content for the sake of signing deals with up-and-coming artists at a higher margin. That\u2019s not an economic trade-off that you want to do.\u201dRepresentatives for the three major labels declined to comment for this article.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a warning shot by the labels to remind Spotify that, as these stories play out, it\u2019s not just Spotify that controls the narrative,\u201d said Bill Werde, the director of Syracuse University\u2019s Bandier Program on the music industry and a former editor of Billboard magazine.In an interview, Mr. Erving said Spotify had paid a modest advance that helped him establish his company. Human Re Sources, he said, is able to pitch songs directly to Spotify\u2019s internal teams \u2014 a rare advantage in the industry\u2019s vast do-it-yourself landscape.Spotify has not given favorable rates to artists affiliated with Human Re Sources, Mr. Erving said, and it has not guaranteed them placement on its playlists. But the company\u2019s artists have had success penetrating Spotify\u2019s most influential playlists, like New Music Fridays and Rap Caviar. Some of them, like Jussie Smollett \u2014 an actor in the hit television show \u201cEmpire,\u201d who makes slithery R&B \u2014 have also made it onto a Spotify billboard in Times Square.\u201cSpotify has been very supportive of the stuff that we have released to date,\u201d Mr. Erving said. \u201cBut Apple and Pandora have been very supportive as well.\u201dThat stance has put Spotify in an awkward position between investors, who are rooting for disruptions that could lead to profits, and music business executives, who would like the streaming service to stay in its lane.According to public filings, Spotify had about $4.9 billion in revenue last year but almost $1.5 billion in net losses. Its stock price has risen steadily since April, and the company is valued at roughly $34 billion.Below the level of the giant conglomerates, the attitude toward Spotify\u2019s moves has been anything but hostile. Its entry into the talent marketplace may give artists more leverage, said Zack Gershen, an executive at Mtheory, a company that consults with artist managers.\u201cFrom our perspective, options are good,\u201d Mr. Gershen said. \u201cOptions create competition. They create innovation. They help everybody discover what the future of this business is.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "HBO and Netflix, Reluctant Rivals, Party Down After Winning 23 Emmys Apiece", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Richard Plepler, the chairman and chief executive officer of HBO, stood at the center of an airy plaza at the Pacific Design Center, where the network has held its post-Emmys party for more than a decade.Another awards season had just drawn to a close, with HBO and Netflix winning 23 Emmys apiece. HBO has long taken pride in its dominance of the Emmys, an honor that came close to ending Monday night. But Mr. Plepler bristled at the notion that there was a rivalry between the network he runs and the well-funded digital upstart.\u201cThis reductive idea that their success comes at our expense, or our success comes at their expense, is just not accurate,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cYou know how you know it\u2019s not accurate? Look at the last three, four years! We\u2019ve grown more in the last three, four years than at any time in history. They\u2019ve grown more. We\u2019ve done great work. They\u2019ve done great work. This is not a binary dynamic. Now \u2014\u2014 \u201dMr. Plepler looked to his left.\u201cLet me give the producer a hug,\u201d he said, moving into the arms of Lorne Michaels, the producer of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and the producer of the Monday night Emmys broadcast.\u201cMazel tov!\u201d Mr. Plepler said.Things had looked dicey for Mr. Plepler and his team until the final moments of the ceremony, when HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d took the statuette for best drama, the most prestigious award of the night.A sense of relief was palpable at the floral-themed HBO after-party. The music was not too loud, and the expansive room allowed for easy conversation. John Oliver, who had won his third Emmy in three years, in the best variety talk show category, walked by, and Mr. Plepler grabbed him and hugged him.\u201cThe thing we are proudest about is, in this incredibly fierce, competitive environment, the line of talent at our door is longer than it\u2019s ever been, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in that talent,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the network the network.\u201d\u201cAre we curating quality, are we curating excellence?\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if we continue to do that, the awards are going to come and, more importantly, talent is going to keep coming.\u201dA few tables away stood Mr. Plepler\u2019s new boss: John Stankey, an AT&T executive of three decades.\u201cThere he is, there he is,\u201d Mr. Plepler said, gesturing toward Mr. Stankey.After mentioning that the two had sat together at the Microsoft Theater, Mr. Plepler added, \u201cHe\u2019s fully in the business now.\u201dIf Mr. Plepler had played down talk of a rivalry with Netflix, Mr. Stankey did not shy away from the subject. \u201cPercentage wise,\u201d he said, \u201cwe performed a lot better, a much higher win-loss ratio.\u201dDecades ago, HBO was in the position Netflix is in now, playing the role of challenger in an industry that was set in its ways. A longtime HBO advertising motto highlighted how different it was, in form and content, from the advertising-driven television business: \u201cIt\u2019s Not TV, It\u2019s HBO.\u201dAnd as it billed itself as the home to what would be called prestige TV, its marketing materials announced with pride, year after year, that it had won more Emmys than anyone else.But now, like every champion getting on in years, HBO has found that it must adjust its strategy if it is to avoid being knocked out by the competitors \u2014 Netflix, Amazon, Hulu \u2014 who would like to take its place as the envy of the industry.Amazon, with a significantly smaller programming slate than Netflix\u2019s, also had a strong night, winning five Emmys during the telecast, including best comedy for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d The victory represented the first time a streaming service had taken the award.Netflix\u2019s 23 wins were the result of an aggressive strategy. It has reached its tentacles into many genres \u2014 from limited series, to reality shows, to stand-up specials \u2014 in an effort to appeal to almost every conceivable niche audience. The company is spending about $8 billion on content this year, roughly $6 billion more than HBO lays out annually for its programming.After the Emmys ceremony, Netflix\u2019s executives and stars packed NeueHouse, a fashionable work space in Hollywood located a few blocks from its new headquarters. Music was blasting, thanks to the of-the-moment D.J. Daisy O\u2019Dell, who had worked the CAA party on Saturday night and the Showtime party on Sunday.The revelers included Dave Chappelle, Jeff Daniels and Tiffany Haddish. They wended their way through narrow hallways covered in thick curtains in a shade best described as Netflix red. Ben Stiller held court in a murkily lit corridor until one of the many security guards present reluctantly told him he was blocking traffic.\u201cThrilled to share the night with HBO,\u201d Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix, said in an email. \u201cThe fact that our wins were across so many titles and forms made me particularly proud of the work of our creators and the team at Netflix.\u201dThe morning after the parties, the Nielsen numbers were in, and they were sobering. Despite all the hoopla \u2014 the campaign-season parties, the red-carpet events and acceptance speeches \u2014 the Emmys telecast had scored a low in the ratings, with 10.2 million viewers, a loss of 11 percent compared with last year\u2019s show.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jim Mattis Compared Trump to \u2018Fifth or Sixth Grader,\u2019 Bob Woodward Says in Book", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump so alarmed his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, during a discussion last January of the nuclear standoff with North Korea that an exasperated Mr. Mattis told colleagues \u201cthe president acted like \u2014 and had the understanding of \u2014 a \u2018fifth or sixth grader.\u2019\u201dAt another moment, Mr. Trump\u2019s aides became so worried about his judgment that Gary D. Cohn, then the chief economic adviser, took a letter from the president\u2019s Oval Office desk authorizing the withdrawal of the United States from a trade agreement with South Korea. Mr. Trump, who had planned to sign the letter, never realized it was missing.These anecdotes are in a sprawling, highly anticipated book by Bob Woodward that depicts the Trump White House as a byzantine, treacherous, often out-of-control operation \u2014 \u201ccrazytown,\u201d in the words of the chief of staff, John F. Kelly \u2014 hostage to the whims of an impulsive, ill-informed and undisciplined president.The New York Times obtained a copy of the book, \u201cFear,\u201d which will be published next Tuesday by Simon & Schuster.But Mr. Woodward\u2019s book has unsettled the administration and the president, in part because it is clear that the author has spoken with so many current and former officials, though all on the condition that they not be cited as sources for the information.Mr. Trump, after initially brushing it aside as \u201cjust another bad book,\u201d accused Mr. Woodward of making up quotes from Mr. Mattis and Mr. Kelly, and perpetuating a \u201ccon on the public.\u201d In a tweet, he suggested that the author was a Democratic operative who had timed the publication to hurt the president politically before the midterm elections.The White House, in a statement, dismissed \u201cFear\u201d as \u201cnothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the president look bad.\u201d After hours of saturation news coverage on cable networks, \u201cFear\u201d rocketed to No. 1 on Amazon.Some of the freshest details in the book involve Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general who has been viewed as an anchor in Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet. Mr. Woodward portrays Mr. Mattis as frequently derisive of the commander in chief, rattled by his judgment, and willing to slow-walk orders from him that he viewed as reckless.In the North Korea meeting, during a period of high tension with the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, Mr. Trump questioned Mr. Mattis about why the United States keeps a military presence on the Korean Peninsula. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this in order to prevent World War III,\u201d Mr. Mattis responded, according to Mr. Woodward.In April 2017, after President Bashar al-Assad of Syria launched a chemical attack on his own people, Mr. Trump called Mr. Mattis and told him that he wanted the United States to assassinate Mr. Assad. \u201cLet\u2019s go in,\u201d the president said, adding a string of expletives.The defense secretary hung up and told one of his aides: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do any of that. We\u2019re going to be much more measured.\u201d At his direction, the Pentagon prepared options for an airstrike on Syrian military positions, which Mr. Trump later ordered.Mr. Mattis issued his own statement denying he ever used the \u201ccontemptuous words\u201d that Mr. Woodward attributed to him. \u201cWhile I generally enjoy reading fiction,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is a uniquely Washington brand of literature, and his anonymous sources do not lend credibility.\u201dMr. Woodward\u2019s reporting adds another layer to a recurring theme in the Trump White House: frustrated aides who sometimes resort to extraordinary measures to thwart the president\u2019s decisions \u2014 a phenomenon the author describes as \u201can administrative coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d In addition to Mr. Mattis and Mr. Cohn, he recounts the tribulations of Mr. Kelly and his predecessor, Reince Priebus, whose tensions with Mr. Trump have been reported elsewhere.Mr. Cohn, Mr. Woodward said, told a colleague he had removed the letter about the Korea free trade agreement to protect national security. Later, when the president ordered a similar letter authorizing the departure of the United States from the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Cohn and other aides plotted how to prevent him from going ahead with a move they feared would be deeply destabilizing.\u201cI can stop this,\u201d Mr. Cohn said to the staff secretary, Rob Porter, according to the book. \u201cI\u2019ll just take the paper off his desk.\u201dMr. Woodward reported new details about Mr. Cohn\u2019s well-documented clash with the president over his equivocal response to the white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. Mr. Cohn, who threatened to resign over the episode, was particularly shaken after one of his daughters discovered a swastika in her college dorm.Mr. Trump\u2019s dealings with foreign leaders were similarly fraught. During a phone call to negotiate the release of an Egyptian-American detained in Cairo, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said, \u201cDonald, I\u2019m worried about this investigation,\u201d referring to the Russia inquiry. \u201cAre you going to be around?\u201dIn July 2017, Mr. Woodward said, Mr. Trump told Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia that he would exempt his country from steel tariffs, only to claim, nearly eight months later, that he had never made that promise. Pressed on it by Mr. Turnbull, Mr. Trump said, \u201cOh yeah, I guess I remember that.\u201dMr. Cohn, Mr. Woodward said, concluded that Mr. Trump was a \u201cprofessional liar.\u201dHe found a sympathetic ear in Mr. Kelly, another retired Marine general, who frequently vented his frustration to colleagues about the president, whom he labeled \u201cunhinged,\u201d an \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201coff the rails.\u201d Mr. Kelly\u2019s reference to Mr. Trump as an \u201cidiot\u201d has been reported before.\u201cWe\u2019re in crazytown,\u201d Mr. Kelly said in one meeting, according to Mr. Woodward. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201dMr. Kelly also issued a denial on Tuesday, saying that \u201cthe idea I ever called the president an idiot is not true\u201d and repeating his earlier insistence that he and Mr. Trump had \u201can incredibly candid and strong relationship.\u201dIn Mr. Woodward\u2019s account, Mr. Trump rarely returns the loyalty of his subordinates. He derided Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one of his earliest political supporters, as \u201cmentally retarded\u201d and a \u201cdumb Southerner,\u201d mimicking his accent and making fun of his halting answers during his Senate confirmation hearing.Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Priebus as a \u201clittle rat\u201d who just \u201cscurries around.\u201d For his part, Mr. Priebus described the White House as a Hobbesian world, in which officials delight in sticking knives into one another, according to the book.\u201cWhen you put a snake and rat and falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal into a zoo without walls, things started getting nasty and bloody,\u201d said Mr. Priebus, whom Mr. Trump eventually ousted and abandoned on a rain-slicked tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base.Mr. Woodward, who began speaking to Mr. Trump\u2019s aides even before the inauguration, also documented the misgivings of the president\u2019s former lawyer, John Dowd, about whether the president should submit to questions from the special counsel in the Russia investigation, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cDon\u2019t testify,\u201d Mr. Dowd told the president. \u201cIt\u2019s either that or an orange jump suit.\u201dMr. Dowd denied on Tuesday that he ever said that.Last January, Mr. Woodward writes, Mr. Dowd staged a practice session in the White House residence to dramatize the pressures Mr. Trump would face in a session with Mr. Mueller. The president stumbled repeatedly, contradicting himself and lying, before he exploded in anger.\u201cThis thing\u2019s a goddamn hoax,\u201d Mr. Trump declared. \u201cI don\u2019t really want to testify.\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d the president replied. \u201cWell, I assume that means it\u2019s going to be a negative book.\u201dMark Landler reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

But Facebook\u2019s acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. That\u2019s a problem: Facebook\u2019s acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.That\u2019s an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened.

But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.Another factor: Under Nike\u2019s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can\u2019t sell league-branded merchandise after 2020. That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process.

{"Headline": "For Pinot Noir, Put Anderson Valley Among California\u2019s Best", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWines of the TimesTop producers have swarmed to the region in Mendocino to make restrained, nuanced wines. It\u2019s been some time since I last visited the Anderson Valley, a bucolic sliver of coastal Mendocino County, where Pacific fogs glide through the towering California redwoods, playing cat and mouse with the rising sun.The wines were often just as idiosyncratic, refusing to toe a line set by some other region or publication. The land and the climate were conducive to good pinot noir, and, by the early years of the 21st century, the valley had gained a reputation for a leaner, more balanced style than the powerful, jammy wines that were then fashionable.A lot has changed in the Anderson Valley in the last 15 years. The region caught the eye of successful producers in other parts of California, and they have flocked en masse. Some simply buy grapes and transport them back to their bases to make wines. Some have planted or bought vineyards, while a few have gone so far as to establish winemaking facilities here.A recent tasting of 20 Anderson Valley pinot noirs by the wine panel suggests that the region is one of California\u2019s most promising areas for the kind of restrained, savory, nuanced wines that until recently were in short supply in the state.The term terroir refers to the soil in which the vines grow, the climate and nuances of that site, its elevation and angle of exposition to the sun, along with the desires and intentions of the people farming the site and making the wine. That last element is the most powerful. It can permit a wine to express the character of a site, or it can overwhelm it.So terroir really refers to the potential of a place rather than its unwavering qualities.We all agreed that the Anderson Valley has great potential to make fine pinot noir in a precise, focused style. The best examples we found were harmonious and nuanced, with aromas and flavors of flowers, red fruits and earthy minerality. Many were moderate in alcohol as well. Among our top 10, only one, the 2015 Velvet Sisters Vineyards from Hartford Court, hit 14 percent. The others were largely below 13.5 percent, and six were under 13 percent. Not that alcohol levels are invariable indicators of style or quality, but they can be suggestive. In pinot noir particularly, alcohol levels rising above 14 percent can signal wines that may be thicker in texture and offer the impression of sweetness. We certainly found a few of those high-octane pinot noirs in our tasting, wines that were cloyingly sweet, jammy and rich. But those were the exceptions. Most of the wines were made with a much lighter touch. Beyond the clumsy few, what separated our top wines from those that did not make the cut was an extra dimension, a wrinkle or two that distinguished the intriguing from the serviceable. \u201cSome were light and bright, others deeper and darker,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cI liked the balance of savory, herbal and mineral.\u201dWilliam noted that many had great acidity, which gave them freshness, and he felt that many of the wines were enjoyable with food, or on their own. Our No. 2 bottle was the lively, floral 2016 Filigreen Farm from Donkey & Goat, based in Berkeley. Jared and Tracey Brandt, another husband-and-wife team, are more likely to be making blends or wines from esoteric grapes than they are Anderson Valley pinot noir, but this one, their first pinot from Filigreen, is superb. The third of our top wines was the earthy, precise 2016 Savoy Vineyard from Peay, a family operation better known for wines from its Sonoma Coast estate. While pleasantly fruity, the Savoy had just enough alluring extra elements \u2014 an herbal edge, a touch of minerality \u2014 to make it interesting.The next rank included the homegrown 2015 Fog-Eater from Drew, bright, energetic and crunchy; and the lively, refreshing 2015 La Selva from Lioco, which is better known for its Sonoma wines, but seems to be making a greater commitment to the Anderson Valley. The Copain was followed by the subtle, complex 2016 Les Larmes from Littorai, which specializes in pinot noirs and chardonnays from the Sonoma Coast and Anderson Valley. Les Larmes is a blend from several different vineyards, and so something of a less expensive introduction to the single-vineyard wines more typical of Littorai.Next came the 2015 Hartford Court, a bigger wine than the others, with darker fruit flavors but well balanced nonetheless. Also keep in mind the 2016 Savoy Vineyard from Failla, softer textured and more straightforward than the Peay Savoy, and the 2015 Charles Vineyard from The Withers, a fresh, harmonious wine with flavors of sweet red fruit.It\u2019s no accident that so many of these producers are also making pinot noirs from the Sonoma Coast and, in the case of Ceritas, from the Santa Cruz Mountains.These regions, along with the Santa Rita Hills in Santa Barbara County, are the sources of California\u2019s finest pinot noirs. The Anderson Valley may wish by nature to stand apart, but it has taken its place among California\u2019s pinot noir elite.Focused, well-structured and refreshing, with aromas and flavors of flowers, red fruits and stony minerals.Fresh and lively, with earthy, floral aromas and flavors, as well as a touch of citrus.Earthy and precise, with flavors of herbs and red fruits.Bright and energetic, with crunchy flavors of herbs, red fruits and flowers.Lively and refreshing, with harmonious flavors of sweet red fruits and herbs.Well-balanced and energetic, with flavors of herbs and sweet-tart red fruits.Balanced and precise, with subtle flavors of red fruits, flowers and minerals.Earthy, complex flavors of dark fruit and herbs.Softly textured, with plenty of straightforward flavors of red fruits.Harmonious and fresh, with flavors of sweet red fruit.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byShows are scrambling to hire more minorities, but the pipeline of experienced writers is thin, a problem of the industry\u2019s own making.Dailyn Rodriguez, a veteran writer and producer, said she wasn\u2019t necessarily looking to work on a new show for the coming season. But she suddenly found herself in high demand, her agents constantly fielding calls about her availability. She was what one Hollywood executive called a \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 not just a Latina, but one who had risen through the television ranks.With dozens of shows now in production, television executives are hustling to diversify their writers\u2019 rooms, the hidden nuclei of Hollywood where stories, dialogue and characters are born, and where the showrunners of tomorrow are created.A deluge of shows in this age of peak TV, with Netflix, Amazon, HBO and other services greenlighting new offerings almost daily, has also stoked demand. Many of these new series have people of color and women as lead characters, in turn pushing minorities and women to the center of the writing staff, a major step forward for writers who say they have long felt like window dressing.\u201cEveryone is eager to find that person,\u201d said Christy Haubegger, an agent at Creative Artists Agency who focuses on diversity. Ms. Haubegger has fielded so many requests for experienced writers of color that she recently created an online database, so networks and producers could look for themselves. \u201cThe demand has been that high,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t service everybody in town.\u201dBut a major reason these seasoned writers are suddenly batting away job offers is that relatively few are in the supply chain. It is a problem of Hollywood\u2019s own making.Plenty of minority and female writers are looking for jobs, but may be unknown to or overlooked by showrunners, unrepresented by agencies, or seen as lacking in experience. \u201cThe pool is wide but not deep\u201d is a common refrain. Even those at the forefront of diversification efforts acknowledge that a shortage exists. Not enough minority women have been groomed for senior writing jobs, a function not only of the industry\u2019s white male focus, but also of rarefied access, discrimination in promotions, and low entry-level pay.Whenever Jamila Hunter, head of comedy at ABC Entertainment, visits historically black colleges and talks about jobs in Hollywood, she finds herself outgunned by recruiters from Wall Street and Silicon Valley who lure graduates with tantalizing salaries. She can promise only years of dues-paying in expensive Los Angeles.Even then, there\u2019s no guarantee, given the fierce competition. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry of privileged apprenticeship,\u201d Ms. Hunter said. \u201cEconomically, there is not a pipeline for them.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no one who thinks, \u2018I don\u2019t want a woman to direct my show,\u2019 or \u2018I only want white men writing this,\u2019\u201d said Sarah Aubrey, an executive with TNT. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in the trenches and it\u2019s crunchtime, it is, \u2018What is my go-to and shortlist of people I know and trust?\u2019 You have to expand your circle.\u201dWhile staffing statistics are not yet available for this year, female and minority writers and showrunners said they were seeing more people who look like them running rooms.The vast quantity of new programming has opened doors that did not exist a few years ago. Some of these shows have among the most diverse staffs in television, including \u201cDear White People,\u201d \u201cSeven Seconds,\u201d \u201cPose\u201d and \u201cMaster of None.\u201dBefore the writer and producer LaToya Morgan signed her second coveted overall deal with AMC \u2014 it gives the network ownership over everything she produces, and provides lucrative job security in return \u2014 she fielded multiple requests from potential employers. Ms. Morgan said she knew several other women of color in the same position. \u201cThere are a lot of cool and great opportunities that I don\u2019t think were there before,\u201d she said. This has a cascading effect. \u201cWhen there are more women in charge, more women are hired, said Felicia D. Henderson, a longtime writer-producer whose credits include \u201cThe Punisher\u201d and \u201cEmpire.\u201d \u201cWhen there are more black showrunners, there are more black writers on staff.\u201d And when there is more than one woman or minority writer in the room, several writers said, they are more likely to be heeded, and less likely to be called on as the voice of all women or people of color. Courtney Kemp, the showrunner of \u201cPower,\u201d calls the phenomenon \u201cBlackipedia, or Blacktionary,\u201d and said, \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting.\u201dAt the same time, some female and minority writers question whether they are being courted because of a genuine push for diversity, or simply because male showrunners want cover from criticism.Kiersten Van Horne, a producer on \u201cBerlin Station\u201d and \u201cMistresses,\u201d said she has been told in recent months, \u201cThey\u2019re looking for an upper-level female\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re looking for diverse candidates at X level.\u201d Tracey Scott Wilson, who was a supervising producer on \u201cThe Americans,\u201d mentors younger colleagues, and said she had met white male writers who believe they were passed over because a minority or woman got their slot, even though other white men ended up being hired. \u201cThat mythology is out there and it\u2019s poisonous,\u201d she said.\u201cIf guys are mad about this stuff, they\u2019re mad about things being slightly less unfair in their favor,\u201d Mr. Slack said. The traditional path to a television writing job starts with serving as a writer\u2019s assistant \u2014 tasks include taking notes and doing research \u2014 which can lead to work as a staff writer. There are generally seven levels above that, carrying greater seniority and higher salaries, and it usually takes up to a decade to make it to the top spots of co-executive producer, executive producer and showrunner.Noelle Valdivia, a producer on the Amazon series \u201cGoliath,\u201d said she remembered being one of only one or two assistants of color when she started in the industry 12 years ago. People continue to hire alumni from their colleges or family friends, she said, and there still are not many writers\u2019 assistants of color.\u201cEveryone wants to hire diverse writers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t create them.\u201dStudios and networks have made efforts to bring along young minority writers and women. There are highly selective fellowships for up-and-comers, most of them writers of color. And, as an incentive for production companies to avoid homogeneous writing staffs, networks usually cover the salary of a so-called \u201cdiversity hire.\u201dBut the programs can carry a stigma. Ms. Saracho, of \u201cVida,\u201d said on the first day of her first television writing job in 2012, a colleague leaned over and said, \u201cYou know you\u2019re the diversity hire, right?\u201d\u201cWe wanted to accept the shame that had been heaped upon us, and prove it wasn\u2019t a given,\u201d said John Landgraf, FX\u2019s chief executive.FX had historically favored directors with extensive episodic television experience, which many women and people of color had not been given the opportunity to amass. To make the shift, the network looked to directors of short films, music videos, and independent films. \u201cIt unlocked a huge amount of talent and potential that was simply being overlooked,\u201d Mr. Landgraf said. He singled out Hiro Murai, who had never directed narrative television before the FX hit \u201cAtlanta,\u201d and has since earned an Emmy nomination.Mr. Landgraf noted that the network still had work to do. Just a third of its senior writers and executive producers in the 2018 season were people of color or women.\u201cThe good news,\u201d she said, \u201cis we can\u2019t fall off the floor.\u201dVOICESWhat\u2019s it like for women and minority writers at work on a show? Five veterans share their experiences in these edited excerpts.There was a show where one of the characters was overtly racist. In the writers\u2019 room, they didn\u2019t want to use the N-word, but they were trying to think of something else. And every single epithet you could imagine, it was just coming out, just pitching different words. And I felt myself getting angrier and angrier. I had to get up and walk out. Workwise, it had to happen, from talking in character. It still did not mean it wasn\u2019t hard. The thing about being black in a mostly white industry, particularly as a black male, is you can\u2019t lose your temper in the same way. Essentially you are an angry black man losing his temper in a way that\u2019s unprofessional, as opposed to an industry that has protected unprofessional white males in perpetua. Things are changing, things are getting better. The one thing I specifically see happening now is there are more black showrunners of both genders than any other time in television.Writers I love and respect will tell me, \u201cOh you\u2019re a unicorn, you\u2019re a higher-level female writer who\u2019s also a minority, and you\u2019re good.\u201d If you don\u2019t hit the mark and you happen to be a minority, your showrunner will assume it\u2019s because you\u2019re a minority that you\u2019re not hitting the mark.A co-executive producer of the recently ended FX series \u201cThe Americans\u201d and a television veteran of 12 years who is also a playwright.All this talk of inclusion, inclusion, inclusion. It\u2019s fine when it\u2019s not B.S. But a lot of it means a producer took a previously white male lead and is now going to make it a black female lead. And they say we need someone as a black co-writer. I get calls like that all the time. I jokingly call it a ghetto pass. Some creators have no interest in making the characters specific and grounding them in their race and/or sex. And you know you\u2019re there for the racial angle.\u201cThe Americans\u201d was a great experience. I felt heard, and I never felt like I couldn\u2019t express myself. A former journalist who joined the television industry in 2016. Her writing credits include \u201cKrypton\u201d(Syfy) and \u201cUnderground\u201d (WGN America). This past year, I had a producer tell me, with regard to a female executive he was complaining about, \u201cDon\u2019t send a girl in to do a man\u2019s job.\u201d He\u2019s no longer a producer. And there was a showrunner who, when I was working with another woman sharing an office, would say, \u201cHey, the women of color lounge!\u201d He\u2019s no longer with the show. In a lot of cases the person doing the weird thing is the person in charge. There\u2019s really nowhere you can go.Co-creator and showrunner of \u201cThe Affair\u201d (Showtime) and a producer on \u201cIn Treatment\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d; also a playwright with 11 years of television experience. I tipped the scale for the fourth season [of \u201cThe Affair\u201d] to more women than men. And it worked so much better. My writers\u2019 room was much more collaborative, better team players, all the stereotypes. The nature of the business is whose voice is the loudest, who can pitch the hardest, you succeed on other people\u2019s failures. But to have a room with a competitive spirit doesn\u2019t work for a show like mine. Also we have a significant age range in our room, from writers in their mid 20s to 60-plus, which I think helps diversity. Just, in my experience, the more disparate people\u2019s respective experiences, the more powerful the room.  Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump reacted to both books with numerous tweets targeting the authors.\u201cIt\u2019s just another bad book. He\u2019s had a lot of credibility problems,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Woodward.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called it \u201cnothing more than fabricated stories.\u201dHere are some key takeaways from the book.In late January, Mr. Woodward wrote, Mr. Trump sat down with John Dowd, then an outside lawyer advising the president on the White House\u2019s interactions with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. The idea was to stage a mock interview between the president and Mr. Mueller, who was angling to question Mr. Trump. During the session, Mr. Trump repeatedly lied and contradicted himself, insulted the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, then exploded in anger, ranting for a half-hour about the investigation being a \u201choax.\u201dMr. Dowd tried to demonstrate why their meeting was reason for Mr. Trump not to do an interview with Mr. Mueller, citing the president\u2019s schedule demands.\u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re lying or you\u2019re bad or anything like that,\u201d Mr. Dowd told him. \u201cGiven your daily intake \u2014 just look what we\u2019ve done this afternoon.\u201dMr. Dowd handed him a letter addressed to Mr. Mueller asserting the president\u2019s right to terminate the investigation. Mr. Trump loved it.The day after, a gleeful Mr. Trump called Mr. Dowd. \u201cI slept like a rock,\u201d the president said. \u201cI love that letter.\u201dBy March, little progress had been made with Mr. Mueller. On March 5, Mr. Dowd met with the special counsel and one of his deputies and explained why he was trying to keep Mr. Trump away from them.\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit there and let him look like an idiot,\u201d he said.Later that month, Mr. Dowd told Mr. Trump why he should avoid an interview: \u201cIt\u2019s either that or an orange jumpsuit.\u201dThe book offers the first extensive look at dialogue between Mr. Mueller and those involved in the Russia investigation. Mr. Woodward recounted Mr. Dowd\u2019s zigzagging relationship with the special counsel\u2019s office, and the lengths he went to to build a rapport with Mr. Mueller in the heat of negotiations over an interview with Mr. Trump. Mr. Dowd fluctuated between credulity and outrage, at one point telling Mr. Trump after an especially trying meeting with Mr. Mueller that the president may have been right about the special counsel all along.Mr. Woodward wrote that Mr. Dowd would tell Mr. Mueller that the president did not have time for the inquiry while he was juggling the responsibilities of his new job.\u201cI\u2019m very sensitive to that,\u201d Mr. Mueller reportedly responded. \u201cI\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201dStill, Mr. Mueller at one point told Mr. Dowd that he could acquire a grand jury subpoena, which Mr. Dowd interpreted as a threat.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to threaten you,\u201d Mr. Mueller reportedly told Mr. Dowd. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking of the possibilities here.\u201dIn one meeting with Mr. Mueller, Mr. Dowd, to make plain just how much he feared that Mr. Trump would commit perjury, asked Jay Sekulow, another one of Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers, to re-enact Mr. Trump\u2019s practice session from January. Mr. Sekulow, playing Mr. Trump, imitated an answer to a question about Mr. Comey.\u201cSekulow\u2019s answer was classic Trump \u2014 an answer spun out of thin air, with contradictions, made-up stuff, anger,\u201d Mr. Woodward wrote. \u201cA perfect performance. A perfect Trump.\u201dMr. Woodward used several defense-related meetings to illustrate the president\u2019s problem grasping his own administration\u2019s policy, including a July 2017 gathering at the Pentagon between Mr. Trump, military brass and members of his cabinet.Here are all the people connected to President Trump who have been charged with crimes or found to have violated federal ethics rules.\u201cWhen are we going to start winning some wars?\u201d Mr. Trump groused as those around him tried to clarify the purpose of the war in Afghanistan. \u201cWe\u2019ve got these charts. When are we going to win some wars? Why are you jamming this down my throat?\u201dMr. Trump attacked the generals and cabinet members in the room, leaving Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson exasperated. He\u2019s a \u201cmoron,\u201d Mr. Tillerson reportedly said once Mr. Trump had left, using an expletive.At a January meeting of the National Security Council, Mr. Trump asked why the United States was spending so much on the Korean Peninsula.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis replied that the administration was trying to prevent World War III. After Mr. Trump left the room, Mr. Woodward wrote, Mr. Mattis told people that Mr. Trump understood the topic like a \u201cfifth or sixth grader.\u201dIn another episode, Gary D. Cohn, the former chief economic adviser to Mr. Trump, \u201cstole\u201d a letter from Mr. Trump\u2019s desk that the president had planned to sign, withdrawing the United States from a trade deal with South Korea. Mr. Woodward wrote that Mr. Cohn told a colleague that he had to \u201cprotect the country.\u201d Mr. Trump apparently never realized the letter had disappeared.In his interview with The Daily Caller, Mr. Trump denied that Mr. Cohn had taken the letter. \u201cThere was nobody taking anything from me,\u201d he said.Mr. Woodward also prints a summary of the July 2017 meeting written by a senior White House official who spoke with its attendees.\u201cIt seems clear that many of the president\u2019s senior advisers, especially those in the national security realm, are extremely concerned with his erratic nature, his relative ignorance, his inability to learn, as well as what they consider his dangerous views,\u201d it read.Mr. Woodward conducted most of his interviews on \u201cdeep background,\u201d meaning he could incorporate the material without citing from whom it came. Throughout the book, he described settings and events with exhaustively reported detail, incorporating what he said in a note in the book were \u201chundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand participants.\u201dBut, Mr. Woodward said in the same note, Mr. Trump declined to be interviewed, leaving the tale largely his advisers\u2019 telling.On the call, Mr. Trump sounded worried, repeating his refrain that it would be a \u201cbad\u201d book for him, and that Mr. Woodward did not understand just how successful he had been in office.\u201cSo we\u2019re going to have a very inaccurate book, and that\u2019s too bad,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be accurate, I promise,\u201d Mr. Woodward responded.\u201cYeah, O.K.,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWell, accurate is that nobody\u2019s ever done a better job than I\u2019m doing as president.\u201dMr. Kelly, who has long been rumored to be close to resigning, once called Mr. Trump an \u201cidiot\u201d and said the White House staff was operating in \u201ccrazytown,\u201d according to the book.\u201cIt\u2019s pointless to try to convince him of anything,\u201d Mr. Kelly bemoaned in a meeting. \u201cHe\u2019s gone off the rails.\u201dMr. Trump came to be suspicious of Mr. Kelly\u2019s scrupulousness, finding workarounds, such as calling members of Congress when Mr. Kelly was not in the room.When Mr. Cohn tried to resign over comments Mr. Trump had made after a white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017, Mr. Trump belittled him but persuaded him to stay. Mr. Kelly then pulled Mr. Cohn aside to express his dismay over how Mr. Cohn was treated.\u201cThat was the greatest show of self-control I have ever seen,\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \u201cIf that was me, I would have taken that resignation letter and shoved it up his ass six different times.\u201dStill, Mr. Kelly shared some of Mr. Trump\u2019s paranoia about bad press.\u201cI\u2019m the only thing protecting the president from the press,\u201d Mr. Woodward quoted Mr. Kelly as saying in a meeting. \u201cThe press is out to get him. They want to destroy him. And I\u2019m determined to stand in the way, taking the bullets and taking the arrows.\u201dOn Tuesday, Mr. Kelly denied in a statement that he had ever called Mr. Trump an \u201cidiot.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ex-Google Employee Urges Lawmakers to Take On Company", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google is facing increased scrutiny by lawmakers in Washington over its size and influence. Now, a research scientist who recently resigned from the company in protest is urging them on.He said lawmakers should increase transparency and oversight of the company and technology industry, saying that there is a \u201cbroad pattern of unaccountable decision making.\u201dDr. Poulson left the company after news articles revealed the existence of the project last month. It was first reported on by the Intercept news site.Google\u2019s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified on Wednesday before a congressional committee about the company\u2019s approach to data protection. Executives from Apple, AT&T, Amazon, Twitter and Charter Communications also appeared at the hearing.Dr. Poulson said the Chinese project, called Dragonfly, had several \u201cdisturbing components.\u201d A prototype, he said, would allow a partner company in China to view a person\u2019s search history based on his or her phone number. He said the project also censored an extensive list of subjects that included information about air quality and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping.He also pointed lawmakers to commitments Google made as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. Google, among other requirements, must submit to regular privacy audits and follow a comprehensive privacy program under the settlement. The privacy program includes reviews of all Google products for privacy issues before they are released.Google\u2019s privacy reviewers are assigned to analyze Google code and make sure it does not violate user privacy. But after Dragonfly became public, several reviewers said they had signed off on sections of code for Dragonfly without fully understanding the project or its privacy implications, according to two people familiar with the process.

{"Headline": "Billionaires Can Seem Like Saviors to Media Companies, but They Come With Risks", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRoughly a century ago, men like William Randolph Hearst, Joseph Pulitzer and Henry Luce dominated the media landscape. These moguls built their publishing empires and used them to intimidate rivals, espouse favored causes and settle scores.Today, members of a new Gilded Age are again in control of many of the country\u2019s most venerable media outlets. Only now, it is tech entrepreneurs, casino magnates and hedge fund billionaires who are seizing control of the press, simply by writing a check.With the deal, Mr. Benioff joined an elite club of relatively new press barons that includes the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post; Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and the head of the Emerson Collective, who acquired a majority stake in The Atlantic; and Michael R. Bloomberg, who owns Businessweek and Bloomberg News.At a moment when many print publications are struggling to survive, the largess of a wealthy owner can seem like a godsend. But there are also fresh concerns, some based on recent experience, that these individuals are assuming an unhealthy amount of influence.\u201cEven good billionaires need to have less of a role in our public life,\u201d said Anand Giridharadas, author of \u201cWinners Take All,\u201d a new book about the global elite. \u201cThey are buying up the free press, which is meant to hold them accountable.\u201dBeyond the marquee names, local billionaires now own the daily newspapers in Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Boston. Smaller outlets \u2014 including The Village Voice, The New Republic and Gothamist \u2014 were also bought by wealthy individuals in recent years.And all of this is happening as the business model for print and online journalism remains precarious at best.\u201cWe have a new era, particularly in the last few years, of billionaire owners from the new economy who are intrigued by this old dilemma,\u201d said Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, a journalism advocacy group.In some cases, these new owners succeed in revitalizing the publications they acquire, injecting them with new energy and freeing them from the pressures of short-term profits, while preserving editorial independence.And in Minnesota, a local businessman, Glen Taylor, has drawn praise for his ownership of The Minneapolis Star Tribune, which he bought for about $100 million in 2014.But just as often, it seems, the new owners of newspapers and magazines can sap newsroom morale, or quickly discover that they have little tolerance for financial losses, or unions.\u201cBeing owned by a local billionaire is not necessarily an act of charity,\u201d Mr. Rosenstiel said. \u201cThere are clearly billionaires who are buying up publications because they want to influence political discourse in the country.\u201dEven John Henry, who made a fortune with his investment firm and is well regarded as the owner of The Boston Globe, has recently expressed some distaste for the economics of print media.For much of the 20th century, print publications were largely owned by private companies \u2014 often helmed by families like the Scrippses and the Chandlers \u2014 that had started a publication in one city and gradually expanded.By the 1970s, consolidation and ample profits from print advertising led many of these companies to go public.But in the late 1990s, advertising on the internet began to chip away at print profits. And in recent years, many once-proud print empires have consolidated, others have been sold for parts, and some papers and magazines are simply going out of business.Amid this turmoil, the new generation of wealthy buyers has emerged. But while buying a high-wattage publication can deliver an owner a certain amount of status and prestige, it can also invite controversy.President Trump, displeased with coverage of his administration in The Washington Post, has taken to attacking Amazon on Twitter, even though Mr. Bezos \u2014 not Amazon \u2014 owns the newspaper.Walter Isaacson, a former editor of Time, said that for most of his career, he had believed that the best owners for media companies were publicly traded corporations, where there was less of a chance for a wealthy owner to meddle.That changed, he said, during his tenure at Time.\u201cThen I went through the disaster of Time Warner, a company that only cared about short-term stock price and didn\u2019t have a feel for journalism,\u201d he said.Now, Mr. Isaacson said, \u201cI have come to the belief that a sole proprietor, especially a benevolent and public spirited one, is a good thing in troubled times.\u201dMr. Giridharadas, however, remains skeptical that ultrarich individuals, however public spirited, are the best owners for the free press.\u201cI\u2019m concerned about the powerful having an oligopoly of the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only amount of power that a billionaire should have over a paper they own is zero.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stan Brock, 82, Intrepid Provider of Health Care in Remote Areas, Dies", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStan Brock, a former British cowboy and co-host of the long-running television show \u201cWild Kingdom,\u201d liked to tell of an exchange he had with the sixth man to walk on the moon.He was recounting to that astronaut, Edgar D. Mitchell, what had prompted him to quit his job, sell all his belongings and found a volunteer mobile medical service for uninsured Americans and poor people in underdeveloped countries.As the genesis story goes, he was a teenager at the time living with the Wapishana Indians in what was then British Guiana, and they had given him a wild Spanish bronco as a gift. The horse, which had killed a previous owner on a wild ride, was only slightly more forgiving when Mr. Brock climbed on board.The bronco bucked across the savanna and collided with a barbed wire fence. Mr. Brock was thrown to the ground, the 700-pound stallion landing on top of him.\u201cEd said, \u2018Gosh, I was on the moon and I was only three days from a doctor,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Brock recalled. \u201cSure, I said, but for those people who lived in the Upper Amazon, and the 50 million people we\u2019re now dealing with in the U.S., they might as well be on the moon for the opportunity they have to get the health care they need.\u201dStan Brock died on Aug. 29 at RAM\u2019s offices in Rockford, Tenn., where he had lived ascetically since he founded the nonprofit outfit in 1985. He was 82. Robert Lambert, a RAM spokesman, said the cause was complications of a stroke.RAM began operating initially in British Guiana and then expanded to the United States in 1992, starting out with a single pickup truck that hauled a single dentist\u2019s chair. It opened its first American clinic in Sneedville, Tenn., in 1992 and still runs an airborne ambulance operation in what is now the independent nation of Guyana.The organization estimates that it has provided medical, vision and dental care to more than 700,000 patients since its founding, in areas ranging from Appalachia to New York City, and in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.Last year, about 1,400 health professionals volunteered to treat 2,300 people who showed up at one of RAM\u2019s outdoor clinics at the fairgrounds in the western Virginia town of Wise. Some had camped out for three days to make sure they would be treated.RAM receives no government funding and is supported by contributions, which invariably escalated after potential givers learned in news reports about Mr. Brock\u2019s unwavering commitment.Stanley Edmunde Brock was born on April 21, 1936, in Preston, Lancashire, England, to Stanley and Irene (Mandley) Brock. His father, a civil servant who supervised telephone installations, was posted around the country and later deployed to British Guiana, a colony until 1966. When Stan was 17, he left Britain and the Canford School in Dorset to visit his parents over the summer and never returned to Britain, or to school.\u201cFor five years I had been a prisoner of the establishment,\u201d he wrote in a memoir, \u201cAll the Cowboys Were Indians\u201d (originally published in 1969 as \u201cJungle Cowboy\u201d), \u201cstrangled by a stiff white collar, black tie, gray drainpipe trousers and an ill-fitting jacket, herded like a convict, carrying armfuls of Chaucer, Homer and English history.\u201dHe was married briefly, but said he had subordinated the relationship to his volunteer work.\u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a way to put this \u2014 would I like to be married? Yes,\u201d he told The Independent. \u201cWould I like to have children? Yes. But I\u2019ve got thousands of them now.\u201dHe is survived by his brother, Peter, and a longtime friend, Karen Wilson, RAM\u2019s former executive director.Mr. Brock became a cowboy in British Guiana. There, from 1952 to 1968, he was the manager of the 4,000-square-mile Dadanwa Ranch, once the world\u2019s largest cattle station, with 30,000 Longhorn cattle and horses.He also appeared in an American sitcom, \u201cThe Corner Bar,\u201d and acted in several adventure films, including \u201cEscape From Angola\u201d in 1976 and \u201cGalyon\u201d in 1980.He was credited with discovering a rare species of bat, which was named for him, Vampyressa brocki. He was also a pilot, which enabled him to reach remote areas, and held a black belt in taekwondo.Mr. Brock was instrumental in persuading Tennessee legislators to let licensed health care professionals from out of state volunteer to provide free medical services. RAM was nonpartisan in debates about health care, though, he said.\u201cI\u2019m just the voice of the homeless and the underserved,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unless they fix these basic things, we\u2019re going to be doing this long after my lifetime.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cthere seems to be no end in sight.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018If This Book Is Not Expressing Everything, What Am I Doing With My Life?\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "FeatureDaniel Mason, a 42-year-old practicing psychiatrist, spent 14 years writing his latest novel, his first about a doctor \u2014 and the costly mistakes he makes.Supported byThe tradition Mason was referring to is psychiatry; the room in question was the one in which a clinician would encounter distressed patients (in Mason\u2019s case, the inpatient psychiatric unit of Stanford Hospital, where he works as a psychiatrist); the ring was a wedding band; and the kind of disclosure Mason had in mind was his having agreed to answer my questions \u2014 the third day of them; the 17th hour of them, by then \u2014 questions about his life.\u201cSome people of an earlier generation would reveal absolutely nothing,\u201d Mason continued, one leg of his long, lean frame crossed loosely over the other. \u201cAnd I think that, generally, what we\u2019re taught is that if a person asks a personal question, the important thing to ask is why they want to know and what they think.\u201dSo why, exactly, would a married doctor enter a room without a ring?\u201cThe theory behind the ring,\u201d Mason said, his own wedding band visible on the hand resting on his knee, \u201cis if a psychiatrist goes into a room without it, that\u2019s going to change what the patient\u2019s going to share. Much more information is going to come when a patient meets a doctor who\u2019s not wearing a ring and, according to people who believe this very strongly, the patient asks: \u2018Are you married?\u2019 That\u2019s a moment when a psychiatrist responds: \u2018We could talk about that. But maybe more important right now is what you were feeling when you asked that.\u2019 And then, this door opens \u2014 hopefully: We\u2019re always looking for a door that might open \u2014 and a patient might say, \u2018Well, I imagine that you are married because I imagine that everybody is happily married except for me.\u2019 That\u2019s Answer A. Answer B is: \u2018I don\u2019t think you\u2019re married because you\u2019re attracted to me.\u2019 Answer C is: \u2018I have no idea. I don\u2019t feel like I can read anybody now. I don\u2019t understand anybody. I didn\u2019t understand my wife, apparently. I don\u2019t understand you.\u2019 Each one of those leads the psychiatrist down these totally different paths. That\u2019s really helpful information.\u201dMason wears his ring while seeing patients, as do many of his colleagues. But despite that measure of clinical transparency, he was clear during our conversations that it was essential to his ability to practice medicine that certain details of his personal life beyond the most basic published facts \u2014 he is married to the novelist Sara Houghteling \u2014 remain unavailable to his patients. He acknowledged the awkwardness of this preference \u2014 I was there, wasn\u2019t I, to profile him? \u2014 but it couldn\u2019t be helped, given that he has been, as he says, \u201cnegotiating two worlds\u201d throughout his professional life. In one, he serves on a team of clinicians that includes psychologists, social workers, nurses, occupational and physical therapists, residents and medical students, treating people admitted for acute mental illnesses or crises. And in another, he is a fiction writer who, nearly two decades ago, published, at 26, while still in medical school, his first novel, \u201cThe Piano Tuner,\u201d which describes the journey of a man sent by the British War Office to the Burmese interior in 1886 to repair a piano. It became an international best seller, was translated into 28 languages and adapted as an opera. His third novel, \u201cThe Winter Soldier,\u201d which took 14 years to complete \u2014 his first about a doctor and, in part, a coming-of-age story about what that profession can demand and return \u2014 arrives this month and with it, for Mason, no little inner negotiation: It will be his first book to appear since he began practicing psychiatry, a vocation which maintains that the practitioner\u2019s face is best kept blank.In part, Mason has displaced this concern by locating the novel in history. Mason\u2019s original idea, a decade and a half ago, the story of an early psychiatrist practicing in Freud\u2019s Vienna, involved the relationships that form between a female patient, who is an artist, her doctor and the patient\u2019s husband. But during the course of his research for the book, Mason (to whom, I should say, I am not related) made a discovery. \u201cI was researching his back story,\u201d Mason told me, \u201cand I came across this moment in history where the Austro-Hungarian Army finds itself so ill-equipped for the war that they don\u2019t have enough doctors. So they invest in medical students with no clinical training and send them off to hospitals. I came across this at a time when I had just finished medical school, was deeply aware all of a sudden of this whole new range of human experience that I hadn\u2019t known existed before. Suffering mostly. Physical and metaphysical, but one is most impressed by physical suffering. Most medical students, up until that moment in their lives, haven\u2019t suffered an illness as severe as the illnesses they will encounter in their patients. And it sounds so unbelievably na\u00efve, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one whose world is shaken by the duration and the depth of suffering that people go through.\u201dThough it would take him a decade, Mason would jettison the part of the novel \u2014 many hundreds of pages \u2014 about the psychiatrist and instead explore his education: that of a medical student out of his depth who must try to help wounded men who are beyond helping.That urge, that fear \u2014 to help the afflicted; to avoid harming those who suffer \u2014 is at the center of Mason\u2019s practice, both as a writer and as a doctor. That afternoon, Mason discussed, in broad strokes, the challenges of trying to help real people in crises. \u201cIt\u2019s so bewitching to feel like you\u2019re curing somebody,\u201d Mason said. \u201cThe first time I saw someone who had catatonia respond to treatment with Ativan, it was like, my God, I\u2019m witnessing a miracle. The hard part is the next time around, when it doesn\u2019t work.\u201cIt is very hard to learn to go home when a patient is not getting better,\u201d Mason continued, \u201cor to stop searching for an explanation.\u201d With all the unknowns involved in the treatment of mental illnesses, Mason said he takes comfort, as a clinician, in Freud\u2019s definition of the goal of treatment: \u201cMuch will be gained if we succeed in transforming your hysterical misery into common unhappiness.\u201d As a fiction writer, Mason\u2019s path to comfort \u2014 comfort with the form; comfort with the sense that what he is producing is meaningful \u2014 has had to come from practice, from a long process of figuring out what, for him, fiction can do: what it can reveal, and what it can offer, to a writer and his readers.The first Mason fiction I read was \u201cDeath of the Pugilist or, the Famous Battle of Jacob Burke & Blindman McGraw.\u201d It is, in thumbnail outline, spectacularly unpromising: a 7,000-word narrative of a boxing match. And not just a boxing match, but a fight between a scrappy young outsider and a seasoned champion. The form of the story seems no less enervating: like a long piece of reporting, with headlines, 17 of them \u2014 \u201cWho was Burke? His Beginnings\u201d; \u201cWho is Blindman?\u201d \u201cThe day approaches\u201d; \u201cThe fight begins\u201d \u2014 prefacing each section. As you read them, however, something funny happens. Mason turns the familiar theater of two men at brutal odds into a state of original fascination. Part of what makes the story so remarkable is Mason\u2019s sense of what language can do, his functional belief that words, as Guy Davenport wrote, \u201care animals, alive and with a will of their own.\u201d Here, the challenger, Burke, watches the arrival of the champion, Blindman McGraw: \u201cBurke hears the murmurs thrumming through the crowds, then shouts going up, the hillside parting for a dark figure to come through. ... Six foot six at least, but the illusion of height is increased by the size of his chest and belly, which set his head back like some faraway peak.\u201d We have seen this scene before, the arrival of the gladiator, and yet we have not, not this way, not through this elemental seizing of time and space, of hillsides parting and peaks looming, far away. We are not in a boxing match; we are in nature, and the struggle will be for survival, hand to hand, word to word.My favorite of Mason\u2019s stories to date, \u201cThe Ecstasy of Alfred Russel Wallace,\u201d involves a more explicit investigation of our species. Wallace was a naturalist, explorer and biologist who, independently through his fieldwork, developed the theory of evolution through natural selection before Darwin published \u201cThe Origin of Species.\u201d Mason situates us at Wallace\u2019s elbow and occasionally in his head as he gathers the specimens and accumulates the ideas that, he is coming to understand, will, for all time, change the way we see our world:Mason makes the urgency of a thought, and the energy of its pursuit, palpable, as Wallace, in total isolation, deep in the Malay Archipelago, in a state of total separation from the developed world, develops inside him an appreciation of the world new to human thinking. As the story builds to Wallace\u2019s expression of that understanding, Mason manages to capture a state I haven\u2019t felt so powerfully before in fiction: solitude, the space in which a thought can grow as organically as a cell, in which the real loneliness and boredom of intellectual work are eclipsed by the ecstasy such work can yield. Moreover, Mason shows how solitude is a kind of suffering that the human animal, if it is to achieve what only our species sometimes can, must \u2014 and will \u2014 endure.During the long gestation and production of his new novel, Mason accumulated half a dozen short stories, among them \u201cPugilist\u201d and \u201cWallace,\u201d five appearing in Harper\u2019s and a sixth in Zoetrope. They vary in form \u2014 one is a letter; one is written as if by Herodotus; another is in the first person; three in the third \u2014 but they are united by their reliance on history for some spark, whether factual or textual. \u201cPugilist,\u201d though its combatants are products of Mason\u2019s imagination, was in part inspired by Mason\u2019s reading of 19th-century magazine accounts of boxing matches, and \u201cWallace\u201d by Mason\u2019s reading of Wallace\u2019s \u201cMalay Archipelago.\u201d In all of the stories, you can see Mason figuring out new strategies to get closer to the people he is writing about. Each is a portrait, each a deep dive into an individual\u2019s nature, each rooted in history.I wondered why Mason\u2019s fiction insisted on, and drew from, historical subjects.\u201cI feel it\u2019s a better skeleton on which to hang other questions,\u201d Mason said. \u201cI feel astounded by the natural world. I could write an essay about how I\u2019m astounded by the natural world. But there\u2019s a man who spent most of his life traveling alone, and with such astonishment for the natural world, that he\u2019s willing to endure everything so he can see one more plant and capture one more animal and sit cooked by fevers in the archipelago \u2014 because he wants to see more.\u201dMason himself traveled down the Amazon in 2004 after graduating from medical school. He says it remains one of the most extraordinary experiences of his life: \u201cThere was something that happened to the perception of time during the long days traveling on the river, which gave me a sense of a fundamentally different way of experiencing the world.\u201d But though this journey inspired the Wallace story, it wasn\u2019t enough to be a story in itself. \u201cI would say my personal history is not particularly interesting,\u201d Mason said, with a small smile that predicted his questioner\u2019s disbelief. \u201cI do believe that. Now, the psychiatrist sitting with me would say: \u2018When you say that your personal history is not interesting, it means you probably think that your personal history is actually painful or difficult, and so this is a way of deflecting that.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. I actually do think I grew up without the trials of most people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most technical professions in medicine,\u201d Mason said. \u201cBut I think that the way I grew up around it, because of my father practicing it, radiology had a kind of mythical quality \u2014 the idea that my father was somebody who could see inside other people was a mystical thing.\u201dMason was an obsessive reader, a kid who took bikes apart and put bikes back together, who read magazines about bikes and how to take them apart and put them back together. There were baseball cards and stamps. There were math competitions. There was the seasonal youth-sports cycle \u2014 soccer, baseball, basketball. There were posters on his wall: \u201cWhales of the World,\u201d a Lamborghini. He played clarinet because he had to. He excelled because he enjoyed school, and he went east to college at Harvard, because he sensed that there was something different about it from where he grew up.When he arrived, he labored under a sense of insecurity. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy place. I felt very lost at the beginning. I felt that friends on the East Coast had access to an intellectual tradition and a historical tradition that engaged with a history that went even farther back into Europe, and I was some kind of rough.\u201dHe was lonely there, homesick. Early in his junior year, he thought of transferring back to California to be closer to home. His adviser, perhaps sensing this lack of direction, introduced him to the young mathematician Ellis McKenzie, then a graduate student working on applying mathematical models to malaria infections. \u201cNot only was Ellis kind and generous with his time for a clueless undergraduate,\u201d Mason explained, \u201cbut also there was something about him that was familiar. He had gone to college in Santa Cruz, spent a lot of time on the same beaches and redwoods, wore flip-flops in winter. He also introduced me to a way of thinking across disciplines, which I hadn\u2019t encountered in my classes. The project was to apply population models to the changing levels of malaria parasites in human blood, and Ellis introduced me to thinking of the body as a kind of ecosystem, rather than just a \u2018them\u2019 and \u2018us.\u2019 In this way, he anticipated the current interest in the microbiome. But even more than mixing disciplines like population biology and medicine, he had this respect for older literature and had discovered this remarkable old data set of blood-parasite levels from back in the early 1900s when people were infected with malaria to treat their neurosyphilis.\u201d (The high fever of malaria was thought to kill the organism that causes syphilis.) \u201cIn some ways,\u201d Mason continued, \u201cmy current interests in psychiatry come from this notion that he embodied, that biomedicine has enormous debts to other fields of biology, to the humanities.\u201dMason graduated with a degree in biology in 1998, writing his thesis on the population dynamics of mixed-species malaria infections. Building on that work, he spent the following year in Thailand on a Luce Scholarship \u2014 malaria research in Bangkok and at field sites on the southern Thai-Burmese border, preparation for what he supposed would be his specialization in medical school when he returned: infectious diseases.Though Mason began medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, in 1999, he did not practice medicine until 2011. During his first year, gross anatomy underway and tissue samples in the microscopes, in a state he describes as complete disinhibition, Mason began writing a novel prompted by his time in Burma \u2014 needed to, in fact. \u201cI returned home amazed by this new world. I felt like there was this huge part of me that was there, and I wanted to capture it, somehow. Preserve the experience. Otherwise it was going to be lost.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think about publishing it,\u201d Mason said. \u201cAnd then at a certain point I thought: If I\u2019m going to share it with friends and family, could Kinko's do a nicer job of printing this than just binding it on one of those spiral things?\u201d Kinko\u2019s was spared the challenge: By the time he was beginning clinical rotations in 2001, Mason had managed to complete, and sell, a draft. Published in 2002, it was \u201cThe Piano Tuner.\u201dBy the time Mason graduated in 2004, after taking a year off to write and travel, especially in Brazil, he had begun conceiving two more novels \u2014 the writing of one and the researching of another \u2014 as well as the first of the suite of stories. Though he had intended to continue directly into his medical residency, the unexpected success of the first novel gave Mason time to try being a full-time fiction writer.It didn\u2019t go well. The ease with which he wrote the first book \u2014 the pure, unselfish freedom of writing only for himself, which Mason now calls \u201ca kind of lost youth\u201d \u2014 was replaced by difficulty. \u201cIf I characterize the trouble I hit with the second book, it felt very inhibited. I wondered, Why am I doing this? If you start asking that, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d \u201cA Far Country\u201d took five years in all and was by design a very different book than its predecessor. \u201cI began to feel when I finished \u2018The Piano Tuner,\u2019 perhaps because of the attention, and a lot focused on the historical and musical apparatus in the book, I thought, Maybe I didn\u2019t capture anything, other than put into a nice fictional form some pretty cool stuff.\u201dMainly, Mason sensed that he had failed to get close enough to his protagonist. So he sought a new direction. \u201cI had gone to Brazil to research this other story \u2014 two convicts on a ship of Pedro Cabral\u2019s, mentioned in the record of his voyage as having been left on shore to learn the native language and weeping as the caravels sailed off. And I thought: Great premise, and so I went from town to town finding cool things, but I began to feel like: All I\u2019m doing is taking this history and arranging it into a more palatable form.\u201d Wishing to avoid that pitfall, Mason abandoned the Cabral story and scrubbed \u201cA Far Country\u201d clean of history and place, writing it from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl from the most rural part of an unnamed \u201cfar country.\u201d\u201cHonestly, my intent was not to try to write about the experience of a 13-year-old girl. My intent was to write about somebody torn up from the roots they come from. I think I would have felt less restraint in retrospect and would have suffered less in writing the book had I picked a gold-rush migrant. Certainly, when I was writing it, that thought came across my mind: Do I have a right to be writing this person\u2019s story? And then there was this resistant thought that said, \u2018It\u2019s a work of fiction, and it\u2019s a work of the imagination, and I\u2019m here.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe novel received a more muted reception than his first, by which time Mason was also three years into a third novel that would become \u201cThe Winter Soldier,\u201d and which, like the second, wasn\u2019t going as planned. It was vast, it was a story of the Great War, it was a novel of history that was also trying to be a novel of consciousness, it was about a psychiatrist, and it wasn\u2019t working. By 2010, \u201cit had become this huge appendage that I was constantly trying to beat into shape.\u201d Mason didn\u2019t know what to do about it and was dispirited.\u201cWhen I hadn\u2019t decided to go back to medicine, there was this existential pressure on the book to be worth existence. If this book is not expressing everything, what am I doing with my life? And if what I was attempting to do was trying to do something in the book to make life meaningful, it\u2019s a pretty tall order. And if I\u2019m going to have to survive on this financially, it had to feel meaningful to me.\u201dFate intervened. Mason, who had passed his first two medical board exams, would have to complete the third by 2011. \u201cBetween 2004 and 2010, there were months I deeply wanted to return to medicine,\u201d Mason said, \u201cand months when I felt like I could keep writing forever. But I missed medicine more than I didn\u2019t.\u201d Mason decided at last to begin residency. And then, busier than ever, Mason returned to the stalled novel and, once he began practicing psychiatry, completed it, 14 years after he began.Even so, Mason\u2019s \u201cThe Winter Soldier\u201d is a risky book, at least within contemporary letters. So much writing currently in critical favor \u2014 that of Rachel Cusk, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Ben Lerner \u2014 exploits the tension between the world on the page and the world that variously inspires those pages to reorient fiction on the author. Whereas Mason takes a resolutely old-fashioned approach by believing in historical fiction \u2014 a genre which trusts that the world and history may be seized unselfconsciously, without the author's formal uneasiness elbowing in. \u201cThe Winter Soldier\u201d is about the varieties of human suffering, which, you could say, is risky, because that\u2019s what the long literary tradition from Homer forward has always sought to illuminate: the ways in which we bring pain to others and to ourselves, even and especially as we try to show compassion. At the heart of Mason\u2019s attempt to add to that tradition is a young medical student named Lucius, son of a prominent Polish family. Mason gives us glimpses of the brutality involved in medical training and the brutality that needs to be noticed and then, by the student, negotiated:Sometimes he was called forth as Praktikant. In Neurology, he stood next to the day\u2019s patient, a seventy-two-year-old locksmith from the Italian Tyrol, with such severe aphasia that he could only mutter \u201cDa.\u201d His daughter translated the doctor\u2019s questions into Italian. As the man tried to answer, his mouth opened and closed like a baby bird. \u201cDa. Da!\u201d he said, face red with frustration, as murmurs of fascination and approval filled the hall. Driven on by the lecturer\u2019s aggressive questioning, Lucius diagnosed a tumor of the temporal lobe, trying to keep his thoughts on the science and away from how miserable he was making the old man\u2019s daughter. She had begun to cry, and she kept reaching for her father\u2019s hand. \u201cYou will stop that!\u201d his professor shouted at her, slapping her fingers. \u201cYou will disturb the learning!\u201d Lucius\u2019s face was burning. He hated the doctor for asking such questions before the daughter, and he hated himself for answering. But he also did not like feeling that he was on the side of the patient, who was inarticulate and weak. So he answered forcefully, with no compassion. His diagnosis of early brainstem herniation and the relentless destruction of the breathing centers and death, was met by rising, even thunderous, applause.Seeking experience, Lucius enlists when doctors are needed at the front, the pages devoted to his route there placing the reader deep into a very different world of expectations:The forest thinned. They passed empty fields, now scarred by war. Bomb craters, abandoned bulwarks, trenches. From a tree, something was hanging: a body, now encased almost entirely in ice. At the far end of the field lay a dark pile of what seemed like boulders, but as he drew closer, Lucius saw that they were frozen horses. There were perhaps fifty, half-covered in snow. Garish, dark-red flowers bloomed from their heads. In the shadows of the forest, he thought he saw others.What Lucius finds, once arrived at the deserted \u201chospital\u201d in the Carpathians, that hospital a bombed-out church, is a whole new medical education at the hands of the one nurse in the doctorless outpost. Margarete, a young nun, has been treating the scores of grievously wounded, undertaking amputations and triage and palliative care on her own, and Lucius will learn, or not, what caring for people in pain entails. Margarete is the heart of the book, a gloriously real creation, a mystery that Lucius wants to know, solve, save. Failures accumulate as the war wears on. A patient is brought in, one who, amid all the varieties of suffering sprawled on the floor of the church, stands out: speechless, motionless, in some kind of shock. Lucius and Margarete will try, in their very different ways, to cure him. What unfolds is a kind of parable of what it means to sit with suffering, to charm it, to bear it, the novel performing the limits of a doctor\u2019s cure. It marks an evolution in Mason\u2019s idea of a novel. Gone is information for its own sake; gone is a pure investigation of a consciousness. Kept is Mason\u2019s committedness to history, in his way.\u201cI know the book will fit under the Library of Congress designation for \u2018historical fiction,\u2019 but if you want to learn about the First World War, I think there are many better things to read than my book. So the question is: What am I bringing to it?\u201cI couldn\u2019t write honestly about psychiatry because I would risk betraying confidences. What\u2019s interesting for a novel is all the complex feelings that a doctor has. The mistakes that he makes. The bad medicine that he practices. The guilt that he feels. And I felt an additional anxiety would flow back into my life, which is taking care of people who would then be reading this novel in which there\u2019s this protopsychiatrist who feels he\u2019s doing a bad job and who needs to make mistakes to move the book.\u201dWe shouldn\u2019t mistake Mason\u2019s decision for an evasion so much as a decision about the kind of doctor he insists on trying to be and the kind of metaphysic he hopes his work will embody. Although \u201cThe Winter Soldier\u201d contains some of the most brutal moments of suffering I\u2019ve encountered in fiction, they\u2019re never there just to move the story along. They allow the reader to sit very close to someone in great pain and to listen to him. They feel entirely of a piece with the story Mason is telling, both about history and about one man\u2019s imagined personal history, a story that, for this imagined doctor, involves a great, signal failure.\u201cHis failing is that he failed to protect someone from harm, violating his oath, which is both simple and so profound in all of its implications. This idea of doing no harm.\u201dWhat if, I wondered, there were an oath for novelists?\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to be cruel in writing,\u201d Mason said, with feeling. \u201cI know there is a horrible scene in this book. But it\u2019s redeemed. I don\u2019t think I could have written it if I weren\u2019t looking for moments of lightness. Maybe what I\u2019m trying to do in the end is to create the possibility for kindness or,\u201d Mason said, after a pause, \u201cfor relief.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Ma turns 54 on Monday, which is also a holiday in China known as Teacher\u2019s Day.The retirement makes Mr. Ma one of the first founders among a generation of prominent Chinese internet entrepreneurs to step down from their companies. Firms including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com have flourished in recent years, growing to nearly rival American internet behemoths like Amazon and Google in their size, scope and ambition. For Chinese tycoons to step aside in their 50s is rare; they usually remain at the top of their organizations for many years.Mr. Ma, a natural salesman and charismatic leader, co-founded Alibaba with 17 others \u2014 some of them his students \u2014 out of his apartment in Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province in 1999.Alibaba started as an online marketplace for businesses to sell their products to other businesses. But it did not take off until it began the Taobao marketplace in 2003, which merchants used to sell goods directly to consumers. Alibaba later rolled out Alipay, an online payment service, to facilitate transactions in a country where few people had credit cards. Alipay later became Ant Financial, the financial subsidiary that Mr. Ma also controls.Today, Alibaba\u2019s empire encompasses e-commerce, online banking, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment \u2014 and even a corporate messaging service similar to Slack. The company owns or holds stakes in some of China\u2019s most important media assets, including the Twitter-like social media site Weibo and the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper The South China Morning Post.Among China\u2019s biggest companies, Alibaba is viewed as one of the firms with the deepest ranks of management talent. Many of the co-founders are still around, and professionals who joined the company later are now in charge.While Alibaba has become dominant in China, it has faced a tougher time expanding internationally. The company has increased its presence outside of China by investing in e-commerce and online finance companies in India and Southeast Asia. But its efforts to muscle into the United States largely have not been successful.As Beijing has increased its involvement in the private sector, Mr. Ma has shifted what he has said about China\u2019s government. He used to say that businesses should be in love with the government but never get married to each other, indicating that an arms-length relationship was preferred.At a conference last November, Mr. Ma was more positive. \u201cThere\u2019s no country like China in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWith political stability, social safety and 6 percent-plus economic growth, we have the best business environment.\u201dAs Alibaba has flourished, Mr. Ma has talked many times about how he did not want to spend his whole life at the company, saying he would retire one day and go back to teaching.In 2014, he created the Jack Ma Foundation, which has worked to improve education in rural China. Mr. Ma\u2019s Weibo social media handle is \u201cspokesman for village teachers \u2014 Jack Ma.\u201d Within Alibaba, he is known and referred to as \u201cTeacher Ma.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Amazon on the Brink", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "OpinionOnce a leader in protecting the region\u2019s vast forests, Brazil is now moving in the opposite direction. Supported byDr. Fearnside is an ecologist based in Brazil; Mr. Schiffman is an environmental journalist.The Trump administration is not the only government that has been busy slashing funds for environmental protection. Brazil has been doing the same.If the government\u2019s retrenchment on environmental protection continues, there may soon be nothing to stop the chain saws on the Amazonian frontier, where the rule of law can be weak and land is frequently seized and cleared illegally. This has implications beyond Brazil. The Amazon\u2019s lush forests make up the largest reserve of carbon dioxide on the surface of the earth. This potent greenhouse gas is released when forests are burned or bulldozed and left to decay.Brazilians are going to the polls on Oct. 7 to choose among nine candidates for the presidency, with a likely runoff later in the month between the top two vote-getters. The outcome will bear significantly on the future of the Amazon. The current front-runner, Jair Bolsonaro, is a climate-change skeptic who has been called \u201cthe tropical Trump.\u201d He has threatened to take Brazil out of the Paris climate accord. Another of the leading contenders, the former S\u00e3o Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad, is regarded as a moderate on the environment. Marina Silva, who as Brazil\u2019s environment minister pushed to limit deforestation and encourage sustainable development in the Amazon, is running well behind in the latest polls. Why this change in policy? The scientists put it succinctly: \u201cIn exchange for political support, the Brazilian government is signaling landholders to increase deforestation.\u201dPresident Temer\u2019s minister of justice is pushing plans to allow agribusiness to rent indigenous land that had been off limits to developers. Other proposals would effectively freeze the creation of new protected areas, open others to resource exploitation and block the mapping of boundaries of indigenous lands, potentially opening native communities and their forests to invasion by miners and ranchers. Indigenous territories contain more forest than all of the government\u2019s conservation units combined, and historically Brazil\u2019s native peoples have been far more effective in defending the rain forest than the government or private landowners.Not so long ago, Brazil was doing things right. Despite low global prices for soy and beef, the nation experienced a remarkable economic expansion while deforestation fell 60 percent from 2004 to 2007, demonstrating that environmental growth is consistent with economic growth. But now that demand for soy and beef on the global market is high, pressure on the forest is mounting. Deforestation is still well below historical highs. But that could soon change if the power of the agribusiness lobby is not checked.The ruralists came into increased prominence toward the end of the administration of the Workers Party president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and grew more powerful during the term of his successor, Dilma Rousseff. During Ms. Rousseff\u2019s presidency, which ended when she was removed from office following impeachment, amnesty was granted to landowners who had illegally cleared forests, encouraging continued lawbreaking in the world\u2019s largest rain forest.Climate change has also increased the danger of catastrophic forest fires. In dry El Ni\u00f1o years, burned areas can greatly exceed what is cleared for cattle pasture.The changing climate represents both a threat to the Amazon and a key reason for protecting its forests. Transpiration from tree leaves generates rivers of moisture in the atmosphere that act as conveyor belts bringing much-needed rain to Brazil\u2019s heavily populated south and to Argentina. S\u00e3o Paulo, which already regularly runs dangerously short of water, will be a major victim if continued deforestation removes this water vapor transport that fills the reservoirs on which the city, South America\u2019s largest, depends.The Amazon forest itself would also suffer. As more of it is cut, the huge volume of self-generated rainfall it needs to remain verdant is steadily reduced, worsening droughts made more frequent and severe by global warming. At some point \u2014 we are not sure how close we are to this critical tipping point \u2014 the entire ecosystem dries out.Brazilians have consistently said in opinion polls that they want to preserve the Amazon. But in the current atmosphere of unbridled greed and corruption in high places, the voices for wise policy are often drowned out. Brazil alone has not created the deforestation problem, and neither can it address it alone. Demand for Brazil\u2019s beef from Western nations, and increasingly from China, has created an enormous temptation to cut the forest to turn a quick profit.Only then, can we insure that the Amazonia forests, the living heart of Brazil \u2014 and of the world \u2014 will remain intact.Advertisement"}

Unfortunately, the chances are pretty good that Google will lose \u2014 that the court will order the company to make certain information harder to find. For example, if you are in the United States and you use Google to search for a New York Times article that has been removed from European versions of the search engine, that article will no longer appear in your results.We should be equally worried, however, about the prospect of platforms like Google and Facebook, with their international reach and pervasive role in our lives, doing the bidding of governments around the world.For now, very few countries are asking online platforms to enforce their national laws elsewhere. And the courts that are considering worldwide removal orders mostly sit in democratic and rights-respecting countries. That should give us some hope for better outcomes in those cases. But it also means that their decisions will carry a lot of weight, and set expectations for other national courts and lawmakers about their own power to make platforms globally remove content.Governments around the world know that while online platforms have historically enabled the free flow of information, that needn\u2019t be the case forever. Technical intermediaries can just as easily become choke points, shutting down communication on prohibited topics. Governments of any country have at least some leverage to make this happen: National internet service providers can cut off access entirely. In 2016, for example, Malaysia blocked the entire Medium blogging platform for refusing to delete a London-based journalist\u2019s accounts of corruption in the Malaysian government.That kind of showdown is rare, though.

{"Headline": "How Apple Thrived in a Season of Tech Scandals", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut this year, as it begins to roll out a new set of iPhones, the story line surrounding Apple has improbably shifted. In an era of growing skepticism about the tech industry\u2019s impact on society, Apple\u2019s business model is turning out to be its most lasting advantage.Because Apple makes money by selling phones rather than advertising, it has been able to hold itself up as a guardian against a variety of digital plagues: a defender of your privacy, an agitator against misinformation and propaganda, and even a plausible warrior against tech addiction, a problem enabled by the very irresistibility of its own devices.Though it is already more profitable than any of its rivals, Apple appears likely to emerge even stronger from tech\u2019s season of crisis. In the long run, its growing strength could profoundly alter the industry.For years, start-ups aiming for consumer audiences modeled themselves on Google and Facebook, offering innovations to the masses at rock-bottom prices, if not for free. But there are limits to the free-lunch model.If Apple\u2019s more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech\u2019s dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks.\u201cBecause of Apple\u2019s business model \u2014 because their money comes from their profitable hardware \u2014 it has been much easier for them to make certain choices and certain arguments about how to address problems in the industry,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, a technology research firm.The thrust of Apple\u2019s message is simple: Paying directly for technology is the best way to ensure your digital safety, and every fresh danger uncovered online is another reason to invest in the Apple way of life.These aren\u2019t new arguments for Apple. While Google and Facebook pursued globe-spanning scale by offering free or cheap services supported by ads, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, was warning of the risks of an internet advertising market run amok.Though their businesses keep chugging along, Facebook and Google, the world\u2019s biggest internet ad companies, now face global scrutiny for the spread of disinformation, propaganda and what critics say is their products\u2019 destabilizing effects on politics and society.Amazon is beloved by customers, but its rapid growth has spurred economywide anxieties about the future of jobs. All three behemoths are considered growing targets for antitrust prosecution in the United States and elsewhere.Apple\u2019s business model, by contrast, insulates it from most of the tech fears that have emerged in the last few years. Although it makes the vast majority of the profits in the global smartphone business, Apple\u2019s phones account for a minority of sales, blunting fears of monopoly.Apple\u2019s high prices also set up an expectation of safety, giving it a freer hand to police online properties like its app store, podcast directory and news app. A decade ago, when Mr. Jobs imposed rules on the iOS App Store banning scammy and pornographic apps, he was called a prude. Now his rules seem prescient.Its commitment to curating online experiences has also turned Apple into something like a moral arbiter for tech. When Apple decided to bar the right-wing conspiracist Alex Jones from its services this summer, it cut through much of the hand-wringing in the industry over Mr. Jones\u2019s antics. Many other tech companies immediately followed its move.Apple has not entirely escaped criticism in the Trump era. Its reliance on China, where it makes its products and expects to see much of its growth, and where its products abide by government censors, looks to be a rising liability.Even when Apple\u2019s products have been directly implicated in tech worries, its business model has helped it weather the storm. Consider the rising fears of \u201ctech addiction,\u201d the idea that kids and adults are spending too much mindless time in the digital world, egged on by tech companies\u2019 insatiable need for our eyeballs.In January, a pair of large Apple investors, Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, wrote an open letter to Apple urging the company to address the issue. Charles Penner, a partner at Jana, told me that the campaign had targeted Apple because the company had every reason to respond.\u201cThe biggest source of strength that Apple has is their ability to charge premium prices for their products,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir value depends on people feeling safe and supported within their ecosystem.\u201dAnd, in fact, Apple responded. The company told the investors that it believed the overuse of tech was a serious issue, and that it had been working on it. In the summer, it unveiled a series of widely praised features meant to allow adults to police their own and their kids\u2019 smartphone habits.Google, apparently spurred by the same campaign, offered similar features for its Android phones. Mr. Penner told me that he appreciated the companies\u2019 efforts, though he expects to keep pushing them to reduce their devices\u2019 addictiveness.Apple\u2019s safety-first business model may become only more important as technology becomes even more intimate. The company\u2019s latest phones can be unlocked with your face, while its watch includes sophisticated sensors to monitor your movements and your health. In pushing these and other advances, the company can reasonably argue that only its ad-free business can protect such sensitive information.But it is worth noting that Apple\u2019s model isn\u2019t available to everyone. In the spring, after Mr. Cook took a few swipes at Facebook\u2019s scandals, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, pointed out the inherent limits in Apple\u2019s model.Since then, Apple has raised the prices of its top-end phones, and as the smartphone market slows, the company\u2019s pristine haven from the dangers of online life might get only more expensive.Inequality is the story of our age, and it\u2019s no surprise that it could become the dominant story line of tech, too. As the digital world gets scarier, Apple\u2019s technology may come to resemble a high-priced oasis for the world\u2019s rich. Everyone else takes their chances on a free lunch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Jeff Bezos Should Push for Nobody to Get as Rich as Jeff Bezos", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtJeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world\u2019s wealthiest man, has been publicly agonizing over a vexing problem: what to do with all his money.The question of how Mr. Bezos should spend his money is a good one, but a better place to start might be: Why does he have so much money in the first place? What does his fortune tell us about the economic structure and impact of the tech industry, the engine behind his billions? And, most important, what responsibility comes with his wealth \u2014 and is it any business of ours what he does with it?The answer: Of course it\u2019s our business.In the book, Mr. Giridharadas argues that the efforts of the super-wealthy to change the world through philanthropy are often a distraction from the planet\u2019s actual problems. To truly fix the world, Mr. Bezos ought to push for policy changes that would create a more equal distribution of the winnings derived from a tech-driven economy, Mr. Giridharadas said.\u201cHe should address himself to America\u2019s deepest problems in ways that would demand sacrifice from the winners of our age \u2014 making a difference at the expense of their opportunity to make a killing,\u201d Mr. Giridharadas said.There\u2019s another way of putting this: Jeff Bezos should spend his vast fortune pushing for a society where no one can ever become as rich as Jeff Bezos is now.An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Bezos\u2019 philanthropic plans.But Mr. Bezos isn\u2019t just rich. He is growing unprecedentedly rich \u2014 rich enough that his wealth, by itself, illustrates a new economic reality.Most of Mr. Bezos\u2019 wealth is tied up in Amazon\u2019s stock, so he could well lose billions if Amazon flails. But if he does, there will probably be someone else just as megarich to take his place, because extreme concentrations of wealth are baked into the dynamics of the modern tech economy.Tech-powered businesses are often driven by an economic concept known as network effects, in which the very popularity of a service sparks even greater popularity. Amazon, for instance, keeps attracting more third-party businesses to sell goods in its store \u2014 which in turn makes it a better store for customers, which attracts more suppliers, improving the customer experience, and so on in an endless virtuous cycle. Digital businesses are also characterized by tremendous economies of scale \u2014 Amazon can create a robotic assistant once and deploy it to everyone \u2014 that further entrench concentration.\u201cWe have technology that has allowed us to create vastly more wealth for society,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Initiative on the Digital Economy. \u201cBut there\u2019s no economic law that says that these benefits will be distributed evenly \u2014 and it\u2019s worked out that some people have gotten most of the benefits and a lot of other people have been left behind.\u201dBut economics isn\u2019t destiny, he said.\u201cTechnology has led to some of this concentration, but since it makes the pie bigger, you could make everyone better off simultaneously \u2014 you could make the poor better off and the rich better off \u2014 and whether we do that is a matter of policy,\u201d he said.\u201cThey\u2019re not providing the sort of high-wage, middle-class jobs to a broad swath of individuals that we used to associate with corporate success,\u201d Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, said of Amazon and other high-flying tech firms. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is not the sharing of the productivity benefits that we used to see in the past. And that may be even more galling than the concentration of wealth.\u201dThose ideas strike me as unlikely; Mr. Bezos is a far-thinking innovator, but he has expressed little interest in near-term political questions.On the other hand, Mr. Bezos\u2019 most attractive quality, as a businessman, is his capacity for patience and surprise.\u201cThis is guy who was willing to buck what everyone else thought for so long,\u201d Mr. Giridharadas said. \u201cIf he brings that same irreverence to the question of how to give, he has the potential to interrogate himself about why it is that we need so many billionaires to save us in the first place \u2014 and what we could do to build a society that would not require Jeff Bezos to help us so much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Mystery of Amazon HQ2 Has Finalists Seeing Clues Everywhere ", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmazon announced its plans for a second headquarters a year ago on Friday. People in the 20 finalist cities are looking for any sign of a winner.Over Labor Day weekend, a club promoter who goes by the name Purple posted a photo on Instagram from the LIV nightclub in Miami. In front of a wall graffitied with names and a single \u201cLife Is Beautiful\u201d sticker, Purple\u2019s arm was casually draped over the shoulders of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon chief executive, whose pants matched the host\u2019s name. \u201cIt\u2019s the big reveal, like \u2018Who killed J.R.?\u2019\u201d said Alex Pearlstein, vice president at Market Street Services, which helps cities develop strategies to be attractive to new employers. \u201cIt\u2019s that kind of buildup.\u201dSome city and economic development officials seem tired of waiting. \u201cProbably every dinner party they go to, every neighborhood meeting, it comes up,\u201d Mr. Pearlstein said. \u201cThey probably get sick of wanting to stall\u201d when queried about the latest. Those whose cities aren\u2019t selected will be eager to move on, using what they learned in the process. Amazon\u2019s \u201cfeedback is very relevant and can help shape public policy, economic development and housing investment strategies for growing economies across the United States,\u201d Mr. Bailey said. \u201cIf Eastern time zone was a big deal for them, I can\u2019t change that. But I can help policy leaders change their work force development plans.\u201dAn Amazon spokesman said on Thursday that the company was committed to choosing a location this year. The silence on the decision \u2014 which could affect local housing and job markets, not to mention a city\u2019s culture \u2014 has led residents and even some officials to fill the information void with any scrap they can muster.Some are even acting on their hunches.Eric Fidler, a software developer, lives next to one of the sites that Washington, D.C., has proposed for the headquarters. He was so optimistic the region would be selected that he invested in three real estate companies he thought would benefit if Amazon chose the area. Then he thought he got an HQ2 crumb when he heard from a recruiter for Amazon\u2019s retail division, which doesn\u2019t have a large engineering presence locally. \u201cSome people do fantasy football,\u201d Mr. Fidler said. \u201cI prefer to speculate on Amazon.\u201dA tenuous connection, indeed. But that has proved to be no barrier for some public speculation.An earlier version of this article gave the wrong name for Washington D.C.'s governing body. It is the Council of the District of Columbia, not the District of Columbia City Council.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Money Talks. Will the G.O.P. Listen?", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySeth Klarman was once the biggest donor to the Republican Party in New England. This year he\u2019s giving some $20 million to Democrats.Ms. Weiss is a staff writer and editor for the Opinion section. BOSTON \u2014 The first page of Seth Klarman\u2019s most recent 25-page investor letter does not inspire confidence. There are quotes about truth and justice from George Orwell, Reinhold Niebuhr and Mark Twain. But the kicker is a line from Ramsay Bolton, a character from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d: \u201cIf you think this has a happy ending, you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\u201d It\u2019s not because people aren\u2019t interested in what he has to say.\u201cI\u2019m kind of a loner,\u201d Mr. Klarman said last week in his 17th-floor office close to the Boston Common. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m willing to come out of my shell and talk to you is because I think democracy is at stake. And maybe I\u2019ll be able to convince some other people of that. And get them to support Democrats in 2018.\u201dThe F.E.C. filings that will come out on Sept. 20 will show that Mr. Klarman is now giving almost exclusively Democrats \u2014 and donating far more money than he ever has.For Mr. Klarman, the logic is plain: \u201cWe need to turn the House and Senate as a check on Donald Trump and his runaway presidency.\u201dHe referred to what\u2019s going on in Washington as an \u201cemergency\u201d multiple times and suggested that the question patriots should ask themselves about the midterms is: What\u2019s the price tag for democracy? If you knew your donation would give your grandchildren a better chance of growing up in one, how much would you contribute? \u201cIt seems like the answer should be a huge amount,\u201d he said.How far? \u201cBy the election I think I\u2019ll have spent between $18 and $20 million.\u201dThat would put him among the very top Democratic donors. Brendan Quinn of the Center for Responsive Politics said: \u201cThink of it this way: As of August, George Soros has given $12 million. I have no way of knowing how much more he\u2019ll contribute this cycle, but it\u2019s entirely possible that Klarman could end up giving more than him.\u201dThere are many people who are similarly situated to Seth Klarman \u2014 wealthy, hawkish, socially liberal, fiscally conservative types who felt politically homeless long before Mr. Trump came onto the scene. Many of them, like Mr. Klarman, were alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. Many of them, like Mr. Klarman, spoke out forcefully during the campaign.But these days, thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, his Supreme Court picks and the roaring economy, they are far more inclined to dump on the president over crudo with their friends than to say anything publicly, let alone change their giving. After all, is life not better for them under this president?Mr. Klarman is mystified by this behavior.\u201cPeople should be asking themselves: Why are we writing checks to these same people who are cowards?\u201d His message to such people: \u201cPlease join me.\u201d Is Mr. Klarman concerned that he\u2019s helping the Democratic Party even as it moves well to the left of his political comfort zone? \u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019m actually excited about somebody like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez coming along because it\u2019s a way of younger people and people of color and people who are different finding their voice and being part of the process,\u201d he said. But he waved off the idea that democratic socialism is on the march. \u201cPeople call themselves democratic socialists. I don\u2019t even know what that means,\u201d he said. \u201cSocialism is not the answer to anyone\u2019s problems.\u201dAs for Republicans, he said, they \u201cwere supposed to be the fiscally responsible party.\u201d But they\u2019re running a trillion-dollar deficit and have given a huge tax cut \u201clargely to rich people.\u201d He added, \u201cWhatever irresponsible fiscal things the Democrats do won\u2019t be worse than what the Republicans have already done.\u201dWhat if it came down to a choice between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders? While a President Sanders would be \u201cappalling,\u201d he says Mr. Sanders is \u201cnot unhinged\u201d and so he would pull the lever for him.Mr. Klarman\u2019s hoping, though, the Democrats hew close to the center.\u201cThe Republicans have abandoned the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats should seize that and plant their flags right there and win.\u201dWinning is the thing that matters to Mr. Klarman more than anything. Including his business. \u201cMe giving this interview could conceivably upset a few of my clients,\u201d he told me. \u201cI love all my clients. I want them to stay as clients. But it\u2019s more important that I do what my conscience requires by speaking out.\u201d\u201cThere are things more important than making money.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The fallout was inescapable: Nearly one in three homes went into foreclosure.Today, the community of North Las Vegas, encompassing the 89031 ZIP code, is the model of the recovery that has swept the nation. The economy is growing, companies are hiring, and the housing market is hot, with this suburban enclave spreading farther into the Mojave Desert.But the recovery has been uneven.Steady growth across the country has lifted the stock market and corporate profits. Those gains, though, haven\u2019t filtered down to most workers. Incomes have barely budged, and consumer debt is increasing again.Housing prices in North Las Vegas are rising so fast that many communities are no longer affordable. Much of the new construction is at the high end, keeping out many first-time homeowners. Some cannot come up with money for a down payment, while others are wary of getting back into a market that once burned them.For many, the American dream is now out of reach. It is increasingly a nation of renters.She bought a three-bedroom house in 2006 with her husband. But she couldn\u2019t keep up on the payments on the mortgage, a subprime loan with ballooning interest rates. She filed for personal bankruptcy, lost the home and got divorced.She tried to buy a home a few miles away, on a property with a rent-to-own option, and put down $3,000 upfront. The deal went bad when she couldn\u2019t get a mortgage, and she lost the down payment.It\u2019s in a safe neighborhood where private security guards patrol at night. But the new owner, an out-of-state investor, just raised the rent by a few hundred dollars and demanded an additional $1,000 for the security deposit.A mother of four, Ms. Guthrie, 51, didn\u2019t have much choice. Her 15-year-old daughter is in a top high school, and she didn\u2019t want to jeopardize her placement by moving out of the neighborhood.Ms. Guthrie, who works at a souvenir distribution company, isn\u2019t planning on buying again. For her, the foreclosure is still too fresh. \u201cHow do you build wealth?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy views on homeownership have changed.\u201dThe first owner bought the house for $400,000 in 2005, taking out more than $1.3 million in loans to acquire the property and three others. She ended up losing all of them in foreclosure and filing for bankruptcy.The damage from the housing crisis \u2014 a toxic combination of frenzied buying, rampant construction, predatory lending and investment excess \u2014 was extensive. Of the 23,000 single-family homes in the 89031 ZIP code, more than 7,500 have had at least one foreclosure since 2006, according to Attom Data Solutions.Foreclosures in 89031 since 2006\u00a0Source: Attom Data SolutionsEdge of 89031 ZIP codeWEST ANN ROADWEST LONE MOUNTAIN ROADNORTH LAS VEGASForeclosures in 89031 since 2006\u00a0Source: Attom Data SolutionsWEST ANN ROADWEST LONE MOUNTAIN ROADEdge of 89031NORTH LAS VEGASForeclosures in 89031 since 2006that went into foreclosure.Edge of89031NORTH LAS VEGASSource: Attom Data SolutionsSandra L.

Some 10,000 liens were placed on homes here by creditors when owners failed to pay bills.She went to court without a lawyer, and lost the case with the homeowner association. \u201cI am still sick to my stomach to this day,\u201d said Ms. Francescon, 59. \u201cThe thing that threw me off is the bank kept saying everything was still in good standing.\u201dLike many in the same situation, she was forced to move elsewhere. Ms. Francescon now lives in Illinois.Big, Wall Street-backed firms and small players picked up homes by the thousands at bank foreclosures for well under $100,000. The investor who bought the house on Osiana Avenue after Ms. Francescon paid just $6,000.The bargains are now gone.Prices are up more than 135 percent from the depths of the crisis in North Las Vegas, rising almost three times as fast as the national average, according to the analytics firm Black Knight.The sisters, both in their 20s, were tired of throwing away their money.

Two running themes throughout the ceremony \u2014 prompting speculation long before the night kicked off \u2014 were the growing role streaming services have played in recent years and the intensifying push for diversity in casting and directing.This year, Netflix led the pack with 112 nominations and ended HBO\u2019s 17-year streak as the most nominated platform. In the end, Netflix and HBO called it a tie; both came away with 23 Emmys each. HBO claimed the top prize when \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d won for best drama. But it was Amazon that won for best comedy series for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d one of five awards the show received at the ceremony.Notably, this year the Emmys boasted the most diverse group of nominees in its history \u2014 as those who watched the program were reminded a number of times. \u201cYes indeedy, one step closer to a black Sheldon,\u201d joked Kenan Thompson of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d referring to the lead character in \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201dComedians and presenters throughout the evening were quick to mock premature back-patting on inclusion and sexual harassment. A whimsical but pointed musical segment opened the show: \u201cWe solved it!\u201d Kate McKinnon and Mr. Thompson sang. Throughout the number they were joined by Sterling K. Brown, Tituss Burgess, Kristen Bell, Ricky Martin and John Legend. (The actual point was: They have not solved it.)Amid the ceremonies, one unscripted moment nearly stole the whole show: The director Glenn Weiss \u2014 who won in the variety special category for directing last year\u2019s Oscars \u2014 drew stunned cheers and an outpouring on social media when he proposed to his girlfriend live on stage.

{"Headline": "Stealing From a Cashierless Store (Without You, or the Cameras, Knowing It)", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA start-up uses visual tracking and behavioral data to operate a new San Francisco market, which lets shoppers walk out unimpeded. And sometimes mischarged.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One recent afternoon, the city\u2019s newest grocery market was trying to figure out whether I would buy, steal or leave behind a bag of white Cheddar popcorn \u2014 and so was I.On its side: 27 cameras along the ceiling and a wealth of behavioral data.On my side: crippling indecision. Five of the seven founders came from the Securities and Exchange Commission, where they built artificial intelligence software to detect fraud and trade violations, before starting Standard Cognition in 2017. Now these fraud experts are working to discern something equally complicated: whether I am stealing a snack.The goal is to predict, and prevent, shoplifting, because unlike Amazon\u2019s Go stores, which have a subway turnstile-like gate for entry and exit, Standard Market has an open door, and the path is clear.Once the system decides it has detected potential theft behavior, a store attendant will get a text and walk over for \u201ca polite conversation,\u201d Mr. Suswal said.Predicting theft requires a lot of data about shoppers, much of which does not exist yet \u2014 \u201cor at least no one is willing to give it to us,\u201d he said.So a few days before Standard Market opened, Standard Cognition hired 100 actors to shop there for four hours. In Japan, the team has worked with a convenience store chain, whose name it has not disclosed, in a very useful data collection effort.\u201cThey all talk about new services, making shopping more fun, making it worthwhile to shop offline,\u201d Mr. Suswal said.And they talk about data. While a store owner can look at receipts to see who bought a generic ketchup, cashierless technology can help tell if the shopper first picked up a Heinz bottle and how long he or she looked at it. Basically, now an owner can see what a customer did not buy. On a recent Friday, a line stretched down the street from Standard Market as a bouncer at the door took in one shopper at a time for the automated experience. The store is in San Francisco\u2019s gentrifying Mid-Market neighborhood, between Chanvi Eatery, a Pakistani restaurant, and Huckleberry Bicycles, a high-end bike shop. People outside were downloading the app and typing in their credit card numbers.Walking out was Yoshimasa Takahashi, 32, who works nearby in finance. A receipt popped up on his phone. It said he had bought noodles and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese \u2014 except, he had not bought the Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. \u201cI was playing with it but didn\u2019t take it out,\u201d Mr. Takahashi said, smiling at his win over the tech. The bouncer gave him a refund.Inside, Rebecca Schiffman, 28, was working the floor. She had been an employee at Whole Foods when the Standard Cognition team recruited her. She liked the idea of getting out from behind a cash register and said she was unfazed about having to intervene with potential shoplifters.\u201cI used to do that all the time anyway,\u201d she said. To shop, I opened my phone, which flashed blue, letting the store know I had entered. I wandered, throwing items into my tote. Then I left.Outside I found Mr. Suswal. A minute went by, and a notification popped up on my phone with my receipt: one white Cheddar popcorn and one roll of toilet paper for a total of $1.19. In fact, I had left with two bags of popcorn. I had toyed with the second bag, debated buying it, considered my dinner plans, put it back and finally took it with a quick impulsive grab. The system missed it.\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Suswal said. And yet it did. He shrugged and said I had won it.But for now it\u2019s not quite good enough. And I'm covered in crumbs.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren on Big Banks and the Democratic Party: 5 Takeaways", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts positioned herself as an alternative to the standard-bearers of the Democratic Party, refusing to classify herself within the party during an hourlong interview on Thursday.And while she brushed off a question asking if she was running in 2020, she offered a glimpse into what such a platform could hold.Here are the takeaways.As speculation mounts over whether Ms. Warren will enter the presidential race in 2020, she was asked where she sees herself within her own party.She argued that her economic views \u2014 like raising the minimum wage, expanding Social Security and regulating big banks \u2014 are ones that most Americans share. She places herself \u201cright in the middle of America,\u201d she said.\u201cHow I see this is, this is a lot less about political parties and a lot more about where America is,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThere are issues on which we are divided. I understand that. But on these core economic set of issues, America is a progressive country.\u201dIs it unfair to argue that she has shifted her views compared with where she had initially established herself within the larger party?\u201cThis is who I\u2019ve been all along,\u201d Ms. Warren said.Ms. Warren was withering in her criticism of Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s former chief economic adviser.\u201cWhat he did was help Goldman Sachs,\u201d she said, adding that the tax overhaul that he helped push through last year saved corporations billions of dollars.What angered Ms. Warren the most, she said, was imagining the response of the American people.\u201cIs he working for us,\u201d she imagined someone thinking, \u201cOr is he working for Goldman, or is he just working for himself?\u201dMs. Warren said that she had spoken to the Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer \u2014 who is said to be considering a presidential bid in 2020 \u2014 and told him she did not support his efforts to impeach the president. Instead, she is intent on protecting the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.The investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s election interference \u201chas resulted in more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas already,\u201d she said.\u201cI want protection for the special prosecutor,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time Donald Trump starts tweeting again or attacks someone else in government, I get very worried about the special prosecutor.\u201dWhat Congress could do, Ms. Warren said, is pass a law that says the special counsel cannot be fired by the president.\u201cOnce the investigation is completed,\u201d she said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll know what we have in front of us.\u201dAs tech giants like Facebook and Apple come under continued scrutiny by Congress, Ms. Warren weighed in on the subject, stating that the issue was more about their anti-competitive business models and less about \u201cbreaking up\u201d big companies.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick one business or the other,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting a huge competitive advantage from being a platform provider because of all this information you\u2019ve been scraping, then we no longer have competition going on.\u201dMs. Warren, who has been the target of the president\u2019s name-calling on Twitter, offered a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s taunts.\u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t going to change. But he\u2019s not going to change me, either,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the fights I\u2019m in and I\u2019m going to stay in them. But I stay in them not because of him, I stay in them because of the people and the urgency I feel in this moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The current head of Disney and ABC\u2019s television group, Ben Sherwood, will leave the company at some point after the Fox deal is closed, according to a person familiar with his decision.Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, will be in charge of most of Disney\u2019s television properties. Dana Walden, currently the co-chief executive of the Fox Television Group, is expected to have a high-ranking role at Disney. She will most likely oversee, among several things, ABC\u2019s entertainment executives, according to two people familiar with the plan.Fox, meanwhile, will likely forge a new identity once it loses its television studio after the deal with Disney closes.Mr. Greenblatt\u2019s departure had been talked about in Hollywood during the Emmy Awards party circuit just over a week ago. At the time, through multiple representatives, Mr. Greenblatt denied he was leaving, though he was actually negotiating his exit.But if his departure is not a surprise, the suddenness is. His last day is Monday, the same day the 2018-19 television season begins. He will be replaced by two people: Paul Telegdy, a president and the head of reality programming at NBC, and George Cheeks, a rising star at the company. They take over on Tuesday.Mr. Greenblatt, 58, said his decision was some time in the making, even though he signed a new contract a year ago.\u201cYou do get weary in these jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the daily changes that go on, you\u2019re constantly reconfiguring the business. I\u2019m just really excited about doing something. Whatever I do will be some new challenge.\u201dMr. Greenblatt arrived at NBC after overseeing the entertainment division at Showtime. NBC at the time was still licking its wounds after its disastrous decision to abandon its 10 p.m. time slot for a daily Jay Leno show. That had severely limited the number of dramas that NBC could develop in any given year, and it took years to undo the damage. NBC\u2019s comedy lineup, once the backbone of the network, had a pair of hits in \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Office,\u201d but the coffers were otherwise bare.\u201cWe were in a complete rebuilding phase, and everything had fallen apart,\u201d Mr. Greenblatt told The New York Times in an interview two years ago.It was a slog. As early as May 2015, rumors circulated that Mr. Greenblatt was done. At NBC\u2019s 2015 upfront presentation for advertisers, Jimmy Fallon, \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d host, said to Mr. Greenblatt as he was exiting the stage: \u201cWe\u2019re all going to miss you, buddy. You had a good run.\u201dStephen Burke, the head of NBC Universal, said in an interview that discussions with Mr. Greenblatt about his departure had been going on for some time.\u201cWe\u2019ve talked over the last couple of years, very openly, and he would say, \u2018Geez, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Burke said.Mr. Burke complimented Mr. Greenblatt on the \u201cbrilliant\u201d job he had done at NBC, and said it was a testament that his successors were both being promoted from within.\u201cThe good news is he\u2019s built a really good team and we didn\u2019t look outside,\u201d he said. \u201cWe picked two guys who are proven commodities in our company.\u201dMr. Telegdy, 47, is the person largely credited with bringing \u201cThe Voice\u201d to NBC, and being in charge of the strongest reality lineup in the business. In addition to \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d NBC broadcasts \u201cEllen\u2019s Game of Games\u201d and \u201cLittle Big Shots.\u201dMr. Cheeks, 53, has been at NBC since 2012 and is a co-president of Universal Cable Productions. Many in Hollywood assumed he was the heir apparent to Bonnie Hammer\u2019s vast NBC Universal cable empire.Mr. Burke said Mr. Greenblatt had recommended that they take over for him, and \u201cthat\u2019s what I was planning on doing anyway.\u201dAs for his future, Mr. Greenblatt did indicate he\u2019s not done with show business. He said he\u2019d be open to a new job, including at a streaming platform.\u201cI love the idea of running a company,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a broadcast network at this point.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What China Can Teach the U.S. About Artificial Intelligence ", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVisionary research is no longer the most important element of progress.Mr. Lee is a venture capitalist and former artificial intelligence researcher.Every technology goes through an age of discovery and an age of implementation. During the age of discovery, the critical work takes place in research laboratories, where scientists make the breakthroughs that move the field forward. During the age of implementation, the technology reaches a point of practical utility and begins spilling out of the lab and into the world.Over the past decade, I\u2019ve watched firsthand as the field of artificial intelligence has transitioned from one phase to the other. The 1980s and 1990s were a period of discovery in A.I., one that I participated in through my research on speech recognition at Carnegie Mellon University and Apple. More recently, I participated in the implementation phase through my work as the head of Google China and as an early investor in the Chinese mobile internet.This movement from discovery to implementation marks a significant shift in A.I.\u2019s center of gravity \u2014 away from the United States and toward China. The age of discovery relied heavily on innovation coming out of the United States, which excels at visionary research and moonshot projects. The country\u2019s freewheeling intellectual environment, unparalleled network of research universities and traditional openness to immigrants (such as myself) have for decades made it an incubator for big ideas in A.I.A.I. implementation, however, plays to a different set of strengths, many of which are manifested in China: abundant data, a hypercompetitive business landscape and a government that actively adapts public infrastructure with A.I. in mind. China also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products. This process, which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge, has driven the market capitalization of many Chinese tech companies far beyond that of the American peers they were once accused of \u201ccopying.\u201dVisionary research will always be important to A.I., which means that China still has much to learn from the United States. But as practical implementation increasingly becomes the name of the game, the United States now has much to learn from China, too.What emerges from these enormous data flows is a multidimensional picture of each Chinese user, which allows A.I. companies to better tailor their services. Silicon Valley companies are working on similar products, but the data at their disposal is largely limited to online activities: Google searches, YouTube views, Amazon purchases and Facebook likes.With regard to its competitive business ecosystem for A.I., China\u2019s advantage is frequently mischaracterized by Western analysts who view Chinese technology as built largely on intellectual property theft. This misunderstanding reflects a difference in cultural attitudes over a perfectly legal form of copying: imitating a successful business model and then tweaking it.In Silicon Valley, there is substantial stigma attached to imitating the business models or features of other companies. Doing so violates the \u201cthink different\u201d ethos associated with innovators like Steve Jobs. The result is that pioneers often go unchallenged for long periods, allowed to dominate the industry even though they don\u2019t explore or exploit all of their technology\u2019s possibilities.In contrast, Chinese entrepreneurs have few qualms about imitating what works. Once a concept is proved to have traction, dozens or even hundreds of other companies rush into the industry, setting off a ferocious fight for survival. The result is analogous to natural selection in evolution: All the companies start from the same branch on the family tree, but they make mutations in their product or business model to gain an edge. The companies with tweaked products that work well survive and grow, while businesses that are slow to adapt perish.You can see this clearly in how the sharing economy developed in China. After companies like Uber and DiDi proved the viability of ride sharing, China\u2019s start-up world tried out every possible iteration of it: shared basketballs, shared umbrellas, shared bicycles, shared mobile phone chargers. Most of these efforts died quickly, but those that survived \u2014 including a handful of the strongest shared-bike start-ups \u2014 turned into multibillion-dollar companies and revolutionized urban transport in just a couple of years.Finally, there is the question of the Chinese government\u2019s support of A.I. In the simplistic story often told in the United States, Chinese bureaucrats in the central government pick winners among the companies, load them up with enormous subsidies and then protect them from foreign competition. But this account fundamentally misunderstands how the Chinese government is encouraging A.I. implementation.The Chinese government understands that as A.I. moves from affecting the purely digital world to the physical one, public infrastructure and institutions will have to change. If we want autonomous cars to reduce accidents, we may need to embed sensors in our roads. If we want A.I.-powered diagnosis to spot cancer earlier, we may need hospital administrators to develop data-sharing agreements that protect privacy while also allowing research to be conducted. These are decisions that entail a degree of risk for public actors, particularly in a highly combative political environment where every misstep becomes fodder for the opposition.In declaring A.I. to be a top national priority, Beijing has sent a signal to local officials that they will be rewarded for fostering this kind of A.I. infrastructure. The Chinese model isn\u2019t based on top-down orders or limitless subsidies; it\u2019s based on encouraging local officials to make the changes needed in their area so that private A.I. companies can develop products that can actually be used.Am I arguing that China now has the recipe for A.I. success? Not at all. The fact that the field is shifting from discovery to implementation does not mean that discovery no longer matters. Indeed, with many problems in A.I., it is unclear which approach is best.Consider an A.I.-powered product like fully autonomous vehicles. Technology companies in both countries are still feverishly chasing the dream of the large-scale deployment of cars that drive themselves far better than any human could. Who wins this race is likely to depend on whether the main obstacle turns out to be a matter of core technology or simply execution details. If it\u2019s technical \u2014 major improvements in core algorithms \u2014 then the advantage goes to the United States. If it\u2019s implementation \u2014 smart infrastructure or policy adaptation \u2014 then the advantage goes to China.At this point, we don\u2019t know which it will be, but we do know that each country can improve its odds of success by learning from the other\u2019s strengths. Chinese researchers, start-ups and A.I. companies should let their imaginations run a little wilder, placing long-term bets that give them a chance of breaking new ground rather than playing catch-up. At the same time, American companies should embrace the less glamorous business of relentlessly developing variations on a proven concept. And American policymakers could move away from a hands-off stance toward A.I., looking instead to actively adapt the nation\u2019s physical structures and public institutions to better mesh with new technology.If both countries can make these shifts in perspective, then what might look like a zero-sum battle for A.I. supremacy between China and the United States will begin to resemble something totally different: an opportunity to learn across cultures and collectively advance the global project of building A.I. that improves human lives.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Are Robots Coming for Your Job? Eventually, Yes.", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBitsGreetings from the real economy. I\u2019m Steve Lohr, a tech reporter for The Times, and I tend to focus on the effects of technology beyond Silicon Valley. No question, the Valley is a wellspring of innovation and home to the ascendant digital corporate giants, both feared and admired. But it\u2019s just a sliver of the $20 trillion American economy.Technology is only a tool in service of greater ends, and those ends presumably extend beyond creating billionaires and enriching investors. The larger agenda, in economic terms, includes growth, productivity, living standards and jobs.Let\u2019s take one of those economic ingredients \u2014 jobs.Forecasts of technology\u2019s impact on jobs run the spectrum from apocalyptic to sanguine, depending largely on the pace of progress in artificial intelligence. But there is a consistency to the serious research on the coming course of automation: In the near term, occupations are more likely to be transformed by digital technology than destroyed by it.The work of the future, it seems clear, is going to be digitally inflected. Software skills are increasingly essential to every field. Most tech workers no longer work in the tech industry, and that trend is accelerating.These efforts are typically not far along yet, but the ones that seem to work best are collaborations \u2014 public-private partnerships that also involve nonprofit organizations and educational institutions.A new project adopting the collaborative model was announced this month in New Haven. The goal, said Gov. Dannel Malloy, is \u201ccultivating the tech work force talent of tomorrow.\u201d The new venture aims to double the number of software engineering graduates in Connecticut over the next several years.Its educational partner is a college-alternative start-up, the Holberton School. Founded in 2015 in San Francisco, Holberton offers a two-year program to create software engineers. Its graduates now work for companies like Apple, IBM, Dropbox and Tesla. The school charges no tuition, but graduates who get jobs pay the school 17 percent of their salaries for three years.After the Connecticut announcement, I caught up with Holberton\u2019s founders, Julien Barbier and Sylvain Kalache, both alumni of Silicon Valley companies. Their school is designed around projects and peer learning with mentors, but no formal teachers.Technical skills are only part of the program. Writing white papers, project reviews and public speaking are also emphasized. Critical thinking, teamwork and learning to learn are the higher-order skills.Technology changes too fast, Mr. Barbier said, for expertise in a particular set of software tools to be a lasting asset in the labor market.\u201cIn two years, you do learn a craft that is in demand,\u201d said Mr. Barbier, Holberton\u2019s chief executive. \u201cBut this is really about self-learning. If you can train yourself, you\u2019re never going to obsolete.\u201dIn San Francisco, Holberton has enrolled a total of 300 students since it opened its doors two years ago and, with added space, hopes to bring in 1,000 students a year before long. At the New Haven school, which begins next year, Holberton plans to start with 30 to 50 students and then expand rapidly.Its model has made encouraging progress.

The company wants the devices to be easier to set up out of the box and for other companies that make kitchen appliances \u2014 from rice makers to ovens \u2014 to tap into the Alexa platform.\u201cWhen we imagine a future with thousands of devices like this, this is going to become essential,\u201d Mr. Limp said.The microwave was perhaps the cheekiest in a blizzard of announcements at the event inside Amazon\u2019s headquarters.\u201cWe took advantage of the hands-free moments,\u201d Tom Taylor, senior vice president of Alexa, said in an interview. \u201cHow do we continue to expand? Where else are those opportunities?\u201dSo far, Amazon\u2019s answer appears to be \u201ceverywhere.\u201dThe company has a long history of introducing products and services at a rapid clip, in sharp contrast to competitors like Apple, which focuses on a few very refined releases at a time. Some of Amazon\u2019s ideas work, like its Kindle e-reader, and the company keeps building on them. But many of them fail, like its Fire smartphone, and the company quickly drops them.On Thursday, Mr. Limp also introduced an Echo Auto that plugs into cars; Fire TV Recast, a DVR recording device that lets users record live TV and watch on a variety of devices; and an analog wall clock with a voice-controlled timer.Another suite of devices announced on Thursday is aimed to appeal to audiophiles. Echo devices can now be used for individual left and right channels, meaning a pair can create stereo sound. And the new Echo Sub provides rich bass sounds, which Mr. Limp showed by booming Lorde\u2019s \u201cRoyals.\u201d The new Echo Input is the first Echo device without a speaker so users can connect their speakers to the brain of the Alexa.Since it introduced its Alexa smart assistant four years ago, the company has not shied from trying out new forms and uses. First it had an Echo speaker, a tall cylinder, then an Echo Dot, a version the size of a hockey puck. Then it added a screen, too, with the Echo Show. At the same time, developers wrote thousands of apps \u2014 or skills \u2014 for the devices. There are now more than 50,000 skills.The strategy helped Amazon quickly take the lead in the voice-controlled device market \u2014 a market it practically created. But it now has some stiff competition.A device from Google, the Home Mini, is now the top-selling smart speaker worldwide, Strategy Analytics, a research firm, wrote in a report this week. Google offers fewer types of devices, but has an advantage because millions of customers already have access to its voice assistant through the smartphones that use its Android operating system. Apple has also introduced its own high-priced voice-controlled speaker, focused on pristine audio quality, which Amazon looks to now be challenging head-on.\u201cThe earlier days were more inventing on behalf of customers,\u201d said Mr. Taylor. \u201cNow we have a chance to invent by listening to customers.\u201dThe announcements Thursday show Amazon trying to flood the field, not just with its own devices but with products intended to model a way for outside manufacturers to build off Alexa\u2019s interface.\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming \u2014 that\u2019s the risk for the consumer,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. \u201cThey have been so early in the market that they need to make sure the geeks that jump into the smart home early have something, but at the same time, they need to make it really simple for people who haven\u2019t yet.\u201dNot all of the announcements were products. Amazon introduced new ways Alexa will try to anticipate the needs of users, not just respond to questions. The Alexa Hunches function, which will be public later this year, tries to provide suggestions; for instance, if a user says good night to Alexa, the voice assistant might note that a porch light is on and offer to turn it off.And users can turn on Alexa Guard when they leave their home, and the device will notify them if it detects a smoke alarm alert or the sound of a burglar smashing a window.Amazon also said users would no longer need to sign up individual skills to use them. Instead, they will be able to speak to Alexa, which will automatically pick the best skill.\u201cThat was a big barrier, you learning how to talk to Alexa versus Alexa learning how you speak, which is how it should be,\u201d Ms. Milanesi said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an Amazon voice assistant function that anticipates users\u2019 needs. It is Alexa Hunches, not Alexa Hunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Secret to Keeping a School Supplies Store Open in the Amazon Era", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA young clerk handed Ali Annunziato, a high school gym teacher in East Flatbush, a set of butterfly-shaped paper cutouts. \u201cWow!\u201d exclaimed Ms. Annunziato. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I was looking for!\u201d The excited teacher, visiting the store for the first time, said she would use the cutouts for decorating one of her bulletin boards.\u201cThey have literally everything I was going to buy on Amazon in one little shop,\u201d Ms. Annunziato said, though she later noted that her bill was more expensive than what she would have paid online.According to Francis Teri, the store owner and a Midwood native, Amazon \u2014 and online ordering in general \u2014 is why most teaching supply stores have closed in recent years. \u201cThere used to be over 3,000 of us across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re about 300.\u201dBut, Mr. Teri argued, \u201cfewer stores get more business.\u201d And because he owns the building, he said, he doesn\u2019t have to pay the rent. \u201cI know the landlord,\u201d he said.\u201cI wanted to be a teacher,\u201d said Ms. Sellick, an employee since 1999. But by the time she had finished raising her two children, she felt it was too late to get a teaching degree. \u201cBut this is the next best thing,\u201d she said.Ms. Sellick prides herself on knowing her regular customers on a first-name basis. And she makes sure to listen to their requests to keep the store\u2019s inventory up to date, especially the bulletin board sets. \u201cEvery year, they look for new themes, new decorations to hang up in their classrooms,\u201d she said. Apparently, there is a strong demand for confetti patterns this year; last year, superheroes were in high demand.Trina Crawford, who teaches first graders at a public school in Mill Basin, stayed with last year\u2019s trend, loading up her basket with cutouts of Marvel superheroes. \u201cI always like to have new things at the beginning of the year,\u201d she said.A frequent customer, Ms. Crawford comes to the store between five and 10 times a year. \u201cIt\u2019s trendy, and it has everything that I need,\u201d she said.One customer seemed to be here almost reluctantly: Mya Sergeant, a seventh-grader from Bushwick, who\u2019d accompanied her father.Asked if she was enjoying the store, Mya shrugged. \u201cI just came here for a mini dictionary,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paying Is Voluntary at This Selfie-Friendly Store", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst there was self-checkout. Then Amazon\u2019s cashier-free Go stores. Now there\u2019s pay when you feel like it \u2014 we trust you.At Drug Store, a narrow, black-and-white-tiled store that opened Wednesday in Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca neighborhood, there is no cashier or checkout counter. Anyone can walk in, grab a $10.83 activated-charcoal drink and leave.In the store, customers are expected to text Dirty Lemon to say they have grabbed something. A representative will then text back with a link to enter their credit card information, adding, \u201cLet us know if you need anything else.\u201dZak Normandin, the company\u2019s chief executive, said he was not worried that Drug Store\u2019s honor system would encourage theft. \u201cI do think a majority of people would feel very guilty for continuing to steal,\u201d he said in a recent interview at the store.When asked how much money Dirty Lemon was willing to lose to theft, Mr. Normandin demurred, noting that the company would write down any losses as sampling costs.Founded in 2015, Dirty Lemon counts 100,000 customers, around half of whom order at least a case of six beverages each month. Its high prices, text-message ordering and beauty claims are helping it get attention in a business littered with new health-focused drink brands. Dirty Lemon\u2019s \u201csleep tonic\u201d contains magnesium, a \u201cbeauty elixir\u201d drink features collagen, and an anti-aging drink contains rose water.The company is closing a round of venture capital funding from celebrities and investors, including Winklevoss Capital, Betaworks and the investment fund of the YouTube stars Jake Paul and Cameron Dallas.Mr. Normandin said his conviction in Dirty Lemon\u2019s store was so strong that he had already made plans to open another one in New York and two more in other cities, all featuring a separate V.I.P. lounge with a bar and special events. The company has shifted almost all of its $4 million annual digital advertising budget into its retail stores.Dirty Lemon is forging ahead into brick-and-mortar stores when many traditional retailers are closing locations and investing in digital marketing and e-commerce. But Mr. Normandin said his customers, who are mainly young women, were tired of digital marketing that constantly pushed them to buy things. Rather, he said, they seek unique in-person experiences.\u201cThey want to actually be kind of immersed in a brand, and take it all in, and maybe take a picture,\u201d he said.Dirty Lemon\u2019s Drug Store features a large, selfie-friendly mirror that reflects a wall of coolers and stark, black-and-white-striped penny tiles creeping across the high ceiling.Mr. Normandin said his company\u2019s plans went beyond lemon drinks and selfie mirrors to transforming the beverage industry\u2019s distribution methods. The company aspires to \u201crebuild the infrastructure that has powered beverages since the 1800s,\u201d he said.That will take a lot of text messages.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Plan to Reach 500 Million Indians: Speak Their Language", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 Only 10 percent of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people know English. Yet most of the country\u2019s e-commerce services have been offered only in English, closing off online shopping to the vast majority of people here.Now Amazon is aiming to break through that language barrier. The e-commerce giant on Tuesday offered a hearty \u201cnamaste\u201d to this country\u2019s half a billion Hindi speakers by making its local website and apps available in India\u2019s most popular language. Users of the India site or app will be able to choose Hindi as their preferred language, much as American users can choose Spanish.Amazon\u2019s expansion into Hindi \u2014 its first foray into an Indian language, even as other companies have tried that strategy and pulled back \u2014 is vital to the company\u2019s ambition of making India its next big market.\u201cThe next 100 million customers will have to be in the vernacular language,\u201d said Kishore Thota, director of customer experience and marketing for Amazon India.Mr. Thota said the company\u2019s research found that eight in 10 Indian customers would prefer to shop in a language other than English. \u201cThe level of trust increases when they see something in their own language,\u201d he said in an interview at Amazon\u2019s India headquarters in Bangalore.If the Hindi versions of its site and apps are successful, Amazon plans to quickly add options to shop in other major Indian languages, such as Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu, which are dominant in regions outside the Hindi belt in the north.Amazon is betting that the market is more ready now, especially as cheap mobile data means that Indian-language speakers are coming online at a brisk clip.Paytm, a digital payments company that operates the No. 3 online retailer, Paytm Mall, began allowing customers to make purchases in 10 Indian languages in October. About 15 percent of the site\u2019s customers do that, said Amit Sinha, who heads the digital marketplace.But most of Paytm\u2019s listings are still in English. Converting them to other languages requires Paytm to build new automated translation tools as well as to persuade sellers and brands to translate their own content. \u201cIt\u2019s a multidimensional problem,\u201d Mr. Sinha said.For Amazon, creating a Hindi-language site and app was difficult from the start. When the company began building its Hindi app and site about two years ago, it first tried to run the English version through a translation algorithm. The result \u201cwas completely illegible,\u201d Mr. Thota said.So the team went back to the drawing board, tapping people to translate key listings and steps in the purchase process into colloquial Hindi. They then showed samples to actual and potential customers, refined them and used the final versions to train the algorithms to do mass translation.Not everything has been translated yet, and Amazon is working with leading brands to convert their pages. People are also reviewing pages to make sure they look right, since there is often more than one way to translate an English phrase into Hindi.One challenge is that spoken Hindi mixes in a lot of English. Amazon decided that some words and phrases, like \u201cfree,\u201d \u201cjeans\u201d and \u201ccash on delivery,\u201d should be kept in English but written using Hindi\u2019s Devanagari script.Most of the 390 million Indians with internet access use it to chat with friends and family, watch videos, listen to music, look for religious content and read the news, the study found. Just 40 percent transact online, and about one-third of those stop after one purchase.Roopa Kudva, who heads Omidyar\u2019s operations in India, said that buying something online is the last step in the journey of a new internet user.\u201cIndians are very comfortable experimenting on the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the moment it comes to making payments online, people think it\u2019s a very sophisticated thing that requires expert knowledge, and they shy away from it.\u201dWhile being able to shop in a familiar language is important, she said, many of the global conventions of online shopping, such as the shopping cart, are unfamiliar to Indians, who are more used to going to a store and asking a shopkeeper to pull items from a shelf.Amazon said it realized that the Hindi version of its site would not suddenly solve those problems.\u201cIt will make people feel a lot more comfortable that we understand them,\u201d said Amit Agarwal, the head of Amazon India. \u201cBut we are focused on all the barriers that will ultimately transform how India buys and sells.\u201dFor example, Amazon offers customer support in half a dozen Indian languages, and today, more than half the queries are in languages other than English.The company has also signed up about 14,000 retail locations across India for its Amazon Easy program, in which a local shopkeeper helps customers place Amazon orders, receives packages and then delivers them. \u201cThey provide basic customer service in a language the customer understands,\u201d Mr. Thota said.Google is also considering a move into e-commerce in India. It recently invested in the Chinese online retailer JD.com, and last week announced plans to turn its multilingual Indian payments app, Google Pay, into more of a portal through which offline and online merchants could handle transactions.By 2021, 73 percent of India\u2019s internet users will prefer to use languages other than English, compared with 57 percent in 2016, according to a study last year by KPMG and Google.Given those trends, every e-commerce site in India has to figure out a way to address the local-language problem.\u201cAnybody who is serious about this country will have to do it,\u201d said Mr. Sinha of Paytm.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Overwatch Bets Gaming Fans Will Cheer for the Home Team to Save the World", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJay Goldthwaite had never felt passion for a Boston sports team, no matter how often his neighbors\u2019 cheers pierced the walls of his condo during playoff games for the Red Sox or the Celtics.But then came the Boston Uprising, a franchise in the Overwatch League whose players shoot it out in a video game to save the world.Now an autographed team poster is framed on a wall in his home office. During an emergency room visit this year, he used his phone to furtively watch the Uprising in a frenzied match featuring a time-traveling pistoleer, an electricity-wielding scientist and a monk pursuing transcendence.\u201cI thought it would be sort of a novelty,\u201d Mr. Goldthwaite, 47, said of having a local team to support. \u201cBut now I find myself jumping off the couch.\u201dBut Blizzard\u2019s parent company, Activision Blizzard, which employs executives who have worked for the N.B.A., the N.F.L., and broadcasters ESPN and Fox Sports, is taking a more deliberate approach.\u201cBasketball is not a sport,\u201d said Pete Vlastelica, the chief executive of e-sports at Activision Blizzard. \u201cBasketball is a game. The N.B.A. makes it a sport by wrapping structure and fanfare around it.\u201dThe Overwatch League\u2019s inaugural season this year featured 12 teams, and the finals in July attracted sold-out crowds of more than 20,000 spectators to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, while matches were broadcast on ESPN. Since then, Blizzard has announced expansion franchises in Atlanta, Washington, Paris, Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia, as well as the Chinese cities of Guangzhou, Chengdu and Hangzhou. The league hopes to ultimately add eight more.By building local franchises for Overwatch, Blizzard offered a structure that could appeal to professional sports executives able to provide valuable cachet.The first two franchises, the Boston Uprising and the New York Excelsior, were bought by organizations connected to Robert K. Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, and Jeff Wilpon, chief operating officer of the New York Mets and the son of the team\u2019s principal owner. Executives with the Los Angeles Rams, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Sacramento Kings soon joined the ownership ranks. E-sports stalwarts joined, too: Cloud9 owns the London Spitfire, which won the first championship.Mr. Kraft\u2019s son Jonathan, president of the Kraft Group, said his organization had been interested in e-sports, but was uncomfortable acquiring what amounted only to contracts with individual players, rather than a permanent franchise.\u201cIt\u2019s not the wild, wild West anymore,\u201d Jonathan Kraft said of the Overwatch League. \u201cThere\u2019s a structure. There\u2019s substance.\u201dOverwatch fans might have an easy time coalescing around geographic allegiances, but they\u2019ll have a hard time seeing their team in person. All of the teams, including New York, Boston and Philadelphia \u2014 not to mention Shanghai and Seoul \u2014 actually play just outside Los Angeles.\u201cThere is a huge audience that is out there dying to engage with this content live and connect with other fans,\u201d Mr. Nanzer said.The local franchise model remains largely untested, however.Mr. Hopper oversees a 10-team league based in Los Angeles, and said he believed there were diminishing returns when expanding to other cities.\u201cWe\u2019ve sold out events because of the relative scarcity of presence in that market,\u201d Mr. Hopper said. \u201cSo we can sell out Madison Square Garden or Staples Center or Air Canada Centre because we haven\u2019t gone there in a long time.\u201dGame companies are trying to replicate the long-term audiences found in traditional sports, and regionalism and nationalism have been powerful anchors, said T. L. Taylor, a professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has written books about e-sports and online gaming.\u201cNow that e-sports can be seen as a viewable product with audiences that can be marketed and carved up, it\u2019s being fit into modes of industry and entertainment that are resonant,\u201d she said.Overwatch League is promising its teams something else that mirrors traditional sports: revenue sharing. Franchises will eventually split the money made from broadcast deals and national advertisers \u2014 which have included HP, Sour Patch Kids, T-Mobile and Toyota \u2014 in addition to keeping all local revenue, according to Blizzard. The players receive minimum $50,000 salaries, and were allocated at least half of the inaugural season\u2019s $3.5 million prize pool.\u201cWe talk about it as a forever league,\u201d he said.Overwatch players aim to control an area or to escort a vehicle through enemy fire using characters with varying powers: Pharah causes havoc from afar with rockets and a jet pack, Mei freezes opponents and builds ice walls, and Lucio, a rollerblading D.J., heals his teammates with music.The game play can be difficult for a casual observer to process, but the culture surrounding it is familiar. As in other sports, fans of the Overwatch League watch matches at bars while wearing jerseys of their favorite team.\u201cHumans,\u201d Mr. Nanzer said, \u201care tribal in nature.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Hits $1,000,000,000,000 in Value, Following Apple", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Amazon has become the second American company to cross that once-unimaginable line. Its shares rose as high as $2,050.50 on Tuesday morning, pushing it over $1 trillion in value, before immediately falling back and then ending the day at $2,039.51, below the $1 trillion threshold. Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is worth nearly as much as Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett put together.This time, the explanation is more complicated.Amazon captures 49 cents of every e-commerce dollar in the United States. It employs more than 550,000 people and generates $178 billion in annual revenue. It sells everything from computing space to peanut butter to appointments with plumbers.But the thing it has always sold the most \u2014 to investors, customers, the news media \u2014 is excitement.In the beginning, Amazon was an exciting new way to shop for books: online. Then it was an exciting new way to read (Kindle e-books), an exciting new way to publish (CreateSpace), an exciting new way to power the internet (Amazon Web Services), an exciting new way to get deliveries (Amazon Prime), an exciting new way to make your house a high-tech outpost (Alexa).Long before Amazon went to Hollywood and began making movies, it was the star of its own show, generating vast amounts of attention just for being Amazon. No other company had ever managed to turn its lack of profit into such effective drama, or the question of what its next move would be.Mr. Bezos made clear when Amazon went public in 1997 that he would not work for Wall Street, and the result was a company cast in an entirely different mold. It never feared losing money. In a real sense, there were no consequences for being wrong.Behind the drama is a relentless and sometimes scary ambition. Amazon is the Jay Gatsby of American companies, believing that tomorrow it will run faster, stretch its arms out farther, fulfill the desires of consumers in ways that no other business possibly could. You will live in Amazon\u2019s world, it says, and you will like it.One of the great benefits for Amazon of this approach is that it is impossible to tell where reality ends and hype \u2014 or perhaps even madness \u2014 begins.Take Amazon\u2019s drone program, which it first announced on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI know this looks like science fiction,\u201d Mr. Bezos said, as he showed a film of an unmanned vehicle delivering a package. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d He said there were \u201cyears of additional work\u201d to be done, but declared himself an optimist. Drone delivery, he predicted, would be a reality in \u201cfour, five years.\u201dThat was December 2013. Roughly a million features were written about Amazon and its drones, nearly all with the subtext: Isn\u2019t this the coolest thing ever?Over the years, the company kept raising the stakes, as if they were not already high enough. Amazon applied a few years ago for a patent for an \u201caerial fulfillment center\u201d that would float at 45,000 feet. Drones would fly out of it with your order and then glide down to your backyard.The fulfillment center, which looks in drawings like a blimp tugging a warehouse, has other uses besides delivering dinner. It would drift down to 2,000 feet to what the patent calls \u201cthe advertising altitude,\u201d where it would present information \u201cabout items and/or services.\u201d Perhaps it will be just like the movie \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and the floating ads will trumpet the joys of working in Amazon\u2019s off-world colonies. The patent was granted this summer.Haye Kesteloo, senior editor of the news site DroneDJ, noted that there were many hurdles to routine delivery by drone, even if the vehicles are not being launched from airships. The claimed drone attack on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela will not help soothe nervous citizens.Nevertheless, Mr. Kesteloo, like Mr. Bezos, proclaims himself an optimist. \u201cCompanies like Amazon will make routine drone deliveries to consumers by 2025,\u201d he said \u2014 only twice as far away as promised.\u201cThere is no doubt anymore,\u201d said Ron Nussbaum, who runs an investment management fund called Maverick Value in Los Angeles. \u201cThe stock always goes up, and no one doubts it will keep going up.\u201dMr. Nussbaum, who emphasized that over all his investments were profitable, might be the last Amazon skeptic. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d he said.And an expensive one. Last year, when Amazon crossed $1,000 a share, he started buying \u201cput\u201d options \u2014 bets that the stock would decline. One of his puts has dropped 85 percent; another, 92 percent.Mr. Nussbaum is planning to buy more. He thinks people are confusing their impressions of Amazon the company with Amazon as an investment.\u201cIf I fill up your gas tank for $1 but it costs me $2, you can say it\u2019s a great product, but it doesn\u2019t make any sense as a company,\u201d he said.Apple had profits of $48 billion last year. Amazon\u2019s were less than a tenth of that. If profits were all that mattered, Amazon should be worth about $100 billion, the size of United Technologies or Texas Instruments. That is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing to get people excited, either.Even before Amazon hit $1 trillion, the milestone was old news. There was a poll on Facebook run by a group of young Wall Street investors. The question: Would Amazon or Apple be the first to hit $2 trillion?The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of Amazon. Dreams will always triumph over devices.Advertisement"}

His move to buy most of Fox forced Disney to raise its bid for those assets so much that when it came time to compete for Sky, Disney had a hard time bidding against Comcast without overleveraging itself. Time will tell whether the Sky deal proves successful \u2014 but if scored simply on the dark arts of deal making, Mr. Roberts already won.We\u2019ll see whether Disney ends up selling Fox\u2019s stake in Sky to Comcast. That\u2019s likely, or else Disney risks being a minority owner with little influence. There has also been speculation that Comcast could sell its stake in Hulu to Disney as part of a swap, but that makes little sense for now.Overnight, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

There, thinking about the current moment got the design team thinking about classical history (goddess power), which got them thinking about their own history, which led them to Emily Wilson (translator of \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d), and Margaret Atwood and Anne-Marie Beretta, who pretty much defined the corporate power coat for the brand in 1981, which in turn led them to the invention of \u2026 calf spats!46 PhotosWhat else to call the snap-on lower pant legs, stretching up from the ankle to just above the knee, that appeared under narrow skirts and dresses ruched and knotted at the waist and knee-length tailored culottes.

Try This", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s easier than you think!For many of us, meeting new people can be an anxiety-inducing affair.It can be a mess! All of our worst social paranoias contained in a single interaction.But there\u2019s an easy way to get around this, simultaneously coming off as more likable while working to build a deeper, more genuine connection with someone: Ask questions.Those follow-up questions, the study found, are especially helpful to increase how much we are liked because they show that we are listening sincerely and trying to show we care.Imagine that! Being a genuine, sincere conversation partner makes people like you more. What a world.A team of researchers from Yale, Harvard, Cornell and the University of Essex found that after initial interactions \u201cpeople systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.\u201dThis is called the liking gap, or the difference between how much we think people like us and how much people actually like us.The study looked at how relationships evolved between new acquaintances and found that the anxiety and self-doubt of meeting someone new can pervade in any type of relationship, sometimes lasting for months.\u201cPeople are often biased by their own internal monologues, which, after social interactions, can be remarkably self-critical and negative,\u201d the authors wrote.

Simply having the knowledge that any self-doubt about an interaction with a new person is unwarranted is a powerful shift in the way we approach new connections. If you feel like someone dislikes you based on a single meeting, odds are that\u2019s just not the case (and they\u2019re probably thinking the same thing).Just keep asking those questions, listening to the answers and being as genuine as possible.

{"Headline": "Hotel Workers Fret Over a New Rival: Alexa at the Front Desk", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe bosses haven\u2019t yet introduced facial recognition technology at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. But from her perch behind the front desk at the pink neo-Moorish palace overlooking Waikiki Beach, Jean Te\u2019o-Gibney can see it coming.Similar fears simmer throughout Marriott\u2019s vast network of hotels, the largest in the United States. Over the last two weeks, Ms. Te\u2019o-Gibney and thousands of other Marriott workers \u2014 cooks and cashiers, bellhops and housekeepers \u2014 have voted to authorize their union, Unite Here, to strike at dozens of locations from Waikiki to Boston and San Diego to Detroit.Alongside the usual demands for higher wages and better workplace safety, the union is bringing another issue to the table, asking for procedures to protect workers affected by new technologies and the innovations they spur.\u201cYou are not going to stop technology,\u201d said Unite Here\u2019s president, D. Taylor. \u201cThe question is whether workers will be partners in its deployment or bystanders that get run over by it.\u201dUnlike manufacturing workers, whose jobs have been lost to automation since as far back as the 1950s, workers in the low-wage portion of the service sector had remained until now largely shielded from job-killing technologies.But with advances in machine learning and other innovations in information technology, many service jobs are now potentially in jeopardy. Compared with manufacturing, the investment needed to automate some tasks in the hotel sector \u2014 like front desk or concierge services \u2014 is likely to be relatively low.At the Sheraton Waikiki, next to the Royal Hawaiian, cashiers at the beachside lounge worry about a newly deployed computer system that will allow servers to close out their own checks \u2014 making cashiers redundant.New technologies are reconfiguring the workplace in other ways. Doormen are losing tips as guests turn to Uber and Lyft instead of regular taxis. So are bellhops when guests use Seamless, a food-delivery app, instead of room service.How many jobs will technology take out? Hoteliers have yet to figure out how guests will react to a more tech-heavy experience. A Marriott spokeswoman said in a statement that the chain was not deploying technology to eliminate jobs but was \u201cpersonalizing the guest experience and enhancing the stay.\u201dCliff Atkinson, senior vice president for hospitality at MGM Resorts, said new technologies had changed job descriptions at properties across his chain but had not eliminated jobs. Front-desk clerks displaced by automated check-in kiosks are deployed as \u201clobby ambassadors\u201d or concierges.Still, history suggests that the most powerful motivation to deploy new technologies has been the opportunity to reduce labor costs. From 1993 to 2007, Professors Acemoglu and Restrepo estimated, each new robot cut 5.6 jobs and reduced wages by 0.5 percent.As technology gets better and cheaper, there are lots of new tasks it could take over. \u201cIt is a new, uncharted area for our company and our industry as a whole,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. \u201cWe have talked about one or two brands being fully automated and self-service for the guest.\u201dDavid Autor, an economist at M.I.T., says it is plausible to foresee a future in which \u2014 as airlines have done \u2014 hotels deploy humans to tend to elite guests and automated systems for everybody else. Workers generate costs well beyond their hourly wage, Professor Autor argued. They get sick and take vacations and require managers. \u201cPeople are messy,\u201d he noted. \u201cMachines are straightforward.\u201dUnions would rather not have manufacturing\u2019s story repeat itself in the service sector. \u201cWe are trying to get ahead of that,\u201d said Anand Singh, president of Unite Here\u2019s local in San Francisco. \u201cWe are not Luddites, but we are seeking a real voice at table.\u201dEdward Wytkind, who until this year headed the Transportation Trades Department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said unions could not stop technology if they tried. \u201cMaybe you can stop it through one round of bargaining or slow it down,\u201d he said. \u201cBut innovation has been going on for 100 years and has never stopped.\u201dAnd he noted what might be the cost of success: \u201cAre we winning a future for workers? Not if the company goes out of business.\u201dA better strategy might be to demand a say in how technology is deployed.The Teamsters\u2019 tentative deal with U.P.S., for instance, calls for six months of advance warning to the union of technological deployments and for the creation of a committee with union and company representatives that would negotiate \u201cregarding the effects of the proposed technological changes.\u201dUnite Here is following a similar path. Mr. Singh listed the union\u2019s goals for Marriott contracts: \u201cWe want to talk about how technology can assist the work we perform and ease the rigors of our work, how our members are trained, what happens to workers who would otherwise be tagged as redundant, how our members are repositioned to succeed or hired into other workplaces.\u201dIn June, the union managed for the first time to include protections from technological change in its contracts covering workers at the Las Vegas properties of MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. Workers will be trained to do jobs created or modified by new technology, allowing them to share in the productivity gains. The contracts also provide for the company to try to find jobs for displaced workers. But the union\u2019s key achievement was to get 180 days\u2019 warning of technological deployments.\u201cThey have to let us know and show us the prototypes and must negotiate with us,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cAt the end of the day, they can move forward, but this gives us time to understand the effects.\u201dIf they could choose a precedent from American labor history, today\u2019s union leaders might follow the path of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.In the 1960s and \u201970s, dockworkers were walloped by one of the most revolutionary technical innovations of the 20th century: containers. At a stroke, containers slashed both the time and number of workers needed to load a ship, saving vast amounts of money.But you need a lot of power to get a deal like that. The longshore union could shut down ports at will, imposing huge costs on shippers. For workers lacking that kind of clout, the gains achieved by the longshoremen seem out of reach.Unite Here\u2019s victories so far have been hard won. \u201cIt was not an easy ask,\u201d Mr. Taylor said of the language on technology in the Las Vegas deals. \u201cIt does infringe on hotels\u2019 right to do what they want.\u201dThe outcome might or might not deliver a greater share of the gains from technology to workers. But front-desk clerks and concierges will have better options than severance when Alexa or computer software takes over some of their tasks. \u201cIt was a good resolution,\u201d Mr. Taylor said. \u201cTime will tell if it is good enough.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Les Moonves Said to Be Negotiating Possible Exit From CBS", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Moonves has been talking to the board about his possible departure as chief executive, including terms of a payout that would be far less than $180 million, the amount specified in his employment agreement should he leave the CBS Corporation, according to three people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private bargaining agreement.The multiple allegations of sexual harassment against Mr. Moonves have partly motivated the talks, which could still break down. Should Mr. Moonves depart, his chief lieutenant, Joseph Ianniello, is likely to be named interim chief executive, two of the people said.During his tenure, Mr. Moonves, 68, has helped transform CBS from a last-place network into the most watched channel for the last decade, with hits like \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cSurvivor.\u201d That success has made Mr. Moonves one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood and his possible departure has put the future fortunes of the company into doubt.For over a month, Mr. Moonves has been grappling with the two separate but equally fateful issues. In addition to the harassment allegations against him, Mr. Moonves is involved in a legal dispute with Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of CBS. An exit with a significant cash payout for Mr. Moonves before a trial that may decide control of the company could be seen as a beneficial outcome for all parties, according to the people.Earlier this year, Mr. Moonves and the network\u2019s independent directors mounted a legal challenge to Ms. Redstone, 64, in an attempt to stop her from merging the network with Viacom. The trial is set to begin Oct. 3 in Delaware Chancery Court. At the same time, the board is investigating claims of sexual harassment against Mr. Moonves and allegations of a broader culture of harassment at CBS, most notably in its news division.Both issues complicated the interplay among directors, and exposed its factions, with one group apparently loyal to Ms. Redstone, another to Mr. Moonves and others debating which direction the company should take.In a statement at the time, Mr. Moonves said: \u201cI recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2014 and abided by the principle \u2014 that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career.\u201dShortly after the article was published, the CBS board enlisted two law firms to lead an inquiry into the claims against Mr. Moonves and the wider workplace culture at the network. The board soon after folded a separate examination of CBS News \u2014 underway since March \u2014 into the larger investigation.The board hired Nancy Kestenbaum of Covington & Burling and Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton to conduct the inquiry. Ms. White led the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration and was previously the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Ms. Kestenbaum was also a federal prosecutor with the same district. The investigation into CBS News is being led by the law firm of Proskauer Rose.Mr. Moonves had recused himself from any matters related to the investigation, and a three-member committee \u2014 Bruce S. Gordon, Linda Griego and Robert N. Klieger \u2014 has been appointed to oversee the inquiry. The makeup of that panel reflects the fractious board itself.Mr. Klieger, a lawyer based in Los Angeles, occupies one of three CBS board seats appointed by Ms. Redstone\u2019s family company. (In addition to Mr. Klieger, Ms. Redstone and David R. Andelman, a Boston-based lawyer who has represented the Redstone family in the past, make up the Redstone family\u2019s board seats.)Ms. Redstone commands both CBS and Viacom by owning 80 percent of voting rights, and the legal battle is being waged to water down that stake in CBS.Ms. Redstone had asked the boards of CBS and Viacom to explore the possibility of a merger to protect themselves from the onslaught of technology giants like Netflix, Amazon and Facebook, which have taken ad dollars and eyeballs away from the traditional players.Mr. Moonves and the majority of the CBS board, however, concluded a combination would not benefit CBS\u2019s shareholders. The company has a far more robust business, while revenue at Viacom, which includes the cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, has been shrinking over the last few years.Ms. Redstone has countersued, claiming Mr. Moonves had effectively forced the CBS board to take legal action against her lest he leave the company.Mr. Moonves draws an annual pay package worth $69.3 million. His employment agreement included a provision that would pay him more than $184 million in pay and benefits as part of his exit if the board fires him without fault, or if he leaves because of the legal dispute.Last month, the CBS directors who are unaffiliated with Ms. Redstone filed requests to seek more information about how her family company, National Amusements, handles the voting shares of its own company and that of CBS.Lawyers for the network suggested in court proceedings that Ms. Redstone\u2019s control of the shares could be in doubt because she\u2019s acting at the behest of her father, Sumner Redstone, 95, who has been in ill health for several years. Mr. Redstone owns the controlling shares, and he does not speak and is being fed through a tube.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Forever\u2019 Is a Thrilling Story of Boring Love", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne year, after 14 straight annual fishing trips, June (Maya Rudolph) and Oscar (Fred Armisen) decide to change up their routine and go skiing. Neither of them has ever skied before. They are middle-aged. It is perhaps too late for all this. They find themselves, freezing and unsteady, tottering on a bunny hill.The series sets its tone, and the terms of June and Oscar\u2019s marriage, in a jazz-scored opening montage. Vignettes pass from right to left: they meet, they fall in love, they move in together, they brush their teeth, they go fishing, they go fishing, they go fishing. It\u2019s a picture of a sweet, dull life, and the visual effect is of panning from room to room, unable to move backward and change direction.The pair have a bantering, best-pals rapport, passing time on a long drive by debating the best way to spend a half-hour. (Sex comes well down the list, after getting a massage and looking at your phone, and they both agree that thirty minutes is \u201ca little long.\u201d) Materially comfortable and unencumbered by children, they have the life rhythms of a prematurely retired couple, though they both work.The hitch, as the opening suggests, is that June is ready for something different and Oscar is not. Things do change, and this is where I must get vague.That\u2019s all true, and thus I\u2019ll zip it about most of what happens beyond the first episode. You will think you have figured out what kind of show \u201cForever\u201d is, and you will be wrong, and you will figure it out again, and you will be wrong again. (The show is best binged quickly; if it\u2019s not for you, you\u2019ll probably know three episodes in.)But in another sense, \u201cForever\u201d is the same story from beginning to end. It\u2019s a narratively nimble show that\u2019s thematically about routine, emotional fidelity and the possibility, or impossibility, of reinvention.Mr. Armisen is right about half the time as Oscar, a variation on the neurotic, young-old-man character that he played in half his \u201cPortlandia\u201d roles. Maybe because of that history, and his tendency to push his characters to an unsettling, staring-too-long grotesqueness, his character lacks the gravity he needs in the more serious moments.If \u201cForever\u201d were a movie \u2014 which it easily could have been \u2014 you\u2019d say it has third-act problems. The story seems to spiral away from it in the last couple of episodes, and the ending feels like it\u2019s giving itself credit for resolving issues it hasn\u2019t fully addressed.But \u201cForever\u201d dares enough, and pulls off a high enough percentage of what it tries, that I found it worth the trip. It manages to be at the same time slice-of-life and cosmically absurd, reflective and irreverent, fantastical and grounded.One of the best episodes shifts focus entirely, to a different couple who have a conversation that is not about June and Oscar but neatly describes their dilemma. One of them questions the concept of monogamy: \u201cThings change, people change and then you want something different.\u201d The other counters, \u201cIf you\u2019re with someone you love, you\u2019ve got to fight for it.\u201dA typical romantic comedy would leave no doubt that the second answer is the right one. \u201cForever\u201d is willing to give both a hearing \u2014 and to understand that most people, who can live their lives only forward, will never know if a different answer would have been better for them.It\u2019s a tricky combination of tones \u201cForever\u201d is aiming for, simultaneously heartfelt and ambivalent. But if the show sometimes gets out over its skis, I give it credit for being willing to strap them on.Advertisement"}

Are they really?Near the end of the debate between New York governor Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon, his Democratic primary challenger, one of the moderators prefaced a question to Ms. Nixon by referencing her net worth. \u201cGiven your personal wealth, reported to be in the tens of millions of dollars \u2014 \u201d CBS anchorman Maurice DuBois started before Ms. Nixon interrupted: \u201c \u2014 which is not true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been reported,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust Google,\u201d Ms. Nixon said, knowing everyone does.CelebrityNetWorth.com, and let\u2019s call it CNW, was founded by Brian Warner in 2009 \u2014 not the same Brian Warner who performs under the name Marilyn Manson (Celebrity Net Worth: $25 million). The site\u2019s home page is full of standard curiosity-gap clickbait in a celebrity finance flavor, with headlines like \u201cBillionaire Michael Jordan Has Zero Influence On Which Players Wear His Shoes, And The Reason Why Is Kind Of Strange \u2026\u201d and \u201cHow Much Money Did Colonel Sanders Make Off Kentucky Fried Chicken? Not As Much As You\u2019d Guess!\u201d But CNW\u2019s core product is the collection of pages it maintains for celebrities (of varying degrees of celebrity) with authoritatively phrased estimates as to how much money they have.These pages include single paragraphs of biographical info, but they\u2019re rendered practically unreadable by formatting. What readers are after is a single number, at the top of the page in big type: $20 million (Chris Pine), $40 million (Chris Pratt), $90 million (Chris Hemsworth). If you want to know how rich (or not) a celebrity is, CNW has an answer. No one is vouching for the veracity of that answer \u2014 CNW\u2019s proprietors \u201cexpressly exclude liability for any such inaccuracies or errors to the fullest extent permitted by law,\u201d according to the terms of use \u2014 but it's an answer nonetheless.The \u201cbest possible ballpark\u201d is a low standard of accuracy for facts, but if you\u2019re the only one on the internet offering an answer to a question people are asking, you become the trusted authority. When slightly more respectable journalistic outlets repeat CNW numbers \u2014 and they often do \u2014 those figures get both murkier and more authoritative. \u201cBallparked\u201d net worth becomes \u201creported\u201d net worth becomes hard to dispute, as Ms. Nixon discovered.CNW is offering answers to questions that don\u2019t have hard and fast answers. Rich people don\u2019t know how much money they have, and \u201cnet worth\u201d includes appraisals on all sorts of nonliquid assets, from cars and houses to fractions of companies. Jeff Bezos doesn\u2019t have $150 billion in gold coins in a swimming-pool vault under the Space Needle. Most people know that, at least on some level. But that doesn\u2019t stop us from Googling, and it doesn\u2019t stop Google from sourcing snippet results from CNW. Prime placement of that information is not about its accuracy either. A Google spokesman said the featured snippets are meant to point users to the most relevant piece of content given their query\u00a0\u2014 and \u201crelevant\" is a very different criteria than \u201ccorrect.\u201dThe American media has printed guesses and lies about celebrities for as long as the two have existed; that\u2019s hardly Google or Amazon\u2019s fault. But because \u201cthe internet\u201d has become our default source for information, it is easier for tabloid facts to circulate under credible logos. The trivia that results can be hard to dispel.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a wealth ranking list. It is the Forbes 400, not the Fortune 400.Advertisement"}

Amazon Prime subscribers will be able to stream the Fox telecast, as well as three alternative commentary options: Storm and Kremer, a Spanish-language stream and a U.K.-English stream.Kremer is a correspondent for the N.F.L. Network and HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Sports\u201d and previously worked for ESPN and as the sideline reporter for NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d Storm hosts \u201cSportsCenter\u201d as well as anchors ESPN\u2019s coverage of numerous major sports events. She also owns a company that produces sports documentaries.They are following in the footsteps of Gayle Sierens, who called one N.F.L. game in 1987, and Beth Mowins, who has called a \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d game each of the past two seasons. Before their debut on Thursday night, Storm and Kremer talked about their style, their historic accomplishment, the kind words they received from Charles Barkley, and what comes next. This interview has been edited and condensed.The release didn\u2019t say, so who is doing play-by-play?We are a different option. This is a game from our perspective. We are going to do a lot of storytelling. We do not have charge of the video. You are going to see us talking about things that might not necessarily match the picture on the screen. There\u2019s going to be a lot of conversations. We will have guests at times.What are you most excited about? Why hasn\u2019t this opportunity presented itself for either of you two before, or for other women? One of the first people I heard from yesterday was Fred Gaudelli, the longtime executive producer of Sunday Night Football. He was one of the first people I heard from, and I was a little nervous because Freddie is the best, and he is a traditionalist. But he said to me: \u201cI had this idea four years ago and I couldn\u2019t get traction on it, and I am so happy. You are the perfect pair.\u201dOne person that I got a kick out of that we both heard from was Charles Barkley. When you go back to the \u201890s, I was broadcasting the N.B.A. on NBC. At the time, the Rockets were in a playoff run, and Charles Barkley was on the team. I said something that got back to him in the locker room, and he made the comment that: \u201cWell, women shouldn\u2019t be talking about basketball. Women shouldn\u2019t be talking about this.\u201d In reference to me.We have seen \u2014 just in general in sports \u2014 a lot more diverse voices in recent years, and that is because there have been some very important societal issues that have touched the sports world, and we needed diverse voices, we needed different perspectives. Even if you look at the sports landscape today compared to very recently, it\u2019s much more diverse because we have, thankfully, come to understand that a lot of perspectives are important.Do you feel like right now you are part of any sort of larger movement or some moment in time we are in?In terms of the societal impact, I think that may be for other people, but the really important thing is, it\u2019s not like Amazon set out to, \u201cWow, let\u2019s put women in because the Me Too movement is going on.\u201d It\u2019s not what the intent was. The intent was, look at it from a business perspective. They spent $50 million to stream. Why would you have streaming rights to a tremendous Fox broadcast and then try to do the same thing? You don\u2019t want to do the same thing.Is calling live games still the pinnacle of sports broadcasting? When will this cease being a big deal? Honestly, this is trending in the right direction, but you know, it has been slow. I think in some ways things have changed \u2014 it feels like rapidly \u2014 and at the same time it feels like slowly.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Finally Makes It to the Big Apple", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a bank of the Bronx River, below the roar of the Bruckner Expressway, Walmart has finally found a foothold in a city that has long shunned it.Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business, Jet.com, is leasing a 205,000-square-foot warehouse in the Bronx that will soon begin supplying MacBooks and organic eggs to New York\u2019s well-heeled shoppers.The physical presence is a victory for the nation\u2019s largest retailer, which has faced resistance from labor groups and their political allies every time it has proposed opening a store in the five boroughs. But it\u2019s also an acknowledgment that the company\u2019s longtime national strategy won\u2019t work in certain big cities.With a revamped Jet\u2019s new push into New York, Walmart is trying to reach beyond its core base of big-box stores in rural and suburban America and compete for higher-income urbanites. A retailing empire built on no frills and low prices, Walmart is using Jet to entice millennials and young families with trendy, premium products like Big Gay Ice Cream and Dr. Martens shoes.\u201cWe believe we can win in New York,\u201d Jet\u2019s president, Simon Belsham, said in an interview.By acquiring stand-alone businesses, Walmart has been able to avoid the political furor it typically sets off in left-leaning cities where there is deep support for the unions that Walmart has rebuffed. Jet is also pushing to grow its business in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington.The retailer\u2019s previous attempts to enter the New York market, in Queens and then in Brooklyn, ended in stinging defeat. Activists and city leaders turned the proposed stores into a referendum on Walmart\u2019s labor practices.As recently as 2014, nearly half the City Council accused the Walton Family Foundation, which is funded by the company\u2019s founding family, of trying to curry favor with New Yorkers by donating \u201ctoxic money\u201d to local efforts to support charter schools.This time around, many city leaders either declined interview requests or did not return requests for comment on Jet\u2019s growth plans in New York. Some are skeptical, even if they are taking a wait-and-see attitude.\u201cWalmart may think they have found a new, under-the-radar path into New York City by buying up businesses already here, but we should not be fooled,\u201d Comptroller Scott M. Stringer, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cWe intend to be watching very carefully.\u201dMaritza Silva-Farrell, executive director of the labor and community group Align, worked to sink Walmart\u2019s plans to open a store in the East New York section of Brooklyn. She and others argued that Walmart\u2019s low prices would endanger local businesses and that its lower wages would depress pay at other retailers.Ms. Silva-Farrell said she was still concerned about Walmart\u2019s business model. But Amazon, she said, is becoming \u201ca world threat\u201d as the company increasingly dictates the global supply chain and broadens into manufacturing.\u201cAmazon is going to define how the economy is going to work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger problem than Walmart.\u201dSome labor activists see Walmart\u2019s use of Jet to break into the New York market as a sign of victory.\u201cThe fact that Walmart had to acquire another company in order to operate in New York City is a testament to our efforts to keep them out,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.New York is now a testing ground for Walmart\u2019s urban e-commerce strategy, which puts every step of the sale \u2014 from the mobile app to the \u201clast mile\u201d of delivery \u2014 under the company\u2019s control.Walmart is also providing a decent amount of local jobs. Jet employs about 1,300 engineers, executives and other white-collar workers at its Hoboken headquarters and is planning to hire more than 100 workers in its Bronx fulfillment center, a warehouse where customer orders will be prepared and shipped.A spokeswoman said it was too early to comment on the pay at the warehouse since the facility is not yet operational. Parcel employs 150 part-time drivers, all earning $15 an hour, which will soon be the city\u2019s minimum wage.When Walmart acquired Jet, it was not clear how the large retailer would integrate the website into its larger online strategy.Founded by the e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore, Jet was billed as the \u201cAmazon killer\u201d that could win over shoppers with low prices. But Jet seemed redundant with Walmart.com, leading some in the tech world to speculate the real motivation was to acquire Mr. Lore, who now runs Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business nationally.About a year ago, Walmart signaled that it was switching gears and focusing Jet\u2019s efforts on certain cities in the Northeast, where Walmart lacks a huge brick-and-mortar presence.Mr. Belsham, who was hired to run Jet in March, said the redesigned website was meant to be less utilitarian and offer more \u201cinspiration\u201d \u2014 enticing shoppers to order groceries and, say, a pair of Nike sneakers, all in the same online basket.The offerings are upscale, but the prices are not outrageous by New York standards. Pints of Van Leeuwen Earl Grey Tea ice cream for $5.99 and hydroponic Gotham Greens lettuce for $3.49 are less expensive than at some city grocery stores.Online grocery is already a crowded market: FreshDirect, Peapod, Instacart and Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods are offering grocery delivery in New York. But analysts expect Jet will have the advantage of using Walmart\u2019s buying power with vendors to compete on price. Jet is also offering products, like iPhones and designer clothing, that other grocers do not.For same-day scheduled delivery, Jet charges a $5.95 fee. There\u2019s no fee for orders over $35 with no scheduled delivery time.\u201cThis is a surgical strike,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, a managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. \u201cWalmart could be a top-10 retailer in the city within the first year.\u201dNot all analysts are sold on the strategy, which they say is likely to lose Walmart money in the near term as the company ramps up its marketing and hiring.For Jet\u2019s \u201crelaunch\u201d party last week, the company rented out a brownstone near Washington Square Park to showcase its New York offerings. One floor of the apartment featured museumlike displays of what Jet said were actual orders by New Yorkers \u2014 including an arrangement of Sam Edelman high heels, avocados and rolls of toilet paper \u2014 bathed in purple light.\u201cIt feels like a bit of a sideshow,\u201d said Scott Mushkin, a retail industry analyst at Wolfe Research. \u201cWalmart\u2019s strength is in places like Missouri, Arkansas and Mississippi, where their stores are the center of commerce. I don\u2019t know what they bring to the table in Manhattan.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hard Lessons (Thanks, Amazon) Breathe New Life Into Retail Stores", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMalls are being hollowed out. Shops are closing by the thousands. Retailers are going bankrupt.But it may be too early to declare the death of retail. Americans have started shopping more \u2014 in stores.From the garden section at Walmart to the diamond counters at Tiffany & Company, old-school retailers are experiencing some of their best sales growth in years.The strong revenues start with a roaring economy and an optimistic consumer. With more cash in their wallets from the tax cuts, Americans have been spending more.The boom also reflects a broad reordering of the $3.5 trillion industry, with fewer retailers capturing more of the gains. Stores that have learned how to match the ease and instant gratification of e-commerce shopping are flourishing, while those that have failed to evolve are in bankruptcy or on the brink.\u201cThe retailers that get it recognize that Amazon has forever changed consumer behavior,\u201d said Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor and former director of the retailing center at the Wharton School. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to work to shop.\u201dMany successful stores are now a cross between a fast-food drive-through and a hotel concierge.Target\u2019s shoppers can order sunscreen or a Tokidoki Unicorno T-shirt on their phone, pull up to the parking lot and have the items brought to their car.Nordstrom lets customers in some stores make returns by dropping their items into a box and walking out \u2014 no human interaction required.Walmart is employing 25,000 \u201cpersonal shoppers\u201d to select and package groceries for curbside pickup.But the pace of closings has slowed, as the most unprofitable stores have been culled and the weakest companies have collapsed. At this time in 2017, nearly 5,700 stores had shut across the United States, according to Coresight Research, a retail analysis and advisory firm. So far this year, about 4,480 have closed.Some big retailers, like J. C. Penney and Sears, are still sputtering, despite closing lagging stores and sprucing up ones that remain open. But the stronger players are capitalizing on the industry\u2019s failures. Target said it was picking up new toy customers in the wake of the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us liquidation this spring.The rebound is feeding the broader economy. Hiring is up, with an average of roughly 50,000 retail jobs being added each month since February, according to the National Retail Federation.\u201cThere has been a shakeout, and 2017 was seen as the bottom,\u201d said Melina Cordero, head of retail research for the Americas at the real estate firm CBRE.Far from retrenching, many retailers are expanding their physical presence or spending billions to overhaul existing stores.Dollar General plans to open 900 stores this year, as it deepens its reach into rural America with inexpensive food and clothing. The company is building a huge following in areas where there are fewer places to shop, particularly in the South and in parts of the Midwest.The newly renovated flagship will probably include expanded retail space as well as hospitality offerings, driven by the success of its in-store \u201cBlue Box\u201d Cafe, which on some days can have a wait list of more than 1,000 people and features a $32 \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany.\u201d Tiffany\u2019s success is built almost entirely on its stores, which account for more than 90 percent of its revenues.\u201cWe have big expectations for this project,\u201d Tiffany\u2019s chief executive, Alessandro Bogliolo, told analysts in a conference call last week. The renovation is expected to reduce the company\u2019s near-term profits, signaling the importance.One of the most ambitious and costly makeover attempts is taking place at Target. The retailer stormed across the American suburbs more than a decade ago, building hundreds of big-box stores known for affordable, hip clothing and furnishings.But many shoppers had grown tired of Target\u2019s cavernous stores, and its cool edge had slipped. Target has lately targeted a new market of young urbanites \u2014 with plans to open about 30 smaller stores in cities and near college campuses this year.Many of the new stores are supposed to be all things to all shoppers \u2014 what the industry calls an \u201comni-channel\u201d experience.Customers can order online and pick up at the store. They can order online and have their purchases delivered home, in some cases, on the same day. Or they can visit the store; employees\u2019 starting salaries were raised in an effort to bolster retention and morale.\u201cOur stores are at the center of our strategy, and they are at the center of our success right now,\u201d Target\u2019s chief executive, Brian Cornell, said in a conference call last month after the retailer reported its largest quarterly sales growth in 13 years.Tiffany Tully, 33, said recent changes to her local Target in Minneapolis had made shopping there more pleasant. The clothing displays, she said, feel more carefully curated and \u201cappealing to the eye.\u201d And she likes the convenience of returning Target items she buys online to the store rather than having to ship them, as with Amazon.\u201cTechnically I am a millennial, but I like going to stores,\u201d said Ms. Tully, a stay-at-home mother.Retailers have been tweaking their store and online strategies for years. But it\u2019s only recently that Amazon\u2019s blistering success has prodded the incumbents to try to reinvent themselves.Ms. Kahn of the Wharton School said retailers could have made these improvements decades ago if they had focused on what shoppers wanted.\u201cMost people want to spend less time shopping, not more,\u201d said Ms. Kahn, whose book \u201cThe Shopping Revolution\u201d describes the disruption in the retail industry.She said Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, had understood this when he pioneered the idea of one-click shopping. But many retailers have built their businesses around the opposite idea, like expansive stores that take hours to wade through and commissions that encourage employees to push certain products.The investments in the new stores and digital offerings are being made at an opportune time, when the strong economy is giving retailers the necessary cash. But any economic weakness could derail their progress before it takes root beyond a few good quarters. Amazon remains the omnipresent cloud, putting pressure on profits and forcing retailers to keep evolving.\u201cThese are big shifts,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a research and consulting firm. \u201cIt is like turning around the Queen Mary.

{"Headline": "Want to See What\u2019s Up Amazon\u2019s Sleeve? Take a Tour of Seattle", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe e-commerce giant uses its headquarters city as a living laboratory, trying out new retail and logistics models.SEATTLE \u2014 Tourists in Seattle have a new must-see destination: Amazon Go, the cashierless store the company opened near downtown in January. Some trials never leave the city. But others, like the use of independent contractors to deliver packages, have found their ways to the rest of the country and abroad. The pilots point to a company, with ambitions that at times can seem boundless, investing deeply in figuring out its physical footprint and how to provide convenience at a lower cost.Amazon said it employed more than 45,000 people in the city, and its teams turn to them to test new products and services.Here\u2019s a tour of a few places where Amazon toys with new ideas in its backyard. Even after projects have expanded outside the city, the flagship locations remain a home for tweaks. Starting a technology-heavy experiment like Amazon Go in Seattle makes sense because the culture prizes the avant-garde, Professor Shulman said. But success here can give a false sense of optimism that a product might take off, so Amazon pilots some experiments elsewhere. Prime Now, the company\u2019s one-hour delivery service, for example, started in New York. \u201cYou will see them go to other cities when looking to test if the market will like it,\u201d and whether it\u2019s worth expanding around the globe, Professor Shulman said.In the front of the store, Amazon customers can pick up and return packages. In the back, workers sort boxes for delivery drivers. Amazon has other pickup locations around the country, usually near college campuses, but most don\u2019t have the integration with a sorting depot.Customers go in, scan a code and then wait for the door on an Amazon locker to quietly pop open and reveal their package, like an automated post office box. The back of the locker is open, providing a glimpse into a small sorting facility used by Amazon Flex, the program piloted in Seattle that pays independent contractors to make deliveries in their own cars. The storefront offers an alternative to customers who don\u2019t want boxes dropped on their doorstep, be it for fear of porch thieves or rain. But it also tests what makes people choose an option that costs Amazon less than having drivers handle the last mile of delivery. Offering reliable, fast delivery has been essential for Amazon\u2019s growth, but that door-to-door delivery is also expensive. Shipping costs ate up 22 percent of Amazon\u2019s online sales in the second quarter, up from 16.5 percent two years earlier. For more than a decade, Amazon tried to break into the grocery business, a mecca for recurring consumer spending also known for brutal profit margins. It started AmazonFresh grocery delivery in Seattle in 2007 and worked out kinks for five years before expanding to other markets. But home delivery of perishable goods is tricky and expensive. Getting customers to pick up their groceries at a central location can be cheaper than home delivery, and pickup is available to all Prime members, not just those who pay $15 a month for AmazonFresh on top of their $119 annual Prime membership.The pickup locations opened in March 2017, just months before Amazon bought Whole Foods, and are the only stand-alone pickup locations for fresh food straight from Amazon. In August, Whole Foods began rolling out free pickup for Prime members at its locations. Whether the drive-in model takes off remains to be seen. The Ballard location isn\u2019t often packed.Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in 2015, in an upscale shopping mall near the University of Washington, not far from where a Barnes & Noble used to be. While Amazon has since opened bookstores in at least a dozen other states, the original remains a test site. The Seattle location was one of two sites where Amazon first tried letting customers return items. On a recent afternoon, more people appeared to be returning items than buying books or devices. Now, all Amazon bookstores accept some returns.It\u2019s part of the company\u2019s growing network of return options that don\u2019t depend on the mail. For some customers, going to a store is easier than finding a box and packing tape to ship something back, and for Amazon, it\u2019s most likely far cheaper. Drop-off returns cost retailers about 20 to 30 percent less than returns by mail, said Mark Geller, the chief executive of Happy Returns, which runs drop-off locations for other online retailers. \u201cA big part of the costs is first-mile, last-mile stuff,\u201d Mr. Geller said. \u201cIt\u2019s the law of nature that over time people will take the path of least resistance. If they reduce the friction by making more drop-off locations, and in more kinds of places, that is going to become compelling.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But that changed after Nike unveiled the campaign and he saw the opposition to it online, he said.\u201cIt makes me proud of Nike in a way that they would stand for what they believe in,\u201d Morse, 31, said.Even the former C.I.A. director John O. Brennan weighed in with support, writing on Twitter that Kaepernick \u201cdrew our collective attention to the problem of continued racial injustice in America.\u201dBut critics of the decision pledged to boycott Nike products, and a #BoycottNike hashtag spread on Twitter. (It was unclear how widespread or organized such a boycott might be.)And some, including the former Fox News anchor Bill O\u2019Reilly, criticized Kaepernick\u2019s stance toward the police, pointing out that the player had worn socks depicting cartoon pigs in police caps.Kaepernick accused the N.F.L. of colluding to keep him off the field because of his activism, and he scored a victory when an arbitrator let his case advance in a ruling disclosed last week.In a statement on Tuesday, Jocelyn Moore, a spokeswoman for the league, said, \u201cThe social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action.\u201dSome people reacted to the Nike campaign with mixed feelings, noting that the company\u2019s decision was likely to be good for business.Nike\u2019s stock price fell more than 2 percent in early trading Tuesday. While some investors were most likely nervous that the Kaepernick announcement would inspire boycotts, the stock price of a main competitor, Adidas, was also down more than 2 percent amid a broader downturn, which was partly attributed to worries about tense negotiations over Nafta.Rosa Clemente, an activist and political commentator, said she supported Kaepernick but was disappointed to see him teaming up with the corporation.\u201cActivists, organizers and leaders sometimes make mistakes, and I think he made a mistake by aligning himself with a company that exploits workers and breaks unions,\u201d Clemente, 46, said in an interview on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a capitalist company \u2014 it\u2019s a hyper-capitalist company.\u201dDavid M. Carter, the executive director of the Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California, Marshall, said Nike had tried to brand itself as a company that supports individual athletes and could benefit from keeping Kaepernick\u2019s activism in the news cycle.\u201cI think it\u2019s very consistent with the Nike brand, and I think what is different about what we\u2019re seeing today is that this is happening in this era of immediacy, with the media and the keyboard warriors out there on both sides, making their point,\u201d Carter said in an interview on Tuesday.Clemente said that it was \u201cfascinating\u201d to see opponents of Kaepernick taking a stand against a large corporation like Nike. \u201cThey are taking from our playbook of protest,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

But the result came as a relief to HBO, which can now say that it has technically finished in first place among all broadcast and cable networks for 17 years running.The rest of HBO\u2019s awards were spread among several shows in acting categories, including wins for Henry Winkler (\u201cBarry\u201d), Bill Hader (\u201cBarry\u201d), Thandie Newton (\u201cWestworld\u201d) and Peter Dinklage (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d).In his acceptance speech, Mr. Dinklage called out the show\u2019s creators, David Benioff and Dan Weiss, saying: \u201cThank you Dave and Dan for changing my life. I cannot walk down the street anymore.\u201d\u201cThe Americans,\u201d the FX spy drama that concluded earlier this year, won two awards, including best actor in a drama for Matthew Rhys. The FX drama had won only two Emmys across its previous five seasons, but voters decided to give it some love on its way out, as they had with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201dNetflix spent handsomely on Emmy campaigning this year, opening a space in Hollywood to showcase its fare and advertising on billboards along the Sunset Strip. But it wasn\u2019t the only company to hype its wares. So-called For Your Consideration events \u2014 panel discussions where voters have access to stars, canap\u00e9s and booze \u2014 filled the schedules of the more than 23,000 members of the Television Academy in the run-up to the ceremony.Last year, there were 61 academy-sanctioned events in Los Angeles and New York during Emmy campaigning season. This year, that number ballooned to 116, according to a spokesman for the academy.Lorne Michaels, the 73-year-old impresario behind \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and NBC\u2019s late-night lineup, also had a big night. Not only did he leave the Microsoft Theater with the Emmy for best variety sketch series, he also produced the broadcast for NBC. It was his second time at the helm, having last overseen the Emmys broadcast in 1988, when the \u201cDynasty\u201d star John Forsythe was the host.In addition to giving the hosting job to Mr. Jost and Mr. Che, Mr. Michaels recruited a number of current and former \u201cS.N.L.\u201d cast members. The show began with a satirical musical number on Hollywood\u2019s diversity problem, led by two stalwarts of the show, Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon.\u201cYup, we solved it!\u201d Mr. Thompson exclaimed.Andy Samberg and RuPaul joined in, along with a group of Broadway-style hoofers identified as the One of Each Dancers.In a taped segment midway through the broadcast, the show returned to diversity as a theme, with Mr. Che handing out \u201creparations Emmys\u201d to black actors from past shows, including Jimmie Walker and John Witherspoon.The focus on diversity became ironic as the night wore on, with one white person after another delivering acceptance speeches. Before the ceremony was done, there were victories for actors and performers of color \u2014 including Regina King, for the Netflix limited series \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d; Ms. Newton, for her work on HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d; and RuPaul, of VH1\u2019s \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d \u2014 but the great majority of winners did not reflect the night\u2019s theme.The \u201cS.N.L.\u201d influence held fast throughout the night, with Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, stars of a new Amazon show, \u201cForever,\u201d appearing in a series of awkward-on-purpose sketches and an out-of-breath Will Ferrell presenting the award for best comedy series.In a way, it was surprising to see the New York-based \u201cS.N.L.\u201d front and center at the Emmys. The Television Academy, the main body behind the awards, has looked askance at the show for most of its 43-year run. But that has changed, with \u201cS.N.L.\u201d having won half of its 62 Emmys in the past five years.\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d a series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino about a housewife who tries her luck as a comedian in 1950s New York, had a big night, taking five awards, including best comedy series.It was the first time Amazon had won a top show award at the Emmys, and the first time a streaming service had taken the best comedy award.Rachel Brosnahan, who plays the show\u2019s title character, won for best actress in a comedy, the first new winner in that category in seven years. (With HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d sidelined this year, Julia Louis-Dreyfus hit the pause button on her record-breaking Emmy run.) Ms. Sherman-Palladino won for directing and writing, in addition to the best comedy series award. And Alex Borstein, who plays Mrs. Maisel\u2019s manager, took the award for best supporting actress.The triumph of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d was a blow to the avant-garde FX comedy \u201cAtlanta,\u201d a critical favorite. Donald Glover, the show\u2019s star and creator, took the prize for best actor in a comedy last year. This time, he lost out to Mr. Hader, who plays a hit man trying to make it as an actor in \u201cBarry.\u201d74 PhotosIn the late-night battle, John Oliver\u2019s weekly HBO show, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d took the best variety talk category for a third year in a row, besting his former colleague at Comedy Central, Stephen Colbert, the host of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS.But the issue was largely absent from this year\u2019s ceremony, with no one mentioning Mr. Moonves from the stage.In his opening remarks, Mr. Che broached the topic, welcoming \u201cthe many, many talented people in Hollywood who haven\u2019t been caught yet.\u201dWith President Trump still deeply unpopular in Hollywood, the hosts, presenters and winners referred to him only in veiled terms, if at all, which stood in contrast to this event in each of the last two years.Mr. Che and Mr. Jost did not invoke his name in their opening remarks. And most winners stayed away from third rail political fare.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the actress Thandie Newton.

The group has endorsed 33 candidates running this year \u2014 14 Republicans and 19 Democrats.Even as he has become the richest person in the world \u2014 and, along the way, a target of politicians \u2014 Mr. Bezos has largely avoided taking ideological sides.

Mr. Sanders, the liberal independent from Vermont, has criticized the wages that Amazon pays its warehouse workers.Since the With Honor Fund was established last year, Mr. Bezos\u2019 parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, have given it about $2 million, according to campaign finance filings. Jeff Wilke, who oversees Amazon\u2019s retail business, donated $50,000 to the group, and Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist who is a member of the Amazon board, contributed $5,000, the filings show.

{"Headline": "On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Congress Has a Bad Reputation. Kavanaugh Isn\u2019t Helping.", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Control of the Supreme Court for a generation. A crucial midterm election just 43 days away. A much-needed victory for a White House under siege. And a major test of the #MeToo movement.But what hasn\u2019t attracted much attention is how Congress\u2019s handling of the matter has done little to help its rock-bottom reputation among the public.Consider this: The Kavanaugh hearing is a high-profile test of the Senate\u2019s duty to \u201cadvise and consent,\u201d or act as an essential check on the White House. That responsibility, laid out in the Constitution, is a key part of the job.Not doing it would be like a babysitter opting out of changing diapers. It\u2019s not the whole thing, but it\u2019s a pretty essential part of the gig.Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, told me this afternoon that the hearing was \u201cjust another emblematic signal of how broken down \u2018advise and consent\u2019 has become. They\u2019re frozen.\u201dOne of the biggest points of contention in the negotiations between the Judiciary Committee and lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Mr. Kavanaugh of sexual assault, is who will actually do the questioning.The Republican side of the Senate Judiciary Committee is composed exclusively of white men. So, obviously, the optics aren\u2019t great.Republicans would prefer to use an outside lawyer or a committee aide \u2014 and most definitely a woman. Lawyers for Dr. Blasey opposed the idea, arguing it would make the hearing feel more like a trial. Democrats have said they plan to ask their own questions.And some top Republicans have changed their tone on the matter, pivoting from the importance of letting Dr. Blasey speak to labeling her claims as little more than a Democratic-led smear campaign.\u201cSenate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man\u2019s personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations,\u201d Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said on Monday afternoon. \u201cThis is what the so-called \u2018resistance\u2019 has become. A smear campaign, pure and simple.\u201dWith the political stakes so high, the risk of having Republicans question Dr. Blasey is obvious. Between a historically wide gender gap and a president not exactly known for his sensitivities when it comes to these issues, Republicans recognize that they have a serious problem with women.Of course, they don\u2019t want to risk making it any worse. But their efforts to stanch the political pain could leave Congress bleeding.\u201cIt\u2019s just another sign that, certainly, the majority here seems ill-equipped to deal with this type of huge pothole in the road,\u201d said Ms. Binder____________________What happens to the Mueller investigation?It could be in trouble.Mr. Rosenstein, who appointed Robert S. Mueller III, has said he would refuse unfounded orders to fire the special counsel. But the attorney general in charge of the investigation does have the power to end it \u2014 or fire the person running it. A successor more loyal to President Trump might do just that.Who takes over?The acting deputy attorney general would be Matthew G. Whitaker, the chief of staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. But it\u2019s complicated. The Justice Department has a rule against \u201cdouble acting\u201d officials \u2014 basically, the acting deputy attorney general can\u2019t also be the acting attorney general for the Russia investigation. (Remember, Mr. Sessions recused himself from the case).Because of that, the succession line for the Russia investigation runs next to Noel J. Francisco, the solicitor general. There\u2019s a caveat there, too: Mr. Francisco\u2019s former law firm, Jones Day, is representing the Trump campaign in the special counsel investigation.Who might Trump choose as a replacement? When a Senate-confirmed official \u201cdies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office,\u201d the president can temporarily replace them with another Senate-confirmed executive branch official. But, again, while Mr. Trump has plenty of loyalists inside the executive branch, that \u201cdouble acting\u201d rule could make things complicated.____________________Is there ever an advantage, as a politician, to not showing up at all?The governor\u2019s race in Alaska \u2014 a three-way competition between an independent incumbent, a Democrat and a Republican \u2014 is testing out the question in repeated no-shows by the Republican, Mike Dunleavy, in scheduled debates and speaking events.At least twice in recent weeks, an empty microphone marked Mr. Dunleavy\u2019s place on stage as Gov. Bill Walker and Mark Begich, a former United States senator, took questions from audience members and moderators.Mr. Dunleavy, a former state senator, has said debate organizers knew of his scheduling conflicts.But having written about Alaskan politics for years as The Times\u2019s correspondent in the Pacific Northwest, I can also see that, however awkward it might look in the moment (and in news coverage), being AWOL might actually rebound to Mr. Dunleavy\u2019s benefit on Election Day.Mr. Walker, a former Republican, has led the state with a Democrat as his lieutenant governor, and more often than not with support from Democrats in the Legislature. The Walker administration has been aggressive in addressing climate change, and recently announced its opposition to the confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Mr. Begich, a former mayor of Anchorage, appeals to many of the same voters.And so a Republican strategy has emerged: highlight, as much as possible, the idea that voters have a choice between a real Democrat in Mr. Begich, a sort-of-Democrat in Mr. Walker, and a genuinely different conservative choice in Mr. Dunleavy. The more that Mr. Begich and Mr. Walker duke it out \u2014 with an empty chair between them \u2014 the deeper those lines, in splitting the Democratic-leaning vote, can be drawn.Read Kirk\u2019s latest story on Alaska, and its \u2018Year Without a Sam\u2019s Club,\u2019 here._____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

Pecker, a confidant of President Trump and chief executive of American Media Inc., publisher of The National Enquirer, to purchase three Time Inc. titles.In a statement, the Des Moines-based Meredith echoed that Time would maintain editorial independence, and made it clear that the deal had nothing to do with Salesforce.\u201cThe Benioffs are purchasing Time personally and the transaction is unrelated to Salesforce.com, where Mr. Benioff is chairman, co-C.E.O. and founder,\u201d Meredith said in its release.Mr. Benioff, 53, whose net worth has been estimated at more than $6 billion by Forbes, confirmed the agreement in a Twitter post on Sunday, saying he and his wife were \u201chonored to be stewards of this iconic brand.\u201d\u201cThe power of Time has always been in its unique storytelling of the people & issues that affect us all & connect us all,\u201d Mr. Benioff wrote. \u201cA treasure trove of our history & culture.\u201dMeredith, which specializes in home and lifestyle magazines like Better Homes & Gardens, had owned Time for less than a year.The magazine\u2019s sale, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was a long time coming. Meredith announced in March that it was seeking a buyer for Time, as well as other former Time Inc. titles: Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated.Each of those magazines has undergone its own extensive search for the right buyer, with more than 100 parties expressing interest, according to Art Slusark, a Meredith spokesman. He added that the company was close to selling Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated, but declined to elaborate. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very measured and formal process,\u201d he said.Time will continue to be based in New York, Mr. Felsenthal said. And, despite speculation that the print edition could cease to exist, he said Time will continue to be centered on the print magazine, which now has over two million paid subscribers.\u201cThe print product is the foundation that we\u2019re building everything else on,\u201d he said.As an owner, Mr. Benioff stands in stark contrast to the humble, Midwest-based Meredith Corp., which started in 1902 with Successful Farming magazine.An impassioned and eccentric billionaire, even by Silicon Valley standards, Mr. Benioff was drawn to computers at an early age. He interned at Apple as a college student, and became a top salesman at Oracle, the enterprise software company. After burning out at Oracle, he traveled to India, decided to leave the company, and co-founded Salesforce in 1999. Today, Salesforce, a pioneer in the business model of offering software as a service, is worth some $120 billion. The San Francisco company occupies the new Salesforce Tower, the tallest office building west of Mississippi.\u201cWe don\u2019t plan to be operational or involved in editorial,\u201d he wrote in a text message. \u201cWe are only stewards of a historic and iconic brand.\u201dBoth Mr. Felsenthal and Mr. Benioff said Time is profitable. But overall profits at the Time Inc. brands have sagged in recent years. In March, Meredith said that over the next 10 months it planned to lay off 1,000 employees of the former Time Inc. magazines.Meredith agreed to purchase Time Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.8 billion last November, and the deal was made final on Jan. 31. The deal came to fruition with the help of an infusion of $650 million from the private equity arm of Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire brothers known for using their wealth and political connections to advance conservative causes.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long couple of years and a challenging time in media and at Time Inc.,\u201d Mr. Felsenthal said.Advertisement"}
