{"Headline": "So Now You Own a Home. Do You Know How to Maintain it?", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHome maintenance classes can help you save money and be smarter about what needs to be done to keep your new home in shape. After the heady early days of homeownership wear off, first-time buyers often quickly realize that they lack even the most basic skills needed to take care of their new home. For New Yorkers accustomed to calling the super for every repair, using a drill to hang drapes or an Allen wrench to fix a leaky faucet can be nearly as daunting as the idea of performing brain surgery. You can get all the inspiration you need from do-it-yourself shows and videos, but what if you don\u2019t know how to properly hammer a nail and don\u2019t even own the right tools?This is where home repair classes can help, giving uninitiated homeowners hands-on training. Courses cover a range of skills, from basic home maintenance to more elaborate tasks like tiling a bathroom, installing locks and repairing or replacing drywall.First, she was irked when a tiler took five days to tile her small kitchen floor; then an electrician disappeared after disconnecting the electricity in her two-family home in Bayside, Queens. That is when it dawned on Ms. McCabe: \u201cI trust myself, and I am handy,\u201d she said. \u201cI can learn to do some of this on my own.\u201d Comfortable around tools, because her father had been a carpenter, Ms. McCabe has taken five classes this year and has used her newfound skills to re-grout her bathroom tiles and fix a lawn mower. \u201cMost people are intimidated with using tools, but taking a hands-on class really boosted my confidence,\u201d she said. She estimated that she has saved about $3,000 so far, just by learning how to do simple home repairs herself. Just as learning how to save for and finance a home is important to financial literacy, educating yourself on how to maintain your home will not only give you a sense of mastery, but can also help you save money on repairs. And you\u2019ll have a better sense of when you need to call a professional. The beginners\u2019 repair classes at City Tech \u2014 which include Homeowner\u2019s Basic Tool Kit and Everyday Electricity You Can Do Yourself \u2014 cost $70 for a one-time, three-hour night class at the school\u2019s Downtown Brooklyn location. That is not a lot of money when you consider that it could save you hundreds of dollars a year, said Debra Salomon, a City Tech program director in the division of continuing education. The Woodside-based community development corporation has classes on first-time home buying and financial literacy, offers foreclosure service and, for about 20 years, has offered an eight-week home maintenance course. The course costs $175 and is held on the second floor of a Sterling National Bank branch in Woodside. \u201cKnowing how to fix simple things in your home empowers you,\u201d Ms. Genao-Estrella said, especially if you are a low- or moderate-income homeowner. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of finally being able to own your home, but you go into debt because you\u2019re always hiring someone to fix everything?\u201dMs. Genao-Estrella has taken the course herself. When her home in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn was damaged by Hurricane Sandy almost six years ago, she hired a contractor to fix the structural damage and a plumber for other repairs, but the plumbing problems kept reoccurring.\u201cI\u2019m not saying I need to become a plumber myself, but I felt I was getting the short end of the stick every time I was having a conversation, especially as a woman,\u201d she said. Knowing how your house works is important, she added, because you can be more specific about repair requests when hiring someone.And that doesn\u2019t just apply to homeowners: Among the students who have taken the class have been a number of renters, she said: \u201cI think some people have landlords that don\u2019t fix things right away.\u201d The class size was small \u2014 between three and six people, depending on the week \u2014 said Ms. Sandiford, an insurance auditor. Classes are held at the organization\u2019s headquarters in Centereach, N.Y., and the fee depends on a family\u2019s size and income, but is never more than $80. Ms. Sandiford\u2019s instructors were licensed contractors who taught her how to repair and replace Sheetrock, how to lay tile and the basics of plumbing. Before taking the class, she said, she felt like she was \u201cthrowing money out the window\u201d on small repair jobs: \u201cIt\u2019s just good to have the knowledge of how the small things in your house work. Now I want to do more.\u201dTricia Gleaton, vice president of the organization\u2019s homeownership center, said many of the students who sign up for the class have never picked up a hammer, and students include both singles and couples, some of whom have bought fixer-uppers nearby.Premium courses are being offered for the first time this year, for $89 to about $200. They last a few weeks, and students can ask their instructors specific questions online. The courses include kitchen cabinetry making and building your own tiny house, and some courses come with blueprints and other materials. About 70 percent of the nearly 4,000 students who have taken DIY University\u2019s online classes have been male, and students range in age from 35 to 70, Ms. Werneken said. Some of the older students have taken the class to fix up their homes before selling them, she said, but the younger students seem to have embraced a \u201cDIY holistic-homeownership lifestyle\u201d to mirror that of the popular hosts of some DIY television shows. Raya Fliker, a homeowner in Port Monmouth, N.J., took a class on wood-finishing at DIY University, and also learned how to tile a kitchen backsplash. With her newfound knowledge, Ms. Fliker built a simple bench to fit into a small nook in her back entryway. She also built a plywood countertop to cover up a granite top on a kitchen island that she didn\u2019t like. Ms. Fliker, a nurse and mother of three, preferred taking classes online, she said, because she could do it whenever she had time, and the instructors taught her specific tasks that she wanted to learn. \u201cI have loved how every project has turned out, and my husband is now buying tools for me,\u201d said Ms. Flicker, who recently refurbished a mudroom for a friend\u2019s house. Not every project has gone smoothly, of course. Although she wanted to install a new kitchen backsplash, the granite border on her kitchen counter was extremely difficult to remove, she said. When she pried off a small portion near the refrigerator, Ms. Fliker ended up with a big hole. \u201cIt was too hard for me to handle, so I fixed the hole and painted over it,\u201d she said, after watching a YouTube tutorial. Then she abandoned the backsplash project. \u201cUnderstanding the mechanics of things helped a lot,\u201d said Mr. Rearick, who lives in a single-family house in Kensington, Brooklyn. He has since patched up a large hole in his third-floor hallway, damage that happened years ago, after his son and a friend had an impromptu basketball game there. More recently, he replaced a leaking water valve in the basement, which cost him about five dollars. \u201cI did wonder, if I hadn\u2019t fixed that myself, would I have paid someone to do it for me for $200?\u201d he said.Mr. Rearick repeated the same class this spring \u2014 a seven-week course currently held at the Flatbush YMCA, for $175 \u2014 as a refresher. \u201cBesides saving money, there are emotional benefits of being able to fix things yourself,\u201d he said. Both he and Ms. McCabe, in Queens, said they were eager to take more advanced classes. Ms. McCabe said she was interested in hanging a new chandelier in her dining room, installing other light fixtures and changing out some old doors. Making mistakes in the classroom was key, she said. Her instructor, Peter Grech, who has worked as a superintendent for residential buildings in the city for more than 40 years, reminded her that screwing up the installation of one 20-cent tile \u201cis no big whoop.\u201d As she put it, \u201cHe taught us in a way that made me believe I can do it, and it worked.\u201d Mr. Grech, who also trains superintendents, makes a point of teaching his students when they should call a licensed professional. One example: You can fix leaky faucets and clogged drains yourself, he said, but you shouldn\u2019t try to move pipes. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line of being confident and doing things yourself, but you shouldn\u2019t get in over your head,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re afraid of doing your first project in your own home, I tell all my students to do it at your in-laws\u2019 house first.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "App-Only Banks Rise in Europe and Aim at Traditional Lenders", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Greg Stevenson was trying to refinance the mortgage on his four-bedroom home in eastern England when things started going awry. An attempt by his bank, TSB, to shift data to a new computer system had gone spectacularly wrong. For several maddening days, he could not connect to his account, transfer funds or reach anybody at the bank for help.\u201cI felt abandoned,\u201d said Mr. Stevenson, a 31-year-old software developer. \u201cI needed to be moving money around, and I needed access to my bank.\u201dThe systems failure in April, affecting nearly two million TSB customers, was a breaking point for Mr. Stevenson. He moved his money to Monzo, a British start-up that is among a growing number in Europe offering checking accounts and A.T.M. cards, but lack physical branches \u2014 everything is done through an app.So-called fintech companies have sought to take on the world\u2019s biggest banks for years, but only recently have companies like Monzo begun to build a critical mass. Millions of customers across Europe, most in their 20s or 30s, have signed up over the past two years. And thanks to favorable regulations in the region and an influx of venture capital, that shift is accelerating.Here in Britain, officials have been concerned about the power of large banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and they see the start-ups as weakening the hold of traditional lenders. The authorities have adopted policies such as a \u201cregulatory sandbox,\u201d allowing what are known as challenger banks to test new financial products and get feedback from regulators before proposing them to customers.Support from regulators in Europe has given momentum to companies entering the market there. In addition to making slicker apps, the companies have slashed fees for spending overseas and wiring money. Last year, Monzo became one of the first challenger banks to receive a license allowing it to hold customers\u2019 deposits on its own, a milestone no start-up in the United States has achieved.\u201cOur regulator is pretty forward thinking,\u201d said Tom Blomfield, 33, the co-founder and chief executive of Monzo, referring to Britain.Finance hasn\u2019t been immune to the technological change reshaping many other industries. Consumers and businesses are using new payment services and online lenders, and hedge funds are increasingly relying on complex algorithms.But Mr. Blomfield \u2014 who sat for an interview at his London apartment after walking the office dog, a cockapoo named Bingo \u2014 argues that day-to-day retail banking has been relatively unaffected.Monzo, like other start-up banks, still has to figure out how to be profitable. But it has already begun to reimagine banking for an increasingly cashless society. Customers of the future won\u2019t need branches when they can text a customer service representative. Detailed spending breakdowns help account holders control their spending. Doing without retail space and tellers keeps costs down, allowing the company to reduce fees and hire programmers.\u201cThe internet lets you run these traditional businesses at a fraction of the cost,\u201d Mr. Blomfield said.Monzo got started with crowdfunding and remains a minnow compared with the giants of British banking, but customers \u2014 notably younger, wealthier ones \u2014 are signing up. Roughly 75 percent of Monzo\u2019s 900,000 clients are under 40, split evenly between men and women. On average, they make more than 50,000 pounds, or about $65,000, a year, nearly double the median British salary, and Monzo is adding more than 2,000 customers a day.Digital banks face innumerable issues, though. Chief among them is how they will make money. A slick app and basic checking accounts are unlikely to be enough, unless they can offer services like mortgages and other loans that come with higher interest rates.As they expand, these start-ups will also face more regulatory scrutiny and targeting by fraudsters. Traditional banks must ensure, for example, that a certain proportion of the deposits they hold are kept in reserve, as a safety net. Such policies help guarantee that a bank will not lose its customers\u2019 money, but they make it harder to turn a profit. Now that Monzo holds customer deposits, it must also meet these requirements.Start-ups also have to fight inertia. People rarely change banks, whether because of an existing mortgage or the headache of updating a Netflix account. Less than a quarter of Monzo\u2019s customers deposit their paychecks into their accounts; most use it as an add-on, to take advantage of perks like cheaper foreign exchange transactions. Even Mr. Stevenson, who does his day-to-day banking with Monzo, had to go to another local lender to refinance.\u201cThe big question is, will millions of people switch their primary transaction accounts, where their checks get deposited and where they pay their bills, and do their key transactions,\u201d said Hans Morris, a former executive at Citigroup and Visa who now manages Nyca, a New York venture capital fund. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a historical bet, you would say that they aren\u2019t going to switch.\u201dMr. Blomfield is confident his company\u2019s young customer base will eventually turn to Monzo for other, more lucrative, financial services that it intends to eventually offer.Monzo plans to announce in coming weeks that it is raising about \u00a3100 million, at a valuation of more than \u00a31 billion, according to two people familiar with the deal. The deal will make it one of the biggest start-ups in Europe, and Monzo will use the funds to help enter the United States as early as next year.Revolut, another banking start-up, has more than 2.75 million customers across Europe, and it is adding 7,000 each day. After raising $250 million in April, it, too, wants to offer services in the United States.Government policies there are more constraining, however. As a result, most fintech firms in the United States have focused on payment services like Square, and mobile money transfers like Venmo, though companies including Chime have entered partnerships with licensed lenders to offer banking accounts more like Monzo.Still, investors in Europe have been won over. A record $1.2 billion has been pumped into banking start-ups globally so far this year, 70 percent of which has gone to European companies. That is more than double last year\u2019s figure, and a tenfold increase on the amount invested in 2014, according to CB Insights, a market research firm.Martin Mignot, a partner at Index Ventures and a member of Revolut\u2019s board of directors, said TSB\u2019s systems failure this year encapsulated the issues traditional banks face: costly retail space and slow, legacy computer systems. Revolut and others are more nimble than their older, larger competitors. \u201cIt\u2019s a different mind-set,\u201d he said.Even some who once felt that app-based banks were a gimmick have been won over.\u201cI was a bit skeptical, but I\u2019m definitely a convert,\u201d said Sinead Loftus, a legal assistant in Ireland who joined Revolut after growing frustrated with her local bank\u2019s fees. \u201cI\u2019ve convinced my mom to get one, I told all my co-workers to get one, I got my boss one.\u201dAdvertisement"}

DeVos, the Amway Corporation co-founder who built and used one of the 20th century\u2019s great personal fortunes to bolster the Republican Party, restore civic vitality to his hometown, Grand Rapids, Mich., and buy the Orlando Magic of the National Basketball Association, died on Thursday. He was 92.An evangelical Christian who espoused the virtues of self-reliance, capitalism and the free market, Mr. DeVos was above all a superb salesman. He joined Jay Van Andel, his friend and business partner for 55 years, in marketing the concept of direct sales and turned the privately owned Amway Corporation into a global enterprise with more than $8.6 billion in sales in 2017, more than 17,000 employees and hundreds of thousands of independent salespeople.At his death, Mr. DeVos and his family had an estimated net worth of $5.5 billion. His daughter-in-law Betsy DeVos is education secretary in the Trump administration.In 1996 he was honored at a $3 million Republican fund-raising event in Washington at which former Senator Bob Dole extolled his influence in the anti-abortion movement and in compelling the party to embrace evangelical doctrine to build a political majority.President Gerald R. Ford, a native of Grand Rapids, was one of Mr. DeVos\u2019s friends. Mr. DeVos also advised Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. He was a member of Reagan\u2019s AIDS commission and helped develop the weekly presidential radio address when he agreed to carry Reagan\u2019s Saturday noon broadcasts on the Mutual Broadcasting System, which was then owned by Amway.Mr. DeVos\u2019s ideas about \u201ccompassionate capitalism,\u201d which were explored in his 1994 book by the same title, were an important source for George W. Bush\u2019s \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d campaign slogan in 2000.Mr. DeVos was an engaged philanthropist, particularly for educational, religious and civic projects in Grand Rapids, where he was born and raised. Calvin College in Grand Rapids, which he attended, was a beneficiary of Mr. DeVos\u2019s gift-giving, as was the Christian Reformed Church.In recent years Grand Rapids, Michigan\u2019s second-largest city, has experienced a civic and business revival in large part because of the investments that Mr. DeVos and Mr. Van Andel made to restore historic structures.In addition, a new downtown campus for Grand Valley State University, a new civic center and the DeVos Children\u2019s Hospital, regarded as one of the leading pediatric hospitals in the nation, all bear Mr. DeVos\u2019s name.Mr. DeVos bought the Orlando Magic for $80 million in 1991, in part because he saw that owning an N.B.A. team would provide a more visible platform for what Pat Williams, his biographer and now a senior vice president of the team, said was \u201chis message of success through faith, optimism, perseverance and hard work.\u201dMr. DeVos regularly spoke to his players and counseled many of them, including Shaquille O\u2019Neal.Since the purchase, the team has won five division championships and two Eastern Conference titles but has not won a championship. In 1998, Mr. DeVos purchased the Orlando Miracle of the W.N.B.A.Richard Marvin DeVos was born in Grand Rapids on March 4, 1926, to Simon and Ethel (Dekker) DeVos. He attributed much of his entrepreneurial spirit and his down-to-earth personal style to his father, an electrician who was fired after years on the job and died of a heart attack in 1962, when he was just 59.\u201cOwn your own business son,\u201d his father had advised. \u201cOwn it. Work hard at it. Set high goals for yourself and never give up, no matter what.\u201dMr. DeVos met Mr. Van Andel, his future business partner, as a student at the private Grand Rapids Christian High School. Mr. Van Andel was two years older and owned a car, and Mr. DeVos paid his friend 25 cents a week for a ride to school and back. During those rides the two discussed someday forming a business.They both attended Calvin College, where Mr. DeVos met Helen Van Wesep, whom he married in 1953.Mr. DeVos and Mr. Van Andel left college to serve in the Army Air Corps during World War II. When they returned, they started Wolverine Air Service, their first joint venture. Several more businesses followed, including a failed charter schooner service, which almost led to their drowning, as well as a drive-in restaurant and a distributorship for a California-based marketer of vitamins and nutritional products.That last experience led to the founding in 1959 of the Amway Corporation, which used a similar manufacturing and direct sales strategy to market household products, including their first, a biodegradable detergent.Mr. DeVos is survived by three sons, Dick (Betsy DeVos\u2019s husband), Dan and Doug; a daughter, Cheri DeVos; two sisters, Bernice Heys and Janice Courts; 16 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. His wife died in 2017.Dick DeVos succeeded his father as president of Amway in 1993 and was followed by Doug DeVos in 2002. Steve Van Andel succeeded his father as chairman. In 2000 the families established Alticor, a new parent company, and Amway became one of three subsidiaries.Mr. DeVos, who was hampered by health problems much of his adult life, underwent a successful heart transplant in 1997. The experience deepened his religious belief and business fervor and led him to write five inspirational and autobiographical books and to give motivational speeches.\u201cMy dad inspired me to believe that there are opportunities all around us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can seize them whenever they come our way. So if you fail at something, you don\u2019t have to despair. There\u2019s another opportunity for success just around the corner.\u201dDaniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s China Fight Puts U.S. Tech in the Cross Hairs", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says his trade war with China will protect America\u2019s dominance and derail Beijing\u2019s plan for technological and economic supremacy.Mr. Trump\u2019s next round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods goes into effect on Monday, hitting thousands of consumer products from handbags to refrigerators to bicycles. The tariffs will also hit the tech and telecom companies that provide much of the gear that powers the internet, mobile networks, data storage and other technology. United States customs will begin collecting a tax on circuit boards, semiconductors, cell tower radios, modems and other products made and assembled in China and exported into America.Those tariffs, Intel warned in a letter last month, are \u201ca game changer for the American consumer.\u201d The tariffs begin at a rate of 10 percent and increase to 25 percent next January.Like American automakers and other manufacturers, the tech sector has increasingly outsourced production to China, where manufacturing and assembly of products is cheaper than in the United States. In recent decades, Intel, Dell, and Apple began shifting manufacturing overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and align operations closer to customers in emerging markets.Intel, for instance, designs and manufactures most semiconductors in the United States but relies on Chinese facilities for assembly of their chips, which will now be taxed. Moving those manufacturing and assembly operations outside of China is unrealistic, the company has warned, saying \u201cit is too expensive to relocate established and integrated supply chains.\u201dGoogle, Dell, IBM and others say the tariffs will increase costs for companies and consumers, hindering America\u2019s ability to dominate the next generation of technology, like 5G wireless networks. Rising prices, the industries say, will slow business growth, increase costs for consumers and put other nations, like China, in a more competitive position to dominate tech.\u201cThe tariffs affect the heart of the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank financed by tech companies including Microsoft, Google and Intel. \u201cIf we are going to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, we should impose them on items that hurt the Chinese, not us.\u201dMr. Trump does not share that view, seeing the tariffs as a weapon to force China to change trade practices that the administration \u2014 and many companies, including tech firms \u2014 say are unfair.\u201cChina is engaged in numerous unfair policies and practices relating to United States technology and intellectual property \u2014 such as forcing United States companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement last week.Tech companies agree that China has long pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business in China or engaged in outright theft of intellectual property. But they argue that using tariffs as a retaliatory measure will hurt American companies while doing little to change China\u2019s ways.Tech and telecommunications products are among the fastest growing imports from China. In 2014, electronics accounted for 40 percent of all Chinese imports, according to the United States International Trade Commission. While the total value of telecommunications parts affected by the latest round of tariffs is unclear, the Telecommunications Industry Association estimates \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in extra costs for companies.The impact on the industry is amplified by the timing, as the United States and China race one another to dominate the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks, known as 5G. The faster networks will fuel the use of artificial intelligence in driverless cars and robotics and other technologies used by military. Companies have warned that the administration\u2019s tariffs will undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s stated plan to lead in those areas.\u201cThese latest duties threaten to raise the cost of 5G infrastructure in the U.S. by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Nokia officials told the F.C.C., according to public filings.\u201cOf course, this is related to some of the product that we import into the U.S. that is manufactured in China, and we are very much focused on mitigating that manufacturing,\u201d Micron\u2019s chief executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in an interview on CNBC.Other companies are weighing legal options. A leading trade group, the Consumer Technology Association, which represents 2,000 tech companies, said the administration is overstepping its authority on trade policy and is considering legal action against the administration.\u201cWe are exploring all options,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the association\u2019s president, said when asked if his group would sue the administration. \u201cThe tariffs will stifle our global leadership in 5G, create and internet tax on business and cause uncertainty for companies.\u201dThe inclusion of tech products only increased tension between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Silicon Valley has sparred with Mr. Trump on immigration. Mr. Trump accused tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google of political bias against conservatives and Amazon of avoiding tax payments. The companies have refuted the president\u2019s claims.Some companies have been partially spared. After intense lobbying by Apple and Fitbit, the Trump administration removed several consumer electronics products from the latest round of tariffs. Left off the list are technologies that affect Apple\u2019s Watch and other fitness trackers, AirPod earbuds and wireless speakers. The administration spared a total of 300 products from an earlier proposal drafted in July.On Friday, a senior administration official who has been engaged in trade negotiations defended the decision to offer relief to Apple\u2019s products. In a briefing with reporters at the White House, the official rejected the notion that winners and losers were being determined based on lobbying power.\u201cThis has been talked about a lot as an Apple issue, Apple has been very vocal about it, but the tariff lines that have been exempted, they applied to a whole range of companies in addition to Apple,\u201d the official said, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the trade battle with China would be resolved.When asked about the exemptions of Apple\u2019s products, Mr. Cook said that while the iPhone is assembled in China, many parts are made and developed in the United States. The tariffs would cost a company like Apple when it imports devices assembled in China.\u201cI think they looked at this and said that it\u2019s not really great for the United States to put a tariff on those type of products,\u201d Mr. Cook said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Nokia\u2019s headquarters. It is Finland, not Sweden.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Tips to Have Better Conversations", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBe genuine. Be interested. And stop hogging the conversation.We all want to be charming, witty conversationalists who can work a room and give people the comfort that they\u2019ve been truly listened to.But how?Being someone people enjoy talking with really boils down to being genuine and being genuinely interested. But that\u2019s much easier said than done, so here are three concrete tips from Jen that will help you become a more engaged \u2014 and enjoyable \u2014 conversation partner.Tier one is safe territory: sports, the weather, pop culture, local celebrities and any immediate shared experience.Tier two is potentially controversial: religion, politics, dating and love lives. \u201cTest the waters, and back away if they\u2019re not interested,\u201d one expert told Jen.Tier three includes the most intimate topics: family, finance, health and work life. \u201cSome people love to talk about what they do and their kids, but don\u2019t ask a probing question until the door has been opened,\u201d said Daniel Post Senning, an etiquette expert and the great-great-grandson of Emily Post.Note also that while \u201cSo, what do you do?\u201d is a pretty common and acceptable question in America, in Europe it\u2019s as banal as watching paint dry. Instead, ask \u201cWhat keeps you busy?\u201dDon\u2019t enter a conversation with the intent of leaving everyone in stitches, unless perhaps you\u2019re a professional comedian.\u201cIf you just talk a lot you might get exhausted, but if you ask questions and listen and draw people out, they\u2019ll think you\u2019re a great conversationalist,\u201d she said.\u201cFor me it comes down to being aware that I should be more interested than I should be interesting,\u201d said Akash Karia, a speaker and performance coach who has written books including \u201cSmall Talk Hacks: The People Skills & Communication Skills You Need to Talk to Anyone & Be Instantly Likeable.\u201dWe\u2019ve all been involved in those irritating conversations where we can never get a word in edgewise.

{"Headline": "Are Landlords Telling the Truth? The City Doesn\u2019t Always Check. He Does.", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn New York City, landlords looking to renovate are supposed to tell the Buildings Department whether their tenants are protected by rent regulations. The idea is to prevent harassment by owners seeking to force renters out in order to charge more. But the Buildings Department does not always check to see if the landlords are telling the truth.Aaron Carr, however, does.Mr. Carr, 30, is the founder of a start-up tenant watchdog agency, the Housing Rights Initiative, and his specialty is searching public records at state and city agencies to expose what he says is a broken system of tenant protections.On Monday, Mr. Carr\u2019s latest report is scheduled to be released at a news conference on the steps of City Hall with City Councilman Ritchie Torres of the Bronx. According to H.R.I.\u2019s research, on more than 10,000 building permits filed with the city over the past two years, landlords lied about whether there were rent-regulated tenants in their buildings \u2014 and got away with it.Mr. Torres said that the city, which has made affordable housing a priority, should shoulder an equal amount of the blame. \u201cJust as scandalous as the number of falsified permits is the failure of enforcement by the Department of Buildings,\u201d he said.City officials said that H.R.I.\u2019s claims are overblown. The Buildings Department has not seen the latest report, but a spokesman, Joseph Soldevere, said that 10,000 permits represent only 3 percent of all the permits issued by the department over the two years in question.And while the buildings department is hiring 70 new inspectors, he said that a landlord who mistakenly checks the wrong box on a permit application is not necessarily breaking the law.\u201cEvery day, the Buildings Department holds landlords accountable for their obligation to provide safe buildings for tenants, both on our own and through our work on the city-state Tenant Harassment Prevention Task Force,\u201d Mr. Soldevere said.In its scant two-year existence, H.R.I. has had an oversized impact on landlord-tenant relations: Mr. Carr\u2019s group has issued a series of scathing reports on bad behavior by landlords, enabled by what it says is the failure of state and city government to hold them accountable.In March, Mr. Carr issued a report claiming that Kushner Companies had falsified more than 80 work permit applications for 34 buildings. In July, 20 current and former tenants working with H.R.I. filed a lawsuit against the Kushners saying that they were forced out of their apartments at 184 Kent Avenue in Brooklyn by construction work that filled the building with \u201cloud and obnoxious drilling\u201d and a \u201cconstant cloud of toxic smoke and dust.\u201d\u201cThis is the beauty of our model, which is low cost, high impact,\u201d Mr. Carr said as he fiddled with his ubiquitous laptop. \u201cIt\u2019s all about publicly available data and connecting tenants to no-out-of-pocket legal support.\u201dLucas A. Ferrara of Newman Ferrara, the law firm representing the tenants in the Kushner suit said, \u201cAaron has probably done more for rent-regulated tenants in New York City over the past three years than the city and state agencies have done in the last 20 years.\u201dBut Adam Leitman Bailey, a lawyer representing or advising landlords in a number of the lawsuits, has a different perspective. \u201cAaron Carr is a very dangerous young man with his tongue,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone, aside from Donald Trump, who can manipulate the press as well as he does. At the same time, he is hurting and damaging the reputations of many innocent and reputable landlords.\u201dMr. Bailey, who is well known for vigorously defending his clients in both the courts and the media, contends that many of the H.R.I.-inspired lawsuits are \u201cfrivolous.\u201dThe State Supreme Court tossed out on technical grounds an H.R.I.-born class-action lawsuit against a company called Big City Properties claiming that the Harlem landlord had violated rent regulations at 11 buildings and inflated rents by overstating the cost of apartment improvements.But the state\u2019s Appellate Division recently reinstated many of the claims against Big City. Worried that the decision would make it easier for tenants to sue landlords, the industry\u2019s powerful lobbyist, the Rent Stabilization Association, has asked permission to join a possible appeal by Big City to the state\u2019s highest court.Mr. Carr, who grew up on Long Island and lives on the Upper West Side, did not start out as a tenant activist. He graduated from the University of Connecticut with a degree in psychology.In 2014, he ran Michael Blake\u2019s successful campaign for an Assembly seat in the South Bronx and subsequently became Mr. Blake\u2019s chief of staff. In that role, Mr. Carr said he would repeatedly call city and state agencies on behalf of tenants tangling with landlords, pleading for inspectors to visit their buildings.\u201cIt was like waiting for Superman,\u201d Mr. Carr said, \u201cbut Superman never came.\u201dMr. Carr formed H.R.I. in 2016 with \u201ca couple thousand dollars\u201d of his own money, and has relied on a \u201cbottom-up enforcement approach\u201d of scrutinizing records at the city\u2019s Finance and Building departments and the state\u2019s Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which oversees the city\u2019s one million rent-regulated apartments.Today, H.R.I. has two full-time and one part-time employees, including Mr. Carr, and a budget of $225,000, much of which comes from individual donations and the Robin Hood Foundation, a charity dedicated to fighting poverty.Robin Hood\u2019s board includes Jeff T. Blau, chief executive of Related Companies, one of the city\u2019s biggest developers; and Paul Tudor Jones II, a hedge fund manager.The bulk of the lawsuits filed have been related to violations of the city\u2019s J-51 housing program, which grants tax breaks to landlords of rental apartments who invest in new roofs, boilers and elevators. Building owners are prohibited from deregulating apartments as long as they receive the tax benefits.In one H.R.I.-initiated lawsuit, against Argo Real Estate, a building owner and property manager, lawyers contend that Argo improperly deregulated 369 rent-regulated apartments at nine buildings in Queens, while getting more than $1 million in tax breaks.A lawyer for Argo, which has not responded to the complaint, declined to comment. One of the lawyers who brought the suit, Shaina Weissman, said that the two sides have been in settlement discussions, but that little progress had been made.Mr. Carr and H.R.I. have not left the state, which oversees rent-regulated housing, off the hook.In May, Mr. Carr sued the state for refusing to release the names of \u201ccheating landlords\u201d who have been caught defrauding the J-51 program in audits that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s administration began in 2016. The suit sought to compel the Division of Housing and Community Renewal to release the names.Mr. Carr complained that legislators do not have the will to enforce the laws already on the books, because a steady flow of political contributions at a state level come from the real estate industry.\u201cNew York State\u2019s broken campaign finance laws have turned housing enforcement into a real estate protection system,\u201d he said.H.R.I. also says city agencies have failed to aggressively go after unscrupulous landlords. This month, Mr. Carr released a report saying that the city has failed to collect $1.5 billion in fines from landlords for violations ranging from \u201cloose rubbish\u201d to failure to notify authorities of asbestos, including more than $350,000 it said was owed by the Kushner Companies.Aziza Taylor, a spokeswoman for the city\u2019s Department of Finance, said that H.R.I. has \u201csurfaced a legitimate issue regarding the difficulty in collecting\u201d fines from landlords. Officials acknowledge that there often are disconnects in the system designed to protect tenants, with city and state agencies using different data systems, and poor communication between the city agencies that issue violations and the Finance Department, which is supposed to collect the fines.A building\u2019s owner is often a limited liability company and a landlord may hold numerous buildings, each in a separate L.L.C.; the finance department often does not know the name of the company or individual behind them.Ms. Taylor said the agency is proud of the work it has done in recent years to get landlords to pay their fines.According to the Finance Department, the Kushners owe $197,000 in unpaid fines, but have paid $108,000 in penalties issued for the past eight years.The Kushners, who have described many of the building violations Mr. Carr has unearthed as \u201cpaperwork errors,\u201d or problems created by tenants themselves, declined to comment.Mr. Carr said he is not obsessed with the Kushners, but they are a convenient foil to get media attention for government\u2019s lax enforcement of laws protecting tenants.\u201cSometimes a sleepy government needs a very big wake-up call,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is notable that while our state and city government have been out \u2018resisting\u2019 the White House, it has allowed landlords like Kushner to invade its own house. Our existence is a window into a broken enforcement system and a broken democratic system.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The territory hugging the Hudson River took its name from an early Dutch trader, Jan Peeck (\u201ckill\u201d means creek in Dutch).A day trip to this historic city, about 40 miles north of New York City, takes an hour or so by train. Comfortable shoes are essential even if no hiking is on the agenda. From the station, it\u2019s a hilly 15-minute trek to the core of downtown, where exploring nets a Moorish Revival tower here, a Victorian charmer there.\u201cA lot of architecture got destroyed by urban renewal, which is a shame,\u201d said Frank Goderre, the city\u2019s historian. In the mid-20th century, Peekskill fell on hard times after its iron foundries and factories folded. \u201cBut what remains is beautiful,\u201d he said.The guns will come to Mr. Feder via the local police department\u2019s buy-back policy, partly financed from the sales proceeds of River Outpost\u2019s PeaceSkill beer. The hoppy, citrusy IPA is crafted by Justin Sturges, 36, its head brewer, who said that all profits will be donated to the program.Louie Lanza, who owns River Outpost and Fin & Brew, estimated they\u2019ve raised $12,500 for the buy-back program, enough to get dozens of guns off the street. His Hudson Hospitality Group is also behind Peekskill\u2019s Hudson Room, Taco Dive Bar, Buns-N-Bourbon and the Eagle Saloon.

{"Headline": "Small Investors Are Prey, Again, for the Wolves of Wall Street", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress tried to protect ordinary Americans\u2019 portfolios with the Dodd-Frank Act, but today they are more vulnerable than ever.Ms. Antilla is the author of \u201cTales From the Boom-Boom Room: Women vs. Wall Street.\u201dDodd-Frank was passed to rein in too-big-to-fail banks and establish new protections for consumers and investors. That included marching orders for the Securities and Exchange Commission to look into reforms meant to level the playing field between everyday investors and the sales agents who try to separate them from their money.The agency\u2019s official actions and failures to act are not the only problem.Last month, Hester Peirce, an S.E.C. commissioner appointed by President Trump, threw out a bombshell, signaling that she would support requests from companies looking to block shareholders from bringing class-action lawsuits. Ms. Peirce told Politico that public companies \u201cabsolutely\u201d should have the option of demanding arbitration instead of allowing class-wide court actions to proceed.Today, when shareholders believe they\u2019ve been cheated, they can join together before a court as a class, as investors in Enron and Worldcom did. The strength of such cases is in their numbers \u2014 investors can share costs that most solo plaintiffs couldn\u2019t afford \u2014 and in the deterrent effect of big judgments.Mr. Clayton, however, recently promoted an idea that similarly is favorable to business. He told an audience in Nashville last month that the S.E.C. is studying various issues concerning private securities, including whether they should be made available to a larger universe of investors. The agency now limits private offerings to wealthy investors. Privately held companies provide far less information about their operations than public companies do, making them a risky bet for individuals. Big institutional investors, by comparison, have the tools to evaluate those companies.And then there are the letdowns after Dodd-Frank. The law directed the agency to evaluate the standards that applied to stockbrokers and investment advisers. Stockbrokers, who are registered with Finra, a self-regulatory organization financed by its Wall Street members, are required only to recommend investments that are \u201csuitable\u201d for their customers, which leaves wiggle room for them to pick products that give them the biggest commissions. Registered investment advisers, who are overseen by the S.E.C. and state regulators, are held to a higher fiduciary standard of putting their clients\u2019 interests first.In 2011, the staff of the S.E.C. recommended that stockbrokers should be subject to the same high standards as investment advisers. Instead, seven years later, the S.E.C. proposed a rule, requiring brokers to act in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of clients, that would slightly raise broker standards but falls short of the fiduciary requirements that the staff recommended.That\u2019s not to say the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard doesn\u2019t have some fans. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street trade group, said it \u201csupports and commends\u201d the new standard.At an event for Main Street investors organized by the S.E.C. in Denver in July, a woman named Jaimie Davis said she had lost more than $2 million at the hands of a broker who put almost all of her assets into speculative private placements that were later exposed as a fraud. Forced to use arbitration, she said one of her arbitrators \u201cslept through most of the arbitration.\u201d Ultimately, she lost the case.Mr. Clayton, who said her story was \u201cthe worst\u201d of all the ones he heard in two months of public meetings, promised to look into it. Twelve days later, the agency wrote to Ms. Davis to say there was nothing it could do to help.The investor-unfriendly moves come at a bad time. Nine years into an economic recovery, stock prices are near record highs. But small investors should not get too comfortable. When things get ugly, they may find, yet again, that there is no one looking out for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Crisis of Election Security", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "FeatureAs the midterms approach, America\u2019s electronic voting systems are more vulnerable than ever. Why isn\u2019t anyone trying to fix them?Supported byAnd now, it emerged, someone was trying to infiltrate the election system itself. The Illinois intruders had quietly breached the network in June and spent weeks conducting reconnaissance. After alighting on the state\u2019s voter-registration database, they downloaded information on hundreds of thousands of voters. Then something went wrong, and the attackers crashed a server, alerting officials to their presence.It soon became clear that this would not be the last attack. In early August, Jenkins learned of another breach, this one on an Arizona state website, and it appeared to come from one of the same I.P. addresses that had been used to attack Illinois. This time, the intruders installed malware, as if setting the stage for further assault. Then reports from other states began to pour in, saying that the same I.P. addresses appeared to be probing their voter-registration networks. Against that backdrop, the D.N.C. hack was looking less like an isolated incident.\u201cWe started to ask: Are these things related?\u201d Jenkins recalled. \u201cAre they the same actors? Is this some kind of concerted effort?\u201d He and his team realized that if Russian hackers were trying to disrupt the coming elections, D.H.S. needed to quickly get in touch with the state and local officials who ran them. But whom do you call when there are more than 10,000 election jurisdictions in the United States?Jenkins at first assumed that each state had a chief information officer who oversaw election security \u2014 but this turned out to be wrong. A staff member suggested that the Federal Election Commission must be the governing body over elections \u2014 but the F.E.C., they quickly realized, was focused on campaign finance, not election systems. Then a colleague did a Google search on election administration and came across the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the federal body created by Congress in 2002 to serve as a federal liaison with state election officials. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to admit I didn\u2019t know that the E.A.C. existed,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI would say that I\u2019m not the only person working in the federal government that this was true for. This topic is not something that was really on anybody\u2019s big radar.\u201dJenkins planned a call for mid-August for his boss, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, to discuss the problem with members of the E.A.C. and the National Association of Secretaries of State. But Jenkins\u2019s knowledge of election hacking was limited to a conference panel he was on six months earlier about the security of internet voting. Although most American voters cast ballots in person or by mail, 31 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of internet voting to military personnel and citizens living overseas. Jenkins, concerned that Russian hackers might interfere with those ballots, intended to offer election officials a simple plan: \u201cWe were going to tell them that internet voting wasn\u2019t safe, and it was a risk factor and you need to not do it.\u201dBut when Jenkins met E.A.C. officials and the executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State for a brief discussion before the scheduled call, what was supposed to be a half-hour meeting bled into four hours, as he and his staff got a crash course in election administration. Internet voting, they learned, was the least of their concerns; the real problems were the machines used to cast and tally votes and the voter-registration databases the Russians had already shown interest in hacking. The entire system \u2014 a Rube Goldberg mix of poorly designed machinery, from websites and databases that registered and tracked voters, to electronic poll books that verified their eligibility, to the various black-box systems that recorded, tallied and reported results \u2014 was vulnerable.In August 2016, though, there was no time to address systemic problems. Many states would begin early voting in five to six weeks, and the machines themselves had to be programmed and locked down well in advance of Election Day. The Department of Homeland Security had to settle for doing Band-Aid security before the election, and even then only with states that requested help \u2014 mostly this involved remote-scanning internet-facing servers for known software vulnerabilities that could be patched, and providing a list of security best practices, like making sure vote-tabulation machines were not connected to the internet. Jenkins said the problems the agency couldn\u2019t address were \u201ctroubling\u201d but beyond its control. \u201cYou could spend years working on connectivity between voting machines and ballot-creating devices and try to get those things fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to do something quickly with a group of people who are resource-constrained as severely as election officials are, you kind of have to focus where you can focus.\u201dTwo years later, as the 2018 elections approach, the American intelligence community is issuing increasingly dire warnings about potential interference from Russia and other countries, but the voting infrastructure remains largely unchanged. D.H.S. has now conducted remote-scanning and on-site assessments of state and county election systems, but these are still largely Band-Aid measures applied to internet-facing servers. They don\u2019t address core vulnerabilities in voting machines or the systems used to program them. And they ignore the fact that many voting machines that elections officials insist are disconnected from the internet \u2014 and therefore beyond the reach of hackers \u2014 are in fact accessible by way of the modems they use to transmit vote totals on election night. Add to this the fact that states don\u2019t conduct robust postelection audits \u2014 a manual comparison of paper ballots to digital tallies is the best method we have to detect when something has gone wrong in an election \u2014 and there\u2019s a good chance we simply won\u2019t know if someone has altered the digital votes in the next election.The ballot box is the foundation of any democracy. It\u2019s not too grand to say that if there\u2019s a failure in the ballot box, then democracy fails. If the people don\u2019t have confidence in the outcome of an election, then it becomes difficult for them to accept the policies and actions that pour forth from it. And in the United States, it\u2019s safe to say, though few may utter it publicly, that the ballot box has failed many times and is poised to fail again.With optical-scan machines, voters fill out paper ballots and feed them into a scanner, which stores a digital image of the ballot and records the votes on a removable memory card. The paper ballot, in theory, provides an audit trail that can be used to verify digital tallies. But not all states perform audits, and many that do simply run the paper ballots through a scanner a second time. Fewer than half the states do manual audits, and they typically examine ballots from randomly chosen precincts in a county, instead of a percentage of ballots from all precincts. If the randomly chosen precincts aren\u2019t ones where hacking occurred or where machines failed to accurately record votes, an audit won\u2019t reveal anything \u2014 nor will it always catch problems with early-voting, overseas or absentee ballots, all of which are often scanned in county election offices, not in precincts.Direct-recording electronic machines, or D.R.E.s, present even more auditing problems. Voters use touch screens or other input devices to make selections on digital-only ballots, and votes are stored electronically. Many D.R.E.s have printers that produce what\u2019s known as a voter-verifiable paper audit trail \u2014 a scroll of paper, behind a window, that voters can review before casting their ballots. But the paper trail doesn\u2019t provide the same integrity as full-size ballots and optical-scan machines, because a hacker could conceivably rig the machine to print a voter\u2019s selections correctly on the paper while recording something else on the memory card. About 80 percent of voters today cast ballots either on D.R.E.s that produce a paper trail or on scanned paper ballots. But five states still use paperless D.R.E.s exclusively, and an additional 10 states use paperless D.R.E.s in some jurisdictions.The voting-machine industry \u2014 an estimated $300-million-a-year business \u2014 has long been as troubling as the machines it makes, known for its secrecy, close political ties (overwhelmingly to the Republican Party) and a revolving door between vendors and election offices. More than a dozen companies currently sell voting equipment, but a majority of machines used today come from just four \u2014 Diebold Election Systems, Election Systems & Software (ES&S), Hart InterCivic and Sequoia Voting Systems. Diebold (later renamed Premier) and Sequoia are now out of business. Diebold\u2019s machines and customer contracts were sold to ES&S and a Canadian company called Dominion, and Dominion also acquired Sequoia. This means that more than 80 percent of the machines in use today are under the purview of three companies \u2014 Dominion, ES&S and Hart InterCivic.Many of the products they make have documented vulnerabilities and can be subverted in multiple ways. Hackers can access voting machines via the cellular modems used to transmit unofficial results at the end of an election, or subvert back-end election-management systems \u2014 used to program the voting machines and tally votes \u2014 and spread malicious code to voting machines through them. Attackers could design their code to bypass pre-election testing and kick in only at the end of an election or under specific conditions \u2014 say, when a certain candidate appears to be losing \u2014 and erase itself afterward to avoid detection. And they could make it produce election results with wide margins to avoid triggering automatic manual recounts in states that require them when results are close.Hackers could also target voting-machine vendors and use this trusted channel to distribute their code. Last year a security researcher stumbled across an unsecured ES&S server that left passwords exposed for its employee accounts. Although the passwords were encrypted, a nation-state with sufficient resources would most likely be able to crack them, the researcher noted. Since ES&S creates ballot-definition files before each election for some customers \u2014 the critical programming files that tell machines how to apportion votes based on a voter\u2019s screen touch or marks on a paper ballot \u2014 a malicious actor able to get into ES&S\u2019s network could conceivably corrupt these files so machines misinterpret a vote for Donald Trump, say, as one for his opponent, or vice versa.Did anything like that happen in 2016? The Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community and election officials have all insisted that there is no evidence that Russian hackers altered votes in 2016. But the truth is that no one has really looked for evidence. Intelligence assessments are based on signals intelligence \u2014 spying on Russian communications and computers for chatter or activity indicating that they altered votes \u2014 not on a forensic examination of voting machines and election networks. \u201cWe should always be careful to point out that there hasn\u2019t been any evidence that votes were changed in any election in this way, and that\u2019s a true fact,\u201d said Matt Blaze, a computer-science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a voting-machine-security expert. \u201cIt\u2019s just less comforting than it might sound at first glance, because we haven\u2019t looked very hard.\u201d Even if experts were to look, it\u2019s not clear what they would find, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to do a pretty good job of erasing all the forensic evidence.\u201dAnd targeting voting machines is just one way to subvert elections. A hacker (or inside operator) could target voters themselves by deleting their names from the voter roll and electronic poll book \u2014 the device used at polling places to verify a voter\u2019s eligibility. Or change their precinct assignments to send them to the wrong location, creating chaos and frustration that causes them to leave without voting. Bad actors could also undermine election results by altering tallies as they are transmitted to county offices on election night or posted to public websites. Although these are unofficial results, any discrepancy between these and official tallies compiled days after an election would sow distrust in the outcome, particularly if the winner of a race changes.The stakes are high when it comes to election security, and the concerns about Russian hackers are warranted. But the focus on Russia, or any would-be election manipulators, ignores the underlying issue \u2014 the myriad vulnerabilities that riddle the system and the ill-considered decisions that got us here. The mad history of election security in the United States is a history of how misguided politicians and na\u00efve election officials allowed an unregulated industry to seize control of America\u2019s democratic infrastructure.[Read about Amendment 4, the ballot that could enfranchise more people at once than any single initiative since women\u2019s suffrage, but could also change the Florida electorate.] Deborah Tannenbaum had a front-row seat for what occurred that night. A Democratic Party field director in Florida, she refreshed her web browser frequently as returns came in from around the county. At 10 p.m., Al Gore was ahead in Volusia, with 83,000 votes to George W. Bush\u2019s 62,000. Things were going well for Gore across the state, and exit polls projected a six-point lead for him. But then something changed. \u201cI had stepped out, and one of the assistants came, and he\u2019s just like, \u2018I need you to come here and verify the numbers,\u2019\u2009\u201d Tannenbaum recalled. When she looked at the county\u2019s website, Gore\u2019s total had dropped 16,000 votes. Tannenbaum called the county election office, alarmed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on down there, but you can\u2019t take away votes!\u201d she said.Unfortunately for Gore, reporters were focused on overall state returns and didn\u2019t notice the funny numbers. At 7:52 p.m., Voter News Service \u2014 a consortium of media outlets reporting election results \u2014 projected Gore the Florida winner based on exit polls. But when the Volusia County numbers changed at 10 p.m., and Brevard County subsequently posted results inadvertently missing 4,000 votes for Gore, Bush shot into the lead; news outlets retracted their call for Gore and called the state for Bush. Gore was on his way to make a concession speech at 3 a.m. when he learned the numbers were wrong.Volusia officials blamed the mishap on a faulty memory card. The county used optical-scan machines made by Global Election Systems (a Canadian company later acquired by Diebold and renamed Diebold Election Systems), which the county had used since 1996. When the election ended, poll workers were supposed to transmit results to the county election office via modem; but the transmission failed, so a worker drove the memory card in, where officials inserted it directly into the election-management system to tally results. Logs for that computer, however, showed two memory cards for Precinct 216 inserted, an hour apart. The vote totals went haywire after the second card was loaded.Beyond the mystery of the two cards, there was another problem with this explanation. A faulty memory card should produce an onscreen error message or cause a computer to lock up, not alter votes in one race while leaving others untouched. And what kind of faulty card deleted votes only for Gore, while adding votes to other candidates?Ultimately, the phantom card was forgotten in the battle that ensued over dangling chads in other counties. Gore\u2019s team requested manual recounts in four counties, including Volusia, but a Supreme Court ruling on Dec. 12 halted them, though not before Volusia completed its recount. The manual tally of optical-scan ballots in Precinct 216 gave Gore 193 votes, Bush 22 and Harris 0. Bush won Florida, and by extension the presidency, by just 537 votes.To this day, questions about the Volusia card remain unanswered. Internal emails from Global Election Systems later leaked to Bev Harris, an election-integrity activist, show that the manufacturer itself remained unsure about what happened. When a Volusia County elections worker named Lana Hires requested an explanation from Global, the response was vague. Talbot Iredale, a Global developer, responded that a corrupt memory card remained \u201cthe most likely explanation for the problem but since I know nothing about the \u2018second\u2019 memory card I have no ability to confirm the probability of this.\u201d He then suggested a more ominous explanation. \u201cThere is always the possibility that the \u2018second memory card\u2019 or \u2018second upload\u2019 came from an unauthorized source.\u201d To which a Global colleague replied: \u201cHeh. Second shooter theory. All we need now is a grassy knoll.\u201dThe memory card in Volusia vividly demonstrated the kind of problems that could occur if states expanded their use of electronic voting machines without proper safeguards. But even as security experts showed how malicious insiders and outsiders could subvert the machines, the warnings went ignored.Computers had been used in elections ever since the 1960s, when punch cards and computerized card readers and tabulators were introduced. And experts had been warning for just as long about the danger of placing too much trust in them. A 1969 front-page article in The Los Angeles Times described a \u201cwar games\u201d exercise to determine if Los Angeles County\u2019s new computerized punch-card readers and tabulators could be rigged without detection. Three computer scientists on the offensive team faced off against three computer scientists on defense. \u201cIn each test, the offensive team won,\u201d the paper reported; the team\u2019s \u201chighly sophisticated techniques\u201d were neither detected nor prevented. The importance of paper ballots to back up and verify digital vote tallies was also underscored by numerous election mishaps over the years. In Rock Island County, Ill., in 1984, for every one vote cast for a particular candidate, a computer tabulator gave him two; it also failed to count \u201cno\u201d votes on a referendum. In Moline, Ill., in 1985, a punch-card reader elected the wrong candidate for City Council by failing to properly count some votes; a recount flipped the race.Hoyer insists that the subject of security and paper trails didn\u2019t come up when lawmakers were developing HAVA. But Rebecca Mercuri disputes this. A computer scientist at Bryn Mawr at the time, she told the House science committee \u2014 in a hearing that was meant to inform the lawmakers writing HAVA \u2014 that \u201cany programmer can write code that displays one thing on the screen, records something else and prints out something else as an entirely different result. I have freshmen, by the way, who can do this. There is no known way to ensure that this is not happening inside of a voting system.\u201dThe experts also recognized even then that voting machines wouldn\u2019t be secure if there weren\u2019t adequate standards for testing and certifying them. Douglas W. Jones, a computer-science professor at the University of Iowa and the chairman of a board that tested and approved machines used in his state, testified to the science committee that the voting machines available to replace punch-card and lever machines weren\u2019t secure, largely because the standards didn\u2019t require them to be. The standards were created in the 1980s, when security was a nascent field and touch-screen D.R.E.s didn\u2019t exist. He advised lawmakers against issuing large-scale funding for new machines until better standards and machines were available.But few in Congress took the critics seriously. Although lawmakers did include a provision in HAVA mandating the creation of new standards \u2014 with the aim that machines bought with HAVA funds would meet them \u2014 the purchasing deadlines they included in the bill forced states to buy their machines before the new standards could be completed in 2005 (they took effect in 2007). In October 2002, the bill passed with broad bipartisan support, and the clock began ticking down to the November 2004 deadline to replace punch-card machines.And with that, the gold rush was on, as a small group of vendors with little security expertise began lining up to win billions of dollars of federal money. Most of that money ended up going to buy D.R.E.s. In 2000, just 9 percent of American voting precincts were using D.R.E.s. After HAVA passed, the proportion ballooned to 67 percent. The basic technology was not new; the first direct-recording electronic voting machines went on sale in 1974, and touch-screen versions were introduced in the mid-90s. But before HAVA, election officials who wanted electronic machines generally chose optical-scan systems. Each machine was more expensive, but you needed fewer per polling place, because voters could fill out the ballots in simple booths and then quickly scan them.The new D.R.E. machines did offer real advantages. With direct recording, counties no longer had to print hundreds of thousands of paper ballots or store them for 22 months after a federal election, as federal law required. And the machines could be adapted to voter needs, by displaying digital ballots in multiple languages and font sizes. They also satisfied the accessibility requirement in HAVA, offering Braille keyboards, audio instruction and other aids for physically impaired voters.Under HAVA, states had to purchase only one accessible machine per precinct and could provide optical-scan systems for other voters. But some counties bought D.R.E.s exclusively, swayed in part by the National Federation of the Blind, which insisted that HAVA, in calling for \u201cuniform and nondiscriminatory election technology,\u201d required states to provide identical equipment for all voters. This interpretation benefited vendors, of course, who were more than happy to sell counties their most expensive systems.In November 2002, just days after Bush signed HAVA into law, Georgia underwent the nation\u2019s first major test of D.R.E.s. The state had signed a $54 million contract with Diebold to use its paperless D.R.E.s exclusively statewide. As the November midterm elections approached, the company scrambled to get the machines in place for one of the closest races for governor that Georgia had seen \u2014 between Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, and his Republican challenger, Sonny Perdue. Perdue won with just 51 percent of votes in a major upset. It was the first time in more than 130 years that a Republican became governor of Georgia. This wasn\u2019t the only upset. Senator Max Cleland, a popular Democrat, went into Election Day leading his Republican opponent, Saxby Chambliss, by three points; he lost by seven.Over the next several years, reports commissioned by officials in California, Maryland and Ohio found more problems with Diebold machines and similar issues with machines from other manufacturers. Problems with voting machines in elections were also making headlines. In 2002 in North Carolina, for example, D.R.E.s made by ES&S failed to record 436 entire ballots during early voting in Wake County, a failure the company attributed to a software bug. Two years later, in Jacksonville, N.C., a D.R.E. made by UniLect lost more than 4,500 ballots when its memory became full and stopped recording; it continued to let voters cast ballots, however, instead of locking up. The incidents that made headlines were disturbing enough, but the real concerns were the ones that weren\u2019t being caught.The troublesome 2004 presidential election in Ohio, in which Kerry was denied access to the voting software, provided a strong case for why paper and audits were necessary. A lot of Ohio counties still used punch cards, but some had adopted D.R.E.s and optical-scan systems. For one precinct of Franklin County, which used D.R.E.s made by a company called Danaher Control, the election-management system tallied 4,258 votes for Bush, though only 638 voters cast ballots. When officials pulled votes stored in the D.R.E., Bush\u2019s total was 365. In Mahoning County, voters using 25 D.R.E.s made by ES&S found that when they touched the screens to vote for John Kerry, the machines interpreted it as a vote for Bush, not an uncommon problem when touch screens are poorly calibrated. \u201cUndervoting\u201d \u2014 when a ballot shows no vote in a particular race \u2014 was also exceptionally high in the state. Democratic precincts across Ohio had 75 percent more undervotes than predominantly Republican ones. In two precincts in Montgomery County that used punch-card machines, the computer tabulators indicated that 6,000 ballots had no vote for president \u2014 an undervote rate of 25 percent, while 2 percent is normal. A congressional inquiry found \u201cnumerous serious election irregularities\u201d in Ohio but ultimately couldn\u2019t conclude whether fraud had occurred.The incidents in Ohio demonstrated that American elections still had integrity problems, but there was little constituency for change. In 2005, Holt introduced a variation of his 2003 reform bill, and once again it quickly died, in part because voting-machine vendors launched a formidable lobbying effort to quash the requirement of paper trails. Some state election officials joined the effort, arguing that adding printers to D.R.E.s would create problems for elderly poll workers if the printers jammed or ran out of paper. The American Association of People With Disabilities was also remarkably effective in lobbying against paper trails, arguing that they discriminated against blind voters, even though the same audio that assisted blind voters to mark their digital ballot could read the paper trail to them. The association persuaded the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union, two politically powerful groups, to oppose paper trails as well.The companies also expanded their reach into other parts of the elections process. Some states built their HAVA-mandated voter-registration databases in-house, but some outsourced this to Diebold and ES&S, the companies that made their voting machines, as well as to other firms. And once these centralized databases were in place, the vendors saw an opportunity for another revenue stream: They persuaded states to replace paper poll books \u2014 the lists poll workers use to verify that voters are registered \u2014 with electronic poll books that could sync with the statewide databases. The software on these devices didn\u2019t have to undergo testing and certification the way voting machines do, and there were inevitable problems \u2014 in 2006 in Denver, Sequoia electronic poll books crashed extensively, creating long lines for an estimated 20,000 people who left without voting. In 2008 in Georgia, Diebold electronic poll books caused delays lasting more than two hours.Over the years, as election officials became more comfortable with their voting equipment, many jurisdictions who gave control to vendors gradually took it back, but there are still districts where vendors and contractors are involved in every phase of elections, from writing the software that registers voters and determines their eligibility to cast ballots, to programming machines and counting the votes. And it\u2019s not clear to what degree, if any, they\u2019re subject to oversight.Legislators have introduced several bills that propose to bolster security, in part by mandating paper trails and manual audits. But only one of them, the Secure Elections Act, has advanced, and in the process it has been significantly watered down. In August, Republican lawmakers weakened the bill by allowing officials performing audits to rely on the digital images of paper ballots stored in optical-scan machines \u2014 images that can be manipulated by hackers and others, security experts say.This year, Congress appropriated $380 million to states to pay for security upgrades and replace some of the machines that were bought with HAVA funds more than a decade ago, in the belief that this will make elections more secure. But the new machines have the same problems as the ones they will replace \u2014 all machines on the market today were tested and certified to the standards HAVA put into effect in 2007, and technology has evolved considerably in the last decade. The Election Assistance Commission and its technical-guidelines committee are completing new standards, but it will be at least another two years before any machines will be tested and certified to them.Even those standards will almost certainly be inadequate. They will, for instance, most likely continue to exempt commercial off-the-shelf components from testing. (If a vendor uses the Windows operating system or a commercial modem in its machines and asserts that it hasn\u2019t altered them, the labs don\u2019t look at those components.) And they probably won\u2019t require labs to do \u201cpenetration testing\u201d to see if they can hack voting systems \u2014 one of the most effective ways to measure the security of a system. \u201cThese companies have seized a central role in our democracy,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is one of a small group of lawmakers who have shown a willingness to demand more transparency from the vendors. \u201cBut rather than recognizing that cybersecurity needs to be their top priority, they treat it as a public-relations problem that can be dismissed with spin.\u201dThe valuable work of testing system security has been taken up voluntarily by security researchers like the Finnish computer programmer Harri Hursti, J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan and the participants at the recent Def Con Voting Machine Hacking Village. But the researchers face hostility and sometimes even legal threats from vendors, who want to prevent them from finding and exposing problems with the machines. Before the Def Con event this year, which received unprecedented support and interest from election officials, ES&S and other vendors sent comments to the United States Copyright Office expressing opposition to a proposed exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that would expand the rights of researchers to reverse-engineer election software.Even now, when the country is desperate to prevent Russian hackers from interfering with future elections, the company is more focused on asserting proprietary control over its systems than on working with communities of researchers who want to secure them. In addition to the comments it sent the Copyright Office, it also sent a vaguely threatening letter to its own customers, warning them against helping researchers by providing them with voting-machine software to examine. In that letter, ES&S reminded election officials of an essential fact: The American people don\u2019t own the software that now sits at the heart of their democracy; they just lease it.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to an area in Ohio where 638 voters cast ballots in the presidential election of 2004. It was in one precinct in Franklin County, not the county as a whole.Kim Zetter has covered cybersecurity for more than a decade.

{"Headline": "In Erdogan\u2019s Charm Offensive, Germans Find Offense", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut if Mr. Erdogan was on a charm offensive, Germans seemed to agree that, after just 24 hours in Berlin, it was more offensive than charm.The first thing the Turkish president did?Mr. Erdogan apparently flashed a four-fingered Muslim Brotherhood salute in central Berlin and demanded the extradition of 69 Turkish exiles in Germany, among them journalists and lawyers investigating Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government and risking prison at home.Chancellor Angela Merkel was not impressed.Standing stiffly next to the Turkish leader at a news conference in Berlin on Friday, she noted \u201cdeep-seated differences\u201d between the two countries regarding press freedom and the rule of law, and she insisted that Mr. Erdogan release several political prisoners held in Turkey \u2014 including five German citizens.\u201cI have urged that these cases be solved as quickly as possible,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, as Mr. Erdogan stared straight ahead.Facing the worst economic crisis in his country in 15 years, the Turkish leader had toned down his anti-Western rhetoric in recent weeks. Only a year ago, he called the German government \u201cenemies of Turkey.\u201d Turkish officials accused Berlin of deploying Nazi tactics, and Turkish newspapers called German companies in Turkey spies.This week, Mr. Erdogan said, \u201cWe want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany \u2014 just like it used to be.\u201dAmong the names on the extradition list, which was submitted to the Foreign Ministry in Berlin on Monday, according to the Turkish newspaper Yeni Akit, is Can Dundar, the former editor in chief of the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet.Mr. Dundar fled Turkey in 2016 after he was convicted of treason and espionage for reporting a year earlier that Turkey\u2019s Secret Service had delivered arms to the Islamic State. His wife remains in Turkey and is not allowed to leave the country.When Mr. Erdogan was informed that Mr. Dundar planned to be at the news conference with Ms. Merkel, the Turkish president threatened to call off the whole thing. In the end, Mr. Dundar said he would not go to ensure that colleagues would have an opportunity to ask Mr. Erdogan critical questions.Asked whether Ms. Merkel considered it a provocation that Mr. Dundar\u2019s name was on the extradition list, the chancellor was blunt: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that there is controversy in this case.\u201dMr. Erdogan, meanwhile, reiterated that Mr. Dundar was \u201can agent\u201d who had published state secrets.Though not holding back her criticism, Ms. Merkel was visibly uncomfortable with a joint appearance that showed clumsy diplomacy not just from the Turkish president but also from a Western power that ultimately has to deal with a budding dictator on Europe\u2019s border.At one point during the news conference, a photographer in the front row slipped on a T-shirt with a message of support for journalists jailed in Turkey. The man, a photographer for a Turkish-language news site in Germany, was swiftly removed by security personnel as Mr. Erdogan looked on and smiled.The newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung described the scene as one \u201cyou\u2019d expect more in Erdogan\u2019s Turkey.\u201dMs. Merkel stressed that Germany and Turkey, both NATO members, had many shared strategic interests. She announced a meeting with the leaders of France, Turkey and Russia in October to discuss the situation in Syria, in particular the rebel stronghold of Idlib.\u201cWe have a lot that unites us,\u201d she said at the news conference, singling out questions of migration and the fight against terrorism. She also expressed hope that Turkey\u2019s economic turmoil would abate.\u201cGermany has an interest in an economically stable Turkey,\u201d she said.Mr. Erdogan is secure in his newly powerful presidency. But the Turkish economy is in bad shape. The lira has come under severe pressure \u2014 losing nearly 40 percent of its value this year \u2014 buffeted by high inflation and surging foreign debt. As the lira has fallen in value, Turkish companies have struggled to make debt payments.But if the Turkish president was looking to reassure financial markets, improve business ties and seek political support, he went about it clumsily.A photograph of him driving through Berlin and making what appeared to be the hand sign of Muslim Brotherhood supporters \u2014 one used by Mr. Erdogan on previous occasions \u2014 was widely shared on German social media.Cem Ozdemir, a Turkish-German lawmaker and longtime Erdogan critic, put it in an interview with the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung: \u201cErdogan has no intention of changing his spots, despite his attempts at a charm offensive.\u201dThe state visit in Germany is hosted by the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial. It has been met with a wave of criticism.Thousands of protesters, including many of Turkish origin, took to the streets of Berlin near Mr. Erdogan\u2019s hotel on Friday afternoon. One banner, held by a Kurdish woman standing near the Brandenburg Gate read, \u201cErdogan you\u2019re not a leader, you\u2019re a dictator.\u201d Another declared, \u201cGet lost, Erdogan!\u201dMore protests are planned for Saturday in Cologne, where Mr. Erdogan is scheduled to open a new central mosque of one of Germany\u2019s largest Islamic organizations. The group, the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs, or Ditib, is financed by the Turkish government and is suspected of disseminating pro-Erdogan propaganda.Several German lawmakers joined the protests rather than attend a state banquet on Friday night. Bijan Djir-Sarai, the foreign policy speaker of the Free Democrats, said he could not dine with Mr. Erdogan \u201cwhile German citizens sit in Turkish prisons.\u201dThe temperature rose briefly at the dinner when Mr. Steinmeier\u2019s criticism of Turkey for pursuing government critics drew a response from Mr. Erdogan. The intellectuals and journalists wanted by the Turkish justice system, Mr. Erdogan said, are \u201cterrorists\u201d and Germany is \u201cprotecting them.\u201dBeforehand, Ms. Merkel had defended the decision to host Mr. Erdogan, saying, \u201cWe can only work through our differences if we talk to each other.\u201dBut she, too, was conspicuously absent from the state banquet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ron DeSantis Faces Questions About Supporter\u2019s Racist Slur", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRon DeSantis, the Republican nominee for governor of Florida and an acolyte of President Trump, is facing questions about a racist slur by one of his supporters, the latest race-related controversy during his campaign.In an appearance at Florida International University in Miami on Thursday, Mr. DeSantis disavowed the tweet.Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for the campaign, said that some of the money from Mr. Alembik was previously returned to him, and none was given during the general election. The campaign will not accept any further donations from Mr. Alembik, he added.\u201cWe adamantly denounce this sort of disgusting rhetoric,\u201d Mr. Lawson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to focus on the issues that matter to Floridians, like building on our economic success, keeping our water clean and boosting classroom education funding.\u201dHe called questions about the tweet \u201ca vile attempt to demean\u201d Mr. Alembik and the DeSantis campaign and asserted that if someone of color had said the same about Mr. Obama, it wouldn\u2019t be considered racist.\u201cThe last thing we need to do is monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda,\u201d he said.Mr. Gillum, 39, does not identify as a socialist, and he and other Florida Democrats strongly criticized Mr. DeSantis\u2019s choice of words.\u201cIn the handbook of Donald Trump, they no longer do whistle calls,\u201d Mr. Gillum said at the time. \u201cThey\u2019re now using full bull horns.\u201dIn the audio of one robocall obtained by The New York Times, a man pretending to be Mr. Gillum can be heard talking in the exaggerated accent of a minstrel performer. \u201cWell hello there,\u201d it begins, \u201cI is Andrew Gillum.\u201d He then talks about mud huts and unfair policing practices, and asks for the listener\u2019s vote amid sounds of drums and monkeys.Mr. Lawson called the robocall \u201cappalling.\u201d\u201cHopefully, whoever is behind this has to answer for this despicable action,\u201d he added.In 2017, the event also featured Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart editor, and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former adviser.Mr. Bossie, who was also a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Trump, later apologized.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sheldon Adelson Sees a Lot to Like in Trump\u2019s Washington", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The return on investment for many of the Republican Party\u2019s biggest political patrons has been less than impressive this year. But not for Sheldon Adelson.Mr. Adelson, the billionaire casino magnate, and his wife, Miriam, a physician, have emerged as the biggest and potentially most influential contributors to Republicans in the midterm season. Despite initially harboring qualms about President Trump\u2019s leadership, the Adelsons have found much to like in a Republican-controlled government that has aligned with their most cherished priorities: unflinchingly pro-Israel, unaccommodating to Middle Eastern adversaries and dedicated to deregulation and lower taxes.Republican control of the House and the Senate is so vital to maintaining these policies, the Adelsons believe, that they have given $55 million in the last few months to groups dedicated to making sure it stays that way. That makes them not only the largest donors to national Republican electoral efforts in this election cycle, but the biggest spenders on federal elections in all of American politics, according to publicly available campaign finance data.In meetings with the consultants and political strategists who have visited his office on the Las Vegas Strip to ask for money, Mr. Adelson and his wife ask pointed questions, hoping to ensure that their money will be spent wisely, people who have pitched them said in interviews. They demand campaign plans, preferably in writing.They are critical of strategies that appear overly reliant on television advertising, preferring to invest in ones with a wide network of field offices and staff on the ground. When advertising does come up, they have surprised some of the people pitching them with detailed questions, like when they would book airtime and what percentage they were paying up front.More than a dozen people who know the Adelsons professionally or personally, some of whom are also friendly with Mr. Trump, said in interviews that the durability of Mr. Adelson\u2019s relationship with the president hinges not on any personal affinity between the two, but on a mutual appreciation for something both men have built their careers on: the transaction.\u201cI think there are a lot of leaders in the establishment Jewish community for whom Donald Trump is not the kind of guy they\u2019d want to break matzo with, but they sure like his polices and what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush who is on the board of the Republican Jewish Coalition with Mr. Adelson.\u201cIn a lot of circles outside the \u2018Always Trump\u2019 base,\u201d Mr. Fleischer added, \u201cTrump has made a lot of progress with people who don\u2019t like him personally but like him professionally.\u201dThrough a spokesman, the Adelsons declined a request to be interviewed.So far this year the Adelsons have steered their money to two groups with proven track records of defending Republican seats \u2014 the Congressional Leadership Fund, the super PAC allied with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and the Senate Leadership Fund, which has close ties to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader. Though they are known to probe prospective recipients about their plans up front, they do not tend to meddle in strategy after the fact or demand that their money be steered toward certain states or races, people who have worked with them said.They have yet to give to Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election efforts, however, reasoning that for now their money is better spent on maintaining Republican control of Congress.The relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Adelson has come a long way.A few months later when Mr. Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition, the conservative, pro-Israeli group the Adelsons help fund, he played to Jewish stereotypes with a crack about how many people in the room must know how to renegotiate deals. \u201cPerhaps more than any room I\u2019ve ever spoken to,\u201d he said.But after Mr. Trump\u2019s election in 2016, Dr. Adelson was crying tears of joy. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it!\u201d she exclaimed, according to one person who witnessed the exchange, hugging Mr. Trump in a meeting in January 2017 at Trump Tower in which the president-elect promised he would move the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.It was the beginning of a raft of decisions and personnel changes by Mr. Trump that, while not always at the top of his priority list, would deliver major, long-sought policy victories for conservative Jews like the Adelsons.Mr. Adelson plays an outsize, if largely behind-the-scenes, role in Israel. Long a staunch supporter of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he began financing a free, right-leaning tabloid newspaper, Israel Hayom, in 2007 that many Israelis consider a mouthpiece for Mr. Netanyahu. It has since become the largest-circulation Hebrew newspaper.Longtime supporters of Jewish settlement projects in the West Bank, the Adelsons have also pledged millions of dollars for the expansion of Ariel University, in the heart of the occupied territory, including a medical school that will be named for the couple.The president has also begun to undo the nuclear nonproliferation deal the Obama administration negotiated with Iran, which many Republicans and conservative Israelis opposed.The Adelsons\u2019 support remains critical to the administration as other longtime party donors recede. Though Mr. Adelson and Mr. Trump are not personally close, according to people who know both men, the Adelsons still believe that big money can produce big results, and that Mr. Trump can continue to deliver them if he has a Republican Congress behind him.Mr. Trump respects Mr. Adelson\u2019s success as a global casino, convention and hotel mogul \u2014 businesses that the president has bought into on a smaller scale. And Mr. Adelson has long demonstrated the kind of bare-knuckles business approach that Mr. Trump identifies with.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Morton Klein, a longtime friend of Mr. Adelson\u2019s and fellow pro-Israel activist, said an overjoyed Mr. Adelson called him from the car right after the meeting in which President-elect Trump declared how seriously he took his promise to move the embassy.\u201cI know he was in the car because he kept yelling at the driver for making wrong turns,\u201d Mr. Klein said. \u201cAnd he said, \u2018Mort! I just came out of Trump Tower and Donald Trump just promised me in his first term he\u2019s going to move the embassy to Jerusalem,\u2019\u201d Mr. Klein recalled.The plan favored by some senior aides at the time, including Stephen K. Bannon, a key strategist for Mr. Trump, was to announce the embassy move on Inauguration Day, people familiar with the discussions said. Mr. Trump\u2019s staff went so far as to look up the time the sun would go down that day \u2014 a Friday, the start of the Jewish Sabbath \u2014 so they could plan appropriately to have Jewish leaders like Mr. Adelson there for the announcement.But officials at the State Department and others in the government talked the president out of it, pointing out that it would provoke mass unrest in the Arab world.The Adelsons were initially frustrated by the delay, but their annoyance has long since faded. And while Mr. Adelson\u2019s commitment to Israel and American foreign policy has always been paramount, associates described his focus on political concerns at home as a close second.\u201cThere\u2019s a Hebrew word, \u2018Neshama,\u2019 and that\u2019s what Sheldon has for Israel \u2014 a heart for Israel,\u201d said Brad Blakeman, an adviser in George W. Bush\u2019s White House who ran an Adelson-funded foreign policy group, Freedom\u2019s Watch.But, Mr. Blakeman added, \u201cthat\u2019s the land of his religion. The land of his patriotism is America.\u201dIsabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem. Rachel Shorey contributed research.Advertisement"}

And maybe I\u2019ll be able to convince some other people of that.

{"Headline": "The Hot Property That\u2019s Next on Tech\u2019s Agenda: Real Estate", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThat was only an appetizer. Three months later, Opendoor has more than doubled its cash pile. On Thursday, the company said it had gotten a $400 million investment from SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund. The valuation for Opendoor remains the same.The so-called mega-round for Opendoor was not the Vision Fund\u2019s only major real estate-related deal on Thursday. The firm also co-led a $400 million investment in the high-end brokerage Compass that valued the company at $4.4 billion.The hauls are part of a race by investors to pour money into technology for real estate, or what Silicon Valley now calls proptech.Having watched tech start-ups upend old-line industries like taxis and hotels, venture capitalists are casting about for the next area to be infused with software and data. Many have homed in on real estate as a big opportunity because parts of the industry \u2014 like pricing, mortgages and building management \u2014 have been slow to adopt software that could make business more efficient.Last year, real estate tech start-ups raised $3.4 billion in funding, a fivefold increase from 2013, according to the start-up data provider CB Insights. One firm, Fifth Wall Ventures, is entirely dedicated to proptech.\u201cTech is starting to make inroads to becoming adopted, and it\u2019s opening the eyes of investors,\u201d said Jeffrey Housenbold, a managing director at SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund.Until recently, the biggest tech innovations to hit the residential real estate market have come from listing sites like Zillow and Redfin. But the start-ups in the new wave are tackling a wide range of areas \u2014 appraisals, building management, financing, co-working, co-living, building amenities and empty retail space.Mr. Housenbold said SoftBank\u2019s deep pockets \u2014 it has $98 billion in cash to spend \u2014 might be influencing the market.\u201cGiven the vast amount of attention on the Vision Fund, people have become more curious,\u201d he said.Opendoor\u2019s goal is to make moving as simple as the click of a button, according to Mr. Wu. While that remains a far-off reality, the company has simplified the process of selling a home. It uses a combination of data, software and a team of 50 human evaluators to assess a home\u2019s value. If a customer accepts Opendoor\u2019s value for their home, the company will buy the property, charging a 6.5 percent fee on average.The company said it offers sellers certainty \u2014 many conventional home sales fall through \u2014 and flexible closing dates, helping them avoid paying double mortgages. It also eliminates the need for a real estate agent. Opendoor employs 100 licensed real estate agents to advise customers if they request it.Opendoor buys only homes built in 1960 or later, worth $175,000 to $500,000 and not in need of major renovations or repairs. Operating in more than a dozen cities, mostly in the South, it bought $316 million of homes in August, up from around $100 million in January. After some light fixes, it sells the homes in an average of 90 days.Before its latest cash infusion, Opendoor planned to expand into one new city a month. Now it plans to double that pace. The company said it expects to be in 22 cities in the United States by the end of the year.\u201cFor a while, we were literally the only ones doing this because it\u2019s complex,\u201d Mr. Wu said. Size is an advantage, he said: More transactions mean more data to help Opendoor price its offers more accurately, as well as more buying power with local suppliers for renovations.Mr. Wu said he believed that reducing the annoyances and costs of moving would entice more people to do it, which would increase the size of the market.\u201cThere are a finite number of homes, but if people are moving with more frequency, that increases the liquidity of the supply in the system,\u201d he said.Opendoor\u2019s business model has not been tested by a major dip in the housing market, causing some skepticism about whether it can work over the long term.\u201cThe vast majority of investors who hear about it initially think it\u2019s a bad idea,\u201d said Stephen Kim, an analyst at Evercore ISI, a market research company. But the skepticism often fades as they realize Opendoor makes money by providing a service to home sellers, rather than on price appreciation, Mr. Kim said. Even if the company breaks even on a sale, the transaction fees are a meaningful business.Jason Childs, Opendoor\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company\u2019s geographic diversity and 90-day average flips helped shield it from a potential housing market crash. In the housing crash a decade ago, the holders of long-duration assets were affected the worst, he said.Opendoor\u2019s Phoenix operations are already profitable, excluding the cost of its headquarters in San Francisco, and Dallas is \u201con the edge of profitability,\u201d said Mr. Childs.The company\u2019s long-term success relies on its ability to accurately price homes. Half of the people who now get offers from Opendoor sell their home to the company. Opendoor did not provide data on how close its offers were to the ultimate sale price of the homes it did not buy.In recent months, aided by the promise of cash from SoftBank, Opendoor has also expanded into the business of selling homes directly to customers, instead of going through brokers in the traditional way. It acquired Open Listings, a home shopping site, to offer a service it is calling a \u201ctrade-in,\u201d where Opendoor handles the entire buying and selling process for a person or family. That service is now available in Dallas. It also began offering mortgage and title services to buyers.But Mr. Wu does not foresee one thing going away completely: the job of the real estate agent. Rather, he expects an agent\u2019s work to shift to more of an advisory role, instead of an administrative one.\u201cThe thing that cannot be automated is this notion of advice \u2014 what neighborhood, what school district, how much you can afford,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have someone who is an expert alongside you.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Lambert, senior vice president of product management at SAP ConcurWhen applied to expense management, machine learning can accurately evaluate reports by observing patterns in what human reviewers approve or reject over time. \u201cYou could think of it like an apprenticeship,\u201d says Thomas W. Malone, founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. \u201cSometimes the apprentice may ask some explicit questions or the expert may make an explicit comment, but the apprentice learns a lot just by watching. I call it a cyber-human learning loop.\u201dAlready, with A.I.-enhanced tools, expense reports are far less burdensome than they were even five years ago. Employees can now scan and upload receipts with their phones, and their travel information is pulled into reports from booking sites, corporate cards and email messages. Managers can review reports by mobile device, then approve them with one button click. But as humans continue to work with machine learning over the next year or two, expense management systems will advance at an even faster pace \u2014 and transform how we do business. \u201cIf an employee takes a picture of a receipt or uses a corporate card, that data can be automatically assembled into an expense report,\u201d Lambert says. \u201cIt could even be submitted on behalf of the employee, if they choose.\u201d As humans and A.I. work jointly, employees will likely be reimbursed faster, and finance managers will benefit from near real-time logs of expenditures. \nPULL QUOTE 2\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting time back in our employees\u2019 hands. That\u2019s our home run story.\u201d- Debbie Reinhart, a senior analyst in financial operations at Cardinal HealthPULL QUOTE 2 MOBILE\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting time back in our employees\u2019 hands. That\u2019s our home run story.\u201d- Debbie Reinhart, a senior analyst in financial operations at Cardinal HealthConcur Labs, a research and development arm of SAP Concur that designs and tests prototypes, is currently beta-testing an expense bot developed for the group-messaging service Slack that lets users upload receipts, add to expense reports and check on corporate expense policies without leaving the app. Also in the works? An Alexa add-on that functions like a travel booking assistant, an Apple Watch add-on that sends expenses to reports via verbal command and a smartphone app that pulls mileage from a car\u2019s odometer into an expense report. All this automation greatly diminishes the sea of user errors employees once generated by manually typing expenses into a spreadsheet, says John Dietz, vice president of Concur Labs. The Concur Detect auditing tool, in fact, can reduce expense reporting errors by up to 66 percent. \u201cFrom an administrative point of view,\u201d Dietz says, \u201cthis technology is reducing network load.\u201dSixty-two percent of accounts payable costs stems from labor, according to a recent report by the American Productivity and Quality Center. \u201cWith machine learning, we\u2019re approaching a period where you bring the human into the process only when you need to,\u201d Lambert says, \u201cas opposed to making that person review everything.\u201dManagers can stay as involved as they want. For instance, a supervisor wondering whether the department has the budget to send an employee to a particular conference may confer with a bot that pulls conference costs and quarterly spend predictions to expedite a decision. With real-time reporting and faster reimbursements, employees will likely be more content, and financial decision makers will have increased control and knowledge.Free from the burden of creating and approving expense reports, companies can focus on propelling their businesses forward. Case in point: Cardinal Health, a global healthcare organization that processes 20,000 expense reports in an array of languages every month. Since automating its process in 2011, the company has reduced the hours its employees spend on expense reports by more than 90 percent. \u201cThe human hours we\u2019re saving could be upward of 10,000 per month,\u201d says Debbie Reinhart, a senior analyst in financial operations at Cardinal Health. \u201cWe\u2019re putting time back in our employees\u2019 hands. That\u2019s our home run story.\u201dFor some people, the idea of artificial intelligence can sound threatening. Should humans be worried about losing jobs to robots? \u201cMachines will certainly do some of the tasks in the future that people do today,\u201d Malone says. \u201cBut it is extremely unlikely that this will lead to long-term unemployment. It has never happened with any of the past generations of automation.\u201d A McKinsey & Company report backs Malone\u2019s assertion: Although automation will affect 49 percent of current jobs, the report predicts, robots will subsume less than 5 percent of these positions. \u201cWhen machines can do the routine things that people do today, we\u2019ll find new things that people and computers can do together,\u201d Malone says. \u201cThose areas will provide new kinds of value and create new jobs.\u201d\nIn today\u2019s tech-centric business environment, adoption rates can suddenly accelerate. \u201cWe expect that many companies will transition to A.I. expense reporting within the next five to 10 years, because it\u2019s so efficient.\u201d Lambert says. \u201cSAP Concur is experienced in partnering with businesses to help them adapt to these rapidly changing times.\u201dWhen machine learning is utilized to its full potential, Malone says, expense reports will essentially become invisible: \u201cPeople involved will rarely even think about them.\u201d And what was once a collective nightmare will quickly fade away into a blurry past.\nAnimations by Joash BerkeleyThe news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "Tesla Chief Elon Musk Is Sued by S.E.C. in Move That Could Oust Him", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byElon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, was accused by federal regulators on Thursday of misleading investors with false public statements, a move that could force him out of the company\u2019s leadership.The suit seeks to bar Mr. Musk, who is also Tesla\u2019s chairman, from serving as an executive or director of publicly traded companies like Tesla. Such a punishment is one of the most serious remedies the S.E.C. can impose against a corporate executive.The case is likely to send shock waves across corporate America and could lead to a re-evaluation of how companies use Twitter to communicate with the investing public.The S.E.C. said Mr. Musk \u201cknew or was reckless in not knowing\u201d that his statements were false or misleading. \u201cIn truth and in fact, Musk had not even discussed, much less confirmed, key deal terms, including price, with any potential funding source,\u201d the S.E.C. said in its lawsuit.In a statement distributed by Tesla, Mr. Musk said: \u201cThis unjustified action by the S.E.C. leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed. I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u201dThe S.E.C. approached the Tesla chief with an offer to settle the case, according to a person familiar with his thinking, but he refused to negotiate, adamant that he had done nothing wrong. A person briefed on the talks said they fell apart Thursday morning, setting the stage for the S.E.C. to vote on the action.Tesla itself was not named as a defendant.A Silicon Valley veteran who joined in founding the company 15 years ago, Mr. Musk is widely regarded by analysts and investors as the creative engine behind Tesla. It has become the most valuable American carmaker, with its stock worth more than $50 billion.The shares tumbled more than 12 percent in after-hours trading after the S.E.C. filed its lawsuit.The S.E.C. issued a round of subpoenas to Tesla and the financial institutions it eventually hired for advice on a potential conversion into a private company. The agency also interviewed a number of Tesla board members, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The complaint said Mr. Musk \u201cknew that he had never discussed a going-private transaction at $420 per share with any potential funding source.\u201dThe S.E.C. said that Mr. Musk had been in a persistent feud with investors who were betting that Tesla shares would fall. The complaint notes that Mr. Musk had discussions in late July with a foreign investment fund that had recently acquired a 5 percent stake in Tesla. In those discussions, Mr. Musk said he was thinking about taking Tesla private, but regulators said nothing formal was agreed on.The lawsuit is the latest in a series of escalating problems for Tesla and Mr. Musk. The company has been struggling to achieve the ambitious production targets that Mr. Musk had publicly outlined. He has made a series of unusual public comments or appearances, including an internet interview in which Mr. Musk appeared to smoke marijuana.The action by the S.E.C. is solely related to events surrounding Mr. Musk\u2019s comments on Twitter. But regulators had been investigating Tesla even before the tweet, and are more broadly examining whether Tesla misled investors about its production goals.Federal prosecutors in California have also sought information from Tesla, an inquiry that appears to be at an early stage.Tesla\u2019s directors issued a statement affirming that they are \u201cfully confident in Elon, his integrity and his leadership of the company.\u201dThe action against Mr. Musk, 47, is one of the most significant by the S.E.C. during the Trump administration, which has been criticized for focusing on smaller cases. The agency seldom tries to bar a figure as prominent as Mr. Musk permanently from the securities industry.When S.E.C. lawyers accused the billionaire Mark Cuban of insider trading in 2008, for example, they did not seek such a ban. Mr. Cuban won the case at trial. When they settled a case against the hedge fund manager Steven A. Cohen for failing to supervise his $13 billion hedge fund, SAC Capital, where several portfolio managers were charged with insider trading, the S.E.C.\u2019s lawyers required Mr. Cohen to stop managing investors\u2019 money only for a period of two years.\u201cThis case demonstrates our commitment to holding individuals accountable for violations,\u201d said Steven Peikin, the S.E.C.\u2019s co-director of enforcement. \u201cNeither celebrity status nor reputation as a technological innovator provide exemptions from the securities laws.\u201dThe S.E.C. complaint is quite detailed in describing the events that led to Mr. Musk\u2019s fateful tweet.The filing said that on Aug. 2, five days before he sent the tweet, Mr. Musk sent an email to Tesla\u2019s board, chief financial officer and general counsel with the subject line: \u201cOffer to Take Tesla Private at $420.\u201d Mr. Musk said he wanted to put the matter up to a shareholder vote \u201cat the earliest opportunity,\u201d the complaint added, and wanted to do so partly because of the attacks on the company\u2019s stock from bearish investors known as short-sellers.Mr. Musk, according to the lawsuit, told Tesla\u2019s board that the $420 figure was based on a 20 percent premium to the stock\u2019s Aug. 2 closing price. He then rounded it up to $420 after his girlfriend told him of the number\u2019s significance for marijuana smokers and thought it would be funny.The board on Aug. 3 authorized Mr. Musk to start talking to some investors about the plan to go private and asked him to report back on those conversations, the complaint said. Mr. Musk had a conversation with at least one large investor, it added, but before anything was close to completion, he began posting statements on Twitter about taking the company private on Aug. 7.The S.E.C. said that in the ensuing days, Mr. Musk did nothing to clarify his statements and threw fuel on the fire with additional posts on Twitter.The case against Mr. Musk is noteworthy also for the speed with which the S.E.C. brought it. Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School, said the case was \u201cdone in record time,\u201d adding, \u201cUsually there is much more opportunity for the defendant to be heard and make formal submissions.\u201dMichael Liftik, a lawyer with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan and a former S.E.C. attorney who helped write the commission\u2019s policy on social media posts, said the investigation was most likely straightforward.\u201cIt was one tweet \u2014 it is one sentence,\u201d Mr. Liftik said. \u201c\u2018Funding secured\u2019 is a definitive declarative sentence and it didn\u2019t leave him any wiggle room.\u201dThe S.E.C. policy, adopted in 2013, permits a corporation to disclose market-moving information on Twitter as long as it has given investors advance notice that it may do so. Tesla had done that and said Mr. Musk\u2019s Twitter account is one place the company might make significant corporate announcements.The episode arose as Mr. Musk had made a priority of smoothing out the assembly of a crucial new product, the Model 3 sedan. In a bid to lift output to 5,000 vehicles a week, he stalked around the plant in Fremont, Calif., joining in to help solve bottlenecks and other problems and sometimes sleeping on the factory floor.Cash has also been a problem for Tesla. Besides spending to ramp up Model 3 production and develop future vehicles, Tesla faces two significant bond payments that could put further stress on its reserves. Most analysts believe Tesla will have to raise additional capital from investors to meet those obligations, but Mr. Musk has said it has no plans to do so.In recent months, as he has juggled Tesla\u2019s production and financing demands, there has been talk about installing a chief operating officer to enable Mr. Musk to take a reduced role in day-to-day operations. But there has been no sign of any active search, and there is no evident internal candidate for such a role.While Model 3 production has accelerated significantly this year, it is unclear how smoothly the process is running. Some owners have complained that cars arrived with crooked panels and other flaws. Hundreds of Model 3s have been parked in lots around California and other states, some needing repairs before they can be delivered.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the body style of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 car. It is a sedan, not a roadster.Neal E. Boudette and David Gelles contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "6 Ways to Fight Election Hacking and Voter Fraud, According to an Expert Panel", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe report notes the significant challenges of securing elections. In 2016, Americans voted in 178,217 precincts and 116,990 polling places. Under the Constitution, each state controls its own election procedures, and officials jealously guard their authority against federal interference. The rules vary so wildly that uniform standards are almost impossible.Still, many of the report\u2019s proposals can be applied nationwide. Here are six ways the panel says that election security can be improved:1. Use paper ballots to establish a backup record of each vote.Even if voter databases and other equipment aren\u2019t connected to the internet, experts said, it will be hard to protect computer systems from cyber threats. As a result, they recommend that by 2020, every voting machine nationwide should generate a backup paper record of each vote. Currently, five states \u2014 Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Delaware and New Jersey \u2014 and portions of several others do not maintain a paper trail.2. Outlaw any kind of internet voting \u2014 for now.For now, the experts say, that is simply too risky.That said, they also urge further study into new technologies that might make electronic voting more secure. And the report says election officials and vendors of voting equipment should be required to disclose to federal and state authorities all attempts to breach security and any newly discovered vulnerabilities in equipment, software and databases.3. Verify election results.With public confidence in elections declining, the panel said states should require public, transparent audits of all elections to guarantee their integrity, including audits of processes \u2014 like voter registration, preparing ballots and reporting of results \u2014 that normally get little scrutiny. The audit data, scrubbed of any private voter information, should be made public so outsiders can verify the results themselves.4. Crosscheck voter registrations nationwide to weed out duplicates.The report urges all states to adopt some method of comparing their registration databases with those of other states to eliminate duplicates from voters who have moved. That would eliminate instances in which voters cast ballots in two locations undetected.In practice, double voting is extremely rare. But election experts say that accurate matching systems would help pare state voter rolls, which are bloated by voters who move but fail to ask election officials in their old districts to remove them.Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia already match registration databases via the Electronic Registration Information Center, a nonprofit agency run by its member states.5. Make voting by mail more secure.Voting by mail is now the standard in Colorado, Oregon and Washington and is rapidly gaining popularity elsewhere. But mailed-in and absentee ballots are at greater risk of theft, forgery and other kinds of fraud \u2014 it\u2019s easier, for example, to buy votes or coerce someone into casting a ballot by mail than it would be in the privacy of a voting booth.Although this kind of voting fraud is also quite rare, the report urges all states to adopt systems that let voters easily verify whether ballots have been mailed to them and whether marked ballots have been received and accepted by election offices. It also calls for the development of new technologies that could counter coercion, vote-buying and other frauds.To combat fraud at the ballot box \u2014 the rarest of all \u2014 the report urges a host of federal agencies to sponsor research into reliable ways of verifying voters\u2019 identities like biometric markers (fingerprints and iris scans, for example).6. Spend more to make elections trustworthy.Again and again, the report hammers home the message that federal and state authorities pinch pennies when it comes to protecting the constitutional right to vote. The experts call for \u201cappropriate\u201d funding of the United States Election Assistance Commission, a little-known advisory body that plays a crucial role in improving election administration.They also urge Congress to allot more money to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which helps develop voluntary security guidelines for voting equipment, so that it can work on security standards for other election procedures and equipment. And the report asks Congress to finance \u201ca major initiative on voting\u201d that would establish academic research centers to improve election technology and administration.Finally, the experts urge Congress and the states to create an ongoing stream of money to replace worn-out and outdated voting equipment. The last major federal funding for voting equipment was approved in 2002, when Congress passed the Help America Vote Act to address electoral failures highlighted by the contested 2000 presidential election.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Corrupt Bargain of the Adults in the Room", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey\u2019re not restraining Trump. They\u2019re making him more powerful. Opinion ColumnistKavanaugh stumbled. He repeated the firm\u2019s name as if he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever heard it before. He told Harris he didn\u2019t know everyone who works there, and asked her, in several different ways, who she was thinking of. \u201cI think you\u2019re thinking of someone and you don\u2019t want to tell us,\u201d said Harris, a former prosecutor. \u201cWho did you have a conversation with?\u201d Throughout the exchange, which continued for several minutes, Kavanaugh was evasive. Entering the hearing room on Thursday, Harris told reporters, \u201cI have good reason to believe there was a conversation. Information that I\u2019ve received is reliable and I asked him a clear question and he couldn\u2019t give a clear answer.\u201d[Receive the day\u2019s most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.] He will owe his elevation to Trump, who is in effect an unindicted co-conspirator in a campaign finance crime that helped him achieve his minority victory. There\u2019s every reason to believe that Kavanaugh will shield the president from accountability or restraints on his power. Yet even Republicans who think Trump is a menace are desperate to confirm his judicial pick.What we have here, in miniature, is the corrupt bargain Washington Republicans have made with a president many of them privately despise. They know Trump is unfit, but he gives them tax cuts and right-wing judges. Those tax cuts and right-wing judges, in turn, strengthen the president\u2019s hand, buying him gratitude from rich donors and potential legal cover. Republicans who participate in this cycle seem convinced that the situation is, and will remain, under their control.\u201cWe want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous,\u201d the official wrote, adding, \u201cThere are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more.\u201dOne answer is that they care about the norms of American democracy \u2014 at least some of them \u2014 but not quite as much as they care about the agenda of the Republican Party.If Kavanaugh weren\u2019t confirmed, it would be a profound blow to Trump, and not just because he would look weak and disappoint his evangelical base. Without Kavanaugh, Trump wouldn\u2019t be assured of a conservative majority on the Supreme Court if and when it rules on him and his administration. With Kavanaugh, the tie-breaking vote on the Supreme Court will be a right-wing apparatchik chosen in part for his deference to executive power.A vote for Kavanaugh is thus a vote to give Trump a measure of impunity. Republican senators who know the president is out of control have a choice \u2014 they can maintain a check on his ill-considered autocratic inclinations, or solidify right-wing power on the Supreme Court for a generation. It\u2019s obvious which way they\u2019ll go. Maybe they\u2019ll tell themselves having adults in the room at the White House makes it O.K. Advertisement"}

Did the near-death experience itself \u2014 or the regulations that came after \u2014 fundamentally change the souls of Wall Street\u2019s upper echelon?Many on Wall Street like to say so. Lessons have been learned, they say.But Mr. Niccolini has had a table-side view of moguldom for decades, and he knows what he saw.In the aftermath of the crisis, whether out of a sense of guilt or anxiety about sending the wrong message, there were attempts at frugality. \u201cPeople started to watch what they were spending,\u201d he said. And nobody wanted to be showy: \u201cPrivate events went way down.\u201dBut that thriftiness evaporated in a matter of months. \u201cEverything became the same again, because these people have money,\u201d Mr. Niccolini said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that part. They have money. They want to spend money.\u201dBonuses returned to Wall Street by the end of 2009 \u2014 Goldman Sachs\u2019s bonus payments reached $16.7 billion, the highest level in its history \u2014 and the financial power players returned to the Four Seasons.\u201cYou know, half the people in this place could be prosecuted,\u201d Oliver Stone, the film director, told me with a sense of glee in 2010 as he surveyed the Grill Room. It was just before the premiere of \u201cWall Street: Money Never Sleeps,\u201d in which he revisited Gordon Gekko\u2019s universe and a post-crisis \u201cWall Street.\u201dEven those laid low by the crisis, like Dick Fuld, the final chief executive of Lehman Brothers, found refuge at the Four Seasons. \u201cHe used to come once in a while,\u201d Mr. Niccolini said. \u201cHe was not treated any different than any other people.\u201dThere have been longstanding changes, of course. But the one that stands out to Mr. Niccolini reflects a change in societal attitudes more than industry ideals. He\u2019s less sanguine about the move toward more casual dress: \u201cI'm waiting for Dan Loeb to show up with sneakers on,\u201d he said referring to the activist hedge fund manager, with a quick laugh. \u201cI mean really, no. It's still Park Avenue, believe it or not.\u201dWhether over drinks or duck, part of what long mattered about the Four Seasons was being there. \u201cIt was important to be seen, to carry on negotiations privately but in sight of others,\u201d Paul Freedman wrote in his 2016 book, \u201cTen Restaurants That Changed America.\u201d The Four Seasons, with its cathedral ceilings, allowed patrons to \u201csee their neighbors, hear their own confidential conversation without difficulty, and not be overheard \u2014 all in a serenely luxurious setting,\u201d he wrote.\u201cI\u2019ve dealt with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is something of the past.\u201d\u201cEverybody wants to pick their own table,\u201d Mr. Niccolini said, listing the names of Wall Street luminaries who had visited the restaurant before its opening to claim a spot.\u201cYou know what that means? They are saying: \u2018I have more money than you. I have more power than you. I am in charge,\u2019\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s about money. It\u2019s about power,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed. In fact, it\u2019s getting much worse.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stormy Daniels\u2019s \u2018Full Disclosure\u2019 Book Will Likely Rattle White House", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsIn her new memoir, \u201cFull Disclosure,\u201d Stormy Daniels cites a statement that President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, asked her to sign, denying that she had a sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. \u201cIf indeed I did have a relationship with Donald Trump,\u201d the statement read, \u201ctrust me, you wouldn\u2019t be reading about it in the news, you would be reading about it in my book.\u201dMs. Daniels, a pornographic actress and director whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, later alleged that the statement she was told to sign was false. She maintains that she did have an affair with Mr. Trump, and was threatened into silence.But it was true in one respect. People will soon be reading about it in her book.\u201cFull Disclosure,\u201d which St. Martin\u2019s Press will publish on Oct. 2, contains few new bombshells, but it is likely to rattle the White House nonetheless. In the memoir, Ms. Clifford gives a vivid, detailed account of her encounter with Mr. Trump in 2006 and its aftermath. Her book comes out just weeks before the November midterm elections, potentially bringing her story back into the headlines as Democrats and Republicans fight over control of Congress.The news media has covered Ms. Clifford\u2019s story heavily for the better part of 2018, since the news that Mr. Cohen paid her hush money first broke toward the start of the year. What began as a tale about money paid to silence a porn star alleging an affair with a major presidential candidate went on to become a full-fledged campaign finance scandal. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty last month to illegally paying Ms. Clifford \u2014 far in excess of the legal donation limits \u2014 to protect Mr. Trump\u2019s election prospects, saying he was acting at Mr. Trump\u2019s direction.The book does not add many new details to the basic facts of the legal case, though Ms. Clifford does raise questions about efforts to shut down the publication of her story after she made arrangements to sell it to In Touch magazine in 2011. Mr. Trump was also contemplating a presidential run that year.Ms. Clifford writes that in making an offer to have her on his reality-competition show \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d during his courtship of her, Mr. Trump said he would help her cheat to avoid losing the \u201cchallenges\u201d the show staged to pare down the contestants. As she has noted previously, he did not make good on his promise to get her onto the show.She reports that during one visit with Mr. Trump \u2014 while watching a \u201cShark Week\u201d documentary \u2014 Mr. Trump fielded a call from Hillary Clinton, whose 2008 bid for the presidency Mr. Trump supported. Ms. Clifford also shared new details about Mr. Trump\u2019s genitalia, which caused a predictable stir on Twitter on Tuesday.The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency has proved to be an unexpected boon for the publishing industry, which has unleashed a barrage of juicy insider accounts. In a typical presidency, pundits and journalists have to wait years for administration insiders to spill the details. Out of either deference or self-preservation, government officials often hold off until a new administration is in place to offer their insider account. But the chaos and turmoil within the Trump administration has upended the usual Washington publishing cycle, as disgruntled ex-staff members and officials who have been pushed out or resigned churn out books at a breakneck pace, at least by the normally glacial standards of publishing.Many of these accounts have shot to the top of the best-seller lists, often after the White House disputes the revelations or threatens legal action, prompting a fresh round of news coverage.\u201cThe ideal thing is to have a book that Trump attacks, because that all but guarantees you best-seller status,\u201d said Matt Latimer, a literary agent and co-partner at Javelin, which represents James Comey.Publishers have had to become more nimble to stay relevant at a chaotic and hyperpartisan moment.\u201cThe challenge that it poses is that the news cycle changes every day; it\u2019s like a Ping-Pong match trying to figure out where the country\u2019s attention is going to be,\u201d said Jennifer Enderlin, executive vice president and publisher of St. Martin\u2019s.\u201cNo matter the volatility of the news cycle, there are some authors and books that will make the public stop and pay attention, and we think we have two of them,\u201d she added, referring to Ms. Clifford\u2019s and Mr. McCabe\u2019s forthcoming books. \u201cIt seems fair that they get to tell their story, since Trump has the biggest megaphone in the country and he gets to say all kinds of things about them.\u201dMs. Clifford\u2019s fall book publicity tour and possible presence on best-seller lists could serve as reminders to voters of the allegations of infidelity surrounding Mr. Trump \u2014 as well as the campaign improprieties related to them that resulted in the felonious campaign finance violations to which Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty.Then again, Ms. Clifford\u2019s allegations against Mr. Trump are clearly already baked into voter impressions of him at this stage, and some political strategists did not expect the book to significantly alter perceptions of him in ways that would change the dynamic of the fall campaign.\u201cFor Trump supporters, they\u2019ve processed it and they\u2019ve come to their own conclusions on it; for people who don\u2019t like Trump, they\u2019ve also processed it,\u201d said Russ Schriefer, a Republican political strategist involved in several races this fall. \u201cIt adds to the sideshow quality of it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really going to affect voters that much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rent vs. Buy: Suburban Edition", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThanks to an uncertain real estate market, more people in New York\u2019s suburbs are putting off buying a home and renting one instead.\u201cIt was a big move \u2014 neither of us had ever lived in Connecticut,\u201d said Ms. Raupp-Temple, 43, an author and acupuncturist. Renting, it turned out, gave them time to figure out that they loved Westport. And yet, when their lease was up earlier this year, they decided to rent again. Mr. Temple, 46, works in finance, and he was convinced that home prices, already dropping, would continue to decline. \u201cOur parents\u2019 mentality was, you bought your home and that was your major profit place. Now, I think people are a little more cautious,\u201d Ms. Raupp-Temple said. In a real estate market tinged with so much uncertainty, renting at more than $5,000, $8,000 or even $10,000 a month feels like a safer bet these days to a number of people who could well afford to buy in the suburban counties of Fairfield and Westchester, where median sale prices in many towns are above $1 million. Indeed, demand for high-end single-family rentals is up significantly, a trend that dovetails with a decline in sales in New York and across portions of the region. Many would-be buyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward a market softened by uncertainty over the new federal tax law and general uneasiness about the economy, even as mortgage interest rates continue to rise. They are less concerned about shelling out so much money for monthly rent than about making a costly purchase they may later regret.When the Temples and their young son first moved to Westport, they rented a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom home for just under $5,000 a month. The rent was no small sum, but in the city they had been paying more for less: $6,500 for a three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. Now they are waiting out the market in a rambling older home just over the border in Wilton, at $5,100 a month. \u201cThere are so many other ways to invest and make money than real estate now,\u201d Ms. Raupp-Temple said. In Fairfield County, the volume of single-family rentals was up 13 percent in July compared to a year ago, according to data from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. In Westchester County, it was up 9.6 percent. Growth in single-family home rentals over the past few years has been most significant at the high end, agents said. The second-quarter market report from William Pitt/Julia B. Fee Sotheby\u2019s International Realty cited \u201can exploding rental market\u201d among high-end properties in the southern part of Fairfield County, in particular. Data provided by the firm showed that for the first half of 2018, the number of homes that rented for $5,000 or more a month in the county as a whole was up 33 percent, to 268, compared to 2015. That included 61 properties that rented for $10,000 or more, a 35 percent increase over 2015.Westchester also showed growth in high-end rentals, but at a slower pace of just over 12 percent, and almost exclusively in the southern end of the county. Nevertheless, Ms. Collins said she had been approached by more agents than usual this year asking whether properties she had listed for sale might instead be available to rent. In at least two cases where agents negotiated rental agreements with Ms. Collins, the clients were seeking rentals because they were relocating from abroad. To meet this growing demand, more high-end sellers seem to be willing to rent, especially if they can\u2019t get the sale price they want. The number of homes offered for rent at $5,000 and up in Fairfield County during the first half of the year was 25 percent higher than five years ago, according to data from William Pitt. In Westchester, inventory was up 18 percent.Homeowners are opting to rent their homes out not just to wait for a stronger market, but also as a way to cut potential losses, said Jaime Sneddon, an associate broker with the New Canaan, Conn., office of William Pitt. If a homeowner sells a primary residence for less than it was bought for, the loss does not qualify for a tax deduction. But if the homeowner rents the house for at least two years, it can be legally converted to an investment property for tax purposes, and any capital loss when it is sold can be written off against future income.\u201cNot everybody can afford to do that, but many of my clients have done it this year,\u201d Mr. Sneddon said.\u201cWe\u2019re going through this era of uncertainty,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAnd what do buyers do when the near-term seems uncertain? They pause.\u201d\u201cPeople are just nervous that values will continue to decline, and for that reason, more people are opting to rent, if they are not forced to buy,\u201d he said. The suburban rental market has always appealed to people moving to the area for a change of employment, but a hesitancy to buy seems more pronounced in the current uncertain market, with renters hedging their bets in case it turns out they don\u2019t stay in their jobs, said Helen R. Cusa, an agent with Halstead.She recently helped a family moving from Los Angeles rent a four-bedroom home, at $10,500 a month, in the Saugatuck section of Westport. Availability of rentals has been higher than usual this year in Westport because of an excess of homes for sale above $2.5 million, she said.Like the Temples, they didn\u2019t want to buy in Westport until they had tried it out. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you\u2019re spending that much more on rent than you would on a mortgage,\u201d Ms. Fine said. \u201cBeing in a home you purchased that is not the right fit is a bigger challenge if you have to sell. You have to weigh out what\u2019s more important.\u201dRenting a house also gives longtime apartment dwellers time to figure out what they really want in single-family living. Since moving to Wilton, Ms. Raupp-Temple said, she has concluded that an older home is not for her \u2014 too much upkeep. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also getting a sense of how much space we need,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we would be fine with three bedrooms, two baths. You start to realize what your needs really are.\u201dInsecurity about the market is also turning more sellers into renters, at least in the short term. Todd David Miller, a vice president of sales at the Higgins Group, said that of the $57 million in sales his team has done so far this year, primarily in the towns of Westport and Fairfield, almost all of the sellers have either moved out of state or are renting in the area. Those who are staying in the area are gravitating toward home rentals near the beach.\u201cThese are mainly higher-end transactions, and the majority of them had to sell at a loss,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to put any more money into real estate right now.\u201d Leslie Razook, an agent with William Pitt, sees the same trend in the New Canaan and Greenwich markets. Baby boomers who have sold the family house are looking for rental homes in walkable neighborhoods near the center of New Canaan or a block off the Greenwich Avenue commercial district. \u201cPeople are more careful in making these transitional decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cParticularly for people who have just sold a house \u2014 they don\u2019t want to get tied down right away.\u201d \u201cI felt like, why force the issue of buying when you can rent?\u201d Mr. Ackerman said. They are now renting a four-bedroom home in Darien for $7,000 a month. And \u201chome prices seem to be coming our way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made a good sale, and I think we\u2019re going to have an opportunity.\u201dYounger couples are also taking their time with those transitions. Harper and Scott Mates spent a year renting a seven-bedroom house in Rye, N.Y., before deciding to buy their own home there this summer. Coming from the city with three young children, they knew they wanted to stay within reasonable commuting distance of their jobs, but weren\u2019t certain Rye would be the best choice. Instead they fell for Rye, where the median sale price of a house was just under $2 million in July. As the end of their lease approached in August, they jumped on a five-bedroom house on an acre within a few days of its listing. Renting for a year didn\u2019t necessarily enable them to get a better deal on a house, said Mr. Mates, 39, who also works in finance, but it prevented them from making a costly mistake. \u201cSpending all this money on rent for a year is a heck of a lot cheaper than buying a place we don\u2019t like and having to sell it and move again,\u201d he said. And they know they are not alone in their thinking: At a recent play date with children in their oldest child\u2019s kindergarten class, the Mates met three other families who had done exactly the same thing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What We Need to Fight the Next Financial Crisis", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress has taken away some of the tools that were crucial to us during the 2008 panic. It\u2019s time to bring them back.Mr. Bernanke is a former chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Geithner and Mr. Paulson are former Treasury secretaries. The seeds of the panic were sown over decades, as the American financial system outgrew the protections against panics that were put in place after the Great Depression. Depression-era safeguards, like deposit insurance, were aimed at ensuring that the banking system remained stable, but by 2007 more than half of all credit flowed outside banks. Financial innovations, like subprime mortgages and automated credit scoring, helped millions to buy homes, but they also facilitated unwise risk-taking by lenders and investors. Although we and other financial regulators did not foresee the crisis, we moved aggressively to stop it. Acting in its traditional role as lender of last resort, the Federal Reserve provided massive quantities of short-term loans to financial institutions facing runs, while cutting interest rates nearly to zero. The Treasury Department stopped a run on money market funds by providing a backstop for investors. The Treasury also managed the takeover of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and worked with the Fed to try to prevent the collapse of large, systemically important financial firms. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guaranteed bank debt and protected depositors.But the powers of the regulators alone proved inadequate. Congressional action made it possible for two presidents, one Republican and one Democratic, working with regulators, to prevent the collapse of the financial system and avoid another Great Depression. Most importantly, Congress provided capital to the banking system, allowing for the normalization of credit flows. Congress also provided support for housing and mortgage markets and authorized a powerful fiscal stimulus. The economy began to grow again in mid-2009, and the funds deployed by Congress were recovered with substantial profit to the taxpayer. Policymakers certainly didn\u2019t get everything right. But compared to most other countries, America\u2019s post-2008 recovery started sooner, was completed faster and was built on healthier foundations. Are we ready for the next crisis? In some respects, yes. Reforms of financial regulation have helped make the system more resilient, making a crisis less likely to occur. Banks and other key financial institutions are financially stronger, and the gaps in regulatory oversight have largely been closed. Regulators are more attuned to systemwide risks. Our main concern is that these defenses will erode over time and risk-taking will emerge in corners of the financial system that are less constrained by regulation. Even if a financial crisis is now less likely, one will occur eventually. To contain the damage, the Treasury and financial regulators need adequate firefighting tools. After the crisis, Congress gave regulators some promising new authorities to help them manage the failure of an individual financial institution, tools we did not have in the fall of 2008 when we faced the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers. The so-called orderly liquidation authority, for example, which was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, could help regulators unwind a failing firm in a manner that could be less damaging to the system as a whole. But in its post-crisis reforms, Congress also took away some of the most powerful tools used by the FDIC, the Fed and the Treasury. Among these changes, the FDIC can no longer issue blanket guarantees of bank debt as it did in the crisis, the Fed\u2019s emergency lending powers have been constrained, and the Treasury would not be able to repeat its guarantee of the money market funds. These powers were critical in stopping the 2008 panic.From a political perspective, Congress\u2019s decision to limit these crisis-fighting tools was predictable. Many of the actions necessary to stem the crisis, including the provision of loans and capital to financial institutions, were controversial and unpopular. To us, as to the public, the responses often seemed unjust, helping some of the very people and firms who had caused the damage. Those reactions are completely understandable, particularly since the economic pain from the panic was devastating for many.The paradox of any financial crisis is that the policies necessary to stop it are always politically unpopular. But if that unpopularity delays or prevents a strong response, the costs to the economy become greater. We need to make sure that future generations of financial firefighters have the emergency powers they need to prevent the next fire from becoming a conflagration. We must also resist calls to eliminate safeguards as the memory of the crisis fades. For those working to keep our financial system resilient, the enemy is forgetting.Advertisement"}

Cohen, his longtime fixer, offered late Friday night to tear up a nondisclosure agreement with a pornographic film star who has long claimed she had an affair with Mr. Trump.It remained unclear why Mr. Cohen made the abrupt move to scrap the hush-money deal with the star, Stephanie Clifford, who is better known as Stormy Daniels. But one effect of voiding the arrangement would be that it could spare Mr. Trump the embarrassment of having to give a deposition in a lawsuit related to the case.In a letter dated Sept. 7, Mr. Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Brent H. Blakely, wrote to Ms. Clifford\u2019s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, saying that Mr. Cohen had agreed \u201cto accept the rescission\u201d of the deal, which was reached in October 2016, a month before the presidential election.Mr. Cohen is \u201cnow pulling a legal stunt to try and \u2018fix it\u2019 so that we can\u2019t depose Trump and present evidence to the American people about what happened,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said.Mr. Blakely, who is based in Los Angeles, did not immediately respond to efforts to reach him, but in an interview on Saturday morning, Mr. Avenatti insisted that the offer was \u201cdead on arrival.\u201dMr. Avenatti noted that even though Mr. Cohen had offered to rescind the deal, Mr. Trump had not extended a similar proposal. Mr. Avenatti added that he would accept the offer only if both Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump acknowledged that the nondisclosure deal was illegal from the start because it violated federal campaign finance laws.But once he pleaded guilty and the criminal case was largely resolved, it remained uncertain whether he could still avail himself of Fifth Amendment safeguards and whether he \u2014 and Mr. Trump \u2014 still had legal grounds to avoid giving testimony about the deal.Late last month, Mr. Avenatti filed court papers that again asked the judge in the case to let him take the president\u2019s deposition.The lawyer defending Mr. Trump in the lawsuit, Charles J.

The house, she added, was named for the papelillo (or paperbark) trees that traverse the structure, giving it the feeling of being one with the landscape.The property includes a two-car garage, as well as separate staff quarters on the top level. The furnishings are also included in the sale.The ground level has a gym, two full bathrooms and an indoor lounge that opens to a rear terrace with a heated infinity pool overlooking Banderas Bay and areas for sunbathing, dining and barbecuing. Thatched structures, or palapas, dot the terraces; one is situated at the edge of the property, providing spectacular views of the coast. \u201cIt\u2019s right above the ocean,\u201d Mr. Elias said. \u201cYou can see and feel the waves crashing on the rocks beneath.\u201dThe home is entered on the main level, through a spacious foyer that flows into a living room, formal dining area and eat-in chef\u2019s kitchen. All have access to a bay-facing terrace and gardens, with additional outdoor lounging and eating areas. This floor also contains two en suite bedrooms (one with a balcony), a laundry area and a temperature-controlled wine cellar.Each of the five bedrooms has an en suite marble bath. Three of the bedrooms are on the second level, including a spacious master suite with a seating area and a walk-in closet. All of the bedrooms have access to a terrace or balcony. Throughout the home, high ceilings and walls of windows offer abundant light and panoramic views of the beach and tropical gardens, along with a variety of natural stone and wood finishes. About a dozen papelillo trees grow through the building, reaching through floors and ceilings. The house comes with central air-conditioning and ceiling fans, as well as lighting control and a surround-sound music system.The community of El Pared\u00f3n is a short drive from downtown Puerto Vallarta (which has a population of around 250,000), in the state of Jalisco, and is about 37 miles from the Punta Mita resort community. The area, popular with tourists, is known for its beaches, water sports and night life. Licenciado Gustavo Diaz Ordaz International Airport is about 11 miles away. \u201cA lot of new product has been brought to the market,\u201d said Brock Squire, the owner and broker of Coldwell Banker La Costa Realty. That includes several new luxury condominium projects, he said, \u201cand this new product has been absorbed extremely well.\u201d The sales volume for luxury homes in Mr. Squire\u2019s office is about 30 percent higher than it was at this time last year, he said, while prices are around 15 percent higher. Luxury two-bedroom condos with water views typically start at around $450,000, he said, although units farther from the water can go for as little as $250,000. Wayne Franklin, the broker and owner of Tropicasa Realty, in Puerto Vallarta, said most buyers are interested in newer construction, and look for proximity to towns and services, as that helps them rent out the homes. \u201cVilla buyers are looking for space as well as the ability to rent,\u201d he noted, \u201cwith a focus on being in turnkey condition in prime view or oceanfront locations.\u201dWarm weather, sandy beaches and tropical forests draw many visitors to the area, including foreign buyers looking for vacation or retirement homes. Mr. Squire estimated that about 60 percent of the foreign buyers in the region come from the United States, with another 30 percent from Canada and the rest from Europe, particularly France, Britain, Italy and Germany.But \u201cEuropeans are increasing faster in numbers than the Americans,\u201d said Charles Tibshirani, senior partner and founder of MexLaw, a law firm with offices in Mexico and Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe, modern city,\u201d Mr. Tibshirani said of Puerto Vallarta. \u201cIt has all the amenities: shopping centers, hospitals, great views.\u201d International buyers face few restrictions in Mexico. But Mexican law requires they buy through a bank trust or corporation, Mr. Tibshirani said, if the property is within 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, of the coastline (which is the case in Puerto Vallarta). The bank holds the trust deed for the buyer, who becomes the beneficiary and retains full ownership rights.Local banks are reluctant to provide mortgages to foreigners, Mr. Tibshirani said, so most foreign buyers either pay in cash or obtaining financing in their home countries, although \u201csome of the developers do finance on newer properties.\u201d All closing documents are prepared and certified by a public notary, Mr. Squire said, but buyers may also choose to work with a closing coordinator, who helps collect the necessary paperwork and facilitate the closing; some of the larger real estate brokerages provide these services in-house. Buyers may also want to hire a lawyer to represent them at the closing and oversee due diligence on the property.  The entire process usually takes around four to five months, Mr. Tibshirani said.Spanish; Mexican peso (1 peso = $0.052)Sellers usually pay the real estate agent\u2019s commission, which ranges from 6 to 8 percent of the sales price.Buyers can expect to pay, on average, 5 to 6 percent of the sales price in closing costs, Mr. Tibshirani said, including fees for the notary and registration and an acquisition tax. The annual property taxes on this house are 70,000 pesos, or around $3,700, Mr. Elias said. Monthly common charges are $1,600, and include access to a community clubhouse, pool and private beach.

{"Headline": "The Progressive Playbook: How These Candidates Pulled Off Their Upsets", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmong the surprises this primary season were several high-profile upsets from the left. The Times asked some of the strategists and candidates behind these wins to break them down.The New York Times spoke with the strategists, campaign managers and candidates at the front lines of progressive insurgent victories, in search of common threads that defined successful campaigns this election cycle.Here they are: A progressive candidate in a district full of moderate voters can overcome some ideological differences, and bring new voters into the process, through personality. A candidate\u2019s life experience needs to reflect those of the voters she needs to convince, the group of experts said. \u201cThere has to be the right coalition \u2014 it has to be the right message, it has to be the right candidate,\u201d he said. A nimble, grass-roots campaign must also be responsive to voter feedback, the experts said. Whether it\u2019s listening to the advice of on-the-ground organizers, or tailoring digital messages to response patterns, the advantage of a nontraditional campaign should be its ability to quickly adjust. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to spend $20,000 on direct mail, maybe spend $700 and test it on Facebook in a targeted way first,\u201d she said.Newer tools aren\u2019t an automatic path to victory, of course. And social media popularity doesn't always translate to votes. In New York, Ms. Nixon dominated the conversation on Twitter, but she was handily defeated by incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo, whose campaign quietly spent more than $2 million on digital advertising, with a heavy focus on Facebook.Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign convened a weekly feedback circle of community leaders, local activists and volunteers. Sarah Groh, Ms. Pressley's 29-year-old campaign manager, said the advisers allowed the team to notice where their opponent was making gains. When the group felt some of the incumbent\u2019s messages were beginning to take hold in the later stages of the race, they decided that Ms. Pressley should record another video ad, focused on delivering her final message to voters in an easy-to-digest fashion. \u201cYou have to be willing to lose,\u201d she said.\u201cEveryone says, \u2018You're not taking the right path,\u2019 but I was just very firm that I don't want to just step into someone else's footprints: I want to create new footprints,\u201d Ms. Hayes said. Abolish ICE. No corporate PAC money. Medicare for all. As national Democrats wrangle with incremental, politically pragmatic solutions to policy problems such as immigration and health care, progressive Democrats are offering bold, sweeping proposals. \u201cOne of the things that we feel strongly about is that candidates run an unapologetically progressive campaign and speak authentically about the issues that they actually care about connect with voters,\u201d said Maurice Mitchell, national director for the Working Families Party. The bold policy proposals gave liberals a progressive version of the Tea Party wave in the Republican Party \u2014 the angry, uncompromising conservative surge that consumed the party after President Obama\u2019s election. It is also a rebuttal to the idea that progressive Democrats are simply against President Trump. Ms. Groh, Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign manager, came to the campaign without any experience in traditional electoral races, but experience in issue-based grass-roots campaigns. Ms. Groh said she believed voters craved a \u201clevel of authenticity,\u201d and innovative policy solutions, delivered by the right messenger, can check that box. Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign manager said ignoring television was the source of internal campaign battles, but the move allowed them to invest an additional $130,000 in field organizers. It also allowed the campaign to spend money on targeted media \u2014 including an advertisement on Spanish-language television and outreach on several ethnic media outlets in Boston. Josi Nielsen, the Missouri political strategist who managed Mr. Bell\u2019s election, said the campaign advertised in community newspapers, which have a small but deeply engaged audience. \u201cIf the message resonates, the challenge is reaching enough people,\u201d Ms. Nielsen said. This year\u2019s insurgent candidates have also looked to another, new not-so-secret weapon: text messages. Several relied on peer-to-peer texting apps like Hustle and Relay to reach huge numbers of voters directly on their cellphones.Ms. Pressley\u2019s team started using Hustle on August 9, initially for event building and volunteer recruitment.The campaign communicated with 4,800 volunteer prospects through the service \u2014 25 percent of them replied to the texts, and close to 8 percent of those texted committed to help.During the campaign\u2019s final days, the campaign initiated conversations with 26,500 voters, reaching out with over 41,000 messages in total.\u201cHustle is a game changer for grass-roots organizing and fund-raising. It allowed us to connect with so many different parts of the district and was an important piece in our path to victory,\u201d said Gina Christo, Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign finance director.

{"Headline": "On Her Debut Album, Noname Is a Sly Hip-Hop Maverick", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlbum ReviewNoname has invented herself as a nonchalant counterbalance to mass-market hip-hop. In \u201cSelf,\u201d the brief track that opens the album, she taunts, \u201cY\u2019all really thought a bitch couldn\u2019t rap?,\u201d but her delivery is far from pushy or confrontational. She\u2019s above it all, laughing at how nonsensical that idea was.While million-streaming hits reduce themselves to the barest minimum of brittle notes and syllables, plus the maximum of barking self-promotion, Noname offers density and abundance instead. She has a lot on her mind as a person, citizen and performer; she strives to encompass it all, including what she knows and what she doesn\u2019t.Her lines of lyrics are long, fast, polysyllabic, intricately rhymed, packed with convoluted allusions and delivered with melodic inflections \u2014 her own extension of the rapping virtuosity of the 1990s, ambitious but never bombastic. The music, almost all of it produced by her invaluable collaborator Phoelix, is filled with the chord progressions of jazz and R&B, elaborately casual beats that always seem to be taking their time, and glimmering keyboards and warm synthesizer tones that echo Stevie Wonder. Even when the material is looped, it sounds like it\u2019s played by people, not machines.What she wants to say on \u201cRoom 25\u201d is complex: thoughts on community, sensuality, mortality and self-determination. The music of \u201cPrayer Song\u201d hovers with electric-piano chords and wordless backup voices; the lyrics are a kaleidoscopic, free-associative vision of Los Angeles, touching on lust, violence, gentrification, plastic surgery, masculinity, conspicuous consumption and religion. In \u201cBlaxploitation,\u201d a brisk funk bass riff carries sound bites about revolution and Noname rapping at top speed about systemic racism, stereotypes and constant tension: \u201cI\u2019m struggling to simmer down/Maybe I\u2019m an insomni-black.\u201dNoname is a full-fledged maverick, but not an abrasive one. Phoelix\u2019s production situates her in leisurely, atmospheric R&B, and there\u2019s almost always the hint of a smile in her voice. But no one should mistake her soft, playful tone for submissiveness.Advertisement"}

Although hey \u2014 that apple looks very tasty. See? Something good can come out of something very bad.The Kavanaugh nomination\u2019s trip through the Judiciary Committee was stupendously depressing. But the chaotic finale seemed like a relief. Republican Jeff Flake, the swing vote, announced he was going to demand an F.B.I. investigation into charges that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford before he\u2019d back the nomination on the Senate floor. And if Blasey\u2019s supporters weren\u2019t super-thrilled, they at least had to feel that attention was being paid.Flake currently appears to be the swing vote on everything. Perhaps you\u2019d rather not have the entire future of the Supreme Court hinging on the feelings of one lame-duck Republican from Arizona. Makes sense. On the other hand, it\u2019s way better than Lindsey Graham.Pop Quiz: What was the weirdest moment during Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s trip through the Judiciary Committee?A) Graham\u2019s announcement that \u201cI know I\u2019m a single white male from South Carolina and I\u2019m told I should shut up, but I will not shut up.\u201dB) Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah\u2019s description of Blasey as \u201can attractive, good witness \u2026 in other words, she\u2019s pleasing.\u201dC) Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony that \u201cboofed\u201d meant \u201cflatulence.\u201dWe certainly have learned a lot about Kavanaugh over the last few weeks. From his affection for beer to the fact that he\u2019s the kind of guy who says \u201cshe and I did not travel in the same social circles.\u201d And did he mention that he was No. 1 in his class? And captain of the basketball team?Kavanaugh\u2019s opening rant unnerved even some of the Republicans. That was when he blamed attempts to destroy \u201cmy family and my good name\u201d on enemies seeking \u201crevenge on behalf of the Clintons\u201d and \u201coutside left-wing opposition groups.\u201dScary to imagine him sitting on a campaign finance case.On the plus side, Kavanaugh\u2019s performance was hardly the worst thing America\u2019s ever seen in the legislative process. There was the time a congressmen beat a senator to a bloody pulp with his cane. That was, however, in 1856.Some Republicans predicted that if Kavanaugh lost, every man in America would be afraid to accept an important judicial post. Because, of course, you could never tell when some unknown woman would leap out of nowhere and accuse you of sexual assault. \u201cIt is the end of good people wanting to be judges,\u201d Graham warned Friday.That\u2019s easily tested. Withdraw the Kavanaugh nomination and see how many male judges tell you they don\u2019t want to be considered for the Supreme Court. Or try picking a woman.On the other hand, one of the lasting effects of the Kavanaugh drama might be to encourage ambitious young men to be more cautious about the way they behave when they\u2019re at drinking parties. See? More good news.The Kavanaugh hearing was one tough slog, given the way the whole thing devolved into a wildly partisan yelling match. By the end of the week you got the impression that many of the senators had frightened even themselves.On Friday, Graham held out the Republicans\u2019 current favorite bipartisan olive branch, which involves saying something nice about Joe Biden. (\u201cHe\u2019s a decent guy. If he runs for president he\u2019ll be hard to beat.\u201d)But through it all, the great story was Blasey, whose appearance before the senators is going to change the way America looks at victims of sexual assault forever. For all the Republicans\u2019 desire to undermine her testimony, nobody dared to withhold respect.\u201cI thought her testimony was very compelling,\u201d President Trump told reporters, in what was for him a moment of extreme discretion and self-control. Of course, the president said he thought Kavanaugh was compelling, too.A lot of Republicans carefully said that everybody was right. Chairman Chuck Grassley managed to announce he found both witnesses \u201ccredible.\u201dWhich, of course, was impossible. Kavanaugh may wind up getting the Supreme Court seat, but Blasey was the one who triumphed. \u201cYou should be proud of your mom,\u201d Connecticut\u2019s Richard Blumenthal said to Blasey\u2019s sons. \u201cShe is a profile in courage and her name will be in the history books long after ours are gone.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lehman Failed for Good Reasons", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byToo many banks still lack the checks and balances that might have saved Lehman Brothers.Ms. Antoncic was the chief risk officer of Lehman Brothers from 2002 until 2007.At its peak, AIG had a market cap of about $240 billion (over four times that of Lehman at its peak), it had $1 trillion in assets, wrote insurance in 80 countries, and it had written protection on hundreds of billions of dollars of various forms of debt \u2014 much of which was helping American and European banks increase the asset quality of their balance sheets. Saving AIG avoided a global macroeconomic catastrophe.As it is, many lives were destroyed. What bothers me most is that the carnage created by developed economies reached people in every corner of the world.To be sure, some things could have been done better, and many decisions could have been made faster. So what have we learned? Are we more financially secure, or are we still vulnerable?There have been major reforms. There is more transparency and tighter controls. Banks, and in particular large international banks, have more capital and better quality capital. Liquidity and funding ratios have been introduced to address asset and liability mismatch. Regulators no longer rely only on banks\u2019 internal models to assess risks, but instead have introduced leverage ratios based on asset size to limit the size of a bank\u2019s balance sheet relative to its equity. New rules on derivatives have been introduced. And there has been an introduction of \u201cliving wills,\u201d in which banks must tell regulators how they would be unwound in the event of a failure.But these regulatory fixes, while necessary, are not a complete solution.The unintended consequences of some of these regulations is that risk has shifted away from banks to less transparent, unregulated entities. For example, the increase in capital requirements have helped feed the so-called shadow banking system. Because new rules limit banks from making leveraged loans, hedge funds and private equity firms have taken up this slack and provide direct financing. This is hardly the outcome intended by the regulators. This peer-to-peer lending is not regulated in the same way as banks are, and moving this lending to shadow banks reduces transparency to regulators.Also, the 2008 crisis was the consequence not of too little regulation, but of inconsistent and inconsistently enforced regulation. Entities doing similar trades were applying different rules and were supervised by different regulators depending on their location, and how they were incorporated or chartered. Without functional regulation, this problem persists.Third, no living will can solve the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem for a highly complex global financial institution. We still do not know how to address the failure of a large international financial firm with hundreds of legal entities across the globe. To do so would require harmonizing the bankruptcy legislation of all the world\u2019s major financial centers, something the European Union has not been able to achieve in 50 years. This is probably the most important lesson from the crisis and the most difficult to address.To me, the biggest risk of all has not been adequately addressed. What I learned from the Lehman experience is the importance of governance. Leadership is about doing the right thing, and no one should go unchallenged when they are about to make a questionable decision. This culture of checks and balances is still lacking in many organizations.While I do not think we will have a large credit-induced financial crisis in the near term, there is always the possibility that, in the next big financial crisis, taxpayers again will be forced to pay the bill \u2014 if not directly, through a bailout, then most certainly indirectly, through lost jobs and an economic downturn.The best one can hope for is to minimize the severity of the shock through better corporate governance and more consistent regulation.Madelyn Antoncic, an economist, is on the board of overseers of Weill Cornell Medicine.

{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk Had a Deal From the S.E.C. It Fell Apart in a Morning.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Thursday began, Elon Musk had a deal on the table.After days of tense negotiations, the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawyers for Mr. Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, had agreed on a settlement that would bring to a close a drama that has riveted Wall Street and Silicon Valley for the past two months.Under the terms of the agreement, what started on Aug. 7 \u2014 when Mr. Musk posted on Twitter that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private for $420 a share \u2014 would end with some modest penalties and Mr. Musk staying on as chief executive, according to two people briefed on the talks.The plan, as it was negotiated by lawyers, was for Mr. Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla within 45 days and not resume that post for two years. The company, also a party to the proposed agreement, would add two new directors to its board. Mr. Musk and the company would pay tens of millions of dollars in fines, according to the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The negotiators planned to announce the agreement on Thursday after the markets closed.The settlement with the S.E.C. was a \u201cneither admit nor deny\u201d deal, meaning that Mr. Musk would not have acknowledged knowingly committing a violation. Mr. Musk, however, would not have been allowed to publicly state that he had done nothing wrong \u2014 and that was something he couldn\u2019t accept, according to three people familiar with the talks.So on Thursday morning, as settlement papers were being drawn up and news releases were being drafted, Mr. Musk walked away. Lawyers, Tesla executives and advisers to the company were stunned that he would turn away from such a favorable settlement.\u201cThe company\u2019s brand and stock will suffer if he leaves,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, an auto analyst at Gartner. \u201cBut I hate to say it, they might be better off.\u201dOn Friday, the S.E.C. set a date of Feb. 1 for a preliminary hearing on the case, leaving plenty of time for Mr. Musk to change his mind and agree to a settlement, albeit a potentially less favorable one. But the lawsuit, which could take years to come to trial, will cast a cloud over the company as long as the matter remains unresolved.In recent weeks, the S.E.C. was preparing to send Tesla a Wells Notice, signaling that it intended to bring civil charges against the company and Mr. Musk. But by Thursday, after the settlement talks fell apart, the S.E.C. narrowed its focus. Instead of looking to settle with the company and Mr. Musk, it sued Mr. Musk alone, according to a person close the company.After the commission began to investigate Mr. Musk\u2019s assertion on Twitter, his lawyers sent two lengthy letters to regulators making their case that he had done nothing wrong, according to that person.The letters outlined meetings that Mr. Musk had had with officials from a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, which had led him to believe he had financial support to take Tesla private, the person said.On an evening in March 2017, for example, Mr. Musk and Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer dined at the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., with Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, and Yasir Al Rumayyan, the managing director of the Saudi Public Investment Fund. During the meal, the letters said, Mr. Rumayyan raised the idea of taking Tesla private and increasing the Saudi fund\u2019s stake in it.More than a year later, the lawyers said, Mr. Musk and Mr. Rumayyan met at the Tesla factory on July 31. When Mr. Rumayyan spoke again of taking the company private, Mr. Musk asked him whether anyone else at the fund needed to approve of such a significant deal. Mr. Rumayyan said no, according to the person familiar with the letters.Representatives for Mr. Ellison and the Saudi investment fund did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday evening. People familiar with the workings of the Saudi fund previously said it had taken none of the steps that such an ambitious transaction would entail, like preparing a term sheet or hiring a financial adviser to work on the deal.Mr. Musk and other Tesla executives told Tesla\u2019s board about the talks with the Saudis, the lawyers wrote, according to the person familiar with the letters. On Aug. 3, Mr. Musk shared his idea for the $420 share price with the board.It was an Aug. 7 Financial Times story that spurred Mr. Musk to action, the lawyers said in the letters to the commission. An alarm bell went off when he saw the newspaper\u2019s report that the Saudis had built up a significant stake in Tesla. He feared that word would get out that a deal to take Tesla private was possible. So he began to tweet, the lawyers said.His tweets, the lawyers wrote, were sent in good faith. He believed that the Saudis were capable of doing a deal and interested in doing one, and that what remained was a matter of details, according to the person familiar with the letters.One sticking point for Mr. Musk in the tentative S.E.C. settlement was the particular statute which he was said to have violated.That statute contains language about misleading investors. Mr. Musk\u2019s lawyers wanted the commission to change its claim to say he was merely negligent in his statement, according to a person familiar with the details of the negotiations.Mr. Musk was concerned about what those terms might mean for his other businesses, SpaceX and the Boring Company. He was worried the agreement could jeopardize those companies\u2019 ability to continue working for the government, the person said.In a statement after the commission filed its suit on Thursday, Mr. Musk called the agency\u2019s enforcement effort \u201cunjustified.\u201d\u201cI have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors,\u201d he said. \u201cIntegrity is the most important value in my life, and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s decision to back away from the settlement could complicate Tesla\u2019s future. He has said the company will be consistently profitable by the end of this year, propelled by sales of its newest car, the midsize Model 3 sedan. But Tesla has struggled to meet its production targets for the Model 3, and has continued to burn through cash while two bond payments totaling more than a billion dollars will come due in the next six months.Tesla had $2.2 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, but has been using up nearly a $1 billion every three months. It also has about $11 billion in debt, and owed its suppliers $3 billion as of June 30.Mr. Musk has said Tesla won\u2019t seek additional capital. But Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, said he believed Tesla will have do so in the first half of 2019.Mr. Musk\u2019s legal troubles will only make it more difficult for the company to issue bonds or secure other financing.\u201cThe best case is they can get access to capital but it\u2019s more expensive than they would like,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cThe worst case is they won\u2019t be able to raise capital.\u201dAnother uncertainty for investors is who will ultimately be at the helm of Tesla. Mr. Musk is Tesla\u2019s visionary, much like Steve Jobs was at Apple, Mr. Nelson said, and belief in him is one of the reasons investors have bet on Tesla shares.\u201cHe\u2019s critical, in our opinion,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.Neal E. Boudette contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Read Barack Obama\u2019s Eulogy for John McCain", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFormer President Barack Obama on Saturday delivered a eulogy on behalf of Senator John McCain at a ceremony at the National Cathedral attended by many of Washington\u2019s top current and former lawmakers.The following is a transcript of those remarks, as prepared by The New York Times. ___________We come to celebrate an extraordinary man \u2013 a warrior, a statesman, a patriot who embodied so much that is best in America.President Bush and I are among the fortunate few who competed against John at the highest levels of politics. He made us better presidents. Just as he made the Senate better. Just as he made this country better. So for someone like John to ask you, while he\u2019s still alive, to stand and speak of him when he\u2019s gone, is a precious and singular honor.Now, when John called me with that request earlier this year, I\u2019ll admit sadness and also a certain surprise. But after our conversation ended, I realized how well it captured some of John\u2019s essential qualities.To start with, John liked being unpredictable, even a little contrarian. He had no interest in conforming to some prepackaged version of what a senator should be, and he didn\u2019t want a memorial that was going to be prepackaged either.It also showed John\u2019s disdain for self-pity. He had been to hell and back, and he had somehow never lost his energy, or his optimism, or his zest for life. So cancer did not scare him, and he would maintain that buoyant spirit to very end, too stubborn to sit still, opinionated as ever, fiercely devoted to his friends and most of all, to his family.It showed his irreverence \u2013 his sense of humor, little bit of a mischievous streak. After all, what better way to get a last laugh than to make George and I say nice things about him to a national audience?And most of all, it showed a largeness of spirit, an ability to see past differences in search of common ground. And in fact, on the surface, John and I could not have been more different. We\u2019re of different generations. I came from a broken home and never knew my father; John was the scion of one of America\u2019s most distinguished military families. I have a reputation for keeping cool; John \u2014 not so much. We were standard bearers of different American political traditions, and throughout my presidency, John never hesitated to tell me when he thought I was screwing up \u2013 which, by his calculation, was about once a day.But for all our differences, for all the times we sparred, I never tried to hide, and I think John came to understand, the longstanding admiration that I had for him.By his own account, John was a rebellious young man. In his case, that\u2019s understandable \u2013 what faster way to distinguish yourself when you\u2019re the son and grandson of admirals than to mutiny?Eventually, though, he concluded that the only way to really make his mark on the world is to commit to something bigger than yourself. And for John, that meant answering the highest of callings \u2013 serving his country in a time of war.Others this week and this morning have spoken to the depths of his torment, and the depths of his courage, there in the cells of Hanoi, when day after day, year after year, that youthful iron was tempered into steel. It brings to mind something that Hemingway wrote in the book that Meghan referred to, his favorite book:\u201cToday is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that ever come can depend on what you do today.\u201dIn captivity, John learned, in ways that few of us ever will, the meaning of those words \u2013 how each moment, each day, each choice is a test. And John McCain passed that test \u2013 again and again and again. And that\u2019s why, when John spoke of virtues like service, and duty, it didn\u2019t ring hollow. They weren\u2019t just words to him. It was a truth that he had lived, and for which he was prepared to die. It forced even the most cynical to consider what were we doing for our country, what might we risk everything for.Much has been said this week about what a maverick John was. Now, in fact, John was a pretty conservative guy. Trust me, I was on the receiving end of some of those votes. But he did understand that some principles transcend politics. That some values transcend party. He considered it part of his duty to uphold those principles and uphold those values.John cared about the institutions of self-government \u2013 our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, rule of law and separation of powers, even the arcane rules and procedures of the Senate. He knew that, in a nation as big and boisterous and diverse as ours, those institutions, those rules, those norms are what bind us together and give shape and order to our common life, even when we disagree, especially when we disagree.John believed in honest argument and hearing other views. He understood that if we get in the habit of bending the truth to suit political expediency or party orthodoxy, our democracy will not work. That\u2019s why he was willing to buck his own party at times, occasionally work across the aisle on campaign finance reform and immigration reform. That\u2019s why he championed a free and independent press as vital to our democratic debate. And the fact that it earned him some good coverage didn\u2019t hurt, either.John understood, as JFK understood, as Ronald Reagan understood, that part of what makes our country great is that our membership is based not on our bloodline; not on what we look like, what our last names are. It\u2019s not based on where our parents or grandparents came from, or how recently they arrived, but on adherence to a common creed: That all of us are created equal. Endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights.It\u2019s been mentioned today, and we\u2019ve seen footage this week of John pushing back against supporters who challenged my patriotism during the 2008 campaign. I was grateful, but I wasn\u2019t surprised. As Joe Lieberman said, it was John\u2019s instinct. I never saw John treat anyone differently because of their race, or religion, or gender. And I\u2019m certain that in those moments that have been referred to during the campaign, he saw himself as defending America\u2019s character, not just mine, for he considered it the imperative of every citizen who loves this country to treat all people fairly.And finally, while John and I disagreed on all kinds of foreign policy issues, we stood together on America\u2019s role as the one indispensable nation, believing that with great power and great blessings comes great responsibility. That burden is borne most heavily by our men and women in uniform \u2013 service members like Doug, Jimmy, and Jack, who followed in their father\u2019s footsteps \u2013 as well as the families who serve alongside our troops. But John understood that our security and our influence was won not just by our military might, not just by our wealth, not just by our ability to bend others to our will, but from our capacity to inspire others, with our adherence to a set of universal values \u2013 like rule of law and human rights, and an insistence on the God-given dignity of every human being.Of course, John was the first to tell us that he was not perfect. Like all of us who go into public service, he did have an ego. Like all of us, there were no doubt some votes he cast, some compromises he struck, some decisions he made that he wished he could have back. It\u2019s no secret, it\u2019s been mentioned that he had a temper, and when it flared up, it was a force of nature, a wonder to behold \u2013 his jaw grinding, his face reddening, his eyes boring a hole right through you. Not that I ever experienced it firsthand, mind you.But to know John was to know that as quick as his passions might flare, he was just as quick to forgive and ask for forgiveness. He knew more than most his own flaws and his blind spots, and he knew how to laugh at himself. And that self-awareness made him all the more compelling.We didn\u2019t advertise it, but every so often over the course of my presidency, John would come over to the White House, and we\u2019d just sit and talk in the Oval Office, just the two of us \u2013 we\u2019d talk about policy and we\u2019d talk about family and we\u2019d talk about the state of our politics. And our disagreements didn\u2019t go away during these private conversations. Those were real, and they were often deep. But we enjoyed the time we shared away from the bright lights. And we laughed with each other, and we learned from each other. We never doubted the other man\u2019s sincerity or the other man\u2019s patriotism, or that when all was said and done, we were on the same team. We never doubted we were on the same team.For all of our differences, we shared a fidelity to the ideals for which generations of Americans have marched, and fought, and sacrificed, and given their lives. We considered our political battles a privilege, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those ideals here at home, and to do our best to advance them around the world. We saw this country as a place where anything is possible \u2013 and citizenship as an obligation to ensure it forever remains that way.More than once during his career, John drew comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been noted that Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cMan in the Arena\u201d oration seems tailored to John. Most of you know it: Roosevelt speaks of those who strive, who dare to do great things, who sometimes win and sometimes come up short, but always relish a good fight \u2013 a contrast to those cold, timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.Isn\u2019t that the spirit we celebrate this week?That striving to be better, to do better, to be worthy of the great inheritance that our founders bestowed.So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse, can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult, in phony controversies and manufactured outrage. It\u2019s a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, but in fact is born of fear.John called on us to be bigger than that. He called on us to be better than that.\u201cToday is only one day in all the days that will ever be. But what will happen in all the other days that will ever come can depend on what you do today.\u201dWhat better way to honor John McCain\u2019s life of service than, as best we can, follow his example?To prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved for the few, it is open to all of us, that in fact it\u2019s demanded of all of us, as citizens of this great republic?That\u2019s perhaps how we honor him best \u2013 by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party, or ambition, or money, or fame or power. That there are some things that are worth risking everything for. Principles that are eternal. Truths that are abiding.At his best, John showed us what that means. For that, we are all deeply in his debt.May God bless John McCain, and may God bless this country he served so well.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Judge Dismisses Federal Suit Accusing Firm of Defrauding 9/11 Responders", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA day after the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit, brought by the New York State attorney general\u2019s office, that accused a financial firm of defrauding firefighters and others involved in the response out of funds meant to compensate them for resulting injuries and illnesses.The attorney general must instead use state courts to pursue any claims it has against the financial firm, RD Legal Funding, Judge Loretta A. Preska of Federal District Court in Manhattan said Wednesday.For the moment, the ruling handed a surprising victory to RD Legal, which the attorney general\u2019s office said had used deceptive tactics to ensnare emergency responders and former professional football players in high-interest loans while they awaited settlements.Judge Preska said there was no basis for state authorities to continue their enforcement action in federal court after she dismissed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency, from the lawsuit in June. The judge tossed out the bureau\u2019s claims that RD Legal had violated federal law after she determined that the structure of the agency was unconstitutional because of the way its director is appointed.RD Legal, a New Jersey firm, sparked controversy by entering into financial deals with emergency workers who responded to the attack that destroyed the World Trade Center towers in 2001.The lawsuit, filed jointly last year by the consumer bureau and state authorities, claimed RD Legal persuaded firefighters, police officers and medical workers to enter into high-interest cash advances. The litigation claimed RD Legal also entered into similar agreements with former football players who were awaiting money from the National Football League concussion litigation.The high-interest financial deals are an offshoot of the fast-growing consumer litigation market, in which firms compete to provide cash advances to people with pending lawsuits.Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for Barbara Underwood, the New York State attorney general, said the office was considering its options. But, she added, the decision \u201chinged on the judge\u2019s interpretation of the constitutionality of specific provisions\u201d of the federal law that established the consumer bureau.Michael Roth, a lawyer with Boies Schiller Flexner, which represents RD Legal, said in a statement that the case never should have been brought. \u201cToday\u2019s order provides for the full relief we originally requested in our motion to dismiss,\u201d he said.The consumer bureau has not yet said if it will appeal Judge Preska\u2019s decision dismissing its case, but it has taken steps in that direction. In an order last month, Judge Preska said she \u201canticipated\u201d that the bureau would file an appeal, based on its actions in the case.Her finding on the bureau\u2019s constitutionality was notable because it relied heavily on a dissenting opinion written by Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the United States Supreme Court.In her 108-page ruling in June, Judge Preska quoted Judge Kavanaugh when he said it was unconstitutional for \u201can independent agency that exercises substantial executive power\u201d to be run by a single director. But she said she disagreed with Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s solution, which would be to give the president more power to supervise and fire the director.Instead, Judge Preska went further, saying the unconstitutionality of the bureau\u2019s structure effectively rendered it powerless to bring action against RD Legal.It\u2019s a severe remedy, and one reason that many expect the bureau to appeal the ruling even though it has taken a softer approach to enforcement actions during the Trump administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Constitutional Standoff Pushes Guatemala Toward Authoritarianism", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUATEMALA CITY \u2014 Three years ago, Guatemala became a startling example to Latin America.It was a feat for a fragile democracy and an inspiration in a region where elites were virtually untouchable and prosecutors were just beginning to tackle graft.But now the nation risks becoming another kind of example \u2014 of the danger to institutions when the entrenched interests of the powerful are challenged.The commission has already targeted his brother and son; both are awaiting trial. Now an investigation into illicit campaign financing points to Mr. Morales and his wealthy backers.The president has gone on the offensive, even defying the country\u2019s highest constitutional court in his attempt to throw out the international prosecutors leading the investigation.First, Mr. Morales first announced he would not renew the mandate of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, the special United Nations-backed body that has been helping the attorney general\u2019s office build cases since 2007. Then, last week, he barred the Colombian head of commission, Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez G\u00f3mez, from returning to the country.Mr. Morales wants to draw a line and make clear \u201cthat the fight against corruption is over,\u201d said Fernando Carrera, a former foreign minister of Guatemala under Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina.The president\u2019s actions have left Guatemala at the brink of a constitutional crisis and threaten a backward slide into authoritarianism.The political maneuvers pale in the context of the battles and bombs that defined this Central American nation\u2019s brutal civil war, which ended with United Nations-backed peace accords in 1996. But the crisis threatens to extinguish the hope for an end to the endemic impunity that has long defined Guatemala \u2014 and which enthusiastic protesters believed they had finally buried three years ago.For years now, the United States has supported the prosecutions unequivocally, seeing in the effort a potential salve for the corruption that crippled the region\u2019s political and economic development \u2014 and fueled, at least in part, emigration by those looking for a better life.But under President Trump, the United States has taken a back seat during the current crisis, saying little about Mr. Morales\u2019s campaign against the investigators.A schism has emerged in the United States government, with career diplomats staunchly supporting the commission, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered what many found to be a weak statement of support for a reformed commission.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, like many supporters of the commission, expressed concern about the lukewarm American response.\u201cWe should not lose sight of the importance of what we have invested in all these years,\u201d said Mr. Leahy. \u201cIf the commission goes, it is hard to see how things don\u2019t get demonstrably worse.\u201dSome former diplomats and experts have suggested the Trump administration is managing the impending crisis in Guatemala with caution, fearful of what might come after Mr. Morales if he is forced from office. But those same individuals warn that a Guatemala in chaos \u2014 one where there is practically no check on corruption \u2014 could hit Washington where it hurts the most: the flow of migrants leaving Guatemala for the United States.For now, the tepid response has empowered Mr. Morales to continue his broadsides, experts said.Mr. Morales\u2019s administration has also worked to ensure support for his presidency, and criticism of the commission, in Washington, signing lobbying contracts worth millions of dollars to influence Congress and the White House.Guatemala supported the Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 and even followed suit, moving their own embassy there.Without the stalwart support of the United States, many have wondered if the protesters can muster the force they showed in 2015, when hundreds of thousands filled the capital for months.There is little evidence, for the moment, of collective action. But leaders of the movement also said they are being more strategic and targeted.The first protest took place Monday as indigenous groups filled the center of the city of Solol\u00e1 and blocked sections of the Pan-American Highway. More demonstrations are planned for the rest of the week.\u201cWe have to support the work of the commission,\u201d said Javier Gramajo L\u00f3pez, a founder of Construir Pa\u00eds, one of the activist groups involved in the 2015 protests. \u201cBut instead of inciting people, we are calling for calm, waiting for the opportune moment, when we are organized.\u201dThe Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, known as Cicig, first arrived in the country back in 2007 to assist the attorney general in rooting out government corruption networks, many of then linked to former military officers.The effort was backed by the United Nations, and donor governments funded much of its work. This included the United States, which has paid roughly half of its budget in recent years.Under the leadership of Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, who arrived in 2013, the commission hit its stride, revealing corruption schemes that ranged from the customs racket that brought down Mr. P\u00e9rez Molina to the manufacturing of fake passports, the creation of phantom congressional jobs, and the siphoning of funds from the capital\u2019s new bus system.Although investigations spanned various aspects of government, the fight has become a personal battle between two individuals: the circumspect Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, and Mr. Morales, a former comedian known for crude caricatures that include blackface.Mr. Vel\u00e1squez has shown a fierce determination to fulfill his mandate, going after the powerful to the point of confronting those responsible for authorizing his presence in the country. His approach has not always been popular; even those who applaud his work worry that an outsider bringing down corrupt officials in Guatemala is still a long way from enduring justice.Showing a healthy dose of self-awareness, he has told colleagues that despite the commission\u2019s broad popular support, they were likely headed toward an inexorable clash with the establishment.\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a point where we touch the nerve center of this,\u201d he has told several people who work for him. \u201cAnd that will be the point of no return.\u201dThree years into his presidency, Mr. Morales is in a fight for survival, one he knew was coming.A year ago, he tried to order Mr. Vel\u00e1squez out of the country. He was blocked by the constitutional court, which ruled that the prosecutor should remain in Guatemala.Since then, Mr. Morales and his allies in congress \u2014 many of them facing corruption accusations of their own \u2014 have tried to undermine the commission and protect the president.Congress voted against stripping Mr. Morales\u2019s immunity from prosecution. It attempted to gut campaign finance rules and slash prison terms for several crimes, but was stopped by the constitutional court and a wave of protest from students to business groups.In January, Mr. Morales fired his reformist interior minister and appointed Enrique Degenhart, who worked to block the government\u2019s cooperation with the commission, reassigning police officers that worked alongside the prosecutors.\u201cIt has been a government in survival mode and not in governance mode,\u201d said Lucrecia Hern\u00e1ndez Mack, who joined the Morales government as health minister and resigned a year ago. \u201cThere are no public or social policies. It has been a boat adrift and the only policy is to get the Cicig and the attorney general off its back.\u201dThat pushed Guatemala to the brink, said Alexander Aizenstatd, a constitutional lawyer in Guatemala, who has been critical of the U.N.-backed commission in the past.\u201cWhen you sign an oath to uphold the law, you do it, especially when you are the president of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t decide which court rulings you follow and which ones you do not.\u201dAzam Ahmed reported from Guatemala City, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pakistan\u2019s Military Has Quietly Reached Out to India for Talks", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Concerned about Pakistan\u2019s international isolation and faltering economy, the country\u2019s powerful military has quietly reached out to its archrival India about resuming peace talks, but the response was tepid, according to Western diplomats and a senior Pakistani official.The outreach, initiated by the army\u2019s top commander, Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, began months before Pakistan\u2019s national elections. Pakistan offered to resume on-and-off talks with India over their border dispute in the Kashmir region, which stalled in 2015 as violence flared up there.A key objective for Pakistan in reaching out to India is to open barriers to trade between the countries, which would give Pakistan more access to regional markets. Any eventual peace talks over Kashmir are likely to involve an increase in bilateral trade as a confidence-building measure.\u201cWe want to move forward and we are trying our best to have good ties with all our neighbors, including India,\u201d Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said. \u201cAs General Bajwa says, regions prosper, countries don\u2019t. India cannot prosper by weakening Pakistan.\u201dDiplomats say General Bajwa has tried to reach out to General Rawat to initiate talks. But the effort has been stymied by what one diplomat called a \u201csystem mismatch.\u201dThe army is Pakistan\u2019s most powerful institution, but India\u2019s military is much weaker and could not agree to a peace deal without the civilian government\u2019s approval. Diplomats in New Delhi say Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is preoccupied with elections expected early next year and does not want talks before then, fearing that if talks collapse \u2014 as they have many times before \u2014 it could cost them at the polls.\u201cTill the Indian elections, there cannot be an immediate betterment in bilateral relations,\u201d Mr. Chaudhry said. India\u2019s military and its foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.With Mr. Khan in office, talks may have a better chance because he is seen as the army\u2019s man, diplomats in both Islamabad and New Delhi say. India sees Mr. Khan\u2019s outreach as sanctioned by the military and believes he will clearly present General Bajwa\u2019s demands and red lines.The plan would give Beijing more direct access to important Western markets by building a series of highways through Pakistan, connecting China\u2019s western border to Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea. If Pakistani troops are freed up along the border with India, the thinking goes, they could be diverted to secure the country\u2019s western flank, where China\u2019s trade routes would be.Pakistan may also be realizing that it can no longer withstand its growing international isolation and its worsening ties with the United States, which was once its closest Western ally. The United States cut more than $1 billion of aid to Pakistan in January for not doing enough to curb terror groups, which it accuses the army of supporting.Salman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Nafta Talks Resume, U.S. and Canada Aren\u2019t Budging on Key Priorities", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Talks between the United States and Canada to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement resumed on Wednesday, but a quick resolution seemed unlikely amid tension between President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada.Describing the Nafta talks as \u201cintense,\u201d Mr. Trump accused Canada on Wednesday of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the United States and said that it did not need Canada to remain in the agreement.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, it that\u2019s going to be fine for the country, for our country,\u201d Mr. Trump said during remarks at the White House. \u201cIt won\u2019t be fine for Canada.\u201dMr. Trudeau, for his part, said in a radio interview that Canada would insist on certain safeguards because Mr. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t always follow the rules.\u201dMr. Trump has continued to insist on a deal that benefits American farmers and businesses and has repeatedly pointed to the trade imbalance between the two countries as evidence that Canada is \u201cunfair\u201d to the United States.Data released on Wednesday showed that gap widening: Canada\u2019s trade surplus in goods with the United States reached $4.1 billion in July, the biggest gap since 2008. The imbalance is likely to further fuel Mr. Trump\u2019s ire toward Canada and his insistence on getting a \u201cfair\u201d pact.But several big obstacles remain, including an independent dispute resolution system that Canada wants to retain and that the United States wants to eliminate. The system allows Canada to appeal punitive duties that the United States imposes on Canadian products, like lumber, as a penalty for subsidizing and dumping products into the American market.The provision was eliminated in the agreement the United States reached with Mexico, but the Canadians have insisted that it is necessary to protect industries from biased rulings in the United States.In a radio interview on Wednesday, Mr. Trudeau described such a mechanism as a \u201cred line\u201d for his country.Last week, the United States International Trade Commission overturned the Trump administration\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on Canadian newsprint. The commission rejected the Commerce Department\u2019s argument that imports of Canadian newsprint were harming American manufacturers and ordered that the tariffs be lifted.Mr. Trudeau\u2019s barb followed a barrage of criticism in the last week from Mr. Trump, who has accused Canada of unfair trade practices and threatened to cripple its automobile industry with tariffs. The president also repeated his threat to leave Canada from a revised Nafta and move ahead with just Mexico.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Trudeau also made clear on Wednesday that Canada was willing to walk.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to accept that we have to sign a bad deal just because that\u2019s what the president wants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk away and not sign a deal rather than sign a bad deal for Canadians.\u201dWhile deep divisions remain, Mr. Trudeau did suggest some flexibility on a crucial issue for Mr. Trump: access to Canada\u2019s dairy market. That industry is heavily protected and Mr. Trump has made opening it to American exports a top priority. Mr. Trudeau signaled on Wednesday that there could be room for compromise.But Canada also has its own demands, including keeping intact exceptions that would limit foreign ownership of cultural industries, like movies and TV networks. Mr. Trudeau said on Wednesday that the cultural exemption, which, among other things, prevents American media companies from acquiring Canadian television networks, is critical to protect his country\u2019s sovereignty.Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, said on Wednesday that her team of trade negotiators worked throughout the weekend in the hope of finding common ground on the remaining issues. After a morning meeting with Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, she said that she was encouraged by the tone of the talks.\u201cThe atmosphere continues to be constructive and positive,\u201d Ms. Freeland said. \u201cThere is good faith and good will on both sides and we\u2019re continuing to work on this.\u201dWhile Ms. Freeland declined to get into the details of the negotiations, she said that Mr. Trudeau\u2019s comments on a dispute settlement system were important.The Trump administration has opposed the investor-state dispute settlement provision over concerns that it takes power out of the hands of elected governments and puts it in the hands of private sector lawyers who sit on a tribunal and determine whether countries are treating foreign investors fairly.The United States has never lost a case filed by investors, but Canada and Mexico have lost cases filed by American corporations like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland.While Canadian leaders have cast nullifying the dispute settlement provision as a dealbreaker, some trade experts believe that Canada would be willing to let go of it in exchange for other concessions from the United States.\u201cI think it\u2019s how they\u2019re going to be able to position it so that governments can declare victory and I think the political pressures in Canada are strong and they\u2019ve got to find a way to make everybody believe that it\u2019s acceptable,\u201d said Bradford L. Ward, former deputy general counsel in the office of the United States Trade Representative who left in May for the law firm King & Spalding.Despite the sticking points, it is unclear whether the United States could actually move ahead without Canada or withdraw from Nafta entirely.Republicans and Democrats in Congress have insisted that Canada must be included in a final deal. Since Congress is unlikely to vote on such an agreement until next year, and Democrats could win control of the House or, less likely, the Senate, Mr. Trump may need to heed to the concerns of lawmakers.\u201cTrump is relying on bluster and bullying in a desperate attempt to get Congress to swallow his half-baked deal,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cYou can\u2019t fix Nafta without fixing issues with Canada.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Are Schools Doing to Go Green?", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:This week, it\u2019s a back-to-school edition: We start off with news about schools using clean energy. Then, if you\u2019re a student, you might be interested in how young plaintiffs are suing the government for climate action. And, if you\u2019re a parent or teacher, see below for book recommendations for kids.Schools around the country are taking an interest in clean energy, putting solar panels on roofs and swapping diesel school buses for electric versions.But it\u2019s not always easy for a school to go green. Here\u2019s a look at some recent developments.Solar power In many ways, schools are a natural fit for solar power: They tend to require electricity only during the day, when the sun is shining, and they often have ample space on their roofs and grounds for solar panels.\u201cThe cost of solar power has come way down, and that\u2019s been the No. 1 driver\u201d of solar in schools, said Ed Gilliland of The Solar Foundation, a Washington-based nonprofit that helped produce the report. \u201cWhereas before, there tended to be a lot of small solar power arrays put up for educational purposes, schools are now embracing them as money-saving investments.\u201dCalifornia has led the way, with almost 2,000 schools installing solar panels. But solar power is reaching schools across the country.The tiny Tri-Creek school district in Lowell, Ind., started a solar program in 2013 after a group of eighth graders asked the board to explore alternative energy options. The district has installed 120 solar panels that together shaved $140,000 off energy bills in the 12 months through July, said Dana Bogathy, the district\u2019s business manager.The district\u2019s 3,300 students learn to monitor the panels\u2019 performance and have even carried out experiments \u2014 for example, what happens when you throw mud on a solar panel? (Answer: Performance goes down.)Financing is an obstacle. The Tri-Creek district issued bonds to cover installation costs and has also used a system that allows users of solar energy to sell the excess electricity back to the local utility. But Indiana, along with several other states, is phasing out that program.Tri-Creek isn\u2019t deterred. \u201cWe\u2019re looking into getting a wind turbine,\u201d Ms. Bogathy said. Electric buses But electric buses are still twice or three times as expensive as conventional buses. In theory, schools could recoup some of that money over time through lower fuel and maintenance costs, but the upfront price tag remains a deterrent.So, the school bus of the future may arrive sooner than you think.There are many other ways to help the environment besides getting involved in lawsuits; see, for example, the story in this newsletter about the eighth graders who convinced their school board to use alternative energy sources. Good luck finding your own way to save the planet this school year!These days there are lots of resources for parents and teachers who want to teach kids about climate change. We asked a group of people immersed in the issue \u2014 including journalists, scientists and activists \u2014 about their favorites.

Relax, it involves no squirmy physical contact.I mean the sort of tickling administered by a team of master farceurs who frisk you into a state of sustained laughter, as involuntary and contented as the purr of a kitten at play. It\u2019s the noise being artfully coaxed from audiences by the British dramatist Richard Bean and a precision-tooled ensemble of great pretenders at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater.Does that sound too esoteric? Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re unacquainted with the arcana of this British cousin of billiards and pool. Not speaking snookerese is no disadvantage in experiencing Mr. Bean\u2019s story of a young working-class phenom from Sheffield and the criminal friends and relations who love (and nearly destroy) him.Besides, the dominant game of \u201cThe Nap\u201d isn\u2019t snooker. It\u2019s farce. And like most sports, farce requires from its players hair-trigger timing and an intuitive grasp of the physics of bodies in motion. Its success is achieved not by sustained assault but by dexterity, and by always keeping the other guy (in this case, the audience) off guard.\u201cThe Nap\u201d is less frenetically funny than \u201cOne Man,\u201d and more modest in scale. But it shares with its predecessor a fondness for the subterfuges and archetypes of classic farce, which Mr. Bean translates fluently into modern-day terms.Our idealistic hero, Dylan Spokes (Ben Schnetzer), is a blue-collar lad with the kind of back story that makes television producers drool. Dylan was brought up by his dad, Bobby (John Ellison Conlee), who selflessly sold recreational drugs to finance a snooker shed in the backyard, where the boy could hone his craft.Dylan knows that without snooker, he\u2019d probably be on the dole and grifting, like his dear old mom, Stella (Johanna Day as squalor incarnate). \u201cWithout snooker, what am I?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m cooking meth, I\u2019m on welfare, I\u2019m getting me legs blown off in Afghan.\u201dBut enough of the anthropology, except to say that it informs Dylan\u2019s commitment to his sport. But as his star ascends \u2014 with the possibility of his reaching the world championship finals \u2014 temptations block his path.First of all, there\u2019s his sponsor, the expensively dressed, one-armed, transgender Waxy Bush (Alexandra Billings in a sensational Broadway debut), who, before her transition, dated Dylan\u2019s mum. Waxy now wants her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to throw a frame (or round) in his next big match to appease some mysterious Philippine gamblers.Word of possible foul play has already reached the ears of Mohammad Butt (a sublimely fatuous Bhavesh Patel), the Integrity Officer for International Sports Security, who shows up in the Sheffield legion hall where Dylan is practicing. (David Rockwell did the sociologically specific sets and Kaye Voyce the spot on, tacky costumes.)

Dismissals of this sort often come with agreements not to prosecute in return for testimony.The authorities have said Mr. Ho met Mr. Gadio at the United Nations in 2014 and later paid him $400,000 for helping to use his influence with the president of Chad to secure oil rights for the Chinese energy company in the African country. Mr. Ho, who worked for a Hong Kong research organization that got financing from CEFC, is separately charged with paying bribes to officials in Uganda to secure similar oil deals for the energy company.The dismissal of the bribery charges against Mr. Gadio presents an interesting wrinkle in the case against Mr. Ho, who now stands to go to trial alone in a federal courtroom in Manhattan in November.Mr. Gadio is expected to testify at the trial, but there is no indication of any broader agreement with federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York.The dismissal came after months of negotiations between Mr. Gadio\u2019s lawyer and prosecutors, according to prior court filings in the case.\u201cWe are extremely grateful that the case against Dr. Gadio has been brought to a just resolution,\u201d said Sean Hecker, a lawyer for Mr. Gadio. \u201cDr. Gadio looks forward to continuing to cooperate with U.S. authorities before returning to Senegal to continue his service to the Senegalese people.\u201dThe charges against both men were brought under the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which is often used to police the actions of United States companies operating overseas. The charges against Mr. Ho are a bit unusual because they involve a Chinese company operating in Africa. The main connection to the United States is that Mr. Ho was a frequent visitor to New York and had meetings at the United Nations.Mr. Gadio is credited with helping to broker a peace agreement that ended a military conflict between Chad and Sudan. Prosecutors said they had evidence that Mr. Gadio had helped broker a CEFC pledge in early 2015 that it would make a $2 million \u201cdonation\u201d to Chad\u2019s president for charitable causes.Mr. Ho, an opthamologist by training, was a Hong Kong official and lives in Hong Kong. He is being held without bail at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan.No explanation has been given for Mr. Ye\u2019s disappearance.

{"Headline": "For Gavin Newsom, a Stealth Run for California Governor", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. \u2014 He may seem hesitant to say it, but Gavin Newsom wants your vote for governor of California. Really.Mr. Newsom took the stage to cheers in the hot afternoon sun in Orange County the other day. For 20 minutes, he talked about the Democratic candidates for Congress and the California Legislature. He talked about President Trump. He talked about poverty, homelessness, immigration and global warming.But there was one topic that Mr. Newsom, the lieutenant governor, barely mentioned: the fact that he is the Democratic candidate for governor of California.But with the threat of an economic downturn, escalating hostility with the Trump White House, and looming decisions about how to respond to entrenched poverty, climate change and a dysfunctional state tax system, California may be entering turbulent waters. And Mr. Newsom\u2019s low-risk campaign, along with a widespread sense that the outcome of the contest is almost a foregone conclusion, suggests voters may learn little between now and Election Day about Mr. Newsom\u2019s qualifications and what he intends to do should he take over as the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state.\u201cI don\u2019t think this campaign will test him,\u201d said Jim Newton, a lecturer on public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cAnd that\u2019s too bad. He\u2019s a quality candidate. It\u2019s too bad we are not given a chance to see more of him and learn what he would do. I think he plays defense through Election Day.\u201dMr. Newsom asserted that California voters had plenty of opportunities to learn about him during a career in public service that included a turn as mayor of San Francisco and as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\u201cI\u2019ve been on the trail for three years,\u201d he said, as his four young children scampered up and down his campaign bus.\u201cThe question of being challenged, of what kind of governor are you going to be: We\u2019ve had that vetting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been as scrutinized as much as any candidate for political office in some time, in terms of my tenure as mayor, my tenure as county supervisor.\u201dMr. Newsom said that voters were most interested in talking about the president. \u201cMy town halls, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHealth care, Trump. Environment, Trump. Jobs, economy, Trump. Anxiety, fear, Trump.\u201dThat said, Mr. Newsom has spent more than seven years as Mr. Brown\u2019s lieutenant governor, a low-profile position that has little authority or assigned duties. It has proved to be a particularly obscure role under the shadow of a governor like Mr. Brown.Mr. Newsom won widespread attention as mayor of San Francisco \u2014 where, among other things, he championed same-sex marriage at a time when it was a contentious issue even in his own party. Still, being mayor of a city of 871,000 people does not present the same challenges that come with being the leader of a state like California, with a population of 39.4 million people, an increasingly assertive State Legislature and an ever-expanding catalog of problems.And Mr. Newsom so far has offered often vague responses on some of the biggest issues he would face: global warming, the over-budget high-speed rail train between Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the state\u2019s volatile tax code, which Mr. Newsom has said needs an overhaul, while saying it was too early to say how.Mr. Newsom signaled during the primary that he would support a California-financed single-payer health care program, over the objections of opponents who said it was unaffordable. Since his primary victory, Mr. Newsom has said it was unlikely to be accomplished during his first term as governor.\u201cSomeone said, \u2018you are backtracking on single-payer,\u2019\u201d he said, when pressed on the question. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually expressing an outline. I\u2019m architecting the conversation over the next few years. It\u2019s not an act that is going to occur by a signature of a governor.\u201dAnd Mr. Newsom, an opponent of the death penalty, said he had not decided what to do if he is forced to preside over the first execution in more than a decade in a state that has more inmates on death row \u2014 over 700 \u2014 than any other. In 2016, California passed a proposition forcing the state to resume executions, although there are legal challenges outstanding.Would Mr. Newsom sign a death warrant? \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to answer the question,\u201d he said, clearly struggling with the issue. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not prepared to answer the question. But I am preparing myself to answer the question. And in that preparation comes a lot of soul searching.\u201dRaphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at California State University, said a central question is how Mr. Newsom might reconcile his liberal appeal from the primary with running a state. \u201cSince he positioned himself in the primary in the progressive wing of the party, what will he do when presented with legislation that, while popular in the party, will be difficult to implement in government?\u201d he said.Mr. Newsom has had an uneasy relationship with Mr. Brown from his first days as lieutenant governor. Mr. Newsom recounted how shortly after he took office, he put out his own economic plan for California \u2014 and was quickly reminded who was in charge by Mr. Brown\u2019s office.Now, he faces the challenge of trying to at once align himself with the popular Mr. Brown while acknowledging criticisms that Mr. Cox and others have offered on the governor and what has taken place under his watch in California, from housing costs to homelessness to growing poverty.\u201cWhat happened to our state?\u201d he said in Seal Beach. In Torrance, he called homelessness \u201cthe ultimate manifestation of our failure. It happened on our watch. We own that.\u201d\u201cUnless we deal with the affordability crisis, the California Dream will no longer exist,\u201d he said after he got back on his bus.Mr. Newsom said he would expect pressure from lawmakers to restore spending that Mr. Brown had cut. He said he would mostly continue Mr. Brown\u2019s frugal ways, but signaled he was ready to spend money in areas where Mr. Brown had not \u2014 in particular, early childhood education and higher education.\u201cI get why people worry about it, because if immediately you connote me with San Francisco, Nancy Pelosi, everything \u2014 I get where that anxiety comes from,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople will soon learn that I am going to be very stubborn as it relates to the budget and fiscal discipline. At the same time less stubborn on some investments that Jerry has understandably danced around.\u201dMr. Newsom said the outgoing governor had left the state \u201cin better shape than probably any governor in modern times.\u201d But he said that Mr. Brown had given him a somewhat mordant warning as they discussed what was around the corner.\u201c\u2018Good luck,\u2019\u201d he quoted Mr. Brown as saying. \u201c\u2019Cause he sees the headwinds, he sees the fixed costs, he sees the hockey stick of health care and pensions. He sees all this building pressure, he knows what the Legislature is revving up to do and all these interest groups that are a deeper part of that appetite than the Legislature. They are all expecting the next governor to solve their problems.\u201dAt 50, Mr. Newsom retains the aura of glamour from his days as a young mayor, with a full head of slicked-back hair. When he showed up to speak for an assembly candidate running in the South Bay of Los Angeles, Democrats clamored outside his bus, waiting to catch a view or a photograph. He emerged carrying boxes of pizza.\u201cHe\u2019s so photogenic,\u201d said Carol Pike-Bauer, 92, a retired chemical engineer. She said she had been following his career since he was San Francisco mayor and admired his willingness to go against the federal government on gay marriage. \u201cHe did what he thought was right and fair,\u201d she said.As mayor, Mr. Newsom\u2019s personal life was also terrain for the gossip columns. He was a fixture on the city\u2019s party circuit, and later admitted to an affair with the wife of his campaign manager. He got a divorce and underwent treatment for alcohol abuse.These days, Mr. Newsom travels the state with his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, a documentary filmmaker, and their children. His son Hunter, 7, kept tugging at the back of his pants, clamoring for attention as Mr. Newsom tried to speak at the rally here.Californians who turned up for his events said they were pleased to hear him talk about issues like global warming and immigration, even in Republican parts of the state.\u201cWe do have a strong Republican base here \u2014 some issues he\u2019s talking about people will disapprove of,\u201d said John Henry Lopez, 47, a plumber who came to hear him speak in Fresno. \u201cBut he will be helped by the cost of health care. That\u2019s a strong message that can get people to vote.\u201dBrock Neeley, 53, who drove from Tulare to see Mr. Newsom in Fresno, said the area is \u201cturning blue, believe it or not.\u201d\u201cPeople are finally getting fed up,\u201d he said. \u201cFarmers who voted for Trump are seeing their crops in the field. Global warming affects us big time.\u201dIn his speeches, delivered without notes and in shirt sleeves, Mr. Newsom plucked quotes from Aristotle, Plutarch, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Oliver Wendell Holmes as he presented himself as the next face of the Democratic opposition in California.\u201cMy opponent has doubled down on all things Trump,\u201d Mr. Newsom said, in one of the few times he mentioned his opponent by name. \u201cThat\u2019s a very challenging place for Cox to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Argentina Takes Emergency Steps to Shore Up Peso", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUENOS AIRES \u2014 Argentina\u2019s president announced emergency measures on Monday to stem concerns from investors about the country\u2019s solvency as it seeks to tap an international credit line.It was the latest move to ease a growing crisis over a plunging currency, just days after the central bank intervened with a drastic increase in interest rates.In a televised address Monday morning, President Mauricio Macri said he would seek to reduce the government\u2019s budget deficit by imposing a new tax on exports. He also said he would reorganize his cabinet, eliminating around half of the ministries.\u201cWhat we have to face is a basic problem, which is we cannot spend more than we have,\u201d Mr. Macri said. \u201cThis is not just another crisis. It has to be the last.\u201dDespite the announcement, the Argentine peso continued its fall, losing 3 percent against the dollar in thin trading that analysts attributed to the Labor Day holiday in the United States. Stocks in Buenos Aires also fell.\u201cApparently there are still some doubts,\u201d said Sabrina Corujo, head of Portfolio Personal, a local brokerage. \u201cBut it may be a bit early to say outright that the reaction was negative.\u201dMr. Macri acted as officials prepared to head to Washington for negotiations Tuesday with the International Monetary Fund. Argentina is seeking a faster disbursement from a $50 billion standby credit agreement sealed this year.The tax on exports will be crucial in allowing a country to eliminate the fiscal deficit next year with the goal of achieving a surplus in 2020, Economy Minister Nicol\u00e1s Dujovne said.The tax, which will be in effect through 2020, will charge 4 pesos per dollar of exports in primary goods and services and 3 pesos per dollar for all other exports.\u201cThis will reduce the uncertainty surrounding the government\u2019s financing capability,\u201d said Marcos Buscaglia, a founding partner at Alberdi Partners, a local consulting firm. \u201cThe problem is that the additional austerity comes from the side of revenues and not spending.\u201dFausto Spotorno, chief economist at Orlando J. Ferreres & Associates, another consulting firm, said the export taxes \u201conly solve the short-term financial problems\u201d and do not amount to \u201ca replacement for the structural reforms that have not been carried out.\u201dIn addition, export taxes, which had long been criticized by Mr. Macri\u2019s allies, \u201care a bad tax because it alters the productivity of the economy\u201d and involves \u201csacrificing the long term for the short term,\u201d Mr. Spotorno said.Mr. Macri decreased export taxes on agriculture as one of his first measures when he entered office in December 2015 vowing to carry out market-friendly measures that he said would help the country reinsert itself into markets. It was a reversal of more than a decade of heavy state intervention in the economy by former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her husband and predecessor, N\u00e9stor Kirchner.Analysts said the government\u2019s credibility was still in question, particularly after a weekend filled with rumors about possible changes in the president\u2019s cabinet.\u201cThere is still a big question about whether the government will be able to implement a plan of social austerity and whether it will be able to obtain political consensus during an economy that is in a recession,\u201d said Federico Furiase, an economist with Eco Go, a consulting firm. \u201cAs time goes on, the government has fewer and fewer instruments to recover that credibility.\u201dAmong analysts there is still a feeling that the government \u201cis running to catch up\u201d after consistently trying to minimize any sort of economic problems, said Rodrigo \u00c1lvarez, the head of Analytica, another local consulting firm.It is a remarkable change in fortune for a government that was once a darling of the international markets and had won a big vote of confidence from voters in last year\u2019s midterm elections.\u201cAfter two years and a few months, the situation changed, and in large part because of circumstances that were outside our control,\u201d Mr. Macri said, largely blaming the global economy and a severe drought for the country\u2019s troubles.With the prospect of a potentially long recession, there is widespread concern among investors about the political future of Mr. Macri, who acknowledged Monday that the economic turmoil would lead to an increase in poverty.The political consequences of the move are difficult to predict.\u201cArgentina has never carried out an austerity plan of this magnitude before,\u201d said Sergio Berensztein, a political analyst.Advertisement"}

It also made a $7,000 donation to another Democratic State Senate candidate, Robert Jackson, who is running in Manhattan against Marisol Alcantara, another former member of the breakaway Democratic group. On Friday, Mr. de Blasio said that, despite the donation, he has not decided whether to openly endorse Mr. Jackson.More recently, he endorsed Representative Joseph Crowley for re-election to the House \u2014 only to have Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unseat him in an upset that turned her into a progressive darling, and raised questions about why Mr. de Blasio had backed an establishment stalwart and failed to see voters\u2019 desire for change.Advertisement"}

Two of the three forces, globalization and marketization, that have propelled Alibaba to its current $500 billion valuation are dissipating. The third force, technology, is mired in the trade war between China and the United States, and its prospects in China are now uncertain.Alibaba didn\u2019t just transform e-commerce in China; it transformed the entire economy by helping build up the private sector. Mr. Ma\u2019s departure from the company now \u2014 though he claims to have been planning it for a while \u2014 adds to a gathering sense that China\u2019s private sector, the engine of the economy, is losing steam \u2014 and faith.But today globalization is under assault. The Chinese government is enforcing more strictly regulations over V.I.E.s that it had long ignored, creating uncertainty for foreign investors. And the trade war between the United States and China is disrupting Chinese exports, threatening the supply chains of which Alibaba is an integral component.Under increasingly tight financial and regulatory pressures, China\u2019s private sector today arguably is facing the most challenging environment since the early 1990s.In conversations I had in Guangdong, business leaders from various sectors \u2014 product design, investment, technology \u2014 called the current situation \u201cdire.\u201d They said they were making far fewer deals, as much as 50 percent less, now than during the same period last year and complained about the toll of increasing taxes.These are not the conditions that allowed Alibaba to succeed.

{"Headline": "Manafort Plea Deal Casts New Scrutiny on Lobbyists He Recruited", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2012, Paul Manafort had a problem. He was seeking a way to bolster the interests of his pro-Russian Ukrainian clients in Washington, but he did not want to set off tough federal disclosure rules for foreign lobbying.His solution, federal prosecutors say, was to help the Ukrainians create a nonprofit group in Brussels. He then recruited a pair of top lobbying firms to represent the group, an arrangement intended to obscure the fingerprints of the ultimate beneficiary of the lobbying \u2014 the Russia-aligned president of Ukraine, Viktor F. Yanukovych, and his oligarch-backed political party.But even some people at the lobbying firms he recruited saw the nonprofit group, the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, as a sham, according to new evidence laid out by prosecutors when they unveiled a plea agreement with Mr. Manafort in federal court in Washington on Friday.An employee at one of the firms, the Podesta Group, referred to the European Center for a Modern Ukraine in an email as the \u201cEuropean hot-dog stand for a Modern Ukraine.\u201d The employee dismissed as \u201ca fig leaf on a fig leaf\u201d its written attestation that it was not controlled or funded by Mr. Yanukovych, or his party, which Mr. Manafort represented.A co-founder of the Podesta Group, Tony Podesta, told his team to operate on the understanding that Mr. Yanukovych \u201cis the client,\u201d while an employee at the other firm, Mercury Public Affairs, called the claim that the nonprofit was independent from Mr. Yanukovych \u201cnonsense,\u201d comparing it to \u201cAlice in Wonderland.\u201dNonetheless, the Podesta Group and Mercury went along with Mr. Manafort\u2019s ruse, despite the reservations now coming to light. Relying on the written attestation from the European Center, which paid them more than $1 million each, the firms initially registered their engagement with the center under less rigorous congressional lobbying disclosure rules, and not under the foreign lobbying disclosure rules. It was not until last year, when the work came under scrutiny from the Justice Department \u2014 about three years after it ended in 2014 \u2014 that the firms retroactively registered their work for the European Center under the more rigorous Foreign Agents Registration Act.Now, that work, and the decision not to disclose it under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, has turned Podesta and Mercury into subjects of interest in a series of linked investigations that have roiled Washington\u2019s lobbying industry by exposing the sometimes surreptitious ways in which foreign interests try to buy influence.The investigations were prompted by the inquiry of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.The plea deal ignited speculation about how prosecutors might try to use Mr. Manafort to build a case against President Trump, for whom Mr. Manafort served as a top campaign official for nearly five months in 2016.But Mr. Manafort\u2019s friends, and associates who worked with him in Ukraine, say that he might have more valuable information about Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs and politicians, and the Western firms that have helped them, including ones that he recruited, such as Podesta, Mercury and Skadden.It was based on representations arranged by Mr. Manafort and his longtime deputy Rick Gates that Podesta and Mercury decided not to register under the foreign lobbying law, known as FARA.Mercury even prepared a FARA registration statement and the payment for the registration fee in 2012, according to the firm.But both firms ultimately decided instead to register under less rigorous congressional lobbying rules. They did so after receiving legal advice based on a written certification from the European Center, relayed by Mr. Gates, that the group was not \u201cdirectly or indirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed or subsidized in whole or in major part by a government of a foreign country or a foreign political party.\u201dThat was not true, according to prosecutors, who called the group \u201ca mouthpiece for Yanukovych\u201d and his party, and asserted it was controlled by party leaders through Mr. Manafort.Robert P. Trout, a lawyer for Vin Weber, the former Republican congressman who was the lead partner on Mercury\u2019s work for the European Center, pointed out that Mr. Weber had previously registered other clients under FARA \u201cand he was willing to do so in this instance.\u201d The decision to register under the congressional rules instead \u201cwas made only because that is what the company\u2019s outside lawyers advised,\u201d he said.Some Mercury employees and alumni expressed concern that Mr. Mueller\u2019s team would use Mr. Manafort to paint a damning, but inaccurate, picture of Mr. Weber and the firm. They assert that the correspondence quoted in Friday\u2019s court filing was from junior employees and was taken out of context.Prosecutors provided new details on Friday about how the firm participated in an effort by Mr. Manafort to tamp down international concerns about the prosecution and imprisonment by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government of one of his leading rivals, the former prime minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko.Prosecutors say that the firm\u2019s lawyers privately expressed doubts to Mr. Manafort about Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s intent and power to perform the crimes of which she was convicted, but that those points \u201cwere not disclosed to the public.\u201dInstead, Mr. Manafort, in a September 2012 memo to Mr. Yanukovych that prosecutors disclosed on Friday, asserted that the Obama administration indicated that if a report written by Skadden on the prosecution of Ms. Tymoshenko \u201cshowed that the trial was conducted fairly and the conviction was based on the facts of the case and not politically motivated, it would have a mitigating impact.\u201dMr. Manafort and his associates hid the cost of the report, as well as the fact that the firm had also been retained to work for the Ukrainian government more broadly, because they believed revealing that context \u201cwould undermine the report\u2019s being perceived as an independent assessment and thus being an effective lobbying tool for Manafort to use to support the incarceration of President Yanukovych\u2019s political opponent,\u201d prosecutors said in a court filing.After prosecutors began making inquiries \u2014 and issuing subpoenas \u2014 about Skadden\u2019s Ukraine work, the firm returned about $600,000 to the Ukrainian government, and also forced Mr. Craig to leave.Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics, said that Mr. Mueller\u2019s portrayal of the report and the firm\u2019s fee \u201cdoes not look good\u201d for the firm.\u201cIf I were the Skadden attorneys who did this, I would be extremely worried,\u201d she said. While the allegations in Friday\u2019s filings might not in and of themselves create criminal exposure for Skadden or its lawyers, she said, there could be legal ethics implications.Bill Taylor, a lawyer representing Mr. Craig, said his client \u201cwas not required to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.\u201dPotentially complicating matters further for Skadden, another one of the firm\u2019s lawyers provided the legal advice upon which Mercury and Podesta based their decisions not to report their Ukraine work under FARA.Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting from Washington, Matthew Goldstein from New York and Milan Schreuer from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ayanna Pressley\u2019s Victory: A Political Earthquake That Reflects a Changed Boston", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 The morning after her upset political victory, Ayanna Pressley ascended a stage in Dorchester a few blocks from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, greeting activists who had gathered to unify the party and to see a trailblazer \u2014 black, female, Bostonian \u2014 now poised to assume the old J.F.K. congressional seat.\u201cThis is a tribal and parochial place,\u201d Ms. Pressley, 44, said Wednesday, surrounded by Boston political leaders old and new as she ruminated on the hurdles that others said would prevent her from winning. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t always been my home.\u201dIt is now.Here in Boston, Tuesday\u2019s result has registered as something deeper, not only an earthquake disrupting the established political order but a jolt to the very identity of a historic American city, one that likes to call itself \u201cthe Athens of America\u201d but is perpetually reckoning with its own reputation for provincialism, particularly on matters of race.Residents had long understood that the winds were shifting, that the city of \u201cHoney Fitz\u201d and Tip O\u2019Neill and the Bulger brothers had evolved into something new. Technology and finance jobs have flooded in, enticing students from the area\u2019s welter of colleges to stick around after graduation. African-Americans and other racial minorities, galvanized by Ms. Pressley\u2019s message that \u201cchange can\u2019t wait,\u201d have made plain that they intend to demand more than a left-leaning voting record in this moment of insurgent fervor.\u201cLiving under Donald Trump is exhausting,\u201d said Horace Small, a longtime activist in Boston who is executive director of the Union of Minority Neighborhoods. \u201cIt ain\u2019t black and brown people who are the only ones who are exhausted. So are a lot of white people.\u201dOf course, the first step was supplying voters with a different kind of choice.Lawrence DiCara, a former City Council president and unofficial Boston historian, recalled the elections of 1960 when Bostonians \u201ccould vote an all-Irish ticket,\u201d with J.F.K. at the top and other Irish Catholic men among the candidates for all the other offices.\u201cLook at all of our mayors over the years,\u201d Mr. Small said. \u201cLook at all the names.\u201dWalsh. Menino. Flynn. And those are only the most recent.\u201cIt\u2019s like the old days,\u201d Mr. Flynn said. \u201cThe Irish came into political power. And then the Italians. And then the Polish. And now you\u2019re seeing the immigrant population and the minorities, they\u2019re starting to get some real political strength in Boston. That\u2019s a good thing. That means that they really feel empowered. They feel like they\u2019re part of Boston.\u201dTaking stock of the fallout on Wednesday, local Democrats vacillated between shock and exuberance. (There was also a bit of justifiable fatigue. After saying she had spent much of the last several months double-fisting coffee and energy drinks, Ms. Pressley canceled an afternoon event, with her campaign citing \u201csome symptoms of dehydration and exhaustion.\u201d)The gathering in Dorchester, held at Senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s Boston headquarters, was billed as a \u201cunity event,\u201d and attended by fellow Democrats who may or may not have supported Ms. Pressley\u2019s bid initially. Mayor Martin J. Walsh, who had backed Mr. Capuano, said that Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign had left people \u201cinspired to make history.\u201dMaura Healey, the state\u2019s popular attorney general, who had worked on behalf of Ms. Pressley, remarked upon the number of first-time candidates across the ballot on Tuesday. \u201cAnd you know what?\u201d she said. \u201cA whole bunch of them won. That\u2019s what democracy looks like.\u201dIn what was seen as a victory of sorts for Ms. Pressley during the campaign, both United States senators from Massachusetts \u2014 Ms. Warren and Ed Markey \u2014 had remained neutral in the race.In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Markey seemed to caution against drawing any larger conclusions about state or national politics.\u201cIt\u2019s constructed as a majority-minority district and there were two very good candidates, and ultimately I think the election reflected that those changes had taken place,\u201d he said at the Capitol in Washington, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think people are reporting a lot of other changes in the statewide races yesterday or in other congressional districts. I\u2019d be hard pressed to predict what will happen in eight more weeks much less two years from now.\u201dBut if nothing else, Ms. Pressley\u2019s upset made clear that enthusiasm matters.Normally, about 60,000 people might turn out in a Democratic primary in this district, according to John Walsh, a former chairman of the state Democratic Party, who supported Ms. Pressley.This time, 102,000 voters showed up. Ms. Pressley won nearly 60,000 of them. \u201cIf this had been an ordinary primary,\u201d in turns of turnout, Mr. Walsh said, \u201cMichael had the votes to win.\u201dThe Pressley campaign attracted those extra votes through a combination of movement-building, social media and old-fashioned get-out-the-vote methods like sound trucks blaring through neighborhoods on Primary Day.The campaign did not have the money or the inclination to air traditional broadcast television ads, which would not have been able to successfully target people in the district. Instead, it ran one Spanish-speaking ad on Telemundo and used other local ethnic media to reach their audience.\u201cOur strategy was to expand the electorate and ignite the base,\u201d said Wilnelia Rivera, a political strategist who has long worked with Ms. Pressley. \u201cWe trained new activists to engage in a new form of political campaign and to reach the pool of people who don\u2019t normally vote.\u201dThomas Whalen, a social scientist at Boston University, said that Ms. Pressley\u2019s victory represented a foreboding moment for machine politicians like Mr. Walsh.\u201cIt\u2019s a bad day for the gray heads in Massachusetts politics,\u201d he said. \u201cThe political representation is starting to catch up with the demographics of the region.\u201dThis was evident too in the Third Congressional District, north of Boston, where no fewer than 10 Democrats were competing for the open seat created by the retirement of Representative Niki Tsongas. The race was still too close to call on Wednesday and a recount was underway, but it had attracted a multicultural array of candidates, including five women, a man with a Korean and Lebanese heritage, recent immigrants, a gay man and a transgender woman.\u201cPressley is lighting the path for minority groups, who now realize that if she can do it, we can do it too,\u201d Mr. Whalen said. \u201cThat was one of J.F.K.\u2019s political legacies. They said a Catholic could never be elected president.\u201dKatharine Q. Seelye reported from Boston and Matt Flegenheimer from Washington.

{"Headline": "Corporate Sponsors for NASA? Agency to Study Making Space for Brands", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an era of flat budgets for the agency, Jim Bridenstine has started talking about corporate sponsorships for NASA missions.Jim Bridenstine, NASA\u2019s administrator, posed a question two weeks ago.\u201cIs it possible for NASA to offset some of its costs by selling the naming rights to its spacecraft?\u201d he asked during to a meeting of a council that advises NASA. \u201cOr the naming rights to its rockets? I'm telling you, there is interest in that right now.\u201dDon\u2019t expect to see astronauts in Coca-Cola commercials any time soon, or NASA\u2019s Mars rover rebranded as Curiosity, brought to you by Aflac. But Mr. Bridenstine has asked a committee of the NASA Advisory Council to explore whether it might be done, despite regulations or laws that seem to prohibit such activities. He also raised the possibility of allowing NASA astronauts to sign endorsement deals.In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Bridenstine pointed to the rockets taking cargo to the International Space Station. \u201cWe have branding opportunities right there,\u201d he said. Perhaps NASA astronauts could beckon to children from cereal boxes like sports stars, or help raise awareness of NASA\u2019s missions, embedding the agency in popular culture and helping spur children to pursue careers in space, he said.But some critics worry that a decision by NASA to make endorsement and branding deals could create conflicts of interest and diminish the agency\u2019s stature and public mission. \u201cCompanies being able to sponsor rockets or astronauts really calls into question who\u2019s really calling the shots,\u201d said Timothy Farnsworth, a spokesman for the Project on Government Oversight, an independent government watchdog. \u201cIf astronauts are receiving compensation from corporations with business before NASA it could create the appearance of divided loyalty between a private company and public service.\u201dIn the interview, Mr. Bridenstine acknowledged that federal employees are generally not allowed to endorse products, but said the committee would explore possible exceptions that would allow NASA astronauts to do so. He noted that soon there will be astronauts employed by commercial companies like SpaceX and Boeing who will not be fettered by the traditional restrictions that apply to federal employees.The military has trouble retaining pilots who can earn more and work less flying commercial jetliners, he said. \u201cWe could end up spending millions of dollars training each astronaut only to have them go work for someone else as soon as they\u2019re trained,\u201d he said.Because NASA does not operate the rockets going to the space station, the agency might not get a cut of the branding revenue, but the rocket company could then make a lower bid on what it charged NASA, Mr. Bridenstine said. The cargo missions are operated, under commercial contracts with NASA, by SpaceX and Northrop Grumman. The committee is likely to make recommendations at the next quarterly meeting of the NASA advisory council, he said.Companies have long tried to tap marketing opportunities in outer space. From 1968 to 1971, Pan Am issued more than 93,000 cards for its First Moon Flights Club. In 2000, the Pizza Hut logo appeared on a Russian rocket, and the following year, a Radio Shack commercial featured Russian astronauts aboard the International Space Station opening a Father\u2019s Day gift. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that Russia is ahead of us in taking advantage of commercial activities on the International Space Station,\u201d Mr. Bridenstine said.Branding and advertising are among the next steps, Mr. Bridenstine said, that future commercial space stations might tap into. \u201cThis is yet another opportunity to prove out a market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Signs Revised Korean Trade Deal", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump signed a revised free trade agreement with South Korea on Monday in New York, cementing the first bilateral trade deal of his administration and suggesting the United States could soon win similar agreements with other trading partners.\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the United States, and it\u2019s a great day for South Korea,\u201d Mr. Trump said during a meeting with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea.The revised United States-Korea Trade Agreement includes steps to open up the Korean market to increased American exports, most notably for automobiles, and will allow the United States to continue imposing a 25 percent tariff on Korean trucks until 2041.But analysts said there are few fundamental changes to the existing agreement, which was negotiated under President Barack Obama and which Mr. Trump has blamed for hundreds of thousands of lost American jobs. And they said the revised agreement includes few provisions that will appreciably change the trade balance between the two countries, which Mr. Trump has complained about.\u201cThe president referred to this deal as one of the worst agreements ever,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, who helped negotiate the initial Korean agreement as a member of Mr. Obama\u2019s administration. \u201cAnd if you look at what was agreed to, it doesn\u2019t seem to change the agreement dramatically.\u201d\u201cI view this as a win-win deal, some solid improvements,\u201d she added, \u201cbut nothing dramatic.\u201dBusiness groups cheered the updated pact, but stopped well short of calling it transformational.\u201cManufacturers were glad to see the president recommit himself to the U.S. trading partnership with Korea today,\u201d said Linda Dempsey, the vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. \u201cA robust U.S.-Korea F.T.A. is essential to the jobs of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers across America.\u201dIn a fact sheet released Monday afternoon by the White House, Trump administration officials said that \u201coutside\u201d the Korea pact, \u201cthe Treasury Department has an understanding with South Korea to avoid competitive devaluation and practices that provide an unfair competitive advantage. The understanding includes strong commitments on exchange rate practices, robust transparency, and reporting.\u201dMr. Navarro did not immediately respond to questions on Monday about what that \u201cunderstanding\u201d comprises, and whether it is in writing.Asked about the lack of a side deal this month, Treasury officials did not respond directly to questions whether it exists or will exist, saying instead that they are happy with the state of talks with the Koreans over currency.\u201cBuilding on existing discussions, the U.S. Treasury and Korea\u2019s Ministry of Strategy and Finance intend to meet frequently to discuss concerns arising from macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies,\u201d a Treasury spokesman said in response to questions about the promised currency provisions.\u201cWe welcome the Korean government\u2019s recent announcement that it will begin disclosing information on intervention in the foreign exchange markets,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cboth countries continue to maintain a market-oriented exchange rate and are avoiding currency manipulation.\u201dSome Democrats say the lack of a firm currency commitment in the Korea deal is a worrying sign given the administration\u2019s continuing renegotiation of trade deals with Mexico and Canada, as well as its strategy with China.\u201cThe White House went on record in March touting a currency deal with Korea that, it turns out, does not exist,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee.The agreement does not need congressional approval to take effect. But it still must clear political hurdles in South Korea \u2014 a process that could get complicated, Ms. Cutler said, if Mr. Trump\u2019s administration recommends new tariffs on foreign-made automobiles, which could hit Korean automakers particularly hard. Mr. Trump has continually threatened to impose tariffs on cars and car parts, though he has yet to put those into effect.Advertisement"}

Rales and Emily Wei Rales worked with the artist to design the room to his specifications. That meant lowered ceilings, special plumbing, placement of the exit signs, consultation with a theatrical lighting specialist and about 70 meetings with the architects.Similarly, Charles Ray spent hours arranging the four sculptures in his gallery down to the inch. And On Kawara \u2014 before he died in 2014 \u2014 was explicit about how he wanted his triptych of Date Paintings, \u201cMoon Landing,\u201d to be exhibited. As a result, it\u2019s the only gallery with a wooden floor.These are the lengths to which the Raleses went in shaping Glenstone as a bespoke temple for artists they have collected in depth over the last 12 years in this affluent exurb of Washington. Works by the likes of Brice Marden, Pipilotti Rist and Roni Horn will now be displayed in a new 204,000-square-foot museum building called the Pavilions, designed by Thomas Phifer. It opens Oct. 4, but the first block of reservations have already been snapped up. The next block becomes available Oct. 1.\u201cThey\u2019re giving birth to a whole new institution,\u201d said the dealer Matthew Marks, who has artists in Glenstone\u2019s collection.In 2006, the Raleses opened a 30,000-square-foot limestone exhibition space on 100 acres, designed by Charles Gwathmey. For years, it was a hidden gem on the grounds of a former hunt club; in its first seven years of operation, only 10,000 people visited.The $200 million expansion adds 11 rooms constructed of stacked concrete blocks that are connected by a glass-walled passage and surround an 18,000-square-foot water court. You can see the family\u2019s home in the distance.In a lengthy recent interview at the new museum, the couple said they had decided to expand so that they could share more of their collection with more people and to entice groups from neighboring schools, where arts education is at risk.The dealer David Zwirner said the Raleses \u201creally want to contextualize what they buy \u2014 where does the work of art fit into the production of an artist?\u201d\u201cWhat this museum means to the United States is more akin to what Getty did, what Hirshhorn did \u2014 it\u2019s at that level,\u201d he continued, referring to J. Paul Getty and Joseph H. Hirshhorn.In an increasingly market-driven art world, artists say they appreciate the Raleses approach. \u201cThese people sought my work out, and they kept coming back,\u201d said Ms. Horn, whose two large solid cast-glass cylinders are on view in the passage along the water court.\u201cI\u2019ve never been a hot artist,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be a big number at auction in my life.

Among the sculptures integrated into the landscape are those by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Ellsworth Kelly and Richard Serra. The couple employ a full-time horticulturist to tend to the 24,000 flowers in Jeff Koons\u2019s monumental \u201cSplit-Rocker.\u201dThe expansion includes an environmental center, offering educational programs, that will open in the spring. \u201cWe\u2019re tree-huggers,\u201d Mr. Rales said.In addition to those of Mr. Gober, Mr. Ray and On Kawara, the museum\u2019s nine single-artist installations belong to Martin Puryear, Michael Heizer, Ms. Rist, Lygia Pape, Mr. Marden and Cy Twombly.Installations were painstakingly conceived in collaboration with the artist or the artist\u2019s estate. \u201cWe feel it\u2019s our responsibility to ask them, \u2018How would you like this shown?\u2019\u201d Ms. Rales said.The couple visited Mr. Heizer in the desert and built a rectangular pit at Glenstone for his sculpture of 15 steel beams. They even placed a line of matching raincoats in a closet for those who want to visit the piece in inclement weather.The inaugural exhibition in the Pavilions demonstrates the range of the collection, in a gallery featuring 65 artworks by 52 artists, dating from 1943 to 1989. They include examples of movements including Abstract Expressionism, Gutai, Brazilian modernism, Arte Povera, Minimalism and post-Minimalism.\u201cWe have our wish list, and we\u2019ve been slowly going through it,\u201d Mr. Rales said of their artists, \u201cthose we feel have made real innovations, shifted the way we look at art, changed the definition of art.\u201dThere are household names like Alexander Calder, Willem de Kooning, Agnes Martin and Mark Rothko. But there is also work by Akira Kanayama (Japan), Sergio Camargo (Brazilian) and Alighiero e Boetti (Italy). And there is an abundance of work by women. (The story of Minimalism is told through artists like Jo Baer, Anne Truitt and Agnes Martin, not just Carl Andre and Dan Flavin.)Similarly, the Raleses have hung a just-acquired flag by the artist-activist Faith Ringgold, which includes the N-word, next to one by Jasper Johns. \u201cHistory is always ripe for reinterpretation,\u201d Mr. Rales said.Glenstone has a staff of 130, including 24 young professionals working as guides. The Raleses said they toured about 50 other museums before expanding their own.Mr. Rales has been collecting since 1990. In 2005, he joined forces with Emily Wei, a former director at the Gladstone Gallery in Manhattan. They married in 2008 and have two children, 5 and 8. Their collection now numbers about 1,300 pieces, including sound art, film, video and works on paper.Glenstone aims to admit about 400 people a day, to ensure that visitors can have a contemplative experience. Instagram photos are discouraged indoors, where the space has a naturally lit, Zen-like serenity, with benches for resting designed by Mr. Puryear and meandering paths.Indeed, the collectors said they wanted plenty of breathing room \u2014 no \u201cMona Lisa\u201d crowds or selfie sticks, very little wall text and no stanchions forcing people to keep their distance from the art. The message to visitors is clear. \u201cLook \u2014 really use your eyes,\u201d Ms. Rales said. \u201cAllow that to be your primary experience.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Avenatti: The Case for Indicting the President", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJustice Department lawyers have said a sitting president cannot be indicted. It\u2019s time to test that proposition by bringing an indictment that can be reviewed by the Supreme Court.Mr. Avenatti is the lawyer for Stormy Daniels in her lawsuits against President Trump and his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.The grand jury system has been employed in hundreds of thousands of cases involving all manner of crimes committed by all manner of people. All, that is, except one: the president. No grand jury has ever indicted a president, and consequently no court, let alone the Supreme Court, has ruled on the critical question of whether the Constitution allows a president to be indicted while in office. Legal scholars have opined on both sides of the issue, and Department of Justice attorneys have drafted memorandums arguing against indicting a sitting president. But none of these analyses establish definitive rules of law. It is time to clarify the issue. Provided there is sufficient evidence to support an indictment of President Trump \u2014 and there are many indications that there is \u2014 the special counsel, Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, and prosecutors from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, who are investigating payments to my client, Stormy Daniels, and Karen McDougal, should present their evidence to grand juries. Those jurors, citizens of our communities, should then determine whether the evidence supports an indictment of Mr. Trump. The fact that Mr. Trump is a sitting president should not derail a process that applies to all Americans, regardless of stature or station. He would still have the post-indictment relief available to all citizens, including the ability to challenge the constitutionality of the indictment. Some also argue that indicting the president would critically impair his ability to lead the country. But this is a White House already engulfed in chaos and daily distractions. And if the House were to initiate impeachment proceedings, it is hard to see how that process would be any less distracting than a criminal indictment. But however well intentioned and instructive those memorandums and analyses might be, they do not begin to approach the weight of an actual Supreme Court decision. Our democracy and our belief in the rule of law for all, including presidents, should not rest on such a soft foundation.Instead, if the facts and evidence are adequate for indictment, then prosecutors must be blind to the officeholder\u2019s position \u2014 especially so in this case because, unlike in President Clinton\u2019s case, the investigations relate to how Mr. Trump won the election. Ultimately, the question would almost certainly be decided by a panel of judges previously confirmed pursuant to the Constitution \u2014 either in the courts of appeals or, more appropriately, the Supreme Court.Should Mr. Trump be indicted and in the event that the case reaches the Supreme Court, Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s recusal should be mandatory. The American public\u2019s view of impartiality of the rule of law and of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.Michael Avenatti is the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, in her lawsuits against President Trump and his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Betrays \u2018Forgotten\u2019 Americans", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom the Supreme Court to labor organizing rules, the president undermines workers\u2019 greatest champions.Mr. Greenhouse is a former labor and workplace reporter for the Times.Donald Trump promotes himself as a friend of \u201cforgotten\u201d workers, but in ways large and small his administration has undermined what has traditionally been the biggest champion of workers: labor unions. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has installed a conservative majority on the National Labor Relations Board that has moved quickly to make it harder for unions to organize. Last December, the board overturned a rule, beloved by unions, that made it easier to organize smaller units of workers in big factories and stores. In another board decision, his appointees made it tougher for workers at fast-food restaurants and other franchised operations to unionize, although that \u201cjoint employer\u201d ruling was vacated when a labor board member later recused himself because of a conflict of interest. The board is also looking to slow down unionization elections, a move that unions oppose because it would give corporations more time to pressure workers to vote against unionizing. Mr. Trump\u2019s first nominee to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, was the deciding vote in a case that delivered this year\u2019s biggest blow to workers. In Janus v. AFSCME, the court\u2019s conservative majority, in a 5-to-4 vote, ruled in June that government employees can\u2019t be required to pay any fees to the unions that bargain for them. By allowing many government workers to become \u201cfree riders,\u201d that ruling is expected to chop revenues to many public employee unions by one-tenth to one-third. With private-sector unions badly weakened by factory shutdowns and corporate resistance to unions, government employee unions have become the most powerful part of the labor movement. That\u2019s one reason anti-union billionaires and foundations underwrote the Janus litigation: to hobble the strongest part of labor. The Koch brothers and other billionaires have seized on Janus to finance efforts, through emails and door-to-door canvassing, to urge government workers \u2014 teachers, police, firefighters, social workers and many others \u2014 to quit their unions and stop paying union fees. It doesn\u2019t look as if Mr. Trump\u2019s latest nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, will be a friend to workers or unions. In an astonishingly anti-worker opinion in a case involving a SeaWorld trainer killed by an orca whale, Mr. Kavanaugh wrote in 2014 that the Labor Department was wrong to fine SeaWorld. Dissenting in a 2-to-1 case, he suggested that the Labor Department should not \u201cpaternalistically\u201d regulate the safety of SeaWorld\u2019s trainers because they, like tiger tamers and bull riders, were sports and entertainment figures who accepted the risk of injury in hazardous businesses that usually regulated their own dangers. His opinion had echoes of 19th-century state court rulings that factory workers assumed the risk of injuries from machinery that cut off their hands.Labor unions might get a boost from Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to increase coal, steel and aluminum production and from his push to renegotiate Nafta to spur domestic auto production. The Trump administration and many unions hope those moves will bring back tens of thousands of mining and manufacturing jobs. That could lift unions\u2019 ranks, but those gains would be a fraction of the losses expected from Janus. Some experts estimate that more than a million workers will quit their unions over the next few years as a result of that ruling. Steven Greenhouse was a labor and workplace reporter for The New York Times for 19 years. He is writing a book about the history and future of the American labor movement.Advertisement"}

Will New Taxes Take Off the Shine?", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWith a new season of international art fairs, auctions and exhibitions about to begin, many are talking up art as the alternative asset of the moment.It remains to be seen if those perceptions will be maintained at next month\u2019s \u201cFrieze Week\u201d in London and \u201cFIAC Week\u201d in Paris, and the forthcoming calendar of auctions in London, Paris, Hong Kong and New York.Ms. Wierbicki thinks the reform will affect some collectors\u2019 willingness to sell. \u201cIt depends on the age of the collector,\u201d said Ms. Wierbicki. \u201cThe older generation is going to be more thoughtful,\u201d she added. Collectors whose artworks have soared in value may want to pass them onto family members, rather than face a capital gains bill of 28 percent, she said.As for younger collectors, \u201cthis higher expense of getting out may make them think about investing in other markets,\u201d said Ms. Wierbicki.Others with expertise in the art market point out that the 1031 exchange was only used by relatively few ultra-wealthy collectors who were regular sellers as well as buyers.\u201cThey\u2019re a small subset,\u201d said Todd Levin, an art adviser based in New York. \u201cThey\u2019re not the whole art market, and we\u2019re only talking about America. But the effect won\u2019t be negligible.\u201dFor outsiders, perceptions of the art market tend to be based on dazzling auction results, particularly at the bellwether sales in New York in May and November.

You don\u2019t read about unsolds.\u201dThe Pi-eX research, based on 250 evening sales from 2007 to 2017, showed that returns on third-party guarantees shrank in 2017, making them more attractive to sellers and buyers, rather than to 1031-minded investors.But with competition between the auction houses pushing up valuations \u2014 and thus creating \u201cgrowth,\u201d or at least inflation \u2014 more guaranteed lots are selling to their guarantors, without any external bidding validating the price.\u201cThere\u2019s huge volatility in the market,\u201d said Ms. Bourron. \u201cThe third-party buyers are taking the full risk of that volatility.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a very risky asset. There are booms and troughs. There are high transaction costs and it\u2019s easy to be taken advantage of,\u201d said Doug Woodham, managing partner at Art Fiduciary Advisors, based in New York.Perception and reality are very different things in the commercial art world.

{"Headline": "John Wilcock, Pioneer of the Underground Press, Dies at 91", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJohn Wilcock, a British journalist and travel writer who played a major role in the emergence of the alternative press at The Village Voice, The East Village Other and the Underground Press Syndicate, died on Thursday at a care facility in Ojai, Calif. He was 91.He died after several strokes, said his biographer, Ethan Persoff.In the 1960s and early \u201970s, a freewheeling age of psychedelic drugs and antiwar protests, Mr. Wilcock led two lives. He was both the author of many \u201c$5 a day\u201d travel books and a driving force behind underground publications that, spurning traditional journalism, attacked political, social and cultural norms with bawdy language and comic-book imagery, all of it financed by sexually explicit advertising.In a 1973 profile, The New York Times called Mr. Wilcock \u201can influential man nobody knows,\u201d an \u201coracle of the nitty-gritty of inexpensive, traditional tourism\u201d and \u201can apostle and chronicler of the radical underground\u201d \u2014 although, the article noted, he looked \u201ca bit too scruffy for a best-selling travel writer and far too straight for an underground celebrity.\u201dMr. Wilcock had worked for news organizations in Britain, Canada and the United States, including The Times, and was the first news editor of The Village Voice before he helped found The East Village Other in 1965. The paper was named for Carl Jung\u2019s definition of \u201cthe other\u201d as \u201cone who is outside society.\u201dThe Other, known as EVO to its devotees, was one of the nation\u2019s first underground newspapers. Published biweekly in New York until it folded in 1972, it had a circulation of 60,000 at its peak.In its pages one might typically find a picture of President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s head in a toilet; recipes for concoctions made with marijuana and hashish; cartoons by Art Spiegelman and R. Crumb; reports on Andy Warhol, Timothy Leary and Abbie Hoffman; and personal advertisements like \u201cFrenchman, graduate student, writer, will happily share his East Village apt. with swinging chick.\u201dIn 1966, as underground newspapers spread to urban areas throughout the country, Mr. Wilcock helped found the Underground Press Syndicate, which shared news and features. Based in New York, it was initially a network of five publications: The East Village Other; The Los Angeles Free Press; The Berkeley Barb; The Paper of East Lansing, Mich.; and The Fifth Estate of Detroit.As more underground papers joined the syndicate and start-ups proliferated \u2014 Abbie Hoffman\u2019s \u201cSteal This Book\u201d listed 271 affiliates in North America and Europe in 1971 \u2014 free counterculture news, criticism and cartoons became widely available.Growth subsided, however, and by 1974 the boom was over, with underground papers giving way to less radical alternative weeklies.\u201cI have no regrets about the path I took, which helped to backstop and record the youth revolution \u2014 maybe the first time in history that teenagers actually had power,\u201d Mr. Wilcock told The Atlantic in 2012. \u201cIt was a hippie bus for all to ride \u2014 The Barb claimed to have sold 80,000 of one issue \u2014 something that backed what was to become a movement. And I probably enjoyed every minute of it.\u201dJohn Wilcock was born in Sheffield, England, on Aug. 4, 1927. He became a cub reporter at 16 for The Sheffield Telegraph and worked for the mass-market London tabloids The Daily Mail and The Daily Mirror. In the early 1950s he was an editor for British United Press before moving first to Toronto, where he worked at Saturday Night magazine, and then to New York, where he settled in Greenwich Village.In 1955, Mr. Wilcock was present at the creation of The Village Voice, a weekly tabloid covering politics and the arts that was America\u2019s first alternative newspaper \u2014 although whether he should be considered a founder is a matter of some dispute.Interviewed last year for an article in The Nation, Edwin Fancher, one of the Voice\u2019s founders, insisted that only he, Norman Mailer and Dan Wolf deserved to be called founders because they were the only ones who had put up money.The Voice discontinued its print edition last year and ceased publication entirely just weeks ago.Mr. Wilcock wrote a column for The Voice, \u201cThe Village Square,\u201d for a decade, reporting on neighborhood events and trivia and depicting himself as an innocent who yearns for young women with ponytails in Washington Square Park and collects lavatory graffiti, like \u201cElectra loves Agamemnon,\u201d at the White Horse Tavern.But he was unable to live on the Voice\u2019s wages \u2014 often little or nothing \u2014 and while working there he also got a paying job with The Times, where he edited and wrote travel articles from 1957 to 1959. Many were offbeat: a wry look at tourists gawking up at skyscrapers in Manhattan, a plan to resurrect a South Dakota ghost town by installing Indians.He met Arthur Frommer, the travel book publisher, in 1960 and soon began working for him. He wrote guidebooks on how to live on $5 a day in Mexico, Greece, Japan, India and elsewhere. He later edited books on the occult and published Other Scenes, an underground magazine offering travel tips, poetry and social commentary.He married Amber Nomi Lamann in 1967. They were divorced in 1972. No immediate family members survive.In 1963, Mr. Wilcock, a photographer and a nude model were arrested on a Sunday afternoon at Liberty Street and Broadway in Lower Manhattan on a charge of disturbing the peace. A judge acquitted them on grounds that in that location, which as part of the financial district was normally deserted on weekends, there was no one around to be disturbed, except the detective who had nabbed them.Mr. Wilcock was for many years a regular among the artists and partygoers at Andy Warhol\u2019s Factory in Manhattan. He was a founder of Warhol\u2019s magazine Interview in 1969. (Interview, like The Village Voice, ceased publication this year.) In 1971 he published \u201cThe Autobiography and Sex Life of Andy Warhol\u201d \u2014 which was actually a collection of interviews with Warhol\u2019s friends and associates, credited to \u201cJohn Wilcock with a cast of thousands.\u201dA revised edition of the Warhol book was published in 2010, the same year Mr. Wilcock published his own autobiography, \u201cManhattan Memories.\u201dIn the 1980s and \u201990s Mr. Wilcock published several small newspapers, including one called John Wilcock\u2019s Secret Diary. He also wrote historical tidbits and practical advice on travel for Insight Guides, a London publisher.Mr. Wilcock settled in Ojai in 2001 and there began publishing an online monthly magazine, The Ojai Orange. The magazine included a column, which he continued to write until recently. He called it \u201cThe Column of Lasting Insignificance.\u201dDaniel E. Slotnik contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Drug Industry Tries to Slip $4 Billion Windfall Into Opioid Bill", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Drug companies usually get what they want in public-policy battles on Capitol Hill, but a move by the pharmaceutical industry to grab $4 billion from the federal Treasury in a bill that is supposed to address the nation\u2019s deadly opioid epidemic is meeting fierce resistance.The change sought by the drug industry has nothing to do with the scourge of opioids, but such provisions are often tucked quietly into popular, swiftly moving bills, then discovered months later. In a sign of the times, members of Congress and consumer advocates quickly mobilized opposition.\u201cBig Pharma is trying to hijack the bill and turn it into a giant pharmaceutical company bailout,\u201d Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota, said in a Twitter post.The proposal \u201cwill increase prescription drug costs for older Americans while providing a windfall of billions of dollars to the drug industry,\u201d said AARP, the lobby for 38 million Americans 50 and older.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the relief for pharmaceutical companies would cost more than twice as much as the bill spends to prevent and treat opioid addiction.Opponents said Monday that they were confident they could block the relief sought by drug companies, at least for now.The Congressional Budget Office had initially estimated that the requirement for drug companies to provide larger discounts would reduce federal spending on Medicare\u2019s drug benefit by a total of $7.7 billion through 2027. Shortly after the law was enacted, the budget office discovered additional information and raised its estimate of the savings to $11.8 billion.Drug makers argue that Congress intended to save just $7.7 billion and should now give back the $4 billion difference. Medicare beneficiaries could still receive discounts of 63 percent, the industry says.The Trump administration has not publicly engaged in this particular fight, but has stoked skepticism of the industry. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said that drug makers are \u201cgetting away with murder.\u201dPharmaceutical companies see the opioids bill as an attractive vehicle because swift passage is a political priority for members of both parties this election year. Lawmakers are urgently trying to work out differences between the versions passed by votes of 396 to 14 in the House and 99 to 1 in the Senate.\u201cWe are focused on ensuring Medicare Part D is secure for the future by correcting a technical error\u201d by the Congressional Budget Office, said Stephen J. Ubl, the president and chief executive of PhRMA, who has led lobbying on the issue.Prescription drug plans pay some of the drug costs incurred by people in the coverage gap. In the Bipartisan Budget Act in February, Congress reduced the insurers\u2019 share to 5 percent; it would otherwise have been 20 percent next year.In a classic spat between two powerful industries, drug companies say insurers should pay more so drug makers can pay less. Insurers will do a better job managing the cost of Medicare\u2019s drug benefit if they bear more financial risk, drug companies say, and many health economists agree.America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the chief lobby for insurers, opposes any changes that would increase their share of drug costs in the coverage gap.Drug companies are urging Congress to provide relief to some Medicare beneficiaries in another way: by delaying a sharp increase in their out-of-pocket drug costs scheduled to occur in 2020, when the coverage gap grows much wider.The Affordable Care Act temporarily shielded beneficiaries from 2014 to 2019, but that provision of the law expires in 2020.Mark E. Miller, the former executive director of a federal commission that advises Congress on Medicare, said: \u201cIn the context of the current debate, I would not roll back the drug discounts. We need broader changes in the structure of Medicare\u2019s drug benefit. If the discounts are rolled back, patients and taxpayers should get something in return, to bring more competition to the market and drive down drug prices.\u201dCongress has been considering several proposals to speed the approval of lower-cost generic versions of brand-name medicines. One would make it easier for developers of generic drugs to obtain samples of brand-name products, which they need to show that the generic version is equivalent to the original.Allowing generic drugs to enter the market sooner could save money for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health programs.Under a proposal approved in June by the Senate Judiciary Committee, a federal court could order a brand-name drug maker to provide samples of its product to a generic company \u201con commercially reasonable, market-based terms.\u201d The court could also award damages to the generic company.Lawmakers have discussed adding some version of this proposal to the opioids bill. But House Republican leaders are wary of any changes that could generate additional litigation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He\u2019s a Former Republican Taking On Dana Rohrabacher. Can He Win?", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIRVINE, Calif. \u2014 Harley Rouda may not fit the image of a liberal hero. For decades, he was a registered Republican and in 2016 donated money to the presidential hopeful John Kasich. He is a real estate executive opposed to rent control. He regularly appears at campaign events with a white pocket square tucked into his conservative dark suit, even in the sweltering Southern California summer heat.But Mr. Rouda is the Democrats\u2019 best chance in three decades to unseat the Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher.The contest has become one of the most closely watched political fights in the country and Democrats see defeating the 15-term incumbent as one of their top priorities. It also demonstrates just how much has changed in Orange County, which less than a generation ago was solidly Republican. Mr. Rouda has capitalized on the shifts by denouncing Mr. Rohrabacher at every turn and now must use the remaining time before the election to convince voters that he is just like many of them: a former Republican who believes the party has abandoned moderate views.\u201cWe have a Republican Party that in many ways is leaving its Republican voters,\u201d Mr. Rouda, 56, said in a recent interview at his campaign headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s true even more so here than in other places in the country.\u201dEven as he campaigned among reliably Democratic voters before the June primary, Mr. Rouda did not hesitate to bring up his own political shifts.\u201cWhen I started this, I went to talk to a group of activists and they said, \u2018You look like a Republican,\u2019\u201d he told the crowd at a meeting of Democratic activists this summer, prompting a round of laughter. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think that was a bad thing. Neither do I.\u201dAs the laughter subsided, Mr. Rouda asked how many people had been lifelong Democrats. A couple dozen hands went up in a crowd of roughly 200 people.\u201cHow many of you would not have been at a meeting like this if Hillary Clinton had won?\u201d he asked. Then, many more people raised their hands, as murmurs of agreement rippled through the room. He quickly added: \u201cMe neither. President Trump has changed everything.\u201dThroughout the country, there have been other examples of former Republican or unaffiliated voters jumping into the political ring this year. Of the dozens of first-time Democratic candidates vying for Congress in this year\u2019s midterm elections, there are candidates in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina who until recently were registered as Republicans or Independents. Like Mr. Rouda, many saw themselves as Reagan Republicans, but say the party has steadily strayed from the ideals of the former president (who was also once the governor of California.) They were stunned to see Mr. Trump win the White House, they said, and his presidency has at once activated and radicalized them.Races like this one represent an essential test for Democrats: Can the party win over moderate, suburban and affluent voters even as it moves toward a more populist bent? Mr. Rouda has said he is in favor of Medicare for All, a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage tied to inflation, along with free tuition at public colleges. While Democrats in many parts of the country are embracing similar policies in an appeal to liberal voters, Mr. Rouda is counting on attracting moderate voters by portraying his support for these policies as fiscally responsible.Still, support for Republicans has been steadily eroding in Orange County. Now, roughly a third of voters in the county are registered Republicans, down from more than half in 1990. Roughly 30 percent of voters in the district are not registered to either party. With a margin of 9 percentage points, Ms. Clinton was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the county since Franklin Delano Roosevelt.This weekend, former President Barack Obama is trying to rally Democratic voters in Orange County, campaigning for congressional candidates in the districts Ms. Clinton won, including the 48th.\u201cI think of party as something you\u2019re born into and may not necessarily choose at first,\u201d Mr. Rouda said. \u201cMost kids don\u2019t say I\u2019m not really feeling Christian, I think I\u2019m Jewish. I think it\u2019s the same if you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican and I was raised in a traditional Republican household.\u201dMr. Rouda has struggled to explain why he did not change his registration until after the 2016 election. He said he thought he was already a registered Democrat and only realized he was not when he looked at his own voter card before he declared his would run.

It appears to be another sign that vertical mergers, where two companies in different industries combine, are acceptable to the Trump administration. (Its effort to block AT&T from buying Time Warner increasingly looks like a political anomaly.)The move augurs well for CVS\u2019s bid to acquire the insurer Aetna \u2014 and for many more potential tie-ups. With Amazon looming over the sector, other companies may be tempted to take the merger plunge.Coke would be a different player. The company is openly pushing into new markets to offset slowing soda sales. (See: its $5.1 billion deal for Costa.) The company says it\u2019s watching the growth in cannabis-infused drinks for now, but it\u2019s not hard to imagine buzz-inducing Coke products hitting store shelves.In a note to clients, the analyst, Mark May, said that breaking up the company could yield two successful businesses: a retail company with an enterprise value of $400 billion and a cloud-computing business worth $600 billion. It would also help Amazon avoid antitrust scrutiny at a time when President Trump appears to be focused on the company.So far, investors appear uneasy with the idea. Amazon shares fell 3 percent after the report was published.The sting isn\u2019t necessarily that Lucid secured funding from the Saudis when Elon Musk couldn\u2019t (though that has to hurt a little). It\u2019s that Tesla, already grappling with competition from traditional carmakers like General Motors and Daimler, must now contend with a well-funded upstart that wants to grab the luxury end of market.Tesla investors can only hope that Mr. Musk, who has seemed distracted lately, can focus on beating the competition.The timing of the trip is uncertain: Elon Musk, SpaceX\u2019s C.E.O., said that the so-called B.F.R. spacecraft would not be ready until 2023 at the earliest.Neither Mr. Musk nor Mr. Maezawa would talk about the cost. But Mr. Musk did say that developing the rocket would cost $2 billion to $10 billion, and that Mr. Maezawa\u2019s ticket was a significant investment in the project.First: \u201cSo you are a charity?\u201d This view suggests that women need help from altruistic donors to get their businesses going. Second: \u201cAh! You are a social impact fund!\u201d This response insinuates that women cannot possibly make you rich, so there needs to be a social mission attached to give an investor something virtuous to talk about at dinner parties. Third: \u201cGreat, but why would you limit yourself?\u201d This may seem like a fair comment, but if you asked me about my deal flow I would tell you that I reviewed more than 100 opportunities in six months and was blown away by the quality of applications.In fact, she writes, she wants to make money, and the firm\u2019s approach allows her to identify opportunities that \u201care largely overlooked \u2014 and therefore attractive.\u201dDealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

Mr. Dorsey \u2014 who sported a nose ring, a popped-collar shirt and a craggy Moses beard \u2014 looked more like a hipster version of a Civil War officer than a tech icon. Yet more striking than his look was his manner before skeptical lawmakers.Faced with tough questions, Mr. Dorsey did not mount an aggressive defense of his company and his technology, as an earlier generation of tech leader might have. Instead, he demurred, conceded mistakes and generally engaged in a nuanced and seemingly heartfelt colloquy on the difficulties of managing tech in a complex world. Even in response to Mr. Barton\u2019s comment about his look, Mr. Dorsey was solicitous. \u201cMy mom agrees with you,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony prompted questions about what we expect from tech leaders today \u2014 and how thoroughly what we expect has been upturned in the last few years. Since the 1980s, a common leadership archetype has loomed over the tech business: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Sometimes unconsciously and often deliberately, a generation of tech leaders attempted to ape the Apple and Microsoft founders\u2019 charisma, their quirks, their style and above all their irrepressible, hard-charging confidence, to say nothing of arrogance.That is, Mr. Dorsey sounded less like a quotable visionary who can see beyond the horizon and more like what he actually is and ought to be \u2014 a thoughtful, accessible, transparent and, despite the beard and nose ring, kind of boring manager of a serious company whose decisions have world-changing consequences.When it comes to tech C.E.O.s, boring is the new black. Under the glare of global scrutiny, the daring, win-at-all-costs ethos that defined so much of the tech industry in the last couple of decades has been undergoing a thorough metamorphosis.Google once played up the nerdy antics of its founders, but now the company\u2019s leaders are almost unidentifiable ciphers. Larry Page, who runs Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has become a recluse, and even Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s achingly pleasant chief, declined to appear at last week\u2019s hearings.Oh, and I almost forgot about Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O. In my defense, everyone forgets about Mr. Nadella.\u201cA start-up that has five million people using it \u2014 that\u2019s small for Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s a tremendous number of people, and so even they have a large amount of responsibility in the world,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.The tech press has also gotten tougher. Once, novelty alone would merit coverage, but in the social media age, even the tiniest misstep can be ruinous. It has become crucial to get a leader who doesn\u2019t speak out of turn.Mr. Musk\u2019s odd behavior underlines the tensions at play as understated style takes over tech. There is a reason that a big, Jobsian personality was once so prized. Tech companies are leaps of faith. In their early days they exist on the knife edge of oblivion, and it is often only through a founder\u2019s force of personality that investors, employees and the media take any notice. The most beloved founders possess an uncanny genius for selling the world on ideas that look useless, pointless or impossible before we all realize we can never live without them.Though he has made good on only some of those points \u2014 Tesla is now struggling to fulfill orders for the Model 3, the \u201ceven more affordable\u201d car in the plan \u2014 posting the plan was part of an impish ploy to generate publicity for what looked like an outlandish idea. That ploy worked; ever since, Mr. Musk has leveraged his growing celebrity as if it were a currency.Every few months, he makes new promises about this or that amazing thing coming soon. Each time, he reaps more attention and financing and, eventually, builds real cars that are sold to real people. In this way, Mr. Musk\u2019s personality became a key element of not just his companies\u2019 brands, but their business models.But it\u2019s a tricky, high-stakes gamble. For one thing, Mr. Musk has to deliver on his promises. More recently, another problem has eaten at this strategy: The future has been getting less obviously wonderful, so it\u2019s hard to take any tech chief\u2019s assurances that their new thing will indeed be as great for the world as they say.\u201cI tried to convince people to slow down A.I.,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cThis was futile. I tried for many years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.\u201dThus, the tension: On one hand, Mr. Musk wants us to believe that everything he\u2019s building is going to turn out wonderfully. On the other, he\u2019s telling us to be very scared. This sounds like a contradiction, but in its admission of doubt and complexity, it\u2019s actually a pretty good picture of the future.No wonder he sounds crazy. No wonder everyone else is going for boring.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Trump\u2019s Trade War Mounts, China\u2019s Wall Street Allies Lose Clout", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew trade talks between the two governments are tentatively scheduled between Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Liu He, a Chinese vice premier, later this month in Washington. Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone\u2019s chief, has been playing a critical role in organizing them, say people familiar with the talks, who asked for anonymity because the process is sensitive.\u201cWhat\u2019s really surprising is that the connections that used to work, the formula that used to work, just don\u2019t work at this point,\u201d said Marshall W. Meyer, an emeritus professor of management at the Wharton School of Business.A worsening trade war could stymie that progress, and it hurt other foreign businesses as well. Lou Jiwei, China\u2019s former finance minister, said in a speech on Sunday that China could block exports of crucial components for Western supply chains if the trade war continued. Such a move would disrupt American businesses but would likely accelerate corporate efforts to shift factories away from China, and current Chinese officials haven\u2019t publicly discussed such a dramatic step.The financial sector\u2019s arguments have often found a sympathetic ear in Washington. Over the past two decades, China has emerged as a major global economic growth driver and as an important customer for many American companies, including Apple, Qualcomm and General Motors.But the Trump administration\u2019s trade hawks have so far prevailed against Wall Street-friendly voices of trade moderation, such as Mr. Mnuchin, a onetime Goldman Sachs executive. That is partly because the trade war hasn\u2019t shown President Trump much downside. His stance has won support from both parties. The United States economy shows few signs of trade-war damage, and markets continue to rise.Even if Republicans lose Congress in November\u2019s elections, the trade war will probably continue, said Robert B. Zoellick, a former United States trade representative. Only a slump in the markets might make him reconsider, Mr. Zoellick said.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to affect Trump,\u201d Mr. Zoellick said about November\u2019s elections. \u201cMarkets could.\u201dJPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, a onetime informal adviser to Mr. Trump, said last Wednesday in a speech that \u201cI\u2019m smarter than he is\u201d and that unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s, his personal wealth \u201cwasn\u2019t a gift from Daddy.\u201d Mr. Trump the next day called Mr. Dimon a \u201cnervous mess,\u201d and Mr. Dimon has since said he shouldn\u2019t have made the remarks. Others, like Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief, James Gorman, and the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, opposed Trump policies like his original travel and immigration ban.The Wall Street influence ran deep. Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street veteran, served as Treasury secretary under President Clinton and helped forge the consensus within the Clinton administration on how to bring China into the World Trade Organization. Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former Goldman Sachs executive with a high profile in China, served as President Bush\u2019s Treasury secretary.Mr. Schwarzman is working behind the scenes to get China and the United States talking again. He urged American officials to invite their Chinese counterparts to resume talks, according to the people familiar with the discussions.Last week, Mr. Mnuchin issued an invitation, which Chinese officials publicly greeted warmly. But Larry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser and another Wall Street veteran, suggested afterward that China had sought the invitation.The meeting in Beijing on Sunday \u2014 organized by Zhou Xiaochuan, China\u2019s former central banker, and John Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president \u2014 gave Wall Street a chance to press for more business from China. The bankers were planning to present Wall Street\u2019s wish list for more market access, including creating a more transparent process for financial firms to get operating licenses and expanding the services that American bank branches can offer.Because the meeting was called on short notice, top Wall Street executives didn\u2019t attend. Most sent a senior executive, like Franck Petitgas, head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s international business; John Waldron, president of Goldman Sachs; and Jon Gray, the No. 2 executive at Blackstone. Officials will pass suggestions to Mr. Liu, Mr. Xi\u2019s top economic adviser.Prospects are good that this type of outreach will help, said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator.\u201cTraditionally there have been these back channels, and one of the reasons why Beijing has put people like Liu He in these senior positions has been because they have such good relationships with Wall Street,\u201d said Ms. Cutler, who is vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.\u201cTo date, these back channels don\u2019t seem to be working in moving this administration towards a negotiated solution.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong, Kate Kelly from New York and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia Struck a Peace Deal With Guerrillas, but Many Return to Arms", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnder a torn Colombian flag on a windy hilltop, a ragtag guerrilla militia gathers. One fighter is missing an arm. Another, a leg. A commander who can barely read but goes by the alias \u201cthe Poet\u201d tells of a recent firefight with a paramilitary squad in the hills nearby.It might be just another scene from Colombia\u2019s decades of guerrilla warfare were it not for a puzzling fact: The group the fighters say they belong to, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, laid down its arms after it signed a peace deal meant to end the longest war in the Americas.The peace accords signed in 2016 by then-President Juan Manuel Santos and the rebels were meant to bring an end to five decades of fighting that left at least 220,000 dead and nearly 6 million people displaced from their homes.Behind the agreement, though, loomed a fear: That many of the thousands of fighters granted amnesty under the pact might sour on civilian life and pick up arms again.It has already happened.\u201cWe doing the same work, we have the same ideals \u2014 and we\u2019ll charge ahead, God willing,\u201d said one of the commanders, who is 25 and goes by the alias Maicol.These dissident guerrillas invited The New York Times to their camp, hidden among mountains north of Medell\u00edn, to tell the story of why they abandoned the peace deal. But well before the visit, the agreement was already fraying.The government, which had promised to sweep into rebel lands behind the FARC, bringing health and education services and potable water, is barely seen in much of the country. President Iv\u00e1n Duque of Colombia campaigned against the accords and now says he will revise them. One of the FARC peace negotiators was arrested for trafficking 10 tons of cocaine this year \u2014 while preparing to take a senate seat.And then there are groups like the one The Times visited, which present a particularly grave threat to the accords. There can be no peace in Colombia if the rebels rearm.Hundreds, if not thousands, of FARC fighters have resisted the deal. Insight Crime, a foundation that tracks organized crime groups, estimates that there may be up to 2,800 dissident FARC fighters \u2014 about 40 percent of the number that fought before the peace deal.One theme connected the fighters\u2019 narratives here in the FARC camp: While the government had promised them a new civilian life under the accords, they soon found themselves under threat by a range of paramilitary groups that rushed to take control of territory the rebels left behind. The dissidents asked The Times not to reveal the location of their camp out of fear the government or paramilitaries might attack.\u201cThey were shooting up my companions, and I decided to go up to the mountains,\u201d said Maicol. At least 75 former guerrillas have been killed since 2016, according to the political party founded by the demobilized guerrillas.While FARC leaders claimed they had handed all of their weapons to the United Nations, that was not entirely accurate. \u201cThere were still some weapons, old ones,\u201d said the commander known as the Poet, who like many of the rebels interviewed, uses his alias so as not to endanger his family.Perhaps as troubling as the resurgence of dissident groups are new alliances they are forming in these mountains. Some of the rebels now wear the insignia of the Virgilio Peralta Arenas Bloc, a mafia group accused by the authorities of killing civilians and trafficking drugs.The group once fought the FARC, but rebels said they now work together for mutual protection. It could one day mean that the rebels look more like an organized crime gang than the Marxist revolutionary army they were founded as in the early 1960s.\u201cThis is just part of the tragic history of Colombia \u2014 one form of violence morphing into another in the absence of a legitimate state,\u201d said Cynthia J. Arnson, the Latin America director at the Woodrow Wilson Center. \u201cPeace accords offer opportunities that can be grasped or not, and this one is being lost day by day.\u201dAmong the former FARC leaders now unaccounted for is Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, FARC\u2019s second-in-command, who went missing more than a month ago, leaving many fearing he will rearm.\u201cIf Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez leaves the peace process and joins the dissidents, then the entire process could fail,\u201d said Jeremy McDermott, the co-director of Insight Crime. He estimates that as many as 10 other commanders could take up arms again, enough to possibly create \u201cthe nucleus of a new guerrilla army.\u201dFormer rebel leaders are urging former fighters not to return to the fold. But many, like Juli\u00e1n Gallo Cubillos, a former commander who was known as Carlos Antonio Lozada, say they also understand their reasons for fighting given the dangers faced as civilians.\u201cWe have to respect their decision,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though we don\u2019t share it, and spent a half century going down that path and never achieved what we were looking for.\u201dThe Colombian government did not respond to requests for an interview. But on taking office last month, Guillermo Botero, Colombia\u2019s defense minister, said, \u201cThe dissident FARC have spread far more than what\u2019s been said and are in the process of growing.\u201dHe also offered a warning to dissidents.\u201cOur armed forces will recover their combative character,\u201d he said.The commander called the Poet joined what he calls the \u201cold FARC\u201d when he was 18, and spent the next 12 years rising through its ranks \u2014 until one day his party was ambushed and he was shot in the stomach. Photos of him and others in the camp were also published by Bloomberg, which also did not use full names.Disguised as civilians, his companions sneaked the Poet into a hospital in Medell\u00edn. He said that while recovering he was arrested on suspicion of being a guerrilla and sentenced to 26 months in jail.Once a free man, the Poet settled near the city of Ituango, leading civilian activist groups there.But when the peace accord was signed and guerrillas in the area withdrew to a disarmament camp, a chill fell over the region as fighters from Colombia\u2019s Clan del Golfo, the country\u2019s largest crime organization, took their place. The Clan threatened those they found in their way.This happened across the country. Hundreds of rural activists were killed, including former rebel fighters.The Poet decided to seek advice from a former comrade-in-arms: Rogelio Guerrero, who had joined the rebels in 1998. The two met at a disarmament camp near the town of Santa Luc\u00eda.Mr. Guerrero told a similar story. Paramilitaries had begun to threaten him, he said, and then last year a former commander living nearby as a civilian was shot dead. Mr. Guerrero feared he was next.After hours of conversation, the two decided to revive their old FARC unit, with Mr. Guerrero as the leader, they said.\u201cI felt proud once again,\u201d said the Poet. \u201cSuddenly I could see it all up and running again. It was just grand.\u201dReturning to the battlefield proved difficult. The FARC\u2019s central command structure, which had relayed messages and orders among groups, was gone. The new dissident group was alone.But they were finding recruits.Among them was Cuatro, a fighter who had spent a decade with the FARC. He disarmed last year, but civilian life did not suit him, he said. When he heard that a group of dissidents was forming, he sought them out.Among the first challenges for the group was protection. Cuatro knew of weapons caches. And Mr. Guerrero, the commander, decided to strike up alliances \u2014 even with old enemies like the Virgilio Peralta Arenas Bloc and the Clan del Golfo.\u201cWe just need territory without there being bloodshed,\u201d Mr. Guerrero said.The Virgilio Bloc agreed to work with them, he said, but the Clan del Golfo \u201cresponded to us with violence.\u201dThe rebels are also seeking out former FARC members who have returned to arms elsewhere \u2014 including commanders like Walter Patricio Arizala, known by his alias Guacho, who controls the cocaine trade on the border of Ecuador and this year kidnapped and killed three journalists. (The government is seeking Guacho, too, saying on Saturday that he had been wounded in an attack.)\u201cThe idea is to find ways to communicate, start meeting and operate like we did before,\u201d Cuatro said. \u201cTo unify all the country.\u201dLife in the new FARC resembles the old rebel routines in many ways.The day begins before sunrise. The fighters wake up in their hammocks, drink coffee and begin classes, discussing Karl Marx and Latin American revolutionaries like Cuba\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed. Every day or two, they break camp and march through the forest for hours.But this is a more impoverished rebellion than the previous one.The old FARC was financed from taxing the coca crop. The area this group now operates in has few plantations and no illegal gold mines. The fighters instead take food from nearby towns when it can be found.Many fighters do not have uniforms. Some sleep on the ground for lack of hammocks.\u201cYes, we go hungry, we suffer everything, but we are clear about what we need to do,\u201d said a fighter who uses the alias Piscino.The goals of the rebels also seem much reduced: They admit they will never overthrow the government and they do not want to fight the provincial police. They do intend to defend villages from other armed groups, they said, though since they are on the run, it is likely they will mostly defend themselves.The fate of this latest rebellion in Colombia is uncertain. It may grow, be crushed or simply fade away. The road ahead is likely to be rough \u2014 but no matter, said Piscino, who lost his left hand to a land mine.These hardships are necessary sacrifices, he said.\u201cThose who have armed again,\u2019\u2019 he added, \u201cwe are ready to die in this struggle.\u201dNicholas Casey reported from Medell\u00edn, and Federico Rios Escobar from a secret rebel base.Advertisement"}

But they are exposed, Mr. Lehmann argues, because Fannie and Freddie would most likely need a bailout of taxpayer money after a big earthquake.Only 13 percent of California homeowners have earthquake insurance, raising questions on whether earthquake insurance should be mandatory for mortgage holders.In a response to questions, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae emailed a statement that said while Fannie encourages borrowers to obtain earthquake insurance, it is \u201cunaffordable for many.\u201dIn the Bay Area, earthquake insurance for a home that would cost around $500,000 to rebuild has an annual premium of about $3,000 per year with a 5 percent deductible, according to the California Earthquake Authority.Mr. Lehmann says that he recognizes the high cost of insurance but that the government should study ways to make it more affordable \u2014 and to lower the risk to a national mortgage system still recovering from the financial crisis a decade ago.\u201cTaxpayers can no longer be asked to bear the risk that hundreds of billions of dollars could come crashing to the ground in the blink of an eye,\u201d Mr. Lehmann said in his study.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)You might recognize Marshawn Lynch\u2019s signature dreads (one of which was torn out during a game in 2014) or Beast Mode (his nickname and clothing line).Happy Tuesday indeed.California Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

{"Headline": "Trump Hits China With Tariffs on $200 Billion in Goods, Escalating Trade War", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, emboldened by America\u2019s economic strength and China\u2019s economic slowdown, escalated his trade war with Beijing on Monday, saying the United States would impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods and was prepared to tax all imports.Mr. Trump, in a statement released late Monday, showed no sign of backing down from the type of full-blown trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies that has rattled financial markets, saying he was prepared to \u201cimmediately\u201d place tariffs on another $267 billion worth of imports \u201cif China takes retaliatory action against our farmers or other industries.\u201dThe tariffs on $200 billion worth of products comes on top of the $50 billion worth already taxed earlier this year, meaning nearly half of all Chinese imports into the United States will soon face levies. The next wave of tariffs, which are scheduled to go into effect on Sept. 24, will start at 10 percent before climbing to 25 percent on Jan. 1. The timing of the staggered increase will partially reduce the toll of price increases for holiday shoppers buying Chinese imports in the coming months.\u201cFor months, we have urged China to change these unfair practices, and give fair and reciprocal treatment to American companies,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made, and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly. But, so far, China has been unwilling to change its practices.\u201dWhite House officials said on Monday that China could win relief from the tariffs by acceding to the administration\u2019s trade demands, including allowing American companies greater access to the China market and dropping its requirement that American companies hand over valuable technology to Chinese partners. Officials said the United States would only continue trade negotiations if the Chinese were \u201cserious\u201d about giving ground on those issues.Economists warn the tariffs could chip away at economic growth in the United States. Morgan Stanley researchers estimate that the latest round could reduce economic growth in the United States this year by 0.1 percentage points, adding to another 0.1 percentage-point drag from tariffs currently in place. And the effects are likely to grow if China retaliates again, as it has threatened to do.The administration did remove roughly 300 product lines \u2014 and some individual products \u2014 from the list after companies objected. Among the items dropped are smart watches, Bluetooth devices, bike helmets, plastic gloves, high chairs, play pens and certain chemicals. But, in some cases, partial product lines will be taxed while other parts are not. For example, high tech network routers and smart watches share a product line, but under the United States trade representative plan, the routers would be subject to tariffs while watches are not.\u201cIt will be a lot of money coming into the coffers of the United States of America. A lot of money coming in,\u201d Mr. Trump said during remarks at the White House on Monday. He added that the United States cannot tolerate the trade gap between what it exports to China and what it imports from that country.\u201cWe can\u2019t do that anymore,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s decision is a significant escalation of an already serious trade dispute \u2014 one with seemingly no end in sight. After months of failed trade talks, top officials from China and the United States were tentatively scheduled to talk later this month in Washington. But it is unclear whether Beijing will agree to come to Washington with the new tariffs set to go into effect.\u201cWe are open to talk if there are serious talks,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview on Monday.Mr. Trump also indicated he was willing to end the trade war \u2014 if China agreed to his demands. \u201cChina has had many opportunities to fully address our concerns,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cHopefully, this trade situation will be resolved, in the end, by myself and President Xi of China, for whom I have great respect and affection.\u201d\u201cThe Chinese are livid and drafting their own battle plan \u2014 they won\u2019t take this sitting down,\u201d said James Zimmerman, a longtime lawyer in Beijing and the former four-time chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce there.Trade analysts said Mr. Trump\u2019s approach risked further confrontation with the Chinese.\u201cWashington\u2019s view seems to be that tariffs and threats of more tariffs will soften up the Chinese and make them more amenable to negotiations,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell economist who specializes in trade issues. \u201cThe evidence that, in response to U.S. bullying tactics, China just stiffens its spine and strikes back with proportionate tariffs against U.S. imports has had no discernible effect on the Trump administration\u2019s take-no-prisoners approach to this rapidly escalating trade war.\u201dChina is expected to further retaliate against the United States, and top officials have warned that could include penalizing American companies that rely on Chinese components for phones, cars, televisions and other products. China\u2019s commerce ministry has said that it is ready to put similar tariffs on $60 billion a year of American goods in response to the threat from the United States. China has matched previous tariff moves dollar for dollar, but the number of American goods to tax is dwindling because, for many years, it has only imported about a quarter as much as it exports to the United States.Lou Jiwei, China\u2019s finance minister until his recent retirement and now a senior Communist Party adviser, delivered an unexpectedly strong threat to the United States in a lunch speech at the forum, which is organized by a government agency reporting directly to the cabinet. Mr. Lou said that, if necessary in the trade war, China could halt exports to the United States of components that are crucial to American companies\u2019 supply chains.Mr. Lou said that it would take years for American companies to find alternatives to China. \u201cTo take a step back, the United States can establish an alternative supply chain in a third country, but it takes time \u2014 what about the pain of three to five years? This is enough to cross a political cycle,\u201d he said.The battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.American businesses \u2014 which have warned that tariffs could hurt profits, force job cuts and, in some cases, destroy companies, said the taxes were going to hurt the United States more than the administration realized. The National Association of Chemical Distributors released a study this month that predicted nearly 28,000 chemical distributor and supplier jobs would be eliminated because of higher prices from the $200 billion round of tariffs.The tech industry, while spared on certain products, called the administration\u2019s approach \u201cmisguided\u201d and said it would hurt American consumers while doing little to change China\u2019s trade practices.\u201cToday\u2019s retaliatory tariffs are not an effective trade policy and may violate U.S. law,\u201d Gary Shapiro, chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, said in a statement. \u201cWe urge the administration to reconsider its misguided approach of increasing tariffs, as they are directly paid for by American companies and consumers.\u201dThe total wave of tariffs thus far has not been large enough to meaningfully affect consumer prices broadly across the economy \u2014 only narrowly, for certain products. Economists warn that the effects could grow noticeably larger if Mr. Trump follows through with his threat to subject nearly all Chinese imports to tariffs.Asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets in the morning, regarding the lack of an impact on prices across the economy from tariffs, Mr. Kudlow stuck with the president. \u201cWith respect to the impact of tariffs, we\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re following it. We don\u2019t see any problems so far.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see any reason to believe at the present time that the president\u2019s trade reforms are going to damage the economy.\u201dThe Trump administration has demanded steep cuts in Chinese tariffs and investment restrictions but has particularly focused on stopping the Chinese industrial policy initiative known as Made in China 2025.Chinese policymakers have long said that they are willing to cut tariffs in particular, but want concessions from the United States, such as curbs on the Commerce Department\u2019s ability to impose steep tariffs on imported goods that are government subsidized or are dumped below the cost of producing them. The United States has long refused, under the Obama administration and now under the Trump administration, contending that the American market is already so open that further concessions are not needed.As for Made in China 2025, Chinese officials dismiss its importance. \u201cWe do not think this is such an important strategy for us or our industries,\u201d said Wang Yiming, a vice president of the Chinese cabinet\u2019s Development Research Center.Chinese officials have expressed a willingness to get rid of the Made in China 2025 name, but they have been much more cautious about accepting limits on some of the key features of Chinese industrial policy, like enormous loans from state-owned banks at very low interest rates to favored industries.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Reversing Roe\u2019 Shows How Abortion Became Political", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor those who found the discussion of abortion at last week\u2019s Supreme Court hearings abstract or technical, the documentary \u201cReversing Roe,\u201d from Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, provides a clear and accessible overview of more than 50 years of the social and legal history of the issue in the United States.While there\u2019s no doubt that the film has been made from a pro-abortion-rights perspective, it gives voice to other points of view. It\u2019s less interested in rendering a verdict on the morality of abortion than it is in tracing the increasing politicization of the issue.After all, as Linda Greenhouse, a longtime Supreme Court writer for The New York Times, notes in the film, the court that handed down the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 included four Nixon appointees. (\u201cAbortion was not a partisan issue at that time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a medical problem. It was a social problem.\u201d)In 1967, as the governor of California, Ronald Reagan signed a bill allowing abortion under certain circumstances. George H. W. Bush is seen in a clip from 1980 opposing the idea of a constitutional amendment banning abortion. Contrast that with Texas today, where, as the state representative Donna Howard notes in the movie, a candidate\u2019s stance on abortion has become a critical aspect of campaigns for offices overseeing such far-flung areas as finance or agriculture.A film of this scope was obviously in the works well before Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, long seen as a critical swing vote on the issue, announced his retirement from the Supreme Court in June, a development mentioned near the end. The movie concludes, by necessity, without a clear read on what the future holds.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Greek Court Rules for Russia in Fight Over Cybercrime Suspect", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW \u2014 A Greek Supreme Court ruling Tuesday in a computer crime case may return to Russia, rather than extradite to the United States, a potential witness in the investigation into Russian hacking during the 2016 American presidential election.The warrant made no mention of election hacking. But Mr. Vinnik is accused of operating the exchange, BTC-e, at a time when, American prosecutors say, hackers used such funds to finance the electronic break-in at the Democratic National Committee and other targets. The practice was described in an indictment obtained by the special counsel investigating Russian election meddling, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Vinnik has been languishing in a Greek jail cell since July 2017, when the authorities arrested him as he was vacationing in a small beachside village in northern Greece. It was one of a series of American moves against Russians described as cybercriminals as they traveled.In Mr. Vinnik\u2019s case and in two others in Spain and the Czech Republic, the Russian authorities countered with competing extradition requests asserting that the Russians had also committed crimes at home, and that they had not come to light before they left the country.Far-fetched as it may seem, the legal maneuver has worked. And it put European governments in a tug of war between Moscow and Washington over Russians suspected of being computer criminals. Spain and the Czech Republic eventually extradited the suspects to the United States.The American authorities had been pressing Greece to hand over Mr. Vinnik, and Greece initially appeared willing to comply. In October, a three-member panel of judges in the northern city of Thessaloniki backed the American extradition request.But since then, the case has taken on a series of unusual twists.After Mr. Vinnik\u2019s lawyers filed an appeal to the Greek Supreme Court, France also demanded his extradition, claiming he had bilked around 100 French citizens by launching cyberattacks through his Bitcoin platform. In July, the judges in Thessaloniki reversed course and agreed to extradite him to France.That ruling dealt a fresh blow to the tenuous relations between Moscow and Athens, which has long courted Russia as an ally.Earlier that month, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had drawn Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s wrath by expelling two Russian diplomats and refusing entry to two others. He acted after Athens said it had uncovered evidence of a Kremlin-backed campaign to manipulate regional politics.Mr. Tsipras accused Russia of fomenting raucous protest rallies in Greece and Macedonia over a referendum in Macedonia to change the country\u2019s name, which would put it on a path to join NATO. Russia, which vigorously opposes an enlargement of the Western alliance, retaliated by expelling Greek diplomats, and accused Washington of \u201cputting pressure\u201d on Greece.When the Thessaloniki court then refused to hand Mr. Vinnik to Moscow, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry warned it would consider reprisals.Mr. Tsipras\u2019s government insisted it wanted to maintain friendly relations. And less than a month later, on July 30, the Thessaloniki court changed course again and accepted Russia\u2019s request that Mr. Vinnik be extradited to Russia.On Tuesday, the Greek Supreme Court issued a preliminary ruling backing the decision. The court is scheduled to issue a final ruling next week. Greece\u2019s justice minister will make the final decision on where Mr. Vinnik will be extradited.In an interview last year, Mr. Vinnik\u2019s Russian lawyer, Timofey S. Musatov, said his client\u2019s case in the United States was unrelated to electoral hacking. Russian prosecutors filed an extradition request on a fraud charge. Mr. Musatov could not be reached for comment Tuesday.In July, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers and revealed details of their operation, including the use of computer servers paid for \u201cusing cryptocurrency.\u201d At the time, Mr. Vinnik\u2019s BTC-e platform was the largest virtual currency exchange in Russia.In the cases in Spain and the Czech Republic, relatives and Russian lawyers said the American authorities were seeking access to the suspects for information about election hacking, though the Department of Justice made no such assertions in indictments.The Department of Justice sought Mr. Nikulin over accusations that in 2012 he hacked three American technology companies: LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring. The allegations against Mr. Levashov related to the spam promotion of penny stocks and pharmaceuticals.Liz Alderman reported from Paris.Advertisement"}

Putin of Russia, which was never a member of the court, withdrew his signature from the treaty when the court announced it would investigate Moscow\u2019s military involvement in Ukraine and possible war crimes in Georgia.\u201cThe court is vulnerable,\u201d said Carsten Stahn, an international law professor at Leiden University here. \u201cBolton is using that vulnerability to attack.\u201dMr. Bolton has fiercely opposed the court since its inception and his remarks represented a warning to the court over its apparent intention to investigate war crimes in Afghanistan, including the torture and abuse of prisoners by C.I.A. officers. Though Congress has documented many of those abuses, nobody has been prosecuted.He said the court\u2019s prosecutors were politically motivated and represented a threat to American sovereignty. And he said that, to many in Africa, the court has become a tool of modern day European colonialism. That argument stunned court supporters because it echoes the view of Sudan\u2019s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who is under indictment for genocide and has campaigned for African nations to withdraw from the court.\u201cThese are talking points for the leaders of Myanmar, the leaders of North Korea, the leaders of Russia,\u201d said David J. Scheffer, a former American ambassador who helped negotiate the Rome treaty during the Clinton administration. \u201cI\u2019m sure this speech was very welcome in Saudi Arabia. This was music to the ears of the Middle East.\u201dMr. Bolton\u2019s speech, and the new hard line it presages, raises fresh concerns about the endurance of the court without backing from the world\u2019s largest countries. China and India never supported it. Russia abandoned its veneer of an endorsement. The nations of the European Union are members and represent the court\u2019s biggest bloc of support.Lawyers and human-rights groups were alarmed, in particular, at the threat of prosecuting international lawyers and judges. \u201cComing from the host country of the United Nations, it is very dangerous to an international legal order,\u201d said William Pace, the head of the Coalition for the International Court, an organization set up to support the court. \u201cIt is undermining the fundamental pillars of an international order designed after World War II to prevent World War III.\u201dWhile European nations view organizations like the International Criminal Court as an important check on dictators, Mr. Bolton and other American conservatives see it as an affront. The United States, after all, shoulders many of the West\u2019s peacekeeping duties. Why then, Mr. Bolton and his allies argue, would the United States expose its citizens to oversight and second-guessing from nations that have benefited from a robust American military?But Christine Van den Wyngaert, who served as a judge on the court as well as the Yugoslavia tribunal, said Mr. Bolton\u2019s speech undermines even those efforts. She said it was troubling to see the United States \u201cwithdraw again in its position of isolation and even hostility towards international criminal justice.\u201dMatt Apuzzo reported from The Hague, and Marlise Simons from Paris.Follow Matt Apuzzo on Twitter: @mattapuzzoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Case for Impeaching Kavanaugh", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the Democrats win the House this fall, they can investigate the charges against him, should he be confirmed.Mr. Krotoszynski is a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law.Charles Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, seem determined to call a vote next week on the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, even in the face of this week\u2019s sexual assault allegations against him. Senate Republicans assume, correctly, that if they can hold the party line, his installation on the Supreme Court is a sure thing. This is certainly true \u2014 even if the Democratic caucus in the Senate holds firm against Mr. Kavanaugh, they simply lack the votes to block him. But the Republicans\u2019 calculus contains a significant error \u2014 namely, the assumption that if Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, that\u2019s the end of the discussion of whether he is fit to serve.The Constitution does provide that federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, \u201cshall hold their offices during good behavior.\u201d The settled understanding of this phrase is that so-called Article III judges enjoy lifetime tenure. But the Constitution also makes both judicial and executive officers subject to impeachment. And, as it happens, the House of Representatives holds \u201cthe sole power of impeachment.\u201d If the Democrats win back the House in November, they can exercise that power.Impeachment proceedings in the House are investigative in nature and come with a full panoply of quasi-judicial powers, including aids to investigations, such as the power to subpoena witnesses to compel them to appear and testify (subject, of course, to constitutional privileges, if applicable, such as the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against self-incrimination). If a simple majority of the House decided to proceed with impeachment, the House Judiciary Committee would be empowered to conduct a thorough and careful investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations that Christine Blasey Ford has made against Mr. Kavanaugh involving a drunken sexual assault when both were high school students in suburban Washington.Nor should the Democrats wait to formally take control of the House in January. The House Democratic leadership should pledge now that if they win a majority, they will conduct an impeachment investigation, to get to the truth. Doing so today would make clear to the Senate Republicans that if they rush to judgment, in the absence of a full and fair investigation, there will still be an investigation.Of course, even if the House impeached Judge Kavanaugh, it would still take a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and remove him from the court. But the Senate vote would surely have at least something to do with the merits of the House\u2019s case: If a full and fair investigation shows that Judge Kavanaugh has lied regarding the incident \u2014 he has denied it categorically and says nothing even remotely like it ever occurred \u2014 Republican senators may find it hard to vote no in the #MeToo era. It would be a terrible blow to the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, of course, but this is the risk that Senators McConnell and Grassley seem willing to take.Attending a strategy session as a White House staff member is not a crime. Lying under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee, on the other hand, is. Perjury would be a perfectly justifiable, and constitutional, basis for impeachment. An important caveat: Congress must take care to maintain the constitutional convention that has existed since the failed impeachment of Justice Chase. Federal judges, including members of the Supreme Court, should not be impeached based on their judicial rulings or philosophy. Accordingly, if the House were to initiate impeachment proceedings against Justice Kavanaugh in 2019, such proceedings should be strictly limited to questions associated with his alleged intentional and deliberate efforts to mislead the Senate about his character and fitness to serve.We do not know the truth of the troubling allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. But, before someone is confirmed to the Supreme Court, good faith efforts to discover the truth should be made. And if the Senate won\u2019t conduct a credible investigation now, the House should offer its assistance next year.Ronald J. Krotoszynski Jr. is a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Photographing Places Blessed by Nature and Contested by Man", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLENSSebastian Villegas trekked over 120 miles by boat, mule and foot through mountain grasslands and muddy jungles to photograph the lives of people who had been cut off from the rest of Colombia for years. Decades of armed conflict between the Colombian government and rebel groups rendered vast swaths of the country\u2019s northwest off-limits to interlopers, who risked being kidnapped, or worse. Those perils have largely vanished after peace accords with the main rebel group, the FARC, removed man-made dangers. But this remote area \u2014 thick with vegetation and resources \u2014 still has many natural obstacles.Undaunted, Sebastian Villegas trekked over 120 miles by boat, mule and foot through mountain grasslands and muddy jungles to photograph the lives of people who had been cut off from the rest of the country for years. He found a region where the official state has long kept its distance, and where people eked out a living not just through agriculture, but also through less-sustainable, extractive means, like artisanal gold mining or logging for fine woods.The result of his arduous journey is \u201cEl Resto es Selva,\u201d or \u201cThe Rest is Jungle,\u201d a book and exhibit that looks at these places blessed by nature and contested by man. \u201cThere has to be some reciprocity,\u201d said Mr. Villegas, who was selected for the project through a competition financed by the World Bank administered initiative Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and conducted by Colombia\u2019s Ministry of Environment and the NGOs Fondo Accion and Puente Consultorias. \u201cWe take from them, but we don\u2019t replace. That\u2019s where I started on the project, looking at how we use up natural resources, but never go to these territories. When you buy a camera or cellphone, you don\u2019t know where the materials come from. We have the object, but not the knowledge of how we extract the materials.\u201d\u201cThese communities, which are isolated, have been through years of conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of minerals, oil, bananas. These were all areas affected by the war. But you could feel it change with the peace process. They were opening up, and civilians could enter to tell their stories.\u201dWhile there is no more armed conflict, danger remains. Recently, four police officers were kidnapped in the region, and daily life remains a struggle. Children have their education cut short in order to go to work and help their families. The discovery of gold in one location 13 years ago led to a local rush of sorts, and Mr. Villegas\u2019s photos show the deleterious impact of contaminated water and a landscape of felled trees.With the project completed, some 3,000 books have been given to libraries, NGOs and members of the diplomatic community, Mr. Villegas said. There have also been exhibits and workshops in Bogot\u00e1. But his goal is to take the photos back to the source, printing them on cloth that can be hung from the trees in remote villages.\u201cWe want to bring it to the people who are in the book,\u201d he said. \u201cThey gave me access to their lives and stories. The photographer has a great responsibility. You can\u2019t just take. You have to be responsible. It\u2019s a question of ethics.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Spain to Exhume Franco From Monument He Had Built", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe vote paves the way for the body to be moved before the end of the year, but it will not end disagreements about Franco\u2019s place in history, nor will it resolve the question of what to do with his burial site, known as the Valley of the Fallen.Franco had the site built, in part with forced labor, to honor those who \u201cfell for God and Spain\u201d in the Spanish Civil War, and it became one of Europe\u2019s largest mass graves, with the remains of at least 33,000 people. Most had fought for Franco in the war, which lasted from 1936 to 1939, but the monument also contains the bones of many of his Republican opponents, dumped there in anonymity.\u201cThere is neither respect, nor honor, nor justice, nor peace, nor concord as long as the remains of Franco are kept in the same place as the victims,\u201d Carmen Calvo, the deputy prime minister, said in Parliament before the vote. \u201cA dictator cannot be exalted: that is the summary of this debate.\u201dParliament approved the exhumation, 172 to 2, with 164 abstentions, and the two who voted against were reported to have done so in error. The two main center-right opposition parties refused to take part in the vote, and the conservative Popular Party plans to appeal the decision before the Constitutional Court, arguing that Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez unjustifiably fast-tracked the measure.Mr. S\u00e1nchez, a Socialist, promised the exhumation soon after becoming prime minister in early June, having ousted Mariano Rajoy and his Popular Party from power in an unexpected vote of no confidence in Parliament. It is not clear where Franco\u2019s body would be reburied.On the other hand, a few hundred people have gathered weekly in central Madrid to urge the new government to give greater recognition to the victims of Franco, in accordance with the Law of Historical Memory that was approved in 2007, under a previous Socialist government.Mr. S\u00e1nchez has promised to revive the law, which had been deprived of state funding under Mr. Rajoy\u2019s conservative government. One of the measure\u2019s main goals is to help finance the opening of more than 2,000 mass graves across Spain, which date from the civil war.Mr. S\u00e1nchez leads a fragile government that controls only a quarter of the seats in Parliament, but on Thursday he received support for the exhumation from the leftist party Podemos, as well as the Basque and Catalan nationalist lawmakers who helped him replace Mr. Rajoy in June.In fact, a Catalan party, Esquerra Republicana, wants the Socialist government to go further and annul the court rulings of Franco\u2019s regime, many of which were decided by military tribunals. The Catalans particularly care about restoring the name of Llu\u00eds Companys, the Republican leader of Catalonia, who fled Spain at the end of the civil war. The German Gestapo captured him in France and returned him to Barcelona, where he was sentenced to death and killed by a firing squad in 1940.Shortly after winning the civil war, Franco ordered the construction of the immense basilica of the Valley of the Fallen to be carved into a mountainside northwest of Madrid. Construction lasted 18 years, with Republican prisoners among the labor force. The basilica is now run by Benedictine priests who live in an adjacent abbey.After taking office, Mr. S\u00e1nchez met with Cardinal Ricardo Bl\u00e1zquez, who leads the conference of Spanish bishops, to ensure that the Church would stay on the sidelines of the debate over Franco\u2019s remains. But relatives of Franco have opposed the exhumation and could still appeal Thursday\u2019s decision before the national court.Those opposed to moving Franco\u2019s remains say that he and his history are no longer on the agenda for most Spaniards, and they accuse Mr. S\u00e1nchez of using the exhumation question to reinforce his left-wing leadership and credentials.In a nonbinding vote in Parliament last year, the Ciudadanos party backed the idea of moving Franco\u2019s corpse to a different burial site. But since Mr. S\u00e1nchez took office, the party has changed tack, claiming that Mr. S\u00e1nchez is unnecessarily reopening old wounds. Lawmakers of the party abstained in the vote Thursday.Franco died in 1975, which means that most Spaniards are too young to remember his regime, let alone the civil war. But Spain has stood out in European politics recently for not having a far-right party make significant headway in elections.Mr. Rivera of Ciudadanos suggested that Franco\u2019s burial site could be turned into a national cemetery, \u201clike that in Arlington\u201d in Virginia.But Joan B. Culla, a Catalan historian, said in an interview that the Valley of the Fallen could not be compared with Auschwitz or Arlington. He suggested the site could be transformed into a memorial resembling the giant Douaumont ossuary at Verdun, where the French and the Germans fought one of the bloodiest battles of World War I.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to remove Franco\u2019s bones,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite another to agree on what to do about the megalomaniac mausoleum that he built to his own victory and glory.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "AnchorFree, Maker of a Top Online Privacy App, Raises $295 Million", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the recent attention on digital privacy, venture capital investors have mostly stayed away from companies that offer virtual private networks, which allow users to hide their online tracks.Now there is one big exception.AnchorFree, the maker of Hotspot Shield, one of the oldest VPN apps, said Wednesday that it had raised $295 million. The round brings AnchorFree\u2019s total funding to $358 million, far outpacing any of its competitors.The investment in AnchorFree suggests that the VPN category is becoming more mainstream. Investors previously avoided it in part because relatively few users have adopted the technology. In addition, some of the networks are not as secure as their companies claim.But after events like the Equifax hack, the repeal of net neutrality rules and Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, downloads of Hotspot Shield spiked.It\u2019s a little perplexing, since a VPN would not have protected people affected by any of those events. David Gorodyansky, the founder and chief executive of AnchorFree, said they had pushed typical consumers to take privacy and security more seriously.Hotspot Shield has been downloaded 650 million times. Lately, it has averaged 250,000 downloads a day. For most of the summer, it has been the top-grossing app in its category in the Apple App Store, and in the top 50 over all, according to the app-ranking site App Annie. AnchorFree\u2019s other apps, Betternet and HexaTech, ranked high on the App Store charts this week, as well as competing VPN apps owned by Norton, McAfee and a variety of obscure companies.\u201cTwo years ago, there were no privacy or security apps in the top 100,\u201d Mr. Gorodyansky said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a massive shift.\u201dVirtual private network technology is open-sourced, or freely available to use, making it easy for anyone to enter the market. There are hundreds of VPN apps. Some, including AnchorFree, have built additional technology on top of the open-source software.Some free services log users\u2019 browsing data and sell it or turn it over to governments when asked. Others say they are based in the United States or the Cayman Islands but actually operate out of countries with censorious governments.Still others obscure what a VPN can actually protect people from.\u201cThey are marketing themselves as \u2018sprinkle our security or privacy dust on your device and suddenly it will become private and secure,\u2019\u201d said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights.AnchorFree made for an attractive venture investment because the technology it has built on top of the open-sourced VPN software makes it faster than other VPN services, said Sujay Jaswa, a partner at WndrCo, the investment firm that led the latest round of financing. Many of AnchorFree\u2019s competitors license its technology, including Bitdefender, Dashlane, Kaspersky and McAfee.AnchorFree\u2019s tech is also prevalent in smartphones and the products of telecommunications companies. Samsung Galaxy phones come loaded with AnchorFree\u2019s VPN software; Verizon and Telef\u00f3nica license it as well. The companies split revenue earned from anyone who becomes a paying customer.The company said it has been profitable since 2010. It has just 110 employees; 80 are engineers, and it has no salespeople. Hotspot Shield is free, but a small percentage of users pay a monthly fee for extra features, including faster internet speeds, the ability choose their internet server, and added protection from phishing, malware and spam. The company recently added a product specifically for businesses.In 2017, the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that promotes digital rights, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate AnchorFree and Hotspot Shield, accusing the company of deceptively redirecting users to certain websites and sharing data.AnchorFree, which has denied the allegations, declined to comment on the investigation. But after the criticism, the company rewrote its terms of service, to avoid legalese, and AnchorFree began to release transparency reports. The first one, issued in November, showed the company received 81 requests for user data from government agencies in the first 10 months of 2017 and 79 in 2016. AnchorFree complied with none of the requests.Hotspot Shield does not log any of its users\u2019 activity, Mr. Gorodyansky said. As a result, the company could not provide the data to the government.\u201cOur conversations are super simple,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no data. End of story.\u201dThe latest round of funding comes from WndrCo along with Accel Partners, 8VC, SignalFire and Green Bay Ventures. AnchorFree would not disclose its valuation or revenue.AnchorFree said it would use the capital to expand into related areas, such as security for internet-connected devices (say, smart doorbells or thermostats). The company will also pursue acquisitions, potentially of companies with sales teams in place.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the AnchorFree competitors that licenses its technology. It is McAfee, not TunnelBear, a VPN service that McAfee acquired this year.Advertisement"}

The Federal Election Commission says doing so doesn\u2019t break any rules.That is according to Myles Martin, a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, who said the salient question was whether a mailing contains a disclaimer saying that it came from a political campaign. And this one did.Aside from that, he said in an email, \u201cthe F.E.C.\u2019s regulations don\u2019t speak to how candidates may choose to word particular solicitations to potential contributors.\u201dConfusion arises not just from the letter itself but from the envelope it arrives in.And the return address? It says the \u201cofficial summons\u201d has come from Senator Ted Cruz.The letter inside the envelope is more clearly part of a fund-raising effort. The Cruz campaign logo appears at the top of the letter and recipients are given the option to donate a preselected amount of money or to write in their own denominations.The letter echoes its envelope, though, in its use of language \u2014 like \u201ccampaign summons\u201d and \u201cconservative affirmation\u201d \u2014 that sounds more legal than colloquial.Since Saturday, Twitter users in two Texas counties \u2014 Travis County, where Austin is located, and Harris County, which is home to Houston \u2014 have posted pictures of the summons-like letters online.In May, the Cruz campaign told The Express-News in a statement that it had sent \u201cmore than 50,000\u201d of the fund-raising letters to \u201clikely supporters\u201d in the San Antonio area alone. It said the mailings were \u201cboth effective and critical to identifying and engaging our supporters.\u201dMr. Martin, at the F.E.C., said he could not comment on whether anyone had complained about the mailers because \u201cthe Federal Election Campaign Act requires that matters before the commission be kept confidential until they are resolved.\u201dThe impact of eyebrow-raising campaign mailings can be difficult to gauge.The letter said the recipient had a record of voting infrequently, which is not a violation, and included the names of the recipient and their neighbors alongside a \u201cscore\u201d based on their turnout record. It said they could improve their score by voting in the caucuses and warned that \u201ca follow-up notice may be issued\u201d after the caucuses were finished.They said mailings like the one Mr. Cruz sent in 2016 are \u201can order of magnitude more effective\u201d than other political mailings because they threaten to publicly shame people for not voting. But the fund-raising letter sent by the Cruz campaign in recent weeks does not do that.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of a newspaper. It is The San Antonio Express-News, not the News-Express.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Germany, a Social Democrat Who Welcomes Trump\u2019s Bluster", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Saturday ProfileBERLIN \u2014 Olaf Scholz took over as Germany\u2019s finance minister in March. Since then, President Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on German cars, called Europe a \u201cfoe\u201d and dispatched an ambassador to Berlin who takes selfies with far-right politicians eager to bring down the German government.But in an interview in his sparsely decorated fourth-floor office in the finance ministry, once the headquarters of the Nazi Luftwaffe, Mr. Scholz professed to be \u201crelaxed.\u201dThere is nothing like a bit of venom from the White House to unite Europe\u2019s \u201cprogressive liberal center,\u201d says the man who is Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s No. 2.\u201cEurope won\u2019t be pushed around,\u201d Mr. Scholz said, smiling serenely. \u201cThe present U.S. administration, if you will, has become a catalyst for an ever-closer European integration process.\u201dShort, balding and poker-faced, Mr. Scholz is by default the leading voice of social democracy in Europe, a movement in crisis trying to prove its relevance in the age of populism. He was a fiery young socialist in the 1970s who gradually mellowed into a post-ideological centrist. First defending workers as a labor lawyer, then defending labor-market reforms to workers and now co-governing with a conservative Chancellor, Mr. Scholz has traveled a journey that in many ways tracks that of his ailing Social Democratic Party.But while support for the Social Democrats is at a postwar low, Mr. Scholz has quietly risen to become one of Germany\u2019s most popular politicians. \u201cLiberal, but not stupid,\u201d is how he once described himself.To his fans, Mr. Scholz is a voice of calm and confidence, a pragmatist from Germany\u2019s taciturn north who represents the elusive silent majority.To his critics, he is overly relaxed about the challenges facing Europe and Germany in 2018 and lacks bold ideas to match his optimism.Last year, he published a book about Germany entitled \u201cLand of Hope.\u201d Six months later, the far-right Alternative for Germany had become the largest opposition party in the German Parliament. But Mr. Scholz\u2019s mantra is unchanged: Stick to social democratic principles and moderation instead of trying to beat the populists at their own game.\u201cWe have this problem with right-wing populism in Europe and in other parts of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we mustn\u2019t act as if that was the biggest problem we have. In fact, we are growing closer together.\u201dThe answer was typical for a man Germans have long known as the \u201cScholz-o-mat,\u201d a technocrat and veteran politician who can seem not just utterly unflappable but almost robotically on message.Italy\u2019s populist wobbles?\u201cNew governments come and go, we mustn\u2019t lose our cool.\u201dBrexit?\u201cVery regrettable,\u201d but \u201cFrankfurt will gain as a financial hub.\u201dA possible trade war with the United States?\u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll find a solution.\u201dWhat about Alternative for Germany snapping at the heels of his own shrinking party and in some polls overtaking it?\u201cI believe the Social Democrats can be the strongest party at the next election,\u201d Mr. Scholz insisted, though at this point his smile looked a little more forced.On Europe, too, he is adamant that the answer to growing public disenchantment with Europe\u2019s institutions is not less Europe, but more. He has scheduled a series of \u201ccitizens\u2019 office hours\u201d in coming months, to discuss ordinary Germans\u2019 concerns about the European Union.Mr. Scholz\u2019 first trip after taking office in March was to Paris \u2014 he was there so fast he beat even his boss, Ms. Merkel. He supports French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s ambition to revamp Europe with a joint strike force, common rules on migration and asylum, strong external borders and a European foreign policy unencumbered by the need for unanimous decision-making by its 28 member states. Mr. Scholz wants to introduce simple majority voting so Europe can play a more decisive role on the geopolitical stage.\u201cEurope has been too apolitical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always focused on economics and trade. Citizens want more politics, they want a Europe that shows what it can do, whether that\u2019s on economics or on foreign policy.\u201dBut when it comes to Mr. Macron\u2019s most ambitious proposals \u2014 a European finance minister and budget \u2014 Mr. Scholz toes the traditional German line that, for now at least, budgetary prudence takes precedence over lofty political goals.\u201cA European finance minister is more of a long-term goal,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, we should not get caught up in this,\u201d he said, and instead should focus on \u201creforming the banking and finance sector and securing the future stability of the eurozone in order to be prepared for coming financial crises.\u201dBut so far there is scant evidence that Mr. Scholz represents a stark break from Mr. Sch\u00e4uble\u2019s stance. As Mr. Scholz has put it: \u201cA German finance minister is a German finance minister.\u201dAt home, despite a booming economy and record-low unemployment, many Germans are angry about stagnant salaries and a feeling that a tiny elite has profited the most from economic growth. Mr. Scholz, the middle-class son of a businessman and married to another politician, knows that he is part of that perceived elite.Populism is a problem, he conceded. In Germany, the resentments that most recently fed far-right protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz have not been fully understood.\u201cThere is something going on, and not just here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the wealthy nations, people are in a bad mood, despite the good economic numbers.\u201dHe added: \u201cThere used to be a promise that if you worked hard and your employer was doing well you would get a share. That promise is in danger.\u201dRestoring it, he said, \u201cis the social democratic project.\u201dOne direct way to address the sense of insecurity and the fear of the future that are relentlessly fueled and exploited by populists, he said, is to increase pensions and ensure decent wages.In person, Mr. Scholz oozes a distinctly northern German temperament, betraying few emotions and only occasionally allowing himself a quiet chuckle. He spent most of his life in Hamburg, Germany\u2019s second city, where he liked to go rowing in the mornings and served as mayor until March this year.As mayor, Mr. Scholz made a point of writing a personal letter to every migrant who had lived in the city for eight years, encouraging them to apply for German citizenship and offering to meet them in person. Six times a year, he would attend the citizenship ceremonies in city hall, which he called \u201ca very moving experience.\u201dIt is that experience, too, that makes him more sanguine about Germany\u2019s ability to weather the challenges brought on by the arrival of more than a million migrants since 2015, and the populist backlash that has followed.\u201cGerman democracy is stable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has grown over many decades and is now deeply rooted.\u201dAs for populism elsewhere, governments come and go, Mr. Scholz says, but Germany\u2019s links to the United States \u2014 based on what he called \u201ca shared democratic tradition of civil rights and liberal democracy\u201d \u2014 run deeper.But, he said, his cryptic smile back in full force, \u201cEurope is sizable.\u201d And as if to remind those paying attention on the other side of the Atlantic, he added: \u201cEurope\u2019s G.D.P. is bigger than that of the United States.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "How a Ukrainian Hairdresser Became a Front for Paul Manafort", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 At first glance, what happened to Yevgeny G. Kaseyev hardly seems like misfortune.Without his knowledge, he says, unknown individuals set up multiple companies in his name and deposited tens of millions of dollars into those companies\u2019 bank accounts.\u201cSometimes it seems fun,\u201d Mr. Kaseyev, a 34-year-old hairdresser, said with a shrug during an interview. \u201cI\u2019m a secret millionaire.\u201dUntil the authorities came calling, that is, seeking $30 million in back taxes.One of the people who did business with a company opened under Mr. Kaseyev\u2019s stolen identity didn\u2019t mean anything to him. But the name certainly caught the eye of investigators in the United States: Paul J. Manafort.Mr. Manafort, who worked for a decade as a political consultant in Ukraine before becoming chairman of the Trump campaign in 2016, made a deal worth hundreds of thousands of dollars with the shell company under the hairdresser\u2019s name. It was called Neocom Systems Limited, according to a Ukrainian lawmaker.Looking into tax evasion by Mr. Manafort, Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators found a web of offshore companies, some of which had directors who, like Mr. Kaseyev, did not even know their identities were being used.There is nothing new about Mr. Manafort\u2019s use of shell companies to hide and launder money. Nor is it surprising that Mr. Manafort should seek to use the scheme of fake directors, say analysts of Ukrainian corruption. It is a common form of subterfuge in former Soviet states, though hardly unique to them.But the role \u2014 and sometimes the plight \u2014 of the people whose identities were used has gone mostly unnoticed.\u201cIt\u2019s a frequent problem,\u201d Daria Kalenyuk, chief of the Anticorruption Action Center here, said of the directors, who stand to take the fall if prosecutors investigate.Sometimes the directors are lawyers or victims of identity theft, she said. But usually \u201cit\u2019s people who are either alcoholics or in poor health, and who simply sell their passports for about $20.\u201dOne of the risks to this scheme is that the fake directors might try to claim the millions held in their names. But Ms. Kalenyuk could not recall one instance of such a claim.\u201cYou need to have some knowledge and education to know how to do that,\u201d she said, in the tax havens like Cyprus or the British Virgin Islands, where such companies are typically established.\u201cUsually, they don\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd even if they did, it\u2019s a risky business to take over a company from a powerful businessman engaged in corruption.\u201dThe companies set up with Mr. Kaseyev\u2019s identity had bland names like April Limited and Neocom Systems Limited. For example, in 2009, Mr. Manafort signed an invoice for $750,000 addressed to Mr. Kaseyev as director of Neocom Systems.Mr. Kaseyev said he first became aware of his unwitting role in the creation of at least three Ukrainian front companies a decade ago, when the tax police contacted him in 2007 about his purported $30 million tax liability at Regional Insurance Union, a company he had never heard of. His passport had been stolen in a burglary a year earlier.The scale of unpaid taxes, he said, suggested that there were larger sums moving through the company.A slender, soft-spoken young man then just getting his start as a beautician, and hence unlikely to have amassed such wealth, Mr. Kaseyev said he was able to quickly convince the police of the identity theft. Yet the companies continued to be used in deals, and one, April Limited, still appears to be open for business, a corporate registry shows.Some homeless men have achieved a measure of fame among activists who track corruption in the former Soviet states because they pop up so often at the head of multimillion dollar companies.One man identified in the Ukrainian media as a homeless Latvian named Erik Vanagels has been listed as the owner of hundreds of companies in Britain, Cyprus, Ireland, New Zealand, Panama and elsewhere. Companies in the network also helped finance the private zoo and sprawling estate of the former Ukrainian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was the main client of Mr. Manafort.Mr. Manafort\u2019s finances also intersected with companies of Mr. Vanagels and another Latvian whose name was used as a director, Stan Gorin. Among the murky transactions these companies engaged in was an $18 million deal to sell Ukrainian cable television assets to a partnership called Pericles that was put together by Mr. Manafort and financed by a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska, according to a Cayman Islands lawsuit and Cypriot corporate records.Milltown Corporate Services, a front company in Mr. Gorin\u2019s name, for a time controlled the television assets.In another notable case, the police in Ukraine last year questioned a barefoot man, Arkady Kashkin, who during interrogation accepted their offer of slices of pizza. He turned out to be named as a director of one of several related companies that had bought $1.5 billion in Ukrainian bonds, according to court records.The invoice had been left in the Kiev office of Mr. Manafort\u2019s political consulting business, Davis Manafort International. In the invoice, Mr. Kaseyev\u2019s name is transliterated into English as Evgeniy Kaseev.Mr. Leshchenko, the Ukranian lawmaker, publicized the find after first providing the originals to the F.B.I. Mr. Leshchenko said that the company was a front and that Mr. Kaseyev had no control over its operations.This was not the first time Neocom Systems had surfaced in a corruption investigation. In a 2012 money laundering and stock fraud case in Kyrgyzstan, the country\u2019s central bank listed it as a shell company used for payments by Asia Universal Bank, which was seized by Kyrgyz officials amid money laundering allegations.It is not clear how much money, in total, passed through that company or through others opened in Mr. Kaseyev\u2019s name.He now spends his days plying his trade at a beauty salon in Kiev for the equivalent of about $8 a haircut. He is also a certified colorist.The best part of his day, he said, comes from seeing the new \u201csense of self-confidence\u201d in his clients as they leave his chair, examining their fresh new look.Iuliia Mendel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "He Led a Group of Disloyal New York Democrats. Will It Cost Him His Seat?", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMoney and power are no strangers to Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, so it should be no surprise that with his political life on the line, he is aggressively deploying both.Mr. Klein, who led the Independent Democratic Conference, now defunct, is blanketing his primary race with money, turning the contest into New York\u2019s most expensive state legislative race this cycle.The stakes are high: The I.D.C. was a group of breakaway Democrats that traded party loyalty for power, working with Senate Republicans to help them control the chamber. In exchange, Mr. Klein and his fellow members secured lucrative appointments and were seen as a potential swing-vote bloc.But some voters \u2014 especially those who belong to President Trump resistance groups \u2014 have not forgiven the eight I.D.C. members, especially Mr. Klein. They have backed his opponent, Alessandra Biaggi, a lawyer in Pelham who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign and later in the office of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\u2019s counsel.Mr. Klein has responded, spending $2.4 million in the race; a third of that was spent in the last three weeks of August alone.The money has allowed Mr. Klein to air television ads and carpet the 34th Senate District, which covers parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, with mailers. Two of them suggested that former President Barack Obama and Mr. Cuomo had endorsed his candidacy; neither has done so.Ms. Biaggi has relied on mailers, digital-media advertising, phone calls, postcard writing and door-to-door canvassing, aided by 500 volunteers, whom she called \u201cthe life source\u201d of the campaign.\u201cVoters are starting to understand what is going on,\u201d Ms. Biaggi, 32, said in a phone interview. \u201cI will go to someone\u2019s door and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, didn\u2019t he do that thing with the Republicans?\u2019\u201dBut whether typical voters comprehend the arcane \u2014 some might say Machiavellian \u2014 deal that Mr. Klein engineered with Republicans remains to be seen.\u201cThe average voter is not aware of the I.D.C., at least not in any detail,\u201d said George Picoulas, a lecturer in political science at Pace University. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the average voter who turns out in primaries like this. It\u2019s the activist base.\u201dIn a statement, Mr. Klein\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Barbara Brancaccio, said he \u201chas shown up and delivered for Bronx and Westchester residents.\u201d She accused Ms. Biaggi of waging \u201ca civil war among Democrats across the state.\u201dMany Democrats in the district say they became aware of the I.D.C. only after the election of President Trump.\u201cIt became clear that one of the biggest problems at the state level was this thing called the I.D.C.,\u201d said Rebecca Lish, an actor and mother of two who lives in Riverdale. \u201cI realized that I had been voting for the head of the I.D.C. over and over again. You see this guy in the district and he has on a blue tie. But then he goes up to Albany and he switches to a red tie.\u201d\u201cI believe Alessandra Biaggi will be a stronger advocate for the issues that matter to me and my family,\u201d said Ms. Lish, pointing to stalled bills dealing with abortion rights, single-payer health care and immigrant protections, among other things.Mr. Klein does have his ardent supporters, particularly residents like Monique Johnson, whom he has helped in small but meaningful ways. As president of the Throggs Neck Resident Council, she is the liaison between the 1,700 residents of a public housing complex in the Bronx and the city\u2019s Housing Authority.In a phone interview, Ms. Johnson said Mr. Klein had been generous with his time and discretionary dollars: calling bingo numbers; running meetings about heat and hot water; donating school supplies and holiday toys; helping children get tested for lead exposure; and securing $1.5 million to overhaul a ball field.\u201cEverything that I do in this development, he is a part of, and I mean that literally,\u201d Ms. Johnson said.Despite her traction with progressive groups, Ms. Biaggi has struggled to amass a significant fraction of Mr. Klein\u2019s war chest. According to state election filings, she has raised $445,000 to his $1.9 million. (He has also spent money left over from previous campaigns.)As in most elections, outcomes will hinge on turnout. Primaries usually yield low turnouts, which tends to favor incumbents. But this year could be different.\u201cIn the Trump era, the progressives are more energized,\u201d said Mr. Picoulas, the Pace University lecturer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the turnout in this year\u2019s primary is higher than four years ago.\u201dAll of the former I.D.C. members are facing primary challenges. In the 13th District in Queens, Jessica Ramos, a former aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio, is opposing Senator Jose R. Peralta. In central Brooklyn\u2019s 20th District, Senator Jesse Hamilton is facing a challenge from Zellnor Myrie, a lawyer and housing advocate.Elsewhere in New York City, Jasmine Robinson, a legal secretary and community activist, is taking on Senator Diane J. Savino in the 23rd District, which covers parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn. The former city comptroller, John C. Liu, is challenging Senator Tony Avella in the 11th District in Queens, and Senator Marisol Alcantara is defending her seat against Robert Jackson, a former city councilman, in the 31st District in western Manhattan.Outside the city, Senator David Carlucci, whose 38th District includes parts of Rockland and Westchester Counties, is fending off an insurgent campaign by Julie Goldberg, a librarian and writer. In upstate New York, Rachel May, who directs sustainability education at Syracuse University, is trying to unseat Senator David Valesky in the 53rd district.Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Banks Won\u2019t Stop Money Laundering, What Can the Government Do?", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchThe continual failure to stop the illicit transactions exposed many weaknesses in Danske\u2019s money laundering controls. The report, though, exonerated the bank\u2019s chief executive, Thomas Borgen, and the chairman of its board of directors, Ole Andersen, of mismanagement and other failures. Nevertheless, Mr. Borgen resigned after the release of the report, in part because he was responsible for the Estonian branch before taking over the top spot.Danske is certainly not the first major bank to have money laundering or other illegal transactions flourish for years, seemingly beyond the purview of top management.So far, it seems, the cost of systematic violations has been a hefty fine, but no one in management pays much of a price, if any. That was certainly the takeaway from the financial crisis when prosecutors, for the most part, passed on pursuing cases against individuals and imposed heavy penalties on the banks.Will Danske Bank or any of its executives face serious consequences for allowing almost unprecedented money laundering? The short answer looks like no.The bank could be barred from the American financial system if it is designated as a \u201cprimary money laundering concern.\u201d Section 311 of the Patriot Act, adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, authorizes the Treasury Department to take \u201cspecial measures\u201d against foreign banks that do not adequately address money laundering and terrorist financing problems.The chance that Danske could face similar action appears to be small. The bank is the largest in Denmark, with 2.7 million customers and 20,000 employees, and has offered to cooperate with the investigations. Danske is likely \u201ctoo big to jail,\u201d meaning the potential job losses and customer disruptions would be so great that the United States would not take steps to put it out of business.Whether we will see anyone at the bank charged with misconduct is another issue. Senior executives often are able to insulate themselves from day-to-day decisions, so finding their fingerprints on anything that might lead to criminal charges seems unlikely.If the penalties assessed against HSBC and BNP Paribas are any indication, Danske is probably facing the prospect of paying billions of dollars to settle the investigations.The larger question is why banks continue to allow these types of violations, and whether there is an effective means to deter them. Large fines pinch the bottom line, but like an expensive speeding ticket, they can be easily put in the past as a one-time transgression.And given that customers are willing to pay almost any cost to move their money secretly, the lure of profits can overcome even the strongest directives to comply with the law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Paying for a Health Problem as a Whole, Not Piece by Piece, Save Medicare Money?", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareA program called bundled payments appears promising, but we need more rigorous evaluations. Among the standard complaints about the American health care system is that care is expensive and wasteful. These two problems are related, and to address them, Medicare has new ways to pay for care.Until recently, Medicare paid for each health care service and reimbursed each health care organization separately. It didn\u2019t matter if tests were duplicated or if a more efficient way of delivering care was available \u2014 as long as doctors and organizations were paid for what they did, they just kept providing care the way they always had.But ordinary people do not think this way. We focus on solving our health problem, not which \u2014 or how many \u2014 discrete health care services might address it. New Medicare programs are devised to more closely align how care is paid for with what we want that care to achieve.One of these programs is known as bundled payments. Instead of paying separately for every health care service associated with a medical event, you pay (or Medicare pays, in this case) one price for the entire episode. If health care providers can address the problem for less, they keep the difference, or some of it. If they spend more, they lose money. Bundled payment programs vary, but some also include penalties for poor quality or bonuses for good quality.Medicare has several bundled payment programs for hip and knee replacements \u2014 the most common type of Medicare procedures \u2014 and associated care that takes place within 90 days. This includes the operation itself, as well as follow-up rehabilitation (also known as post-acute care). In theory, if doctors and hospitals get one payment encompassing all this, they will better coordinate their efforts to limit waste and keep costs down.Do bundled payments work? They certainly appear promising, at least for some treatments. But it\u2019s important to conduct rigorous evaluations.But that doesn\u2019t mean the program saved money over all.\u201cThese results suggest bundled payments are a win-win,\u201d said Ezekiel Emanuel, a co-author of the study. \u201cThey save payers like Medicare money and encourage hospitals and physicians to be more efficient in the delivery of care.\u201dBut Robert Berenson, a fellow at the Urban Institute, urges some caution. \u201cStudying one kind of procedure doesn\u2019t tell you much about the rest of health care,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of health care is not like knee and hip replacements.\u201dMichael Chernew, a Harvard health economist, agreed. \u201cBundles can certainly be a helpful tool in fostering greater efficiency in our health care system,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the findings for hip and knee replacements may not generalize to other types of care.\u201dOne limitation shared by all of these studies is that they are voluntary: No hospital is required to participate. Nor are they randomized into the new payment system (treatment) or business as usual (control). Therefore we can\u2019t be certain that apparent savings are real. Maybe hospitals that joined the bundled payment programs are more efficient (or can more easily become so) than the ones that didn\u2019t.\u201cIn this first look at the data, we examined post-acute care because it is an area where there is concern about overuse,\u201d said Amy Finkelstein, an M.I.T. health economist and an author of the study. \u201cIn addition, prior work suggested that it\u2019s a type of care that hospitals can often avoid.\u201dThe study found that bundled payments reduced the use of post-acute care by about 3 percent, which is less than what prior studies found. \u201cThose prior studies weren\u2019t randomized trials, so some of the savings they estimate may really be due to which hospitals chose to participate in bundled payment programs,\u201d Ms. Finkelstein said. Despite reduced post-acute care use, the study did not find savings to Medicare once the costs of paying out bonuses were factored in. The study also found no evidence of harm to health care quality, no increase in the volume of hip and knee replacements, and no change in the types of patients treated.On the other hand, Dr. Berenson said, health care providers could figure out how to work the system: \u201cIn three to five years, we may see volume go up in a way that offsets savings through reduced payments for a procedure. We\u2019ll wait and see.\u201dGoing to a partly voluntary program will make it harder to learn about longer-term effects, Ms. Finkelstein said, and to get at the answers we\u2019re seeking.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Housing Market Slows, as Rising Prices Outpace Wages", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDENVER \u2014 By nearly any measure, this city is booming. The unemployment rate is below 3 percent. There is so much construction that a local newspaper started a \u201ccrane watch\u201d feature. Seemingly every week brings headlines about companies bringing high-paying jobs to the area.Yet, Denver\u2019s once-soaring housing market has run into turbulence. Sales and construction activity have slowed in recent months. Houses that would once have drawn a frenzy of offers are sitting on the market for days or weeks. Selling prices are rising more slowly, and asking prices are being slashed to attract buyers.Similar slowdowns have hit New York, Seattle and even San Francisco, cities that until recently ranked among the nation\u2019s hottest housing markets. The specifics vary, but economists, real estate agents and home builders say the core issue is the same: Home buyers are reaching a breaking point after years of breakneck price increases that far exceeded income gains.\u201cThe local economy is still fantastic, all the fundamentals are there, but obviously wages are not keeping pace,\u201d said Steve Danyliw, a Denver realtor. \u201cAs the market continues to move up, buyers are being pushed out.\u201dRachel Sandoval is one of them. An elementary schoolteacher in the Denver Public Schools, Ms. Sandoval earns about $50,000 a year, enough to afford a condominium or a modest house in most markets. But not in Denver, where the median sales price for all homes was $410,000 in August, and where even condos routinely top $300,000 \u2014 a price Ms. Sandoval calls \u201cnot even close to feasible.\u201d She said she was scoping out jobs in Texas, where houses are cheaper and pay is higher, and considering leaving teaching in search of a higher salary.For now, Ms. Sandoval, 41, is sharing a one-bathroom rental house with two roommates, a nurse and an adjunct professor. The three stick to a strict schedule to make sure they can all get to work on time.\u201cWe are professionals, we have degrees,\u201d Ms. Sandoval said. \u201cThis was not the plan.\u201dThe recent slowdown, however, is unlikely to give would-be buyers like Ms. Sandoval much relief. Prices in Denver are still up 8 percent over the past year, according to the S&P Case-Shiller index. That\u2019s cool compared to the double-digit gains of a couple years ago, but well ahead of the 6 percent increase in average hourly earnings over the same period. Rising interest rates have also made buying homes more expensive.Few analysts expect an outright decline in home prices anytime soon. That\u2019s because, unlike the speculative bubble of the mid-2000s, the recent run-up in prices has been driven primarily by economic fundamentals: People are moving to Denver faster than developers can build places to live. The Denver region has added more than 300,000 residents since 2010, making it one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing areas.Over all, however, the housing market is not behaving as the textbooks say it should. Inventories remain low despite the recent increases, and new construction is slowing, not picking up.Part of the problem, local real estate agents say, is that the furious pace of price growth has essentially gummed up the market, making homeowners reluctant to sell for fear of being unable to find a new home.Rising interest rates are compounding the problem because would-be sellers do not want to give up their low interest rates, a phenomenon economists call the lock-in effect.Brant and Annie Wiedel spent more than a year trying to get a foothold in Denver\u2019s housing market \u2014 and they are reluctant to give it up. The couple estimate that they looked at 160 houses before finally closing on a three-bedroom ranch house in Lakewood, a suburb, three years ago.With two children and a third due in January, the Wiedels would like to trade up. With the rise in home prices some renovations, the house they bought for $350,000 could be worth more than $500,000.But the family borrowed at about 3.5 percent three years ago. Today, they would pay closer to 5 percent. \u201cEven if we just saw houses at the same price, we\u2019d have to pay more\u201d every month, he said.Ultimately, the key to breaking the logjam is to build more homes. Downtown Denver is crawling with cranes, many of them erecting amenity-filled apartment complexes aimed at young professionals. A drive in almost any direction from downtown reveals freshly built subdivisions with names like Tallgrass, The Enclave and Green Gables Reserve.Most of those new homes, however, will list for more than $400,000. And hardly any builders are selling properties for under $300,000 without government subsidies. Even many home builders worry they are pricing themselves out of the market.\u201cI see the biggest threat to our business as the affordability challenge, that we are building houses that people can\u2019t afford,\u201d said Gene Myers, chief executive of Thrive Home Builders.The problem, Mr. Myers and other local builders say, is cost. The price of land, building permits and other fees can run close to $150,000 for a single-family lot \u2014 before construction.Some of the challenges are specific to Colorado. Quirks in state law, for example, make it easy for condominium buyers to collectively sue builders over construction defects, making developers reluctant to build condos.But other issues are common to many cities. Building materials have become more expensive, in part because of tariffs on lumber and other products that President Trump imposed this year. Labor costs are rising, too, especially for skilled trade workers. Restrictive zoning makes it hard to build denser developments that make cheaper homes profitable for builders.\u201cThey\u2019re producing what they can produce,\u201d said Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government housing-finance company. \u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s uneconomic for them to produce affordable.\u201dThis big-city conundrum is spreading. People priced out of San Francisco moved to Seattle and Portland, driving up prices and displacing people who moved to Denver and Austin. Next on the list: Boise, Nashville and other cities offering some of the same attractions at lower prices.\u201cCity after city is going to face this,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, Redfin\u2019s chief executive. \u201cAt some point, the buyers step back and say, \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019\u201dMore people are moving to Denver than leaving it, but migration has tapered off in recent years. J. J. Ament, chief executive of Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation, said he had seen no sign that rising home prices were making the region less attractive. Last month, VF Corporation, an apparel maker that owns brands like The North Face and Vans, announced it would move its headquarters to Denver from North Carolina, partly because of the area\u2019s reputation for outdoor activities. The state also offered $27 million in incentives.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t use the word \u2018crisis,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ament said. \u201cThe work force is still willing to move here.\u201dThat shortfall could threaten Denver\u2019s growth, said Phyllis Resnick, a Colorado State University economist and one of the report\u2019s authors. The skilled workers moving to the area, who have been so important to attracting companies and jobs, want to be able to eat out at restaurants, drop off their dry cleaning and send their children to school, all of which require lower and middle income workers. If they cannot afford to live in the area, Ms. Resnick said, Denver will not retain its allure \u2014 and the economy will not keep growing.\u201cMy concern is, at some point it sort of breaks because we can\u2019t house the folks that we need to fill out all the economic activity in the region,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced that in the near term it will correct itself just through market forces, unless that\u2019s through people moving out.\u201dTo have a big impact, economists say Denver and other cities have to build more homes affordable to middle-class families. That will require persuading communities accustomed to single-family homes to accept condos and townhomes.\u201cThe only way to solve the riddle is through density,\u201d said Dave Lemnah, co-owner of Lokal Homes, a Denver builder.That\u2019s why he is building projects like the Villas at Wheatlands, a 94-unit development in Aurora, east of Denver. Each lot has three attached units arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Lokal sells the homes for less than $400,000; some go for close to $300,000.One buyer, Angela Kirkland-Vandecar, an aesthetician and a single mother, has spent two years searching for a home she could afford on her roughly $50,000 income.When Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar began her search, she did not want to move to Aurora or to a condo.\u201cI\u2019ve now done everything that in the beginning I said I was not going to do,\u201d she said.But Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar feels good about her decision. Her monthly mortgage payment will be less than her $1,900 monthly rent, and she is happy not to have a lawn to mow. Her daughters, 11 and 13, will have their own rooms, and she will no longer have to store food in the laundry room, as she did in the cramped apartment she had been renting.Walking through her nearly ready house recently, looking for defects, Ms. Kirkland-Vandecar opened a door in the kitchen and paused. A Lokal Homes worker asked if she had found a problem. She shook her head.\u201cI\u2019m just enjoying my pantry,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A G.O.P. Senate Candidate Highlights His Drug Industry Career. Should He?", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn deeply blue New Jersey, few expected a real contest for Mr. Menendez\u2019s seat. Yet anger stemming from Mr. Menendez\u2019s federal corruption trial last year \u2014 a trial that Mr. Hugin\u2019s campaign reminds television viewers in New Jersey about on a regular basis \u2014 has dampened his popularity among voters.An examination of Celgene\u2019s aggressive promotion of Revlimid and its predecessor, Thalomid, while Mr. Hugin was a top executive at the company, including its chief executive for six years, reveals many of the controversial financial and legal tactics that have tarnished the industry\u2019s reputation, from marketing drugs for unapproved uses to raising prices and fighting off generic competitors.Mr. Hugin has dismissed the criticism.\u201cNew Jersey voters are a lot smarter than my opponent gives them credit for,\u201d Mr. Hugin said in a statement. \u201cThey understand that it costs billions of dollars in research and development, and years of hard work by hundreds of researchers and scientists, to develop medicines that successfully treat and cure cancer.\u201dSome experts are not so sure. Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll, noted that despite the fact that many large drug companies are based in New Jersey, public opinion in the state likely mirrors the national attitude.\u201cConcern about being able to afford health care is the top issue mentioned by voters in our polling for this year\u2019s midterm, in large part because of rising drug costs,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cThis provides an opening for Menendez.\u2019\u2019Any broad swing in voter opinion could prove difficult for Mr. Hugin to overcome. Even with Mr. Menendez\u2019s vulnerabilities, New Jersey has nearly 900,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans, and a number of competitive House races that have attracted national attention.When Mr. Hugin arrived at Celgene in June 1999, the company was struggling to figure out how to turn a profit on its only marketed drug, Thalomid, which had been approved a year earlier to treat a rare skin condition caused by leprosy.Thalomid was Celgene\u2019s brand name for thalidomide, an old drug that became notorious in the 1960s after it was traced to thousands of birth defects worldwide.F.D.A. officials, alarmed that a notorious drug was being sold illicitly, took the unusual step of seeking out drug companies that might be willing to bring thalidomide to market legally.Celgene, then a little-known New Jersey company that had never sold a drug, ultimately took up the challenge.But leprosy was hardly the point: The F.D.A.\u2019s main goal was to keep the drug from harming infants, and it did so by requiring that Celgene set up a first-of-its-kind distribution system that would limit prescriptions to preapproved doctors and pharmacies.Celgene, meanwhile, had ambitious plans. Thalidomide was generating intense excitement in the medical world, and from the start the company made clear it would not stop at treating leprosy. Celgene needed a finance executive to pitch its story to Wall Street. It settled on Mr. Hugin, a managing director at J.P. Morgan.Drug companies are forbidden from promoting a drug for any unapproved uses, but doctors have broad discretion to prescribe a product for a range of diseases. Celgene appeared to exploit this distinction almost as soon as Thalomid arrived on the market, according to company filings, public statements and internal documents included in the whistle-blower lawsuit Celgene settled in 2017.The company hired a team of 60 sales representatives, many of whom had experience in oncology, according to financial filings, and just months after Thalomid arrived on the market, Celgene announced that it would pursue F.D.A. approval for multiple myeloma.\u201cPerhaps more than for any other available drug, the need to provide and distribute thalidomide responsibly is essential to the public health,\u201d the agency wrote in the letter.Celgene has denied that it engaged in illegal marketing, saying it settled the lawsuit in 2017 to avoid the uncertainty, distraction and expense of protracted litigation.\u201dThe incredible demand for Thalomid, and later Revlimid, as promising treatments for multiple myeloma, a disease that affects more than 30,000 patients a year, was a windfall for Celgene.The company was able to aggressively raise prices in part as a result of its legal monopoly. Under federal regulations, a pharmaceutical company can exclusively market a drug for up to seven years. Once that period expires, along with any patents, the market opens to generic competition and prices typically fall precipitously.To protect the profits from Revlimid and Thalomid, Celgene mounted an aggressive campaign to extend its monopoly.\u201cThey\u2019ve gone to pretty great lengths to protect that drug and to build as many walls around it as they can,\u201d said Michael Brzica, the vice president for federal government affairs at the Association for Accessible Medicines, the generic drug industry\u2019s lobbying group.Celgene has been repeatedly accused of restricting access to samples of its drugs, which generic companies need to test their competing products.In restricting access to Revlimid and Thalomid, Celgene relied on a federal requirement that the distribution of those drugs be tightly regulated because of their dangerous side effects under a program known as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation System, or REMS.Congress expressly prohibited drug companies from using these programs to block or delay generic drug approval.Yet, according to three lawsuits filed by generic drug companies, Celgene did just that.It began with a simple refusal to distribute samples of their drugs, citing REMS and demanding that generic drug companies provide written confirmation from the F.D.A. permitting Celgene to provide drug samples. In the case of Mylan, one of the generic drug companies that sued Celgene, this process took 19 months.After the generic companies sent approval from the F.D.A., Celgene would request more information before agreeing to distribute the drug. But according to court documents in the Mylan case, these requests were laborious, irrelevant and time consuming.The voluminous requests from Celgene became a rinse-and-repeat cycle for many of the generic drug companies, according to court documents. Two companies, Lannett and Barr Laboratories, settled with Celgene. Mylan\u2019s suit will soon head to trial.\u201cThis is really concerning conduct and Celgene is by far the worst offender,\u201d Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School who studies patent law, said of Celgene\u2019s tactics to delay generic development.In 2017, after Mr. Hugin had stepped down as chief executive and become executive chairman, the company suffered two major setbacks in its development pipeline: A drug it had hoped would be a breakthrough in treating Crohn\u2019s disease failed to outperform a control group and Otezla, a psoriasis drug, badly missed sales expectations.Ronny Gal, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company who follows the pharmaceutical industry, said drug companies have generally been \u201ctone deaf\u201d when it comes to raising the price of their monopoly products. \u201cCelgene clearly has been there, but has not been any worse than the main players,\u201d he said.The tactics can carry a human cost. Last year, Elaine Kodish, a 76-year-old retiree from Los Angeles, briefly stopped taking Revlimid after her Medicare drug plan required she pay more than $450 a month for the drug that keeps her multiple myeloma in check. Ms. Kodish said she bought stock in Celgene when she started taking Revlimid in 2016, as a way of supporting a company she believed was keeping her alive.But after a series of price increases have exposed her to ballooning out-of-pocket costs \u2014 she has since returned to taking Revlimid, which now costs her about $785 per month \u2014 she said she recently sold her stake. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the drug companies, don\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d Ms. Kodish said. \u201cHowever, they can\u2019t be compensated on the backs of people who are dying.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Better Way to Get New York\u2019s Traffic Moving", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe city can fight congestion and raise revenue through parking regulations. Mr. Primus managed parking in San Francisco for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency for six years. There is a good alternative. New York could use a parking-based approach to achieve much of the same congestion management and revenue goals. This has three elements.First, the city would prohibit garage operators from selling parking by the month. Monthly parking is like an all-you-can-eat buffet \u2014 if the parking next to your office is already paid for, why not drive to work every day? Whether someone takes a car to work really matters because such trips are usually at peak times when alternatives are most viable \u2014 that\u2019s when trains and buses run most frequently and it\u2019s easiest to car pool. Requiring parking to be sold by the hour is like moving from all-you-can-eat to \u00e0 la carte. Even if the hourly cost is the same as what\u2019s implied in a monthly rate ($400 a month is equivalent to about $2.50 per hour if you park 40 hours a week), simply ensuring that people pay for parking every time they drive in will change how they decide to make some trips and, as a result, reduce congestion. Garage operators could still charge whatever they like, but would be required to price parking in a way that will reduce traffic.Third, New York could require all garage and lot operators to offer an off-peak discount, as is already done in San Francisco\u2019s municipal garages. People who park for at least four hours would receive, say, a $4 discount for arriving before streets are congested as well as a $4 discount for leaving after traffic subsides, for a total discount of up to $8. That is a powerful incentive for people to drive when there\u2019s less traffic. Every year, city transportation managers would review and adjust the time thresholds (say, 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.), minimum length of stay and discount level to ensure consistency, a level playing field for parking operators and sufficient incentive for drivers. The magic of this approach is that it is tantamount to a peak period surcharge but framed as an off-peak discount \u2014 no one (other than economists) likes peak period surcharges, but everyone loves a discount. The effect is the same but the political viability is crucially different. This is also more politically feasible than congestion pricing because it affects parking, something people are already accustomed to paying for, and requires only local rather than state approval. It also avoids the technical complexity, cost (hundreds of millions of dollars to install, maintain and operate) and privacy concerns raised by the hundreds of surveillance cameras congestion pricing would require.This parking-based plan for congestion management does not preclude other ideas, including some that have already been considered in New York \u2014 a fee for commercial vehicles and trucks entering Manhattan at peak times, a surcharge on trips in for-hire vehicles (like yellow taxis and Uber cars) and traditional congestion pricing. No city has pursued a parking-based congestion management plan before. New York could show the world how sound parking policy, rather than heavy investments in technology, can help address the urgent and universal issue of congestion. Cities are looking for ways to be smart \u2014 and this no-tech, no-cost, data-free and politically feasible approach to congestion management could be the smart way forward. Jay Primus, a former manager of SFpark, a parking-based approach to handling traffic, for the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, is a consultant.  Advertisement"}

Donald Trump warned that if Hillary Clinton got to make the appointment \u201cour country is going to be Venezuela.\u201d Mrs. Clinton responded that a Trump justice \u201cwould threaten the future of our planet.\u201d The partisan forecasts are even more ominous as Senate hearings begin next week on Mr. Trump\u2019s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Anthony M. Kennedy on the Supreme Court.We may pride ourselves that we have self-government, but for decades we\u2019ve turned to the court to settle our most difficult social and political issues: abortion and gay marriage, campaign finance and gun control, even a disputed presidential election. When the justices rule the way we like, we laud them for \u201cinterpreting\u201d the Constitution. When they don\u2019t, we complain they\u2019re \u201cmaking the law\u201d based on their own predilections. A good justice is an umpire; a bad justice is a player.

In the past, presidents weren\u2019t driven solely by hyperpartisan agendas for the court, in part because the court wasn\u2019t in the maelstrom of so many divisive issues as it is today. Yes, justices sometimes disappointed the presidents who appointed them \u2014 like Earl Warren, selected by Dwight D. Eisenhower to be chief in 1953, and David H. Souter, picked by George H.W. Bush in 1990. But now, thanks to more cynical vetting, nominees act on the bench the way the presidents who chose them expected. Barack Obama got what he wanted with Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. So, too, in most votes, did George W. Bush with John Roberts and Samuel A. Alito Jr., and Bill Clinton with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. When the votes in contentious cases can be predicted at the outset, constitutional law simply becomes partisan politics by another name. If you typically know beforehand how justices will vote based on which president appointed them, then what\u2019s the point of having a court that, in theory, operates above politics?Of course, the court sometimes must act decisively to protect rights. By design, the unelected, largely unaccountable Supreme Court serves as a bulwark against tyrannical majorities. The First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free expression envisions the protection of repugnant views. And few legislators are apt to defend the rights of criminal suspects. That\u2019s why there are constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and against self-incrimination. The court\u2019s role is to vindicate these unpopular protections. In one of its finest moments, in Brown v. Board of Education, the court gave force to the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of equal protection for all.Once upon a time, liberals looked to the Supreme Court to secure social justice, while conservatives abhorred what they called judicial activism. Now that conservatives are on the verge of locking down control of the court, they can\u2019t wait for the court to enshrine new legal doctrine to achieve victories that have eluded them in the political branches, or, if need be, to validate successes won now that the White House and Congress are in Republican hands. Rollbacks of federal regulation of the environment, the workplace, health care and the voting booth are the constitutional grail for conservatives. Suddenly, liberals are the ones preaching judicial restraint. In the fight for the court, hypocrisy is king.A month before the Constitution was ratified in 1788, Alexander Hamilton explained what he saw as the source of power for the new Supreme Court. The other branches, as well as the populace, would obey the justices because of their prestige. Their rulings would be based \u201cneither on force nor will, but merely judgment.\u201d By Hamilton\u2019s reckoning, while the president \u201cholds the sword\u201d and Congress \u201ccommands the purse,\u201d the court would be \u201cthe least dangerous branch.\u201dThat\u2019s no longer so. Yes, the president can initiate war. And Congress, beholden to special interests, can pass foolish laws or do nothing at all. But the court\u2019s self-aggrandizement in recent decades is more insidious and destructive of American values in the long term. With deep distrust in our elected representatives, we have come to believe democracy is broken. Too often we\u2019ve hoped that the justices will be our saviors. With so much dysfunction in government, the justices see themselves that way, too. But even in the current age, we need to demand more from the political branches of our government. We do not need, nor should we want, the court to save us from ourselves. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "383,000: Estimated Death Toll in South Sudan\u2019s War", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe number far surpasses earlier estimates from the United Nations and brings into focus the tragedy of a conflict that has received little global attention.The researchers behind the report hope it will be instrumental in understanding the conflict and strengthening humanitarian responses.\u201cWe hope that these kind of findings create even more urgency to actually making sure that the current peace deal is solid and is adhered to,\u201d said Francesco Checchi, the lead epidemiologist involved in the report.While the numbers represent a stark increase from previous estimates, Mr. Checchi said the toll could well be higher.The figure is the only comprehensive estimate of the death toll after nearly five years of war. There have been efforts to calculate the human cost on a community level over the years, with dozens of humanitarian groups conducting small-scale surveys.The researchers whose report was released on Wednesday attempted to calculate the death toll from the beginning of the conflict in December 2013 until April 2018. Using population statistics and growth projections, and factoring in the intensity of the fighting, displacement, disease, access to health care and more, the epidemiologists produced a model that enabled them to estimate deaths month by month and county by county.Assessments by humanitarian organizations and civic groups contributed to the projections.The majority of the deaths occurred in the state of Central Equatoria, the country\u2019s bread basket, as well as in the northeastern states of Jonglei and Unity, all of which have been sites of major violence during the war. The death toll was highest in 2016 and 2017 after a power-sharing agreement brokered in 2015 fell apart.Experts who have been monitoring the conflict for years say the new estimate offers a useful framework for understanding and responding to the war.\u201cFor a long time, the absence of a death toll sanitized the horrors of the war and minimized its drastic effects,\u201d Brian Adeba, deputy director of policy at the Enough Project, a Washington-based group that monitors conflict in Africa, said in a statement. \u201cThis death toll reinforces the urgent need to hold accountable both the direct perpetrators and the leaders responsible for the violence.\u201dThe conflict began as a feud between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and to then-Vice President Riek Machar. It soon spiraled into fighting among several factions, engulfing the country in ethnic violence and eventually producing a devastating humanitarian crisis.Because of violence, large portions of South Sudan have been inaccessible for periods of time. Aid workers have also been targeted during the conflict.The epidemiologists who produced the new report had to find ways around the lack of access to many parts of South Sudan, Mr. Checchi said.\u201cOrdinarily what we might try to do in such a crisis scenario would be to carry out a large survey, take a sample nationwide and ask households to tell about their experience over the last few years, including deaths in their household,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was is really not an option for South Sudan.\u201dOn Sept. 12, a new peace agreement was signed by all parties to the conflict during a ceremony in Ethiopia. But the agreement does not address many of the issues at the core of the conflict, many experts say, and they fear it may not hold.\u201cWith the peace agreement that was signed earlier this month being so structurally flawed, it is likely this number will continue its inexorable climb until the root causes of South Sudan\u2019s violence are addressed,\u201d John Prendergast, founding director of the Enough Project and co-founder of The Sentry, which researches the financing of conflicts, said in a statement.The humanitarian crisis still needs to be confronted. Several nations met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday to discuss South Sudan.Harriett Baldwin, a member of Britain\u2019s Parliament and the country\u2019s minister for Africa, called the latest peace accord a significant achievement, but said that it was \u201conly the first step on a long journey to peace.\u201d\u201cEven since the most recent cease-fire, violence continues,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Kavanaugh Hearings Are Over. Now What?", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats did the best they could. Pressuring red-state senators to vote no will backfire.Contributing Opinion WriterSo the Kavanaugh hearings are over. How did the Democrats do?They accomplished the latter about as well as could be expected. They raised salient objections from the moment of the opening gavel. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal\u2019s repeated requests for a vote to delay the proceedings were a bold intervention. The Democrats let America know that thousands of documents pertaining to Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s White House years had been withheld from them or dumped on them at the last minute. Tough questioning from a range of Democratic senators showed the country a nominee whose responses on topics from abortion rights to executive power were relentlessly evasive.And yet, unless lightning strikes, Mr. Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the court sometime in the next few weeks and will take his seat before the court\u2019s next session starts in October.Attention will turn now to that upcoming confirmation vote. The strongest focus of Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s opponents will be on Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, in the probably vain hope that these two supporters of Roe v. Wade can be pressured to vote against the nominee. Both have signaled that that is unlikely.Next, activists\u2019 attentions will turn to the Democrats who might end up voting to confirm Mr. Kavanaugh. These include most notably a handful of incumbents who are up for re-election in states Donald Trump carried: Joe Donnelly in Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Joe Manchin in West Virginia, Claire McCaskill in Missouri, Jon Tester in Montana and possibly Bill Nelson in Florida.There are other red-state Democratic senators seeking re-election this fall \u2014 Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Debbie Stabenow in Michigan, for example. But for reasons peculiar to them, their races and their states, they\u2019re generally considered to be able to cast safe \u201cno\u201d votes.So liberal activists and groups are presumably going to spend time and precious money this month lobbying the above senators to vote no. I say to them: Don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a waste of said time and money, for two reasons.First of all, if Ms. Murkowski and Ms. Collins vote \u201caye,\u201d Mr. Kavanaugh has his 51 votes. It\u2019s over. It doesn\u2019t matter at that point if he has 51 votes or 56.You have to look at the situations these people find themselves in, consider their re-election prospects \u2014 and consider the alternative. Take Mr. Manchin, whose circumstance is the one I know best.But if Mr. Manchin were to cast a (numerically meaningless!) vote against Mr. Kavanaugh \u2014 presto. The rest of the race would be about that, and nothing but that. Millions of dark money dollars would pour in for TV ads blasting Mr. Manchin for going against the wishes of their president.But here\u2019s the second and more important reason to give the red-state Democrats a pass here. This battle wasn\u2019t lost last week, and it sure won\u2019t be lost by these red-state Democrats if they vote to confirm. It was lost in 2016.It was lost by the Democratic Party, the Hillary Clinton campaign, and the courts-oriented grass roots and public-interest groups that didn\u2019t do nearly enough to explain to the Democratic rank and file in 2016 that a Clinton victory would mean a liberal court majority for the first time in 30 years.I kept waiting and waiting that fall for Ms. Clinton to emphasize this point, or for other prominent figures to say, \u201cLook. You\u2019re not wild about Hillary Clinton? Fine. Are you wild about Roe v. Wade, same-sex marriage, protections for immigrant children, campaign finance contribution limits? Then you\u2019d damn well better vote.\u201dIt never happened. So that\u2019s on them. But honestly, regular voters should have been mature enough to have figured this out on their own. They\u2019re to blame, too.If you live in Wisconsin and thought it would be neat to vote for pot-friendly Gary Johnson, then Brett Kavanaugh is partly your fault. If you are a Michigander who thought you were sticking it to the man by voting for Putin buddy Jill Stein, Brett Kavanaugh is partly your fault, too.So now, Roe will be struck down; corporations will remain people for the foreseeable future; the Trump administration can attempt any immigration restriction it wants, confident the Court will have its back; all remaining limits on campaign contributions may die; and, not least, a solid court majority will presumably rule in favor of Mr. Trump on executive power questions.Say what you will about religious conservatives who voted en masse for a moral reprobate for president. They grasped the stakes. Liberals did not. Progressive donors and pressure groups, rather than wasting money these next few weeks, had better direct it toward making sure the same mistake isn\u2019t made in 2020.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arizona Lawmakers Cut Education Budgets. Then Teachers Got Angry.", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "Red shirts and blouses had emerged as the official uniform of teacher uprisings against low pay that were spreading from West Virginia to Oklahoma and Kentucky under the rallying cry \u201cRed for Ed.\u201d Just one week earlier, a Facebook post by Noah Karvelis, a 23-year-old teacher in Phoenix, lit the spark in Arizona, asking teachers to wear red on March 7 to demand more money for the state\u2019s chronically underfunded public schools. Within days, 6,000 people clicked that they were on board. Berg, a high school math teacher for 23 years with a master\u2019s degree who was taking home $1,620 a month, was one of them. On the designated day, a Wednesday, thousands of Arizona teachers turned campuses red from the New Mexico line to California. Karvelis and other young teachers then took it upon themselves to keep the activism going, declaring every Wednesday Red for Ed day \u2014 but Berg decided to wear it daily. \u201cI wanted people to come up and say: \u2018Kelly, today isn\u2019t Wednesday. Why are you wearing red?\u2019\u2009\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so I could tell them, This is how important it is. We need to make our voices heard.\u201dIn the past, the idea of participating in anything that resembled a political movement had repelled Berg. \u201cI would say, \u2018Don\u2019t talk to me about politics,\u2019\u2009\u201d she recalled. \u201c\u2009\u2018I think it\u2019s a waste of time.\u2019\u2009\u201d A 46-year-old lifelong Republican, she called herself a \u201csleepy voter,\u201d as if she sleepwalked through the voting booth every four years. \u201cI was just voting for the person with an R by their name or not voting.\u201dThis was true even though the Legislature and governor \u2014 unified under Republican control since 2009 \u2014 cut education spending more than any other state in the wake of the Great Recession. Berg suffered doubly because her husband, a web developer, lost his state job, and now the entire family of six \u2014 they have four sons, ages 7 to 13 \u2014 was on her health plan, with the premiums cutting her previous take-home pay almost in half. She was working three extra jobs to keep the family afloat, arriving home most nights barely in time to check her kids\u2019 homework and kiss them good night. Across the state, teachers were taking in roommates, working second and third jobs and leaving the profession in such waves that substitutes without standard certifications were leading more than 3,400 classrooms statewide. Two thousand more couldn\u2019t be staffed at all.In December 2016, the day before Christmas break, Berg heard that her son Mark\u2019s sixth-grade teacher had quit to take a private-sector job for more money, and suddenly she felt that she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She needed to understand why Arizona\u2019s schools were so poorly funded and who was responsible. She turned for help to her best friend, Tiffany Bunstein, who followed state politics closely and, like Berg, had been teaching for more than 20 years at Dobson High School in Mesa, a sprawling, demographically diverse suburb east of Phoenix. \u201cI went to Tiffany and said, \u2018I want to know what you know,\u2019\u2009\u201d Berg said.It was on this Facebook page that Berg learned of the March 14 hearing in the House Ways and Means Committee on a bill related to Arizona\u2019s tuition tax credit program, which awards dollar-for-dollar state tax credits to individuals and corporations for donations for private school scholarships. In the previous school year, donors had given more than $157 million, and over the last 20 years $1 billion, avoiding the same amount in taxes \u2014 money that never reached the state general fund or public schools. The bill would increase the size of individual scholarships, at a predicted annual cost of $2 million in 2020, a pittance in a more than $10 billion overall state budget. But for Berg and many other teachers emboldened by the March 7 show of solidarity, that was $2 million too much. \u201cOnce again we\u2019re undercutting public education, and it needs to stop,\u201d she recalled thinking. It was spring break, and teachers urged one another on Facebook to attend the hearing.Berg drove downtown, her heart pounding. \u201cThis is totally so uncharacteristic of anything I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d she kept telling herself. Arriving at the Capitol, she found hundreds of other teachers, all wearing red, and was surprised by how comfortable she felt. Before she could stop herself, she volunteered to testify about the bill. She stood at the microphone with rows of red-shirted teachers behind her and read from notes, her head down, nervously smoothing her brown hair and adjusting her glasses. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about politics, but I do know about math,\u201d she began, introducing a lesson on how teachers\u2019 salaries had stagnated. Other teachers told stories of financial crises in their schools, pleading for every available dollar to go to public, not private, education. When one teacher\u2019s voice broke as she described a colleague covering two kindergarten classes at once because of a shortage of substitutes, the others applauded in encouragement. When a Democratic lawmaker called the private scholarships inequitable \u2014 exceeding the state\u2019s spending per public school student by $9,000 in some cases \u2014 the teachers stood up in silent assent. The committee chairwoman, Michelle Ugenti-Rita, instructed them to sit. \u201cAnd when they sit, you can answer,\u201d she said to the bill\u2019s sponsor, the Senate president Steve Yarbrough, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to all show each other respect.\u201d Despite the entreaties of the teachers, the bill passed the committee on a party-line vote \u2014 six Republicans to three Democrats.Berg went home, signed onto the Facebook page, which by now had tens of thousands of followers, and poured out her rage. \u201cWe were told to sit down when we stood in agreement. ... We were told to remain quiet when applauding when a teacher, who was in tears, was pleading for support for our classes and our students,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe were disrespected. We were mocked. We were listened to, but not heard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what radicalized me,\u201d Berg said later. \u201cAs the kids would say, \u2018I\u2019m woke.\u2019\u2009\u201dThe Great Recession devastated education funding in every region of the country. With tax revenues plummeting, legislators and governors desperate to slash spending turned inexorably to public schools. Anticipating sweeping teacher layoffs, the Obama administration in 2009 sent states a federal stimulus package of $100 billion specifically for education, but the recession outlasted it. In half the states, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, teacher pay adjusted for inflation was lower in 2016 than in 2000.Few states were hit as hard as Arizona, where the sun, low taxes and wide-open spaces had drawn transplants from around the country, fueling an economy heavily based on real estate development. All that came to a painful halt when the housing bubble burst in 2008. State revenue had grown so feverishly in the years before the crash that in 2006, Gov. Janet Napolitano, a Democrat, and the Republican Legislature were able to cut income taxes 10 percent even as they significantly increased education spending, including an expansion of kindergarten from half a day to a full day statewide.The recession, coupled with the tax cuts, wiped out billions of dollars in state revenues. Napolitano left to join the Obama administration as secretary of homeland security in January 2009, and her Republican successor, Jan Brewer, and the Republican Legislature cut funds that districts relied on to pay teachers, maintain buildings, update curriculum and technology and much more. Salaries were frozen, funding for all-day kindergarten was eliminated and class sizes climbed year by year as teachers left for higher-paying jobs and principals were forced to combine orphaned classes. By last year, Shannon Connors, a sixth-grade teacher at a high-poverty, 98 percent Latino school in Phoenix, ended up teaching two classes at once \u2014 50 students \u2014 when a succession of long-term substitutes failed to teach one of the classes effectively.Similar situations had unfolded in every state where teachers walked off the job last spring. A 2017 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that West Virginia, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona \u2014 scenes of the largest teacher walkouts \u2014 were among the six states that cut the most aid to local school districts in the last decade. All are solidly Republican and have embraced small government and income-tax cuts. They are also right-to-work states where union membership is optional and unions are weak. Fewer than half of Arizona teachers belong to the union.In Arizona, state funding per pupil has been below the national average since 1975, falling particularly after the mid-1990s, when lawmakers embarked on an almost unbroken streak of annual cuts in personal and corporate income taxes. Tom Rex, an Arizona State University researcher, calculated that if not for the cumulative effect of those tax cuts, the state general fund in 2016 would have totaled $13.6 billion instead of $9.5 billion, or more than 40 percent higher. Even in the depths of the recession, Brewer and the Legislature cut corporate income taxes 30 percent \u2014 roughly $550 million a year \u2014 in hopes of stimulating the economy, but without success. Voters approved a temporary 1-cent sales-tax hike in a 2010 referendum, with proceeds designated primarily for education, then decisively voted down a permanent extension in 2012.The leader of the 2012 opposition to the sales tax was Doug Ducey, now the governor of Arizona, who was then the state treasurer. A former C.E.O. of Cold Stone Creamery and a Republican, he championed small government and free-market solutions to education like charter schools and Arizona\u2019s version of private school vouchers. Attacking public school districts as wasteful bureaucracies, he argued that more money would solve nothing. \u201cWe need to spend those dollars more effectively,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to raise taxes on hard-working citizens.\u201dCutting taxes and privatizing schools had long been popular in Arizona, but there were signs that the worsening teacher shortage was changing that. Beginning in 2015, the year Ducey took office, political polls showed education was the No. 1 concern for the Arizona electorate, even ahead of immigration and health care.While keeping his no-new-taxes pledge, Ducey found some ways to increase school aid. In 2016, he won legislative and voter approval to give districts $3.5 billion over 10 years, mostly from a state land trust created at the time of Arizona\u2019s founding and dedicated in part to funding public education. The move came after the Arizona Supreme Court found the state liable for failing to keep school funding even with inflation during the recession. Education leaders said the $3.5 billion came to less than was owed but embraced it as a way to funnel much-needed money to schools.As the economy improved, Ducey restored some other funds eliminated during the recession, and districts began raising salaries modestly for the first time in eight years. But this barely dented the legacy of decades of cutbacks in both wealthy and low-income districts.In January, Ducey unveiled his budget for 2018, specifying a raise of only 1 percent for teachers, along with some other aid that districts could apply to raises. On Feb. 22, news arrived of West Virginia teachers walking off the job to demand better pay and benefits. \u201cMy first thought was, They must be a union state,\u201d Berg said. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t, and I wondered what that meant for us.\u201dOne Saturday, Berg and Bunstein rallied with hundreds of other teachers along Baseline Road, a major thoroughfare, wearing red and waving Red for Ed posters. Traffic snarled as drivers slowed to honk and shout encouragement. Supporters dropped off pizzas and cases of water. From the back seat of a minivan, children waved homemade signs saying, \u201cWe support our teachers.\u201dOn March 28, another Wednesday, 2,500 teachers converged at a nighttime rally at the Capitol, which had been called by Arizona Educators United to announce the new movement\u2019s demands. They included a 20 percent salary increase, raises for support staff, no new tax cuts until Arizona increased per-pupil spending to the national average, a pay scale guaranteeing salaries would continue to rise and a return to prerecession school-funding levels. That would require an increase of $632 per student \u2014 the current level was $5,105 \u2014 or about $700 million in additional spending, based on legislative budget data.On April 2, teachers in Oklahoma and Kentucky walked off the job over pay and pension issues. Amid a clamor for action in Arizona, A.E.U. leaders invited community supporters to join them on April 11 for \u201cwalk-ins,\u201d lining up outside schools before the opening bell and striding arm in arm to the entrance. More than 100,000 teachers, students, principals, parents and business owners participated at 1,100 schools.The next day, Governor Ducey, who is up for re-election in November, called a news conference and announced that he had found room in his budget for a 20 percent pay increase for teachers over three years that he called \u201c20 by 2020.\u201d There would be a 10 percent raise this year, and \u2014 if future Legislatures approved the funds \u2014 5 percent in 2019 and again in 2020.A.E.U. leaders called the raises unsustainable without new taxes and again demanded a return to funding levels from before the recession \u2014 a decade earlier. They held a vote to decide whether to walk out, and 78 percent of more than 50,000 participating teachers and support staff voted yes. The date was set for April 26, near the end of the legislative session; the walkout would continue until lawmakers voted on the education budget.The first morning of the walkout, Berg and Bunstein rode together into downtown Phoenix in Berg\u2019s Honda Odyssey, past miles of flat, exurban expanses with mountains looming in the distance, wondering how many teachers would actually show up. At the designated meeting spot outside Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team, they found so many people in red \u2014 teachers from affluent suburbs and the highest-poverty schools around Phoenix \u2014 they couldn\u2019t see where the crowd stopped. Bunstein received an aerial photograph on her phone of a red sea surging 19 blocks down Washington Street from the ball field to the Capitol. It exceeded the scope of the camera, appearing to reach beyond the horizon. At about the same time, a deafening, celebratory roar went up from the crowd. Berg and Bunstein found themselves crying. So did many others.Also in the crowd was Lupita Almanza, a Mesa teacher who had gotten only one minimal raise in eight years. Weighed down by student debt and her obligations as a single mother of a daughter in kindergarten, she had been agonizing about whether to leave her job. She thought often of how much she would be paid in the private sector. \u201cI\u2019m bilingual,\u201d she said. \u201cI could make good money as a translator.\u201dBut something profound happened to her when she told her students she was walking out and wouldn\u2019t be there the next day. \u201cSaying goodbye to them was the hardest thing I ever did,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I realized, if this hurts my heart so much, I should be doing this. I went to the Capitol every day of the walkout, and I fought, not just for my daughter or my nieces and nephews and students, but for myself too, because this is my passion \u2014 to be a teacher \u2014 and I just can\u2019t close the door yet. I have found my voice.\u201dFar-right social-media sites including Breitbart and The Daily Caller searched Noah Karvelis\u2019s online history and revealed shortly before the walkout that he had volunteered as a college student for Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign and had tweeted about teaching students such topics as gender, race and \u201ctoxic/violent masculinity.\u201d Republican lawmakers quickly tarred Red for Ed as a socialist plot \u2014 \u201ccue Karvelis\u2019 former boss Bernie Sanders,\u201d Republican State Representative Maria Syms of Paradise Valley wrote in an op-ed in The Arizona Republic. When a high school music teacher in Tempe texted State Representative Kelly Townsend, a conservative Republican, asking to explore common ground, she replied, \u201cWhen the teachers denounce the socialists in charge of your Red for Ed movement, and parenthetically I wondered why they chose the color red, then we can sit down and talk.\u201d The teacher posted the exchange on Facebook.\u201cLet us band together, \u2018conservative\u2019 and \u2018liberal,\u2019 and WIN this war,\u201d Jonathan Massey, an English teacher of 14 years and a Republican who said he often votes like an independent, wrote on Facebook. \u201cAfter we have achieved sweet victory, we can resume attacking each other on other issues! Haha! WE are the kind of uprising which politicians of both major parties dread. They have lost control of us, and that means TROUBLE.\u201dFor six days, teachers lobbied their lawmakers amid debate over the education budget. In the end, the salary increase survived intact, but the other teacher demands went nowhere. Democrats presented most of them as amendments; all were defeated by Republicans banding together. On the last day, the vote on the overall state budget dragged on into the morning. It was common for Arizona budgets to pass in the middle of the night with only a handful of spectators watching. But this time, when the final vote was taken at 5 a.m., the gallery was still packed and solid red with teachers.Aidan Balt, 31, a high school English teacher and a Republican, had watched all night, growing increasingly distressed. She had been teaching for eight years at a school south of Phoenix where half the students are low income. She took home $2,200 a month, too little to afford to live on her own. She routinely worked 12-hour days and longer, trying to make up for what her students didn\u2019t get from their underfunded school. During the budget negotiations, she met with one of her representatives, a Republican, to tell him in detail why the system needed more revenue. She said he was cordial but told her she didn\u2019t understand the budget.\u201cYou go meet a Republican lawmaker, and they say you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she recalled later, sipping passion-tea lemonade in a Starbucks. \u201cBut I do know what I\u2019m talking about. This is something I\u2019m an expert in, something I love and live every day.\u201dShe said she identified strongly with the Republican Party. \u201cI was raised to believe in personal freedom. I was raised around people with guns. I\u2019m pro-life,\u201d she said. \u201cBut over time my perception has changed. Politics shouldn\u2019t be polarized. I\u2019m not so black-and-white that I can\u2019t see that sometimes I might have to vote differently because of other issues. For me, all I can do is focus on something I know, and that\u2019s education.\u201dShe was just one teacher in a red shirt, sitting among many others in the Senate gallery in the wee hours of a morning in May. But watching the party-line votes against the teachers\u2019 demands, she felt compelled to take a stand. Pulling out her phone, she went to the online portal for the Arizona state government and changed her voter registration \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to Democratic.On May 4, teachers returned to school with a new slogan: \u201cRemember in November.\u201dChristine Marsh, Arizona\u2019s 2016 Teacher of the Year, decided last year to run for the State Senate in a district straddling Phoenix and the affluent suburb Paradise Valley, against its moderate Republican incumbent, Kate Brophy McGee. On a sweltering day this past June, having just completed her 26th year in the classroom, Marsh was traversing several Phoenix housing developments, riding in a fellow teacher\u2019s Prius, hopping out every minute or two to knock on voters\u2019 doors to ask them for support.\u201cTeachers live by the mantra \u2018Just close your door and teach,\u2019\u2009\u201d said Marsh, 52, who teaches high school English and calculated that she has taught more than 3,500 students. \u201cIf there were things we didn\u2019t like, we shut out the outside world and did our job to the best of our ability. We\u2019ve been systematically cut for 20 years, but the last 10 years, I came to the point I could not \u2018Close my door and teach\u2019 anymore. I\u2019m running to get to the point where teachers can focus on our students and not be testifying before the House Education Committee.\u201dThe G.O.P. holds a four-seat margin in the State Senate; Marsh\u2019s district, a mix of Democrats, Republicans and independents, is one of a handful that Democrats have targeted as winnable in hopes of flipping Senate control. Republicans have controlled both houses of the Legislature for 25 years, except in 2001 and 2002, when the Senate was tied.\u201cWe balance or flip the Senate, and there are no more budgets passed in the dark of night,\u201d Marsh told a crowd of former students and parents gathered at a Scottsdale home in June. \u201cWith a 15-15 split, Republicans have to come to the table. It\u2019s a game changer for the whole state.\u201dOn Facebook, teachers encouraged one another to work for candidates who are dedicated to more funding for education \u2014 mostly Democrats but in some cases Republicans. Hoping to circumvent the governor and Legislature, they also embraced Arizona\u2019s robust tradition of direct democracy, backing ballot initiatives to support public schools.One of those referendums was already on the ballot for November, thanks to a statewide coalition of mothers and teachers who came together in the summer of 2017 in a precursor to this year\u2019s grass-roots uprising. Calling their movement Save Our Schools Arizona, the cadre of women became overnight activists when Governor Ducey and the Legislature in April 2017 vastly expanded the state\u2019s then-limited program of private school vouchers \u2014 known as Empowerment Scholarship Accounts \u2014 by making all 1.1 million Arizona schoolchildren eligible for them. Under the voucher program, the state loads an average of $5,700 onto debit cards and issues them to parents to use for private schools, home instruction and other alternatives to public school. Ducey described the measure as necessary for children who struggle to succeed in traditional settings. \u201cPublic education is about educating our public,\u201d he said. Lawmakers limited the expansion to 5,500 new participants a year through 2022 to allay fiscal concerns. But the S.O.S. leaders argued that the Legislature could eventually lift the cap, triggering an exodus of students and revenue from public to private schools. With an all-volunteer force, in temperatures of 110 and higher, they gathered more than 100,000 signatures \u2014 well beyond the 75,000 needed \u2014 for what became known as Proposition 305, which blocked enactment of the voucher-expansion law until voters rule on it this November.In the middle of the walkout, inspired by Prop 305, Karvelis and other Red for Ed leaders endorsed another ballot initiative called Invest in Ed, developed by the national and state teachers\u2019 unions and liberal public-policy groups, that would raise $690 million a year through increased marginal tax rates on the state\u2019s top earners. It would create a dedicated funding stream to restore all-day kindergarten, reduce class sizes, hire more counselors and continue to raise teachers\u2019 pay.Karvelis said he and the other leaders informally polled teachers amid the frenzy of the walkout, finding widespread support for the initiative. But the endorsement created fissures in the movement. \u201cI thought this was a bipartisan fight for education,\u201d Kris Leffler, a Mesa teacher and a Republican, wrote on Facebook. \u201cOnce the chant for higher taxes for the wealthy started, you lost this teacher\u2019s support!!!!\u201d The proposed ballot measure would almost double the marginal tax rate on the richest residents \u2014 individuals making over $500,000, couples making over a million dollars \u2014 from 4.54 to 9 percent, making it the fifth-highest rate in any state. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in that liberal thought,\u201d Leffler said. Other Republican teachers renounced Red for Ed on the same grounds. Jonathan Massey, who cautioned against partisanship from the start, lamented what he called \u201cthe loss of our trademark\u201d but didn\u2019t leave the movement.Those backing the measure argued that it would make the system more fair because the state budget now relies heavily on sales taxes, which disproportionately burden low-income residents. Berg said she would have preferred a broader-based tax but was moved by the bottom line of having more money for schools. So was Jenna Kaderlik, a Republican teacher from Surprise, a Phoenix suburb, who took a $15,000 pay cut when her family moved from Texas. \u201cThe ballot initiative really called to me \u2014 a dedicated, sustainable revenue stream every year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be voter-approved and voter-protected. The Legislature and the governor can\u2019t touch it.\u201dThey and thousands of other teachers across Arizona spent evenings and weekends collecting signatures; Berg took charge of distributing petitions to other teachers every Saturday morning across the Mesa school district. On one Saturday in June, she and Bunstein spent three hours collecting signatures at a coffee shop called Xtreme Bean in a busy shopping strip. Later that day, they moved to a bar and grill in Tempe, where they ran into S.O.S. activists from the previous year\u2019s battle for Prop 305. With their cause already on the ballot, S.O.S. was helping out supporters of Invest in Ed and a third referendum called Outlaw Dirty Money. It would require so-called \u201cdark money\u201d groups that funnel millions of hard-to-trace dollars into Arizona political campaigns \u2014 mostly Republican but also Democratic \u2014 to reveal their individual donors. The parents and teachers who took on the voucher law had become intimately familiar with these groups.\u201cIf you cared last year about vouchers, and this year about the walkout, you need to ask the next question: Where did this issue come from?\u201d said Dawn Penich-Thacker, a communications professor at Arizona State University and an S.O.S. founder who was coordinating volunteers at the bar and grill. \u201cAnd that takes you to dark money.\u201dDucey had become a presence at conferences organized by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and donors to their political-finance network when he was state treasurer. An organization called Americans for Responsible Leadership, whose funding was traced by California authorities to the Koch network, contributed almost $1 million in support of Ducey\u2019s successful campaign against the 1-cent sales-tax hike in 2012.In his 2014 gubernatorial campaign, Ducey ran on a pledge to cut taxes every year and drive income tax rates in Arizona \u201cas close to zero as possible.\u201d That year, six dark-money groups spent almost $3.5 million supporting him or attacking his opponents, according to an investigation by The Arizona Capitol Times. Citing tax records, the paper found that five of the groups were financed by the sixth, American Encore, run by the Arizona political consultant Sean Noble, who was known to have funneled more than $100 million from anonymous Koch-network donors into political causes in 2012. \u201cOur network will work with anyone to help remove barriers that are preventing students from reaching their potential,\u201d Meredith Olson, an education spokeswoman for the Koch network, wrote to The Times in an email.In 2017, the Koch brothers\u2019 political advocacy arm, Americans for Prosperity, named the Arizona voucher-expansion bill its No. 1 education-reform priority in the country. The American Federation for Children, another bundler of anonymous contributions, founded by the family of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and focused on expanding school choice through charter schools, vouchers and private school scholarships, made it their top priority in the state.Charles Koch and five members of the DeVos family have each given the maximum $5,100 to Ducey\u2019s gubernatorial campaign this year, according to filings with the secretary of state.When the expansion of vouchers passed in 2017, DeVos tweeted congratulations from her official account: \u201cA big win for students & parents in Arizona tonight.... I applaud Gov. @DougDucey for putting kids first.\u201dFor weeks after leaders of Save Our Schools delivered their petitions to the secretary of state, a phalanx of activists from Americans for Prosperity and the American Federation for Children submitted multiple daily objections to individual signatures, according to Roopali Hardin Desai, an attorney who represented S.O.S. When the state nonetheless certified more than enough signatures as valid, lawyers representing the Koch network filed legal challenges that went all the way to the State Supreme Court but ultimately failed. Desai estimated that the voucher proponents spent as much as $500,000 on legal fees. But since Arizona law does not require such groups, known as social-welfare organizations, to disclose expenditures or individual donors in campaigns over ballot access, she said, \u201cI have no idea where it came from, who was paying or how much it was.\u201dThe school-choice movement in Arizona has fought to keep charter and private schools lightly regulated, arguing that too much state oversight would stifle innovation. In 2017, the Grand Canyon Institute, a nonprofit research organization, found that more than 77 percent of charter schools in Arizona use state funds to do business with for-profit companies owned by the charter holder, a member of the charter board or their relatives. With 18 percent of Arizona public school students in charters, the highest percentage of any state, David Wells, the institute\u2019s research director, reported that charters spent half a billion dollars in 2013-14 on these \u201crelated-party\u201d transactions, which are illegal in public school districts.One charter engaging in related-party transactions is Benjamin Franklin Charter School, owned by State Representative Eddie Farnsworth, a Republican, who has received regular infusions of campaign support from the American Federation for Children \u2014 more than $8,000 in his recent primary campaign, according to filings with the Arizona secretary of state. Farnsworth, who votes on charter school legislation despite his direct interest in one, owns a real estate firm from which B.F.C.S. leases its four campuses, according to records assembled by a watchdog group, Arizonans for Charter School Accountability. When the group complained that B.F.C.S. does not hold board meetings, the Arizona attorney general\u2019s office found that the state\u2019s open-meetings law does not apply because Farnsworth is the board\u2019s only member.Steve Yarbrough, the president of the Arizona Senate, a Republican who is retiring this year, was for years the prime legislative champion of the state program that provides tax credits for donations to private school scholarships. He also benefited personally from it. By law, donations go directly to so-called School Tuition Organizations, which then award the scholarships, and Yarbrough was until January the executive director of the state\u2019s biggest S.T.O., the Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization. (He was succeeded by his son Scott.) Under Arizona law, S.T.O.s can keep 10 percent of all donations. A.C.S.T.O. paid Yarbrough $129,649 in fiscal year 2017. A.C.S.T.O., a nonprofit, outsourced services like data entry and information processing to a for-profit company that Yarbrough co-owned with his wife and another couple. That company charged the nonprofit $672,453 in 2017 and millions of dollars combined over the previous decade. The Arizona Republic reported in 2015 that Yarbrough, in addition, was A.C.S.T.O.\u2019s landlord, receiving $52,000 a year in rent.He also served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee.\u201cIt\u2019s blatant that a number of lawmakers have something to make off of charters and private schools,\u201d said an infuriated Aidan Balt, the formerly Republican teacher who changed her registration. \u201cWho puts up with that? We do! Arizonans put up with that!\u201dAs a result of the increase approved by the Legislature \u2014 with a huge shove from Red for Ed \u2014 Berg got a $6,000 annual raise, the biggest of her career. Her husband recently got a new job with generous health benefits. Beginning Oct. 1, for the first time in years, she\u2019ll no longer be carrying the whole family of six on her health plan, adding $1,600 a month to her take-home pay. That, with her raise, allowed her to quit the community college job that had taken her away from her children three nights a week.Out on the campaign trail, Ducey was touting the pay raise as a signal accomplishment, along with other increases in state support to school districts. In November, he faces the Democrat David Garcia, an education professor at Arizona State University who won the Aug. 28 primary with a ringing call for more education funding.Ducey emphasized in one appearance after another that he made these changes while standing firm against a tax increase. He criticized the Invest in Ed initiative to hike taxes on the rich, along with its underlying argument that Arizona needs to raise more revenue to fund public education adequately. He pointed out that surging economic growth in the last year helped finance the raises. \u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019d raise a tax when we have such overwhelming revenues coming into our general fund,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThat would be the equivalent of hanging out a sign in Arizona that we\u2019re no longer open for business.\u201dBut as soon as school reopened, teachers began filling Facebook with evidence of all that remained unaddressed. They wrote of children sweating in buildings with broken air-conditioners their districts couldn\u2019t afford to repair, of a special-ed class being held in a trailer with a bullet hole in it. They wrote of spending $400, $500 and even $1,500 of their own money on classroom supplies. Christine Marsh, the State Senate candidate, posted that she had 37 students in one freshman English class. \u201cTeachers have to solve systemic problems on their own,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this for years, but Arizona\u2019s children are entitled to a better system.\u201dBerg, who returned to Dobson High on Aug. 2, was in her empty math classroom for a prep period on Aug. 21 when a mass email showed up on her phone: The secretary of state had certified the Invest in Ed signatures, and the measure was officially on the Nov. 6 ballot. It now had a name: Proposition 207. \u201cI cried, I got goose bumps, I shared it on Facebook, I felt grateful for everyone who helped,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I got right to work\u201d on plans to mobilize support.In a stunning development, however, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled on Aug. 29 that Proposition 207 could not appear on the November ballot. The justices\u2019 finding was that the wording of the initiative inadvertently repealed the indexing of Arizona tax brackets to inflation and would eventually raise taxes on all Arizonans, not just the rich. Sponsors of Invest in Ed had successfully contested this interpretation in a lower court, but the justices found \u201ca significant danger of confusion or unfairness,\u201d invalidating the petitions signed by more than 270,000 Arizonans to put the tax increase on the November ballot. The order cannot be appealed.In a separate decision the same day, the justices upheld a lower-court ruling that invalidated petitions for the Outlaw Dirty Money initiative, disqualifying it from the ballot as well. The state director of the Kochs\u2019 A.F.P. was a plaintiff in the Outlaw Dirty Money case, and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry filed the challenge to Proposition 207. \u201cThis has been a great day for taxpayers,\u201d said Tom Jenney, an executive of the Arizona branch of A.F.P. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great day for everyone looking out for freedom.\u201dTeachers reacted with fury on the Arizona Educators United Facebook page, accusing \u201cDucey\u2019s stacked supreme court\u201d of subverting democracy. Ducey expanded the high court in 2016 from five to seven justices, of whom he has appointed three. Teachers of every political stripe called on one another to work in November to defeat all politicians opposed to more funding for education. \u201cThe ONLY way out of this . . . is to collectively \u2014 Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal \u2014 unite and vote for the same candidates,\u201d wrote Heather Gookin, a fourth-grade teacher and registered independent. \u201cIf politicians insist on inserting themselves into our classrooms, we need to insist that we let the right ones in.\u201dTeachers who last year couldn\u2019t identify their legislative district were crowdsourcing information on their state senators\u2019 and representatives\u2019 education records, their dark-money donors, their comments at meet-and-greet sessions. Whether Democrats, Republicans or independents, they said they were being deluged with requests for advice \u2014 from neighbors, friends, relatives, day care providers, kids\u2019 soccer coaches, gym buddies, even people at dog parks \u2014 on whom to support for governor and the Legislature.Berg said no one had ever asked her before how to vote in an election, nor could she have answered intelligently. But now she can, and she does. \u201cWe are educators who learn for a living and try to make a better world through our classrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we gather, focus, research and teach others what we have learned about Arizona politics?\u201d/\u2022/Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Once Looked Tough on Trade. Now Its Options Are Dwindling.", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, Mr. Trump has made his biggest move yet, announcing 10 percent tariffs starting in a week on $200 billion a year of Chinese goods. But this time, China can\u2019t match them all \u2014 and that crystallizes a growing problem for Beijing.China\u2019s responses have so far failed to thwart Mr. Trump\u2019s trade offensive, and with the White House amping up the fight again, Chinese leaders aren\u2019t sure how to respond, people briefed on economic policymaking discussions say.Chinese officials \u201care generally confused,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Hinojosa-Ojeda, a trade specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has been traveling around China speaking with officials, businesspeople and workers.\u201cThey don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he added. \u201cThey worry that the tit-for-tat model is playing into Trump\u2019s hands.\u201dChina does not import nearly enough from the United States to target $200 billion in American goods \u2014 let alone the additional $267 billion in Chinese goods that Mr. Trump has threatened to tax.Mr. Trump has said as much, and did so again at a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cChina has been taking advantage of the United States for a long time, and that\u2019s not happening anymore,\u201d he said.The Chinese public could see any effort to soothe tensions as capitulation. Some hard-liners want a more aggressive stance.Lou Jiwei, who retired as finance minister in 2016 but is still the head of the country\u2019s social security fund, suggested on Sunday that China could deliberately disrupt American companies\u2019 supply chains by halting the export of crucial components mostly made in China. But Chinese trade experts dismiss that idea as impractical and not the government\u2019s position.Chinese officials know what they don\u2019t want to do. They have rejected one idea that would replace the matching tariffs with a more sophisticated system, said the people briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the fragility of the deliberations. That response \u2014 discussed in detail within the Commerce Ministry and other agencies \u2014 would have led to lower tariffs on American goods in dollar terms, which could be seen as a fig leaf to the White House.That approach would have recognized a potentially expensive new reality for Beijing: The tariffs may be here to stay. Mr. Trump is suffering from weak approval ratings and could lose influence in congressional elections in November. Democrats have opposed most of his agenda, but many have supported his attacks on trade with China. Even if Mr. Trump leaves office in two years, there is little guarantee that his China trade policies will be changed.In Beijing, proponents of the new approach, which would scale down China\u2019s tariffs in dollar terms to reflect the lopsided trade imbalance between the two countries, say Chinese leaders could still revisit the idea because it offers them a way to contain the damage and soothe tensions.China\u2019s leaders \u201cdon\u2019t really want to engage in a dollar-for-dollar retaliation,\u201d said Yu Yongding, a prominent economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. \u201cTheir purpose is to stop this trade war.\u201dChina\u2019s other options are limited.Other moves have already served as warnings, like delays at Chinese ports. Ford Motor\u2019s Lincoln cars and other goods have sometimes been the subject of unusually lengthy customs inspections this summer, although the delays do not appear to have caused much financial harm.\u201cIt is certain that China will have other, invisible retaliation against the United States,\u201d said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at the Commerce Ministry\u2019s policy research and training academy.\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to build a reputation, and easy to harm a reputation,\u201d Mr. Mei said.China could also guide its currency to a weaker level against the dollar. It has already nudged the currency a bit lower, making Chinese goods cheaper in the United States and partly offsetting the tariffs. But a weaker currency would make China\u2019s imports more expensive, raise the risk of inflation and lead to a potentially damaging flight of money out of the country. It could also provoke further American retaliation.The trade war has hit only a small part of the Chinese economy for now, but the damage could add up. Higher tariffs on American goods raise the cost of essential imports like soybeans and microchips. China still derives a big chunk of growth from making smartphones, clothing, chemicals and a raft of other goods and selling them to Americans.The battle began when the United States imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines. It has led to a global tit-for-tat targeting billions of dollars of goods.The new plan that Chinese officials rejected in recent weeks could have been more warmly greeted by the White House.Under that plan, the United States and China would each levy tariffs based on proportions of trade rather than dollar amounts, people familiar with the discussions said. Because the United States imports nearly four times as much from China as it exports, that would lead to tariffs at different values.For example, the United States has already levied tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, one-tenth of what it imports from China. Instead of matching that with tariffs on $50 billion in American-made goods, China would levy tariffs on one-tenth of such goods, totaling $13 billion to $15 billion, depending on the details.Proponents of the plan say letting Washington impose more tariffs than Beijing would actually hurt the United States more because tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers and businesses in the countries that levy them.\u201cThe United States wants to hurt China by imposing tariffs on Chinese exports,\u201d Mr. Yu, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences economist, wrote in a journal in July. \u201cIn the end, it may be the United States itself\u201d that is hurt, he wrote.But other Chinese trade experts say tariffs on equal fractions of trade would be too big a compromise.\u201cIt\u2019s unrealistic, it\u2019s difficult in practice, it\u2019s not doable, and it\u2019s against basic trade rules,\u201d said Mr. Mei, the Commerce Ministry researcher.Elsie Chen and Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In the Balkans, Russia and the West Fight a Disinformation-Age Battle", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySKOPJE, Macedonia \u2014 As Macedonians prepare for the most important vote in their nation\u2019s history, scores of Facebook posts are urging voters to burn their ballots. Hundreds of new websites are calling for a boycott. And one news article, widely shared online, warns that Google may eliminate Macedonian from its list of recognized languages, depending on the vote.In a disinformation age, Macedonian and Western officials say the flurry of social media activity is just that \u2014 disinformation directed by Russian-backed groups trying to stoke fears and depress turnout in a vote that could put this Balkan nation on a path to join NATO.All have a simple message: It\u2019s now or never.On his way here on Monday, Mr. Mattis told reporters that Russia was financing \u201cinfluence campaigns\u201d to undermine the referendum. Appearing later with Mr. Zaev, Mr. Mattis did not mention Russia specifically, but spoke of the need to fight \u201cmalicious cyber activity that threatens our democracies.\u201dRussian officials have broadly denied that they are trying to affect the outcome of European elections. But Russian diplomats have made no secret of their opposition to further NATO expansion, arguing that it would destabilize the Balkans.\u201cOne of Russia\u2019s top foreign policy and security goals is to oppose NATO at every step,\u201d said James H. Mackey, who leads the Euro-Atlantic and global partnership office at NATO. \u201cAs long as they think they can make trouble, they will try to make trouble.\u201dCongress allocated money in January 2017 to fight Russian disinformation campaigns, including $8 million specifically for Macedonia. But the money did not arrive for more than a year, and it has yet to be effectively deployed, according to a Western official who agreed to speak about the subject only on the condition of anonymity. An additional $2 million, meant to promote the rule of law in Macedonia, which is still struggling with endemic corruption, had not arrived as of August, the official said.American officials also note that millions in security assistance flow to the country.NATO officials, for their part, say they provided information to help Macedonia counter the Russian campaign. \u201cWe see Russia is trying to meddle, to spread disinformation,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said in an interview. \u201cBut Russia is not winning.\u201dHe added that opinion polls continued to show majority support for the country\u2019s name change, despite the Russian campaign. The challenge, he said, was that Moscow \u201coperates on many different levels with many different tools.\u201dWhen he arrives in Skopje on Monday, Mr. Mattis will urge Macedonians to vote in the referendum. He will also emphasize the $5 million in annual security support the United States provides, Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, said.\u201cRussia seeks to convince the Macedonians that the West is going to abandon them, that Russia is the stable influence in the region,\u201d Mr. Pahon said. \u201cThat is just not true.\u201dChanging Macedonia\u2019s name and bringing the country into the alliance, Mr. Pahon said, would reduce Moscow\u2019s influence. \u201cMacedonian accession to NATO is one of Russia\u2019s worst nightmares,\u201d he added.In Macedonia, officials blame Russian-backed online groups for proliferating false articles and Facebook posts as a way to heighten social divisions, drive down participation and amplify public anger. This spring, football hooligans opposed to the name change clashed with police officers outside Parliament in Skopje \u2014 an episode quickly seized on by people who produced false stories claiming government brutality.\u201cThere is a famous Balkan singer, and they took an old picture of her beaten and bruised in a domestic violence incident, and tried to claim she was beaten by police at the protest,\u201d said Marko Troshanovski, who works for Societas Civilis, a research institute focused on promoting democracy. \u201cThe misinformation was later countered, but it was in the blood stream.\u201dAfter the clash, Mr. Zaev, the prime minister, blamed Moscow and expelled a Russian diplomat. In response, Oleg Shcherbak, the Russian ambassador to Macedonia, offered a stark warning.\u201cIf it came to a conflict between Russia and NATO,\u201d he warned ominously, \u201cyou will have the role of a legitimate target.\u201dAccording to Western officials, Moscow\u2019s primary goal is to depress turnout. If less than half of registered voters participate in the referendum, the issue is forced back to Parliament, undermining the popular mandate for a solution.To an outsider, the dispute can seem puzzling, but it has proved diplomatically explosive and intractable. Like so much in the Balkans, it is a conflict complicated by history and war.Western diplomats say that 40 new websites are popping up each day on Facebook to encourage people to boycott the referendum. These websites, originating outside the country, fit a pattern of Russian interference in other elections, diplomats say.In a country largely divided along ethnic lines, some websites deliberately stoke tensions with the country\u2019s ethnic Albanian minority, evoking memories of a yearlong armed conflict in 2001 between the government and a faction of Albanians.\u201cAre you going to let Albanians change your name?\u201d is a common theme.American intelligence officials say Russia has also co-opted local football fan clubs and motorcycle gangs opposed to the name change.\u201cThe Russians are pumping money into the opposition to the name agreement and supporting nationalistic politicians opposed to the deal,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, a former Obama administration official now at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.Assuming Macedonian voters agree to the name change, and Macedonia\u2019s Constitution is amended to reflect it, the deal would then be subject to approval by the Greek Parliament. Greek officials have also accused Moscow of interference and have responded by expelling two diplomats.\u201cThey are spending money in Greece, trying to add to the resistance to the Macedonia name issue,\u201d said Ben Hodges, a former United States Army commander in Europe, who is now at the Center for European Policy Analysis. \u201cWherever there is a seam or a crack, that is what they will exploit.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Mattis\u2019s visit on Monday is meant to signal American resolve \u2014 even as some Republicans in Washington are increasingly resistant to expanding NATO. Montenegro\u2019s membership was opposed by the Republican senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, and conservative publications have produced articles in recent weeks questioning the wisdom of further NATO expansion, specifically citing the case of Macedonia.\u201cThey may get aggressive, and, congratulations, you\u2019re in World War III,\u201d he said.Officials in Skopje nervously took note of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments but said that they believed the United States stood firmly behind their bid to join NATO.And the prime minister said his government had placed its \u201centire political capital to solve the dispute with Greece.\u201d\u201cThis is our big chance,\u201d Mr. Zaev said. \u201cCitizens know that the moment has to be seized. This is how they will shape their future and the future of our country.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect title for Jens Stoltenberg of NATO. He is the organization\u2019s secretary general, not its general secretary.Marc Santora reported from Skopje, Macedonia, and Julian E. Barnes from Washington.

{"Headline": "A Bitter Nominee, Questions of Neutrality, and a Damaged Supreme Court", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In the first round of his Supreme Court confirmation hearings early this month, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh kept his cool under hostile questioning, stressed his independence, and exhibited the calm judicial demeanor that characterized his dozen years on a prestigious appeals court bench.\u201cThe Supreme Court,\u201d he said, \u201cmust never be viewed as a partisan institution.\u201dHis performance on Thursday, responding to accusations of sexual misconduct at a hearing of the same Senate committee, sent a different message. Judge Kavanaugh was angry and emotional, embracing the language of slashing partisanship. His demeanor raised questions about his neutrality and temperament and whether the already fragile reputation of the Supreme Court as an institution devoted to law rather than politics would be threatened if he is confirmed.\u201cThis whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit,\u201d he said, \u201cfueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\u201dIn a sharp break with decorum, Judge Kavanaugh responded to questions about his drinking from two Democratic senators \u2014 Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island \u2014 with questions of his own about theirs. He later apologized to Ms. Klobuchar.The charged language recalled Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s years as a partisan Republican, working for Ken Starr, the independent counsel who investigated a series of scandals involving Bill and Hillary Clinton, and serving as an aide in the administration of George W. Bush. It was less consistent with the detached judicial temperament that lawyers associate with an ideal judge.But his confirmation, which had once seemed all but assured, faced another dramatic turn on Friday when Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona called for a one-week delay of the full Senate\u2019s vote on his nomination to allow for an investigation by the F.B.I. into the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford and other women.Ideology has long figured in the Supreme Court\u2019s work, but a sharp partisan split on the court is a recent phenomenon. Starting in 2010, the court became divided along party lines, with all five Republican appointees to the right of all four Democratic ones.Confirmation fights reflect this new reality. The court\u2019s two senior liberals, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, were confirmed with just a dozen negative votes between them. More recent nominees have faced furious opposition.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., a devoted custodian of the court\u2019s prestige and authority, has bemoaned the damage that even ordinary confirmation hearings do to his institution.Chief Justice Roberts spoke in the wake of a series of confirmation hearings tinged with partisanship but nothing like the all-out war the American public saw on Thursday. If the chief justice feared that the court\u2019s reputation could be damaged by them, he has reason to be terrified now.\u201cWe don\u2019t work as Democrats or Republicans,\u201d he said in the 2016 remarks, \u201cand I think it\u2019s a very unfortunate impression the public might get from the confirmation process.\u201dThe Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the man she alleges assaulted her while they were in high school, revealed several details in their stories that do not match up.As it happens, a reliable way to predict how justices will vote in highly charged cases is to check the political party of the president who appointed them. There was one exception to that rule in recent decades: Justice Anthony M. Kennedy could be unpredictable.Justice Kennedy was nominated in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan after his first pick, Judge Robert H. Bork, was rejected by the Senate. Many scholars trace the divisiveness of contemporary Supreme Court nominations to the resentments that began with Judge Bork\u2019s confirmation hearings.Justice Kennedy replaced Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who also occupied a seat at the court\u2019s ideological center. But if Judge Kavanaugh replaces Justice Kennedy, there is little question that he will move the court to the right.A confirmation hearing is not a courtroom, of course, but experts in law and psychology said there was reason to fear that Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s searing reaction to the recent accusations could affect his work should he be confirmed to the Supreme Court.\u201cThis process clearly has ignited a passionate reaction in Judge Kavanaugh that will doubtless influence him for the rest of his life,\u201d Professor Rachlinski said. \u201cResearch on how emotions influence judges suggests that he will be unable to set this experience aside when deciding cases involving relevant subjects or parties who are closely aligned with those he has today treated as personal enemies.\u201d\u201cHis time in the executive branch and his work for Starr suggested he was one of the most partisan nominees in a long time,\u201d Professor Segall said.\u201cI would think that any person, even acting in totally good faith, would not be able to put aside the obvious trauma of this hearing for him, whether he\u2019s telling the truth, lying or suffering from cognitive dissonance,\u201d Professor Segall said. \u201cThis kind of event could greatly affect one\u2019s decision making in the gray areas that most Supreme Court cases present.\u201dIn 1991, in a hearing with distinct echoes of the one on Thursday, Judge Clarence Thomas vehemently and categorically denied accusations that he had sexually harassed a subordinate, Anita F. Hill.He was in the bathtub when he learned that the Senate had confirmed him by a 52-to-48 vote. \u201cWhoop-dee-damn-doo,\u201d he said, according to his memoir. His reputation had been destroyed, he wrote. \u201cMere confirmation, even to the Supreme Court,\u201d he wrote, \u201cseemed pitifully small compensation for what had been done to me.\u201dA bitter Justice Thomas went on to become the most conservative member of the Supreme Court in modern history.Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.\u2019s confirmation hearings in 2006 were far less bruising than the ones endured by Justice Thomas and Judge Kavanaugh. But they were painful enough that Justice Alito has said he avoids walking by the Senate building where his hearings were held.Justice Alito, too, has forged a consistently conservative voting record. And in 2010, he mouthed the words \u201cnot true\u201d at a State of the Union address in which President Barack Obama criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Citizens United campaign finance case. That overt clash, with a Democratic president on one side and a Republican appointee on the other, was another sign of a deepening partisan divide.On Thursday, Judge Kavanaugh made plain how devastating the accusations against him were and whom he blamed: Democratic senators. He described the pleasure he had taken in teaching law at Harvard, where he was a highly regarded visiting professor hired by Justice Elena Kagan when she was the law school\u2019s dean.\u201cThanks to what some of you on this side of the committee unleashed,\u201d Judge Kavanaugh said on Thursday, looking at the Democrats, \u201cI may never be able to teach again.\u201dIt is not easy to trace precisely how the confirmation process affects a justice\u2019s work, Professor Dorf said.\u201cI don\u2019t think Justice Thomas is consumed by anger,\u201d Professor Dorf said. \u201cBut it\u2019s there, and it comes out from time to time.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh, too, if he joins the Supreme Court, might occasionally employ an extra measure of skepticism in considering arguments in favor of congressional power or put forward by a future Democratic administration, Professor Dorf said.\u201cIt will be impossible to demonstrate a straight line in any given case,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s got to affect him.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It\u2019s a particularly challenging question this year, since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate, we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races, this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.All estimates based on 500 interviewsJust because one candidate leads in all of these different turnout scenarios doesn\u2019t mean much by itself. They don\u2019t represent the full range of possible turnout scenarios, let alone the full range of possible election results.Even if we got turnout exactly right, the margin of error wouldn\u2019t capture all of the error in a poll.

He has created special classes such as Theme Parks and Tourism, and drawn material from his trips as a self-described coaster nut: a serial rider with few peers when it comes to amassing visits to different coasters around the country and the world.The constant travel might seem unaffordable on a public university professor\u2019s salary, were it not for the generosity of his wife, Dr. Cheryl Lewison, who shares his coaster affinity and his impressive riding totals.Dr. Lewison left a corporate law career to pursue medicine, and is now an emergency room doctor at Queens Hospital Center. Her income helps finance the trips.\u201cI thank my lucky stars every day \u2014 I definitely hit the jackpot\u201d in marrying Dr. Lewison, he said. \u201cI remember I told my father that I met a woman who was a lawyer and a doctor. He said, \u201cYou marry that girl tonight.\u2019\u201dBoth grew up riding coasters, but their joint pursuit began in earnest in 2007, about a year into their marriage. Early on, they could rack up nearly 200 coasters a year by hitting jackpot sites like Cedar Point park in Ohio, where they could ride a dozen coasters in one trip. Then they began hitting coasters all over the world.\u201cHe said that when we got to 1,000 coasters, we\u2019d stop,\u201d she said, \u201cand conveniently, he forgot.\u201dThey visited 125 last year, Mr. Lewison said, and this year\u2019s expeditions have ranged from New Zealand to the Jersey Shore. In coming months, they plan on hitting amusement parks in the Middle East and Vietnam, not to mention the Halloween festivities at Great Adventure in New Jersey.They have traveled to China six times and ridden more than 150 coasters there, said Mr. Lewison, who recently tried planning a marathon trip to a series of obscure Chinese parks involving constant flights.\u201cBut my wife said, \u2018We\u2019re going to die in a plane crash and people will say, \u2018What were they thinking?\u2019\u201d he saidMr. Lewison grew up in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., cutting his teeth on smaller rides at nearby Palisades Park \u2014 which is long gone \u2014 and then on coasters such as Lightnin\u2019 Loops at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, the Dragon Coaster at Rye Playland in Westchester County, and the Cyclone in Coney Island.His obsession blossomed by age 13 when he traveled to Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Va., and rode the Loch Ness Monster 22 times in one day, he said.His coaster craze cooled after hearing about the fire in 1984 that killed eight teenagers at the Haunted Castle at Six Flags, but it resurfaced while he pursued a doctorate in business in the 1990s at the University of Pittsburgh, thanks to the coasters at nearby Kennywood amusement park.In his Theme Parks class last week, he apologized for not being quite up to speed.

Putin. He is also a major investor in a satellite imagery firm that has a license from the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., to handle classified information.Less well known is Mr. Nikolaev\u2019s role providing money for a Kremlin-backed project to develop night-vision technology that the military sought after Western sanctions made it difficult to obtain. Mr. Nikolaev\u2019s role was obscured by complex transactions involving offshore companies and Mr. Beseda, the documents show.The emails described the project as \u201cone of several priority lines of development\u201d approved by Mr. Putin, saying it would counter an advantage enjoyed by \u201cthe troops of our probable enemy \u2014 NATO.\u201d\u201cThe project closes one of the main strategic technological gaps in the defense capability and technological independence of the Russian Federation,\u201d Dmitry Rogozin, then deputy prime minister, said in a 2013 letter.A spokesman for Mr. Nikolaev did not deny the billionaire\u2019s role in the night-vision enterprise, but downplayed its significance, saying he \u201conce invested in a private-sector defense technology project, but it went nowhere and he ended his involvement with it in 2015.\u201d\u201cMore to the point, Mr. Nikolaev is not connected to Russia\u2019s security services,\u201d said the spokesman, Jeffrey H. Birnbaum.Mr. Nikolaev, 47, maintains a low profile in the Russian oligarchy, but he was thrown into the spotlight when his name surfaced in connection with the Butina case.Federal prosecutors say that Ms. Butina, 29, conspired with a Russian government official and an American political operative to seek back channels between Moscow and Republicans, including members of the Trump campaign, who were sympathetic to improving relations with Russia. In court filings, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said her activities were part of an influence operation, citing her \u201cconnection to suspected Russian intelligence operatives.\u201dThe F.B.I. also said that Ms. Butina\u2019s emails and text messages referred to an oligarch with \u201cdeep ties to the Russian presidential administration\u201d who served as her \u201cfunder.\u201d The oligarch was not named in court documents, but the description matches Mr. Nikolaev, and several people familiar with the case have confirmed his role.Worth slightly more than $1 billion, Mr. Nikolaev, together with two partners, owns about a third of Globaltrans, one of Russia\u2019s largest rail car operators, and the trio recently sold a major stake in a port business. He also sits on the board of American Ethane, a Houston-based energy company, and has invested in business ventures with Igor Rotenberg, the son of Arkady Rotenberg, a close childhood friend of Mr. Putin\u2019s.Mr. Beseda did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, he has not denied the authenticity of the emails.The business plan described Mr. Nikolaev as a private \u201cco-investor\u201d who would put up roughly $12 million. Other funds would come from a government research institute and a large state-owned development bank.The plan did not explain that Mr. Nikolaev\u2019s investment would filter through offshore companies registered in the British Virgin Islands, Cyprus and Seychelles. Those firms entered into transactions with other offshore shells involving Mr. Beseda, who took over Mr. Nikolaev\u2019s stake by 2016, according to the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta.There they met Svetlana Nikolaeva, Mr. Nikolaev\u2019s wife, who is the head of Orsis\u2019s parent company, Promtechnologies Group. The 2013 business plan for the night-vision project stated that Mr. Nikolaev \u201ccontrols the Promtechnologies Group who owns Orsis brand,\u201d and that Promtechnologies \u201cis ready to buy significant amounts of the project products.\u201dAt various times, Promtechnologies executives have included Alexander Beseda, another son of the F.S.B. general, and Alexey Rogozin, the son of the former deputy prime minister.

Mr. Trump, speaking at a news conference, claimed that he had rebuffed a request from the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for a meeting and criticized Canada\u2019s trade negotiator, Chrystia Freeland, the foreign affairs minister. \u201cWe don\u2019t like their representative very much,\u201d Mr. Trump said.Mr. Mnuchin struck a more diplomatic tone, noting the importance of the trade relationship with Canada and expressing optimism that the few remaining \u201copen items\u201d could be settled.\u201cWe reached a deal with Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we be able to reach a deal with Canada?\u201dThe sputtering Nafta negotiations have rattled the nerves of members of Congress whose constituents depend on trade relationships with both Canada and Mexico.Still, the White House is expected to release text of the deal it struck with Mexico as early as Friday, a development that suggests the White House is not going to wait for Canada to sign on to the deal.Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, met with key lawmakers on Thursday to deliver what senators said was a pessimistic assessment of the state of negotiations with Canada. But he left several questions unanswered, including whether Mr. Trump was prepared to pull out of Nafta if Canada did not sign a new agreement \u2014 and what rules would presumably govern trade with Canada in the event that Congress passed a Mexico-only agreement.Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, told reporters that Mr. Lighthizer had told lawmakers that the United States and Canada remained far apart on negotiations. \u201cI\u2019m not at all optimistic at the moment,\u201d Mr. Thune said.Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, said that it was possible for Canada to join the agreement with Mexico by November, even if the administration submits bilateral text to Congress this week. But any agreement, she said, \u201cneeds to be North America, to be the most effective.\u201dCongressional staff members cautioned that the administration would find little support on Capitol Hill for a deal that excluded Canada entirely, and that there was little appetite for pulling out of Nafta without a trilateral agreement to replace it. They also said that the agreement with Mexico alone would be unlikely to move to a vote in the House if Democrats win control of the chamber in November\u2019s elections.Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said that an agreement that excluded Canada would be much harder to pass in the Senate because it might not qualify for the trade protection authority provisions that would allow such a measure to be ratified with just 51 votes.While some Senate Democrats agree with some of Mr. Trump\u2019s goals on revising Nafta, they made clear on Thursday that they would punish him politically for excluding Canada.\u201cIt would be a monumental mistake to do this without Canada,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s basically surrendering on fixing Nafta.\u201dRepresentative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, said that Mr. Lighthizer had told him that he would be releasing text of the agreement with Mexico this weekend and that he was hopeful that Canada would come on board after its provincial elections in early October. Mr. Doggett said he was not ready to say if he would reject an agreement with just Mexico, but said he had urged Mr. Lighthizer to keep working on the Canadians.\u201cThose supply chains are very important, and it\u2019s important that this not devolve into a bilateral agreement,\u201d Mr. Doggett said.One staff member said Mr. Lighthizer had raised the possibility of imposing additional tariffs on Canada similar to the ones Mr. Trump has placed on China in the event that the Canadians cannot come to an agreement with the United States. The United States has so far put tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods like machinery, electronics and fish.Canada is already incensed over the administration\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs, which Mr. Trump put into effect earlier this year. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, is angry about Canada\u2019s dairy tariffs and has threatened to tax Canadian-made cars if they do not allow American dairy farmers greater access.Mr. Trudeau was undeterred on Thursday, saying Canada would not bend to the United States demands, including elimination of a dispute settlement mechanism that allows Nafta countries to challenge each other outside the nations\u2019 official court systems.\u201cThe Americans are finding that the negotiations are tough because Canadians are tough negotiators, as we should be,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said in Ottawa. \u201cBut a good, fair deal is still very possible.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sloan Kettering\u2019s Cozy Deal With Start-Up Ignites a New Uproar", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization.An artificial intelligence start-up founded by three insiders at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center debuted with great fanfare in February, with $25 million in venture capital and the promise that it might one day transform how cancer is diagnosed.Memorial Sloan Kettering holds an equity stake in Paige.AI, as does a member of the cancer center\u2019s executive board, the chairman of its pathology department and the head of one of its research laboratories. Three other board members are investors.At a staff meeting Thursday morning, Dr. Thompson and others, including Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, the acting physician-in-chief who replaced Dr. Baselga, described the recent events as a disruption and acknowledged that the hospital was under a microscope, according to several people who attended. Doctors said they were concerned about a lack of communication from hospital leadership, and one said patients were nervous that their health data was being commercialized by the institution.Hospital pathologists have strongly objected to the Paige.AI deal, saying it is unfair that the founders received equity stakes in a company that relies on the pathologists\u2019 expertise and work amassed over 60 years. They also questioned the use of patients\u2019 data \u2014 even if it is anonymous \u2014 without their knowledge in a profit-driven venture.In addition, experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance have questioned whether Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation\u2019s leading cancer centers, complied with federal and state law governing nonprofits when it set up the deal. The experts pointed out that charitable institutions like Memorial Sloan Kettering must show that they didn\u2019t provide assets to insiders for less than the fair market value.Cancer center officials said that they acted properly in approving the deal with Paige.AI and that if successful, the venture could change the future of cancer diagnosis. \u201cThis is an incredibly expensive undertaking \u2014 it needs a lot of money,\u201d Dr. Gregory Raskin, the hospital\u2019s vice president of technology development, said in an interview. \u201cWe feel this is a really valuable and important technology to get developed.\u201dOfficials said that some board members invested only after early efforts to generate interest from outside companies and investors had failed. But they acknowledged that they did not seek an independent valuation of the tissue archive, nor did they put the proposal out for competitive bidding before licensing it to a single company. In exchange for sharing its voluminous database, Memorial Sloan Kettering received ownership shares amounting to about nine percent in the company.\u201cIt just seems awfully coincidental that the individuals involved happen to be people in control and influence of that asset, and they ended up with an exclusive use of it,\u201d said Marcus S. Owens, a Washington lawyer who ran the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt organizations. \u201cIt seems to create a cascading series of conflicts for the operation of Sloan Kettering.\u201dThe decision to license images of the patients\u2019 tissue slides to a for-profit company also highlights the broader debate over the use of personal medical data, ranging from genetic information to, in this case, images of a person\u2019s cells, for research and commercial purposes.After ProPublica and The Times began asking questions about the arrangement, one of the founders \u2014 Dr. David Klimstra, the chairman of the pathology department \u2014 said he would divest his ownership stake.The Paige.AI project finally took off after enlisting the help of Norman Selby, a member of the hospital board\u2019s executive committee and a longtime health care consultant, manager and investor. He is listed as a founder and executive chairman of Paige.AI and holds an equity stake.The three other hospital board members who became investors are Stanley Druckenmiller, Alexander T. Robertson and Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis, according to Richard Beattie, honorary chairman of the cancer center\u2019s board and a member of its executive committee. \u201cWe were desperate,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis is more risky than most transactions, and we couldn\u2019t find investors.\u201dThe board investors in Paige.AI, and Mr. Breyer, either declined to comment or did not return calls and emails. Mr. Selby has pledged to donate some of his profits to the hospital, Mr. Beattie said.Experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance questioned whether Memorial Sloan Kettering, which is a charity, acted properly in what is known as a related party transaction with the founders of Paige.AI.While federal law does not specifically require seeking bids from competitors or independent appraisals of the assets in such a transaction, nonprofit groups that make deals with companies associated with board members or employees must demonstrate that they have taken steps to ensure that insiders don\u2019t get preferential treatment. If nonprofits are found not to have complied, they or the individuals involved could face tax repercussions.Mr. Beattie said the hospital relied on some investors to set a value for licensing the slides, with guidance from hedge fund leaders on its board. A law firm, which he did not identify, evaluated the documents and said it was a good deal.Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors who has written books about corporate governance, said the center\u2019s process was \u201cinadequate.\u201d\u201cThey could be throwing a dart at the wall to figure out what the valuation is,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re accepting somebody\u2019s word for it and that\u2019s very, very risky.\u201dMr. Beattie said the cancer center would follow I.R.S. rules requiring it to list the transaction on financial forms, which won\u2019t be public until next year. He also said the hospital had set up plans to manage conflicts for the three company founders. All four members who are invested, including Mr. Selby, must recuse themselves from any board actions about the company, Mr. Beattie said. A review of the hospital\u2019s I.R.S. filings does not show any similar transactions in recent years.In two meetings this month, staff pathologists confronted hospital leaders over the cancer center\u2019s relationship with Paige.AI, some of them angered by the deal that would allow others to profit from their work.At a tense meeting Sept. 12, some pathologists said they only learned about the deal online after it was announced, two people in attendance said.As for how the deal came about, Dr. Klimstra told colleagues that Google had twice approached the hospital about securing access to the pathology slides and was turned down. Mr. Beattie said there were never serious conversations with Google. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.Doctors also expressed concerns about whether patients had consented to have images of their tissue used in this way.Dr. Klimstra told them the project had been approved by an institutional review board, which considers ethical issues involving patients. Patients who had not given their consent to having their readings shared would have all personal health information stripped from the images and notes, he said. Dr. Raskin said that between 30 to 40 percent of patients typically do not consent.And Paige.AI will not have exclusive access to slides that resulted from federally funded research, he added.It then says, \u201c(contemplate consulting fees, repeat with feeling.)\u201dIn an interview last week, Dr. Rosenblum said he wasn\u2019t seeking financial compensation, but felt \u201cthe leadership had not been particularly transparent with us about the founding of this company, and I feel that we were not sufficiently credited with what had been our intellectual input in this.\u201dKathryn Martin, the hospital\u2019s chief operating officer, said the cancer center did not anticipate the pathologists\u2019 objections. \u201cI think we could have done a better job communicating it,\u201d she said in an interview.Dr. Klimstra said in a statement that the project represented a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in the pathology field.\u201cOther than my family, there is nothing more important to me than running my department,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cI sincerely regret the fact that my equity ownership in Paige has served as a distraction to my primary leadership role at M.S.K.\u201dDr. Fuchs, the head of the computational pathology lab, defended his role in a separate statement. \u201cComputer scientists like myself very seldom get the chance to really help patients,\u201d he said.Details for distributing any profits or proceeds from Paige.AI have not been worked out, officials said. Ms. Martin suggested that if the deal is successful, some funds could be set aside for the pathology department to finance research projects.For now, much of the talk is theoretical \u2014 the company is years away from selling a finished product, with a staff of fewer than 20 employees.The roster of other key advisers also appears to be in flux. Until recently, Dr. Baselga was listed as the chairman of Paige\u2019s scientific advisory board. But his name disappeared from the company\u2019s website last week, the day after he resigned from Memorial Sloan Kettering. He also recently resigned from board positions at the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a radiation equipment manufacturer.Charles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.

The position gave Lloyd authority over unaccompanied minors caught crossing into the United States, authority Lloyd exploited to try to stop pregnant migrants from getting abortions.It\u2019s fitting that last week\u2019s Kavanaugh confirmation hearings were regularly interrupted by the sound of women screaming.

Brigitte Amiri, an A.C.L.U. lawyer who represented the girl, was stunned, because it seemed clear that Doe, who\u2019d already obtained the necessary judicial signoff, had the law on her side. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I was expecting from any judge that would have read Roe v. Wade,\u201d Amiri said of the ruling. \u201cConservatives, progressives, anyone.\u201dIndeed, a few days later, the full court reversed the panel\u2019s decision. Kavanaugh, dissenting, wrote that \u201cthe government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life.\u201dBy the time Jane Doe got her abortion, she was 15 weeks pregnant and needed a more complicated second-trimester procedure. On Friday, Rochelle Garza, a lawyer who served as Doe\u2019s temporary legal guardian during the proceedings, testified at Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings.\u201cShe was one of the most vulnerable people in our community,\u201d Garza said of the girl, adding, \u201cShe was an immigrant, she didn\u2019t speak English, she was in detention, and she was being put under extreme pressure. And I felt it was unfortunate that Judge Kavanaugh did not take that into consideration.\u201dPoliticians sometimes say that they are personally opposed to abortion, but believe it should be legal. Trump and some of his enablers reverse that formulation.A famous pro-choice poster from the 1980s proclaimed, \u201cYour body is a battleground.\u201d Kavanaugh is likely to join the Supreme Court because in 2016, the woman whom most women voted for was defeated.

He saw it as another sign.\u201cIt just felt right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lunch wasn\u2019t a very good lunch. There were awkward pauses and we both didn\u2019t finish our food. But when we left, we shared a kiss. Just a peck on the lips but that\u2019s when I knew she felt the same way I did.\u201dCaroline Baumann and John Stewart Malcolmson met in 2011 on howaboutwe.com, a dating website that proposed two people get together for an activity rather than, strictly speaking, just a date. But the couple\u2019s connection was even more coincident than is usually the case with these things, as neither put more than a modicum of effort into their profile.In fact, Mr. Malcolmson stumbled onto the site because he was looking for an elegant user-interface design for a job he was working on. He signed up and went through the process of creating an account primarily so that he could assess the site\u2019s technical merits.Ms. Baumann had a similar lack of enthusiasm when the website popped up on her screen as a new offering.\u201cI thought, what the hell, I\u2019ve dated half of New York,\u201d Ms. Baumann said. \u201cI gave it no time at all, because I have no time, and then, voil\u00e0! He\u2019s the man of my life.\u201dMs. Baumann was drawn to Mr. Malcolmson\u2019s interest in the subjects that consume her own life \u2014 inspirational art and design \u2014 and though he found not much to go on in her profile, he was nonetheless intrigued.Mr. Malcolmson proposed that the two try a tennis match, but Ms. Baumann nixed that suggestion, leery of being committed to two hours if it turned out that she wasn\u2019t interested after all. So they agreed instead to go the Gagosian Gallery together, to see an exhibit of Andreas Gursky\u2019s satellite images.It was a brilliant move, as, Ms. Baumann explained, \u201cthe premise of our union is centered on art and design. It\u2019s what glues us together.\u201dThere was immediate chemistry between the two, and as neither wanted the date to end, they moved on to tapas and a glass of wine afterward.\u201cI was struck by her energy, her joie de vivre,\u201d Mr. Malcolmson said.

{"Headline": "The Supreme Court Is Coming Apart", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not just the Kavanaugh mess. Over the long term, the court risks a crisis of legitimacy.Opinion ColumnistThe Supreme Court is an unusual institution, because it somehow manages to be both majestic and intimate.The court is housed in a marble temple with soaring columns, and it has made some of the most consequential decisions in American history. But it feels like a simpler institution than either the presidency or Congress. Its arguments are not televised but are open to the public. Spectators are often surprised by the courtroom\u2019s modest size. Outside the court, the nine justices tend to lead more normal day-to-day lives than senators, governors or other grandees.This combination has long allowed the court to embody the American ideal of democratic government \u2014 powerful yet humble \u2014 and many people have revered it as a result.But today the Supreme Court is in trouble. And the issues are much larger than the mess of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. Absent some kind of course correction, the court risks a crisis of legitimacy.[Receive the day's most urgent debates right in your inbox by subscribing to the Opinion Today newsletter.]And the biggest damage from the court\u2019s partisanship doesn\u2019t even come from the nasty confirmation battles. It comes from the fact that a major American institution defines itself in an evidently false way. Hypocrisy isn\u2019t good for credibility.The second major threat to the court comes from the radicalness of Republican-appointed justices.Already, the Roberts court has often shown itself to be zealously activist. It has thrown out bipartisan legislation on voting rights and campaign finance. It has overruled decades-old precedents on labor unions, antitrust and criminal justice.So what can be done about the court? There are no easy solutions.A less palatable option is for Democrats to expand the court when they next control Washington. Given the outrage of the Garland nomination, Democrats are right to be thinking about this. But I hope they don\u2019t have to resort to it, because it would risk a tit-for-tat battle that could do even more damage.Roberts is never going to turn into a liberal. But it is reasonable to hope that he will show more of the small-c conservatism that the Supreme Court needs. If he allows it to become an all-powerful version of Congress where the legislators happen to wear robes, both his legacy and the country will suffer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: In \u2018The Land of Steady Habits,\u2019 Suburban Malaise, With a Twist", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American suburb is zoned for ambivalence. Neither city nor country, suburbia \u2014 at least in the imagination of too many novelists, filmmakers and songwriters to count \u2014 yokes affluence to alienation. Beyond the well-kept lawns and hedges are seething hives of adultery, anomie and addiction. These pathologies may not actually be more common along the commuter rail lines than anywhere else, but there is an imposing body of literature that insists otherwise.Leaving his gracious old colonial in the care of his ex-wife, Helene (Edie Falco), Anders says that he has decided to give \u201ccondo living\u201d a try. To feather his bachelor nest, he wanders through retail stores soliciting decorating tips from women \u2014 customers and salespeople alike \u2014 and then sleeping with them. It doesn\u2019t seem like much fun, for him or his partners, but it\u2019s a way of passing the time.Anders may have quit the rat race, but he can\u2019t seem to stay away from the track. He goes to parties where he runs into Helene, and pursues awkward conversations with old friends who are less than delighted to be in his company. Helene has moved on to a new man (Bill Camp), which bothers Anders more than he would like to admit. He tries to maintain a semblance of paternal authority with his drifting, post-collegiate son, Preston (Thomas Mann), and indulges in some desperate adolescent behavior with another young man, Charlie (Charlie Tahan), who takes a lot of drugs.Nobody seems to like Anders all that much, and he doesn\u2019t really care. He acts less like a man in free fall than like a guy who\u2019s got it all figured out, which has the effect of making him at once pitiable, infuriating and kind of mysterious. Maybe he is privy to some kind of esoteric knowledge. Or maybe he\u2019s just a shallow jerk embracing his true identity.\u201cThe Land of Steady Habits\u201d (Connecticut\u2019s longstanding unofficial nickname) is not only Anders\u2019s story, though his self-centeredness can make it feel that way. As he stumbles toward either a bright new beginning or a total flameout \u2014 the first foreshadowed by a tentative romance with Barbara (Connie Britton), the second by his age-inappropriate semi-friendship with Charlie \u2014 other lives are illuminated, and also singed, by his wayward comet\u2019s path. His blithe clumsiness contributes to, and directly causes, a lot of hurt, visited especially on the next generation. Middle-aged guys may muddle through, but young men like Preston and Charlie risk losing their way, and even their lives.The darkness and pain haunting Westport are more pronounced \u2014 and maybe for that reason less affecting \u2014 than the melancholy and quiet rage that figure in Ms. Holofcener\u2019s other movies. The suburban setting is acutely rendered, but it also feels a little secondhand, with not as much room for invention and oddness than the New York and Los Angeles of \u201cLovely and Amazing,\u201d \u201cFriends with Money\u201d and \u201cPlease Give.\u201dBut within these constraints, the performances have sufficient grit \u2014 and the writing has just enough polish \u2014 to make \u201cThe Land of Steady Habits\u201d feel unpredictable and fresh. Mr. Mendelsohn, who looks and speaks as if he were perpetually sucking on a cough drop, makes no overt gestures either in the direction of likability or awfulness. Anders can be thoughtless and casually cruel (after sex with Barbara, for example), and he can also be affable and honest. That it\u2019s hard to tell the difference is a credit to the actor, who all but dares us to give up on the character altogether.And the film\u2019s strength is that it holds this out as a real possibility, taking seriously the proposition that redemption may be out of reach. In most versions of the suburban male midlife crisis story, the protagonist comes by our sympathy as if it were a birthright or a secular manifestation of grace. In Ms. Holofcener\u2019s secular, implicitly feminist revision, Anders has no such entitlement. He\u2019s stuck with himself, as everyone else \u2014 the audience included \u2014 is stuck with him. We make the best of it, and in this case \u201cthe best\u201d is a very fine movie.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ten Years Ago, Wall Street Collapsed. These Reporters Told the Story.", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by In late July 2008, the secretary of the United States Treasury, Henry M. Paulson, came to The New York Times for a meeting with reporters and editors.It had been a topsy-turvy seven months \u2014 after the Dow Jones industrial average hit a then-record peak of 14,198 in October 2007, the housing market, which had been inflated by $600 billion of subprime loans, collapsed. Mr. Paulson arrived at The Times after several major financial upheavals, including the collapse of the mortgage lender IndyMac, and the government-sweetened acquisition of the investment bank Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase.But on that July day, Mr. Paulson told the assembled group that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance companies that owned or guaranteed roughly $5 trillion in home morgage debt, were financially secure. \u201cThe visit\u2019s unstated mission was to reassure us that the government had things under control,\u201d Lawrence Ingrassia, then The Times\u2019s business editor, remembered.Mr. Paulson\u2019s answers, though, were halting and rambling \u2014 a performance Mr. Ingrassia recalled as \u201cquite unconvincing.\u201dAfter the meeting, Mr. Ingrassia remembered telling a colleague, \u201cI\u2019m more worried now about how bad things are than before Hank came in.\u201dThen, in September, the government seized control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, placing both in a conservatorship. Nearly $190 billion was ultimately injected into the companies. This was the moment in which months of uncertainty in the markets finally crystallized, marking the start of a financial panic as severe, by some measures, as the Great Depression.On Friday, Sept. 12, Eric Dash, then a banking reporter, was working on an article about the unease at Lehman Brothers, which many expected would be the next investment bank to collapse. He was at Bobby Van\u2019s Steakhouse on West 50th Street, hoping to find \u201csome Lehman bankers drowning in their sorrows\u201d and was planning to write about the last days at Lehman.As he was talking to a despondent employee, Mr. Dash received an unexpected phone call from a source. The chief executive officer at the source\u2019s firm, a major Wall Street bank, had been summoned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Journalists on The Times\u2019s Business desk canceled all plans. Mr. Sorkin\u2019s grandfather, Sidney, died that Friday. \u201cI asked my father if I should keep working,\u201d said Mr. Sorkin, \u201cand he said, \u2018For this, Poppy would want you to work.\u2019\u201dThe weekend of Sept. 13 and 14, 2008, would become \u201cLehman Weekend,\u201d in which Mr. Paulson and other federal officials, along with the nation\u2019s banking chief executives, tried to save Lehman Brothers from bankruptcy.On Saturday, as teams from across Wall Street gathered to find a solution \u2014 funding or otherwise \u2014 for Lehman, The Times\u2019s Business desk tried to determine what was happening at the Fed.\u201cBankers wanted to know what we knew, and we desperately wanted to know what they knew,\u201d said Jenny Anderson, then a Times finance reporter. \u201cThe pace of events surpassed people\u2019s ability to shape the story.\u201dBut it was still unclear how these meetings at the Fed would impact Lehman Brothers and the nation\u2019s financial health. \u201cOne of the conundrums of the whole crisis is that the people on the 30th floor had no understanding of what was happening on the 29th floor,\u201d Mr. Sorkin said.The same weekend, Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch for $50 billion, and the insurance giant AIG nearly cratered. Lehman\u2019s failure \u201copened the portals of hell,\u201d according to Diana B. Henriques, then a senior financial writer for The Times. \u201cI was afraid A.T.M.s would go dark, so I told my husband to take as much cash out now as he could.\u201dFueled by pizza, Mr. Sorkin, Mr. Dash and the reporter Ben White huddled around Ms. Anderson\u2019s second-floor desk.\u201cI was nine months pregnant with my first child, and I was the only woman in the world who ever thought, \u2018Please don\u2019t go into labor, I want to keep writing this story!\u2019\u201d Ms. Anderson recalled.The reporters pieced together an article explaining the implications of the weekend\u2019s events while Mr. Ingrassia finessed the copy to meet the final 11:30 p.m. deadline, only to be interrupted when Mr. Sorkin ran over with a last-minute edit. He had just spoken with one of the handful of people familiar with all of the dominoes in play, who warned the horizon was still very much unsettled: \u2018You don\u2019t understand how bad this AIG thing is. That\u2019s the next levee to break.\u2019 \u201dMr. Sorkin and Mr. Dash didn\u2019t leave until after 1:45 a.m. on Sept. 15 when Lehman officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the largest filing in U.S. history.\u201cWe were writing the first draft of what could have been the Great Depression for our generation,\u201d Mr. Dash said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Youth Sports Megacomplex Comes to Town, Hoping Teams Will Follow", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEMERSON, Ga. \u2014 Just past the Hampton Inn and the Chick-fil-A, beyond the climbing wall but not as far as the water park, is your field of dreams. Actually, there are eight of them: all major league-sized, synthetic-turfed and LED-lit, and wedged in next to the three soccer pitches. The Champions Center is ahead on your left, where a dozen basketball courts can be converted into two dozen for volleyball.It is here at the LakePoint Sporting Community where the visiting boys and girls in their cleats and their uniforms have come to play, with their parents trailing them from the diamonds and the hardwood to the fast-food restaurants and the hotels. In the summer, hundreds of teams pass through here every week.\u201cThe plan is to be like a cruise ship for youth sports,\u201d said Bob Zurcher, the chief financial officer of LakePoint Land, which has helped turn Emerson, a town of 1,500 about 40 miles north of Atlanta, into an unlikely year-round tourist destination. \u201cYou give them first-class competition and facilities, then try to give them everything else they need right here.\u201d\u201cThey may be holding back on vacation or on a car, but they will make certain that Susie goes to the cheerleading competition in Orlando and Johnny gets to his Little League tournament in Georgia,\u201d said Mary Helen Sprecher, the managing editor of Sports Destination Management, a trade publication for event managers and rights holders. \u201cThese youth complexes have become part of the sports ecosystem by putting heads in beds, filling up restaurants and delivering economic impact.\u201dThe miles, and the costs, can add up quickly. The Peach State Basketball Classic at LakePoint in July, for example, was only a midseason stop for Scott Wyatt and his 16-year-old daughter, Claire. Her team, the Tennessee Fury, was coming from a girls tournament in Louisville that had attracted more than 800 squads, and it would head to an event in Atlanta a few days later.Wyatt, a pharmacist in Knoxville, Tenn., stayed with his wife and daughter at the Holiday Inn, as the tournament required. The Fury\u2019s game schedule was tight, which meant the families\u2019 meal options were largely limited to the Taco Bell or the Chick-fil-A or the pizza restaurant near the complex. LakePoint officials said out-of-town visitors spend an average of $122 per person a day; for locals, it\u2019s about half that.Over two nights and three days, Wyatt said, his family expected to spend about $800 here, or about one-third the $2,550 their trip to Louisville had cost. The three-day tournament in Atlanta that followed would add more to their tab. Toss in an earlier trip to Raleigh, N.C., and Wyatt estimated that the summer travel basketball schedule for Claire, a 6-foot-1 junior, would cost the family about $6,000.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get college scholarships \u2014 that\u2019s the only reason we are here,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cThe whole goal to get these girls in a school and some of it paid for.\u201dThe Peach State Basketball Classic was considered a boutique exposure tournament for the nearly 100 teams that participated, and there were college coaches carrying clipboards roaming the special lanes between courts reserved for them \u2014 set up to allow them to watch players away from parents. The coaches wore shirts bearing the logos of every kind of program: Bible colleges and Ivy League universities, big state schools and small liberal arts institutions. Signs for scouting services and sneaker companies surrounded the courts.Earlier in the year, the big shoe companies \u2014 Nike, Adidas and Under Armour \u2014 all had hosted top-tier boys tournaments here that drew some of the biggest names in college basketball: Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski, Kentucky\u2019s John Calipari, Villanova\u2019s Jay Wright. Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder turned up to check in on an A.A.U. team that he sponsors, and the former Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade came to watch one of his sons play.Other weeks, the complex\u2019s focus switches effortlessly between baseball and volleyball, soccer and cheerleading.For the players and their parents, though, the potential payoff is worth the sizable investment of time and money. N.C.A.A. member universities hand out about $3 billion in scholarships a year. And while the organization reminds parents that only 2 percent of high school athletes are awarded athletic scholarships, the pursuit of even a microscopic share of those billions continues to drive the youth sports economy.Disney was among the first to recognize this emerging market, and in 1997 it dived in by creating the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex on the grounds of its Disney World theme park in Orlando, Fla. The 220-acre complex has nine venues \u2014 including a tennis center, outdoor fields, indoor courts and field houses \u2014 and hosts annual events like the Pop Warner football and national cheer and dance championships.Entering the market was a steeper climb, however, for communities like Emerson, in Bartow County, where the youth sports facilities had to be built from scratch \u2014 along with the infrastructure and every other supporting business and service.Peter Olson, the county administrator, recalled the original developers\u2019 offering a succinct pitch for the 1,300 acres here along Interstate 75. \u201cWe\u2019ll build the ocean,\u201d Olson said they told him, \u201cand then the beach will be valuable.\u201dThe county offered the developers a tax abatement for 10 years and financed the Champions Center with $36 million in bonds from its development authority. Since opening in 2014, more than 3 million visitors from all 50 states have come to play here, producing what the county said was an annual economic impact of $97.4 million. Food, bar and hotel revenue in the county, Olson said, was up 80 percent.\u201cWe have some skin in the game,\u201d he said.There also have been some missteps. Building a massive youth sports development is a capital-intensive project, and the original investors ran out of cash after only 100 acres had been developed. In June, a hedge fund based near Los Angeles, Rimrock Capital Management, took the complex into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and, as the major creditor, decided to try to turn its debt into equity.\u201cThey are doubling down,\u201d said Dan Berman, a senior managing director of GlassRatner Advisory & Capital Group, the Atlanta-based firm Rimrock brought in to restructure the deal.With more than $100 million already at work, a priority is more hotels and restaurants: Signs marking the future homes of a Holiday Inn Express and a Spring Hill Suites stand alongside the bulldozers creating the roads that will connect them with the sprawling LakePoint complex. Berman said more sports facilities were a certainty, but Rimrock is also exploring more options, like added amusement attractions and a convention center.In the meantime, and with summer over, lacrosse and soccer tournaments and flag football leagues are expected to keep the outdoor fields busy through the spring. The Champions Center is booked through next summer with cheerleading competitions and volleyball, basketball and futsal tournaments.With new youth sports complexes popping up throughout the nation, including two projects in neighboring Alabama, Dean Keener, a senior vice president who helps manage the indoor facilities, said the youth sports industry had become as competitive \u2014 and as potentially lucrative \u2014 as his old profession: He is the former men\u2019s basketball coach at James Madison University.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like college recruiting,\u201d Keener said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to sleep with one eye open.\u201cYou sign someone and you may be on to the next recruiting class, but these complexes continue to go up and you can\u2019t rest on what you\u2019ve done or you\u2019ll be out of business.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The hedge fund has claimed that market manipulation was to blame in that case, but courts never agreed.Higher prices would mean China\u2019s leaders would have to be careful as they seek ways to bolster slowing growth, lest their efforts drive up prices still further. The trade war with the United States could also lead to higher prices for Chinese consumers and companies as tariffs raise the cost of imported goods.Chinese economists say that there is no cause for alarm, and that some price increases may be temporary. But the consumer price index may understate the situation, so expect close scrutiny of prices over the coming weeks.Some investors and employees have said that the approach has stunted growth.

{"Headline": "The New York Times Endorses Andrew Cuomo for Governor in Thursday\u2019s Primary", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "OpinionThe threat of Donald Trump and new pressure from reformers are likely to summon his formidable strengths.Supported byThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.New York is a big state with small politics. It is home to many of the most ambitious and inventive people in the world, but its governance is stunted by party hacks and special interests, petty rivalries and systemic corruption.The Democratic primaries on Thursday, Sept. 13, provide some ground for hope. The damage being done by the Trump administration has reawakened New Yorkers to the importance of political participation. Recognizing this new spirit, energetic Senate candidates are promising real reform. Candidates for attorney general \u2014 in particular Zephyr Teachout, a national expert on corruption \u2014 are campaigning to clean up Albany and take on the Trump administration, and they\u2019re well positioned to do just that.Unfortunately, the top of the ticket offers less cause for enthusiasm.In his two terms as governor, Andrew Cuomo has had significant accomplishments. But he has done little to combat the corruption in the Legislature and his own administration, and he has allowed the subway system, the foundation of the New York City economy, to rot. The case for change, at a time when so many New Yorkers yearn for change, is not hard to make.Yet the actor and activist Cynthia Nixon was the only Democrat with the guts to take on Mr. Cuomo, his $30 million campaign war chest and his reputation for vindictiveness. She has campaigned on sweeping promises to address New Yorkers\u2019 hunger for health care, housing and a fair criminal justice system.Ms. Nixon\u2019s candidacy has demonstrated the impressive effect of reformist pressure on Mr. Cuomo. When she spoke forcefully about criminal justice reform, he restored voting rights to parolees. When she criticized him for blessing the Independent Democratic Conference \u2014 a group of rogue Democrats who empowered Republican control of the State Senate in exchange for perks and pork \u2014 he made sure the alliance was dismantled.But Ms. Nixon\u2019s lack of experience in government or management of any sort do not inspire confidence that she could overcome the old guard in Albany to fulfill her promises and run the state. Her campaign has, at times, boiled down to a largely negative message \u2014 that she is not Andrew Cuomo \u2014 and while that can indeed seem an appealing truth, it is not, in the end, enough.[Go beyond the headlines and behind the curtain with Frank Bruni\u2019s candid reflections on politics, culture, higher education and more every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]This is not a reason to despair. Strategic and at times bullying in his use of power, driven and maddeningly evasive, deeply schooled in state and federal policy, Mr. Cuomo is, his supporters and critics would agree, a formidable political animal, and he has scented a change in the wind. His legacy is at stake. New statehouse reformers are demanding striking progress on promises long stymied by special interests and Albany deal-making. And Donald Trump is threatening his constituents. These are circumstances that are likely to summon Mr. Cuomo\u2019s strengths, and that is the reason we think he merits one more chance to serve New York and fulfill his potential as governor.When Mr. Cuomo is focused on governing, no New York politician in memory has been as effective. Because of his leadership, New York passed one of the toughest gun control measures in the country, legalized same-sex marriage, raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour and enacted paid family leave. While his tuition-free plan for state colleges remains too narrowly focused to benefit most of the families who need it, it is a step in the right direction.The governor has supported clean energy programs and banned hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking. His handling of Hurricane Sandy \u2014 the kind of crisis that most tests a leader \u2014 was sure and largely efficient. Urged on by his rival Mayor Bill de Blasio, he funded a prekindergarten program that has given thousands of New York children a better start in life.Mr. Cuomo has also overseen the construction of a bridge to replace the decrepit Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson River, pushed to transform Midtown\u2019s James A. Farley Post Office into a grand new train station and led a long-overdue overhaul of La Guardia and Kennedy airports.And he has stood up against President Trump\u2019s assaults on racial minorities, immigrants and other vulnerable groups. We are glad to see him fighting to protect New Yorkers from Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan, which sharply reduced the amount of state taxes that can be deducted from federal tax bills. He backed a change to the state tax code to blunt the impact of the federal changes and directed the state to sue the federal government.Yet Mr. Cuomo\u2019s failures threaten to eclipse his record of accomplishments.Day after day, New Yorkers are being tormented below ground, at a cost to the state\u2019s economy of billions of dollars, because of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s inadequate efforts to address the crisis in the subway system. Let there be no doubt, the governor controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. As Mr. Cuomo has said, \u201cIf a governor wanted to step up and be responsible, he or she could be.\u201d It is past time for Mr. Cuomo to step up, to persuade the Legislature to approve congestion pricing as a source of revenue \u2014 despite the mayor\u2019s blinkered opposition \u2014 and to find whatever other funds he needs to turn the system back into one of the glories of New York, if not the wonders of the world.One reason the governor has been able to build up a campaign treasury large enough to repel potential competition is that he has raised funds through the \u201cL.L.C. loophole\u201d that he pledged to end years ago. This loophole allows businesses called limited liability companies to flout limits on corporate donations.Four years ago, because Mr. Cuomo had failed to deliver promised ethics reform and because he faced a more prepared opponent in Ms. Teachout, we did not endorse any candidate in the Democratic primary for governor. This year, his ethics record remains a black mark, but circumstances have changed.If the State Senate shifts to Democratic control, as now seems possible, Mr. Cuomo will be in a position to push through reforms he has failed to deliver in the past. First among these should be changes to make it easier for New Yorkers to vote, including by mail-in ballot, and to run for office. Though it may be hard to persuade even Democrats in Albany to support genuine campaign finance reform, the L.L.C. loophole is so egregious, and Mr. Cuomo so relentless when he sets his mind to something, that we expect him to close it at last.Mr. Cuomo is flawed. When he allows petty enmity and political grievance to distract him from his commitment to public service, he is his own worst enemy. But when he confronts a real problem and gets down to work, he is a very capable governor.Yet he can\u2019t \u2014 he won\u2019t \u2014 do it alone. Voters need to show up at the polls on Thursday, Sept. 13, in large numbers and, wherever possible, support reform-minded candidates who will hold Mr. Cuomo to his promises and take on Democrats beholden to corporate interests. Those voters will need to return to the polls in November.That is how New York can finally get the government, and governor, it deserves, and how it can become the model of humane and honest public service that all America needs.Advertisement"}

Votes", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump on Monday said the sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, which are slowing proceedings on his nomination to be the newest Supreme Court justice, could be one of the \u201csingle most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s statements on Monday echoed his remarks in a radio interview to be broadcast on Monday morning, in which Mr. Trump acknowledged that he would most likely not be able to persuade any Democrats to vote for Judge Kavanaugh, meaning that he would have to hold nearly every Republican to win confirmation in the narrowly divided Senate.\u201cWe\u2019ll get almost no Democrat,\u201d he told Geraldo Rivera for the debut show of \u201cGeraldo in Cleveland\u201d on WTAM radio. \u201cWe may get a couple in states where I won by many, many points \u2014 you understand that \u2014 but we\u2019ll essentially get no Democrat.\u201d\u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll have a second judge very shortly who is a fantastic, fantastic man, a fantastic talent and intellect,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The president, nonetheless, said he favored allowing Dr. Blasey to make her case before the Senate. \u201cI want her to have her voice,\u201d he said. \u201cLet her have her voice, let her say whatever she has to say. Let him say what he has to say and that in the end these senators will make a choice.\u201dAt one point, the White House had hopes of winning the support of several Democratic senators running for re-election in states that Mr. Trump won, but that prospect seemed to vanish with the emergence of Dr. Blasey\u2019s allegations. If no Democrats support Judge Kavanaugh, that means the Republicans, who hold a 51-to-49 majority with Vice President Mike Pence able to break ties, can afford to lose only one of their own caucus.The Justice Department has said that Mr. Rosenstein was joking when he talked about taping the president, a version in conflict with others who described his comments. Mr. Rosenstein said that he currently sees \u201cno basis to invoke the 25th Amendment.\u201dAdvisers have sought to keep Mr. Trump from firing Mr. Rosenstein, at least until after the midterm elections in November, for fear of a backlash. Since Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, Mr. Rosenstein supervises the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\u201cI don\u2019t want to comment on it until I get all the facts,\u201d Mr. Trump said when asked if he would fire Mr. Rosenstein. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten all the facts, but certainly it\u2019s being looked at in terms of what took place. If anything took place and I\u2019ll make a determination sometime later, but I don\u2019t have the facts.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not, because I\u2019m an honest guy,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd that stuff is unrelated to me. And that was Michael did that stuff. And Michael I mean you know, you know I have many, many lawyers. I have very big law firms I have that do my work.\u201dWhile the president said it was \u201cunrelated to me,\u201d in fact, Mr. Cohen acknowledged in court that Mr. Trump directed him to make payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to keep them silent about affairs they said they had with the candidate.Mr. Rivera asked if Mr. Trump knew of anything that Mr. Cohen could tell the authorities that could be a problem for the president. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything because, I\u2019ll be honest, I do everything straight,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI do everything straight.\u201d\u201cYou have the mayor of San Juan who\u2019s incompetent,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cShe should never be there. She\u2019s just doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing, she\u2019s totally incompetent person. You have as you know locally they did a very, very poor job.

They were playing out arguably the most consequential period in modern economic history.We\u2019ve spent the last decade debating the crisis. Could Lehman Brothers have been saved? Were bank bailouts the best way to protect Wall Street? Could the government have helped ordinary individuals more directly? Did the response widen inequality? Did the crisis create today\u2019s populist politics? And, perhaps most important, are we any safer today?My colleagues and I have put together a brief recap of key moments of the crisis, from that meeting at the Fed to the government\u2019s rescue of Wall Street. At the end, I\u2019ll be back with a little analysis and some highlights from an interview I conducted yesterday in Washington with Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner, who all played instrumental roles during the turmoil.For many of us, it is painful to relive those moments. But they are instructive if we hope to avoid another crisis.\u2014 Andrew Ross SorkinThat day, Dick Fuld, Lehman\u2019s C.E.O., seemed hopeful. He told Ken Lewis, his counterpart at Bank of America:\u201cYou and I both know we\u2019re doing this deal.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re trying to send us a message!\u201dA little after 4 p.m., the heads of Wall Street\u2019s top banks were told to attend the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by 6 p.m. There, Mr. Paulson told the executives:\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be government money. You\u2019re going to have to figure this out.\u201d\u201cI am not here to sell Merrill Lynch,\u201d Mr. Thain said. Mr. Lewis responded, \u201cWell, that is what I want.\u201dAfter a long day at the New York Fed, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase retired to his bank\u2019s executive dining room, where he told staff that disaster loomed:\u201cSo you might as well enjoy the champagne and caviar!\u201d\u201cHow many of you would kick in $1 billion \u2014 I don\u2019t care what form it takes \u2014 to stop Lehman from going down?\u201dOne by one, they raised their hands. Lehman executives rejoiced. But by 11 a.m., British regulators had quashed the idea of a Barclays-led deal without government assistance. Mr. Paulson told colleagues that his British counterpart didn\u2019t want to \u201cimport our cancer,\u201d and urged Mr. Thain to hurry up and save Merrill:\u201cIf you don\u2019t find a buyer by this weekend, heaven help you and heaven help our country.\u201dLate that afternoon, Bank of America cut a $50 billion deal to buy Merrill. By 10 p.m., it was approved. At close to midnight, Lehman\u2019s board voted to file for bankruptcy. Mr. Fuld told the room:\u201cWell, I guess this is goodbye.\u201dRead more:\u201cIf they default, you\u2019ll see default probabilities explode on all financial firms.\u201d\u201cI slammed the phone more than a few times on discussing A.I.G.

Here were some of the biggest impacts around the world:What saved America\u2019s financial system in 2008?

But the authorities had to deploy several bazookas.\u201cThis is a huge cow patty with a piece of marshmallow stuck in the middle of it, and I am not going to eat that cow patty.\u201dLawmakers disliked the bill because it gave the executive branch sweeping authority.

But markets continued to crater. The government had to put TARP funds to use with maximum impact, and quickly.Should the government have required more from the banks? That\u2019s still debated. Tony Fratto, a press officer in the White House at the time, said in an interview this week:\u201cIt was like coming up with the design for a plane as you fly it, and then flying that plane in stormy conditions.\u201d\u201cI care about Wall Street for one reason and one reason only \u2014 because what happens on Wall Street matters to Main Street.\u201dThe worst financial crisis in 80 years had its roots in low interest rates, lax oversight and complacency on Wall Street. Debt issuance and risk-taking had surged. Wall Street gobbled up loans from risky borrowers and repackaged them into complex financial products, inflating one of history\u2019s largest credit bubbles.The Fed rode to Bear\u2019s rescue anyway, fearing that the collapse of a major investment bank would cause panic in the markets and wreak havoc with the wider economy. Fed officials knew that they were doing a bad thing, but believed that the alternative would be even worse.\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a bazooka, and people know you\u2019ve got it, you may not have to take it out.\u201d\u201cThis turmoil would directly and negatively impact household wealth: from family budgets, to home values, to savings for college and retirement.

{"Headline": "Guatemalan Leader Bars Re-entry of Corruption Prosecutor", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala said Tuesday that the head of a United Nations-backed anticorruption commission would not be allowed back into the country, a move that pushes the country\u2019s fragile institutions closer to a full-blown constitutional crisis.While that decision was within his authority as president, the order to block the entry of the Colombian prosecutor, Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, puts Mr. Morales in direct conflict with Guatemala\u2019s highest court.Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, who has led the anticorruption panel since 2013, left Guatemala on Monday for meetings in Washington and New York. The government\u2019s refusal to permit his return raises the stakes in a standoff between the prosecutor and the president over allegations that Mr. Morales broke campaign finance laws.The conflict also threatens to overturn one of the most successful anticorruption efforts in Latin America, where citizens fed up with entrenched graft have demanded an end to impunity for politicians who siphon money from public accounts and cut deals with favored businesses in return for government contracts.The president has made no secret of his desire to remove Mr. Vel\u00e1squez, whose investigations have swept up a large part of Guatemala\u2019s political elite. Mr. Morales\u2019s predecessor has been jailed since 2015 on charges relating to a customs fraud scheme.Over the past year, Guatemalan lobbyists have attempted to end United States funding for the commission, while government officials have tried to persuade Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres of the United Nations to replace Mr. Vel\u00e1squez.On Tuesday, Mr. Morales repeated his demand that Mr. Guterres appoint somebody else to head the panel, called the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. The commission works alongside the attorney general\u2019s office to uncover corruption networks.Among its investigations, the commission has been steadily uncovering schemes of illegal campaign finance, including some $1 million in anonymous contributions to Mr. Morales\u2019s presidential campaign.Mr. Morales\u2019s efforts to remove Mr. Vel\u00e1squez have now taken on a more threatening cast, as the president appears to be willing to back up his efforts with a show of force.Last Friday, Mr. Morales was flanked by more than two dozen police and military officers as he announced that the commission\u2019s mandate would not be renewed. In the hours before, a line of vehicles with machine-gun turrets took up a position outside the commission\u2019s walled Guatemala City headquarters.On Tuesday, military trucks rolled into Guatemala City\u2019s central plaza, the site of giant protests three years ago that forced former President Otto P\u00e9rez Molina to resign after he was implicated in the customs fraud scheme. They left as evening fell.In a country that spent most of the past century under brutal military rule, the symbolism of the military presence was unmistakable.The Trump administration has supported the commission, and the United States Embassy in Guatemala said last week that the commission \u201cis an important and effective partner to fight against impunity, improve governance and hold the corrupt accountable.\u201d But there was no immediate response to the announcement on Tuesday.On Tuesday in Washington, Democrats threatened to cut aid to Guatemala if Mr. Vel\u00e1squez was not allowed to return.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "An Alternative to Payday Loans, but It\u2019s Still High Cost", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserU.S. Bank, one of the country\u2019s biggest banks, has again begun offering customers small, high-cost loans, saying the loans now have safeguards to help keep borrowers from getting in over their heads.The loans, between $100 and $1,000, are meant to help customers deal with unexpected expenses, like a car repair or a medical bill, said Lynn Heitman, executive vice president of U.S. Bank consumer banking sales and support. But the fees equate to an annual interest rate of about 70 percent.U.S. Bank and several other institutions, including Wells Fargo and Regions Bank, for a time offered so-called deposit advance loans, which typically were costly and had to be repaid in a lump sum when the customer\u2019s next paycheck was deposited. Banks abandoned the loans after regulators clamped down on them in 2013.On a $400 loan, the fee would be $48, which equates to an annual interest rate of about 71 percent, according to an example on the bank\u2019s website.Consumers apply for the loans online or via a smartphone app, and a decision is made quickly using automated \u201cunderwriting,\u201d or financial review.Customers must have a checking account with U.S. Bank for at least six months before applying for the loans, and must have recurring direct deposits. The bank runs a credit check before approving loans, and reports the borrower\u2019s payments to credit bureaus, which can help customers build a credit history. Ms. Heitman declined to say what minimum credit score was required, but said the loans were available to a \u201cbroader\u201d range of customers than its traditional loans.Reaction to the new loans has been mixed. Nick Bourke, director of consumer finance at the Pew Charitable Trusts, which supports making affordable small loans available to consumers with appropriate safeguards, said the new loan appeared promising. When the loan program was announced, he tweeted that it was a \u201cgame changer.\u201d Pew opposes payday loans, but has called for mainstream banks to offer less risky small loans to help consumers when they hit financial potholes. The U.S. Bank loans include some features that Pew recommends, Mr. Bourke said, such as limiting loan payments to 5 percent of the borrower\u2019s monthly income and avoiding overdraft fees.\u201cIt\u2019s a great first step,\u201d Mr. Bourke said.According to Pew\u2019s research, 12 million people a year take payday loans. If borrowers can\u2019t make the payment, they often pay more fees to renew the loan. Payday borrowers, Pew found, spend an average of $520 in fees to repeatedly borrow $375.U.S. Bank\u2019s new loans cost $12 for each $100 borrowed, when payments are automatically debited from a customer\u2019s account. The fee is $15 per $100 if a customer opts out of automatic payments.\u201cThis is a high-cost loan,\u201d Ms. Heitman acknowledged, adding that the bank was being \u201ctransparent\u201d about the fees. The bank has received strong positive feedback from customers, she said, who say they find the loan terms easy to understand.The Center for Responsible Lending, an advocacy group, was skeptical of the value of U.S. Bank\u2019s offering, saying the loans are still too expensive for most low-income people, many of whom are already burdened by debt and have little wiggle room to take on more.\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the wrong direction,\u201d said Rebecca Born\u00e9, the center\u2019s senior policy counsel.And while the bank won\u2019t let the customer\u2019s checking account be overdrawn by a loan payment, she said, the payment itself could cause the account\u2019s balance to shrink so low that subsequent bills cause overdrafts.\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Ms. Born\u00e9 said, \u201ca bank that pays its depositors less than 3 percent interest should lend that money for a whole lot less\u201d than an interest rate of 70 percent or more.Here are some questions and answers about short-term loans:What happens if I lack funds to make a payment on my \u201csimple\u201d loan?Ms. Heitman said that if an automatic payment would overdraw a customer\u2019s account, the bank would wait until the next scheduled payment date to make a withdrawal. In the interim, the bank uses its \u201cinternal\u201d collection processes, such as contacting the customer by text and email, to encourage the borrower to make the missed payment, she said. No late fee is charged. She declined to say whether the bank would refer past-due accounts to outside bill collectors at some point.Are any other big banks offering similar loans?Fifth Third Bank, based in Cincinnati, offers what it calls \u201cearly access\u201d loans \u2014 essentially, a paycheck advance \u2014 of up to $1,000 for customers who have had accounts at the bank for at least a year. The bank charges a fee of 3 percent of the advance, which must be repaid in full with the customer\u2019s next deposit. In part because the loans aren\u2019t repaid in installments, they don\u2019t meet Pew\u2019s criteria for \u201csafe and affordable\u201d small loans, Mr. Bourke said.What alternatives to small, high-cost loans exist?Some credit unions offer \u201cborrow and pay\u201d programs, in which part of customers\u2019 payments go into a savings account that they can draw on once the loan is repaid. Ideally, consumers should try to amass a cash cushion that they can use in an emergency, avoiding the need to borrow at high cost, said George Barany, director of the America Saves program, a savings initiative of the nonprofit group Consumer Federation of America.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lady of the Rings: Jacinda Rules ", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJacinda Ardern, one of the young, progressive leaders countering Donald Trump, talks about being only the second world leader to give birth.Opinion ColumnistAt first, the skies were cloudless in the Land of the Long White Cloud. \u201cIt was highly coveted among the princesses at the dinner,\u201d Ardern\u2019s partner, Clarke Gayford, told me. \u201cThey made a beeline for her, and I\u2019m surprised she managed to leave wearing it, to be completely honest.\u201dShe was going to be able to run a country and nurse a baby at the same time \u2014 without a nanny or a wedding ring! The boyish and charming Gayford, the 40-year-old host of a TV fishing show who smiles with delight no matter how many times he is asked \u201cIs Jacinda your greatest catch?\u201d would be the stay-at-home dad who would show the way for modern men. Why had it taken us so long to realize how seamless it could all be? Then Ardern took her first official trip since she gave birth to her daughter, Neve, 11 weeks ago and the fantasy of easy equality evaporated.She has been forced to justify abbreviating her trip to the Pacific Islands Forum on the island of Nauru from three days to one, flying separately from her foreign affairs minister, Winston Peters, on an Air Force jet \u2014 at a cost of about $50,000 in American dollars \u2014 so that she could breast-feed her daughter. Neve was too young to get the vaccinations necessary to go along. Even though Ardern had to fly there in the middle of the night and fly back a day later in the middle of the night, she wanted to attend because all Kiwi prime ministers consider it a can\u2019t-miss; and also because she didn\u2019t want to seem like she was shying away from an ongoing debate with Australia, as she tries to rescue refugees from the hideous holding facilities in Nauru, the shame of Australia.Critics said Ardern should have gone for the whole three days or just stayed home and left the duties to Peters, who was \u201cmore than capable of holding court with all the local leaders over a drink at happy hour,\u201d as the morning TV host Duncan Garner huffed.Never mind that in a nation dependent on tourism, Jacinda is the biggest thing to hit here since Frodo dropped the ring into Mount Doom. Her ministers had to defend her.\u201cThis is an aircraft and a crew who would be working anyway,\u201d Grant Robertson, the finance minister, told the press. \u201cWe allocate a certain amount of money to them each year, so it\u2019s either this flight or another flight.\u2019\u2019 And Peters told me that he knew of an instance when a man in government here \u201cwith less authority and status who did that and no media beat him up. She should ignore the craven, cowardly trolls.\u201dBut she is not ignoring the trolls. When I met her at her gray frame bungalow, a few hours after she got home, she was handing off her big black briefcase to an aide at the door, breast-feeding her daughter and anguishing about what she calls her \u201cdamned if I do, damned if I don\u2019t\u201d moment.\u201cWhat surprised me the most is how hard I took that, being given a hard time for going, but actually it did upset me a bit,\u201d she said, wearing jeans with holes in the knees and a maternity pullover, kicking off her fuzzy leopard slippers and sitting in bare feet on the floor of the living room. Gayford stood in the kitchen, cradling the beautiful baby in a blue-and-white striped blanket. (In a cosmic wink, Neve was born on Bhutto\u2019s birthday.)\u201cIn New Zealand, we\u2019re really careful about excess,\u201d said Ardern, who bought her maternity clothes at Kmart and frequents secondhand stores. The country even resisted the global pandemic of Starbucks. \u201cI hate the idea of anyone thinking that I don\u2019t put a lot of thought about the cost to taxpayers. I make our ministers travel to events in vans to pool together.\u201d She instituted a salary freeze last month that stopped a 3 percent raise for her and the members of Parliament. \u201cI want to be a good leader, not a good lady leader,\u201d Ardern said, stretching out her legs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be known simply as the woman who gave birth.\u201dArdern\u2019s official residence is in Wellington. The Auckland bungalow is surprisingly small and down-to-earth for a prime minister, with knitted items for the baby sent by New Zealanders and toys strewn around. There\u2019s a pink cardboard box full of congratulatory notes from the queen, Prince Charles and world leaders. Gayford has just renovated the deck and is working on the front path. As cyberbullying is to Melania, saving the oceans is to Clarke. Ardern, who intends to teach her daughter Maori, has magnets with Maori numbers from one to 10 on the refrigerator and gave Neve a middle name of Te Aroha.The couple met when he got in touch with her about a constituency issue \u2014 a bill that Gayford worried would erode privacy. They share a love of D.J.-ing and a droll sense of humor. She teased him during one joint interview that she could never shield her daughter from the sight of his dad sweater. And when he saw Ardern\u2019s Vogue spread, he tweeted, \u201cWell that\u2019s the desktop sorted.\u201d When a columnist wrote a nasty piece dismissing the First Bloke as a \u201chipster salty seadog,\u201d he tweeted a picture of himself holding a fish and calling it another bottom feeder. I ask Ardern if she is surprised that America has not yet had a woman at the top. \u201cYes,\u201d she shot back. \u201cBut I was equally surprised at the debate about universal health care. That\u2019s not something we question here.\u201dDespite its beer and rugby bro culture, New Zealand is more progressive than Australia, where women leaders are lining up to call out sexism and bullying. Aotearoa, the Maori name for New Zealand, is celebrating 125 years of suffrage and its third woman prime minister. But Ardern says there\u2019s still work to be done.\u201cI got this letter today from a young woman that was so lovely, I just scribbled a reply back,\u201d she said. \u201cShe got pregnant around the same time as me and she just felt like her boss was more willing to be flexible because he saw this expectation being built around making sure that women could have babies and remain in their jobs. And I thought, well, even if I only create that sentiment or that environment or even create a little bit of solidarity for other women, that is something.\u201d She wants to show that women can lead with different styles, not cast themselves in the egotistical, brash mold of many male politicians. \u201cOne of the criticisms I\u2019ve faced over the years is that I\u2019m not aggressive enough or assertive enough or maybe somehow, because I\u2019m empathetic, it means I\u2019m weak,\u201d she said. \u201cI totally rebel against that. I refuse to believe that you cannot be both compassionate and strong.\u201d On another day, when I came to interview Gayford, Ardern\u2019s mother, Laurell, is there, helping with the baby. Jacinda was raised as a Mormon but left the faith when she was in her 20s over its stance on same-sex marriage. This year, she became the first New Zealand prime minister to march in a gay pride parade. Laurell Ardern said her daughter\u2019s optimism flowered early. At 8, she started a \u201cHappy Club\u201d for unhappy girls in her class, with rules about saying nice things to each other. Her sense of social justice developed early as well. Her mother recalled that when Jacinda was 16 and working as a cashier in a grocery store, she dipped into her own wallet when a customer came up short. Her sunniness is a contrast to the doomsday cult burrowing into her country, which has become a favorite with Peter Thiel and other Silicon Valley digerati obsessing on the end of the world in the land of \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d The Parliament just passed a bill to curb foreigners from snapping up existing homes and crowding out local buyers. Ardern met President Trump in November at the East Asia summit in Vietnam. It came out that at first Trump mistook Ardern for Sophie Trudeau. When he realized who she was, he playfully told someone standing near her, \u201cThis lady caused a lot of upset in her country.\u201d She retorted, laughing, \u201cNo one marched when I was elected.\u201d She did not tell Trump that she herself joined the global women\u2019s march the day after his inauguration. Ardern is so committed to moral leadership, I wondered what she made of the charge in the explosive anonymous Times Op-Ed piece about Trump\u2019s \u201camorality\u201d and how his aides are working to ameliorate his habit of roughing up allies and flirting with foes. New Zealand, after all, is part of the Five Eyes intelligence coalition. And while Silicon Valley types might be marshaling bunkers and building panic rooms in New Zealand for the apocalypse, Washington was already in an apocalypse. Doesn\u2019t she ever call the prime minister of Canada and yell, \u201cOMG, Justin! Are you seeing this?\u201d With classic New Zealand understatement, Ardern replied: \u201cWell, I mean, there was a time when things were a lot more predictable than they are now.\u201d She said she is not fearful because she believes the checks in the American system will hold. President Trump will be presiding over the United Nations Security Council when the General Assembly meets in New York later this month. The prime minister will be trying to combine mothering and traveling again, this time hopefully with less ludicrous commentary. She will be juggling more than 40 events in seven days, with Neve and Gayford as part of the entourage.  I wonder if she worries that she will do something to evoke Trump\u2019s wrath and get a nickname hurled at her. \u201cI\u2019ve been given so many, it\u2019d be quite hard to come up with a new one,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cBack in the early days of my political career, I was called Socialist Cindy. I just hate the nickname Cindy.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Attorney General Hopefuls Go After Zephyr Teachout in Final Debate", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe debate among the Democratic candidates for New York attorney general started off friendly enough, with the four posing for a selfie shortly after taking the stage Thursday night at Cooper Union\u2019s Great Hall.But an hour into the final debate before the Sept. 13 primary, all politeness went out of the window.That is when three of the candidates \u2014 Letitia James, the New York City public advocate; Sean Patrick Maloney, New York\u2019s first openly gay congressman; and Leecia Eve, a former top aide to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Hillary Clinton \u2014 began ferociously criticizing Zephyr Teachout.The attacks continued a pattern that began at last week\u2019s debate, furthering the perception that Ms. Teachout, a law professor who rose to prominence with her 2014 primary challenge to Mr. Cuomo, was the putative front-runner, although Ms. James has led the most recent polls.Ms. James criticized Ms. Teachout for being reprimanded by the North Carolina State Bar for not providing a change of address when she moved out of state while working on a death penalty case. Mr. Maloney criticized Ms. Teachout for saying she does not accept corporate donations. And Ms. Eve dug into Ms. Teachout for recently becoming a member of the New York State Bar Association \u2014 and for the fact that she grew up on a farm in Vermont.Ms. Teachout seemed to weather the attacks, focusing on her qualifications as an author of a book about corruption, a candidate who does not take money from corporate political action committees or limited liability corporations, and a legal scholar who has a firm grasp of the law.\u201cI have the deep legal understanding and expertise of the precise laws we need to use at this precise, terrifying legal moment,\u201d Ms. Teachout said, in response to a question about suing President Trump.The candidates are closely aligned on most issues. All have sought to make it clear they will not be afraid to take on the Trump administration or to fight for more power to use the office to tackle corruption in Albany.Ms. James said she has sued both Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio and remains independent.\u201cThere will be no sunlight between me and the law,\u201d Ms. James said.Ms. Eve made clear her intent to attack Ms. Teachout from the very beginning, declaring in her opening statement that when she spoke about being an independent voice for vulnerable New Yorkers, it was \u201cnot rhetoric, and certainly not a classroom exercise\u201d \u2014 a barb that elicited an audible ooh from the crowd.Mr. Maloney stopped short of calling Ms. Teachout a liar, but just barely, calling her attacks and rebuttals \u201cjust false\u201d or a \u201cpile of nonsense.\u201d\u201cThis is like the tale of two Zephyrs,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI have seen the good Zephyr. This is not it. This is the attack Zephyr that wants to win a political campaign.\u201dThe debate was co-moderated by Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan who was fired by President Trump; there had been speculation that Mr. Bharara was interested in running for the seat, which is being filled by Barbara D. Underwood.When Mr. Bharara and his fellow moderator, WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer, stepped onstage for a sound check more than 30 minutes before the debate, the crowd broke into applause.\u201cWe have done absolutely nothing worth applauding,\u201d Mr. Lehrer said.That did not stop several audience members from approaching the stage, smartphones in hand, to snap a photo of the pair.\u201cI know most of you are here because of Preet Bharara,\u201d Ms. James, who wielded punch lines throughout the debate, said in her opening statement.Mr. Bharara, for his part, seemed unmoved by the attention. Only once did he seem to allude to the unfulfilled wishes of those \u2014 including, seemingly, many in the crowd \u2014 who wished he had run for the position himself.\u201cRunning for office isn\u2019t something everyone has a stomach for,\u201d Mr. Bharara said.Another point of contention in the debate came over money.Mr. Maloney transferred $1.4 million of that money into the account for his attorney general campaign, according to the most recent campaign finance report, and now has just under $500,000 on hand, the same amount as Ms. Teachout.Ms. Teachout filed a suit against Mr. Maloney saying the transfer violated the donation limit. Mr. Maloney said the judge dismissed the suit in nine minutes, and then corrected himself, noting it had been actually assigned a court date.Ms. Teachout, in one of her strongest replies of the night, struck back.\u201cAs a lawyer, you should know the difference between a case being thrown out and going forward,\u201d Ms. Teachout said.But Mr. Maloney snapped back, \u201cYou are not going to sue your way to a victory.\u201dMs. James still leads the pack with $867,000 on hand. Ms. Eve has just $43,000 on hand even after she lent her campaign $100,000.The short digital advertisement shows Mr. Maloney saying he voted against President Barack Obama 42 percent of the time, including on issues such as the Affordable Care Act.Bill Lipton, the state director of the Working Families Party, called Mr. Maloney a \u201ccorporate hack trying to masquerade as a progressive,\u201d using some of the most critical language of the mostly cordial contest \u2014 until the final debate.Advertisement"}

It has been an almost impenetrable voting bloc in recent years, and growing stronger, with more than 80 percent of white evangelical voters supporting President Trump in 2016.Democrats have largely stood on the sidelines as Republicans forged this alliance. But now a group is moving more aggressively to bring evangelical voters and the Democratic Party together as the midterm elections approach.In the weeks leading up to Election Day, a group of progressive Christians \u2014 largely Democrats who are also evangelicals \u2014 are organizing small rallies in some 20 battleground House districts across the country. Their goal is to urge Christians to vote for Democrats and counter Trump administration policies that oppose their religious beliefs \u2014 especially on immigration, health care and poverty.The group, Vote Common Good, hopes that shifting even a small percentage of evangelical voters will make a difference at the polls.\u201cWe think they are movable,\u201d said Doug Pagitt, a pastor from Minnesota who is leading the effort. \u201cIn the privacy of the voting booth, they might do something.\u201dThe Democratic Party does not have significant resources devoted nationwide to targeted religious outreach, but this effort has support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and many Democratic candidates trying to flip Republican seats are participating.\u201cMore Democratic elected officials should be talking about God, and their own personal religious beliefs,\u201d said Representative Ted Lieu of California, a vice chairman for the D.C.C.C. who has informally advised Vote Common Good.\u201cAmerica has always been a country where faith has played an important role,\u201d Mr. Lieu said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea for Democrats to ignore that.\u201dThe rallies, styled as \u201ctraveling salvation show tent revivals,\u201d will be held in church parking lots and parks, with beer trucks, musicians and preachers in a bid to encourage evangelicals who have felt alienated from the Republican Party, Mr. Pagitt said.\u201cThe progressive left habitually rediscovers the strength of the evangelical vote and tries to counter it,\u201d said Ralph Reed, the chairman of the conservative Faith and Freedom Coalition, which has field teams in 19 states and plans to knock on two million doors by Election Day.\u201cTo be sure, imitation is the highest form of flattery,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this effort will fall short because the religious left lacks the intensity, resources and infrastructure built over the years in the evangelical community.\u201dThat isn\u2019t stopping Democrats from trying.\u201cYou are going to have a percentage of evangelicals who realize that the president\u2019s behavior and policies are inconsistent with the teachings of Christ,\u201d said Mr. Lieu, who is Catholic. \u201cThe Democratic Party is a very big tent party. You can have lots of different views. We are very accommodating.\u201dBut the party has struggled to connect with white, socially conservative voters, many of whom have views outside the Democratic platform. A year after white evangelicals helped send Mr. Trump to the White House, the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, called on the Democratic Party to make room for anti-abortion voters.Vote Common Good is largely funded by Eric Hadar, a real estate investor and developer and Democratic donor, who gave half a million dollars to the project, and who hopes that evangelical defectors might have the best chance of influencing their peers.\u201cAs a white, liberal Jew living in New York, I can march up Fifth Avenue day and night, it won\u2019t have the same impact,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cThis evangelical base is really where this is going to turn. Somebody has to focus on these people.\u201dDemocratic candidates participating in the project say they hope to shift the conversation about values in America, which they believe Mr. Trump has betrayed.\u201cAs a child, my family taught me the importance of following the Golden Rule,\u201d said Katie Hill, a first-time Democratic candidate seeking to flip California\u2019s 25th district, outside Los Angeles. She will be attending one of the Vote Common Good rallies.Republicans, she said, \u201chave shown time and again that they do not follow this most basic value.\u201d\u201cThey have separated families at the border, repeatedly attempted to slash the social safety net and have waged an outright assault on women\u2019s health and early childhood education,\u201d she said.Gina Ortiz Jones, an Iraq war veteran in southwest Texas who is running to replace Representative Will Hurd, will speak at the group\u2019s event for her district.\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know that being religious doesn\u2019t always equal being conservative,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cSo many people are in favor of Democratic platforms like affordable health care and comprehensive immigration reform specifically because their religion tells them to be kind, compassionate and deliberate in the way they treat others.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Braille for a New Digital Age", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen she was a graduate student in her native Bulgaria about five years ago, Kristina Tsvetanova was once asked to help a blind friend sign up online for a class. Understanding why he could not do so opened her eyes to the lag in technological innovation to benefit blind and visually impaired people.\u201cThe shock that my friend couldn\u2019t perform this simple task stayed with me,\u201d Ms. Tsvetanova said in an interview.Ms. Tsvetanova, who went on to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial management and a master\u2019s in engineering, knew that she had stumbled onto an untapped opportunity.\u201cI realized that there was a gap in the market and a business opportunity in developing technology to provide access to content and services for the blind,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a second-generation entrepreneur, my father taught me to take risks.\u201dIn 2014, Ms. Tsvetanova, who turned 30 last month, moved to Vienna to take advantage of its more sophisticated business culture, where she co-founded the start-up Blitab Technology (a play on the words blind and tablet). She is also the company\u2019s chief executive and has since relocated to San Francisco for proximity to Silicon Valley investors. Later this fall, she plans to introduce Blitab\u2019s debut product, a portable tablet (also called Blitab) designed for blind and visually impaired people.\u201cBlitab will soon be available for pre-order on our website,\u201d Ms. Tsvetanova said. \u201cWe plan to ship by the end of the year.\u201dDesign-wise, Blitab looks like any other tablet-style device. It is slightly thicker than an iPad, but with two separate display fields. On the tablet\u2019s bottom half, a touch screen allows users to select an application or web browse using their voice.On the top half, the tablet\u2019s glass is perforated into a grid with holes, which allow Blitab\u2019s liquid-based technology to create tactile relief \u2014 or \u201ctixels\u201d \u2014 that outputs content in the Braille alphabet \u2014 the touch-reading system that has been the literacy tool for blind people since 1824. The \u201csmart\u201d liquid alters the surface of the tablet to convert text, maps and graphics into Braille, by creating a rising sensation under the user\u2019s fingertips.\u201cBlitab can translate any type of content into Braille using our cloud-based software and displays one page of content at a time,\u201d Ms. Tsvetanova said.Priced at around $500, Blitab could be the improved and affordable alternative to existing portable Braille readers that blind people have long desired.\u201cWith this tool, the blind can surf the net, connect with friends and download books, like everyone else,\u201d she said.The impact of Blitab on the lives of visually impaired people is potentially enormous.In 2017, the World Health Organization estimated that there were 253 million people living with vision impairment across the globe, including 36 million blind people and 217 million with moderate to severe vision impairment. Those numbers are expected to triple by 2050.Existing keyboards for the blind mostly operate via piezoelectric technology, which uses pressure to generate electricity, allowing them to function as a Braille reader. The keyboards are often bulky, limited in functionality and sell for thousands of dollars. There are also portable Braille readers, which have been around for two decades, but typically offer only single-line displays.\u201cCan you imagine reading Harry Potter one line at a time?\u201d Ms. Tsvetanova said.\u201cOnly 1 percent of published books is available in Braille,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople with sight loss cannot actually read most books, they can only listen to them being read.\u201dBraille illiteracy contributes to high unemployment rates for blind and visually impaired people, estimated to be 75 percent in Europe (according to the European Blind Union) and 70 percent in the United States, according to Cornell University\u2019s Disability Statistics. These numbers are even higher on a global scale.Since Blitab\u2019s founding, Ms. Tsvetanova has been recognized for its potential to change the lives of people with sight loss. She won the Rising Innovator award in 2017 from the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and was recognized in 2017 by MIT Technology Review\u2019s Spanish edition as one of its European Innovators Under 35. Last year, Blitab was among 56 finalists selected from 1,401 entries in the Index: Design to Improve Life, a design competition based in Denmark, which awards about 500,000 euros (about $580,000) in total prize money.\u201cThis tablet will be especially impactful for the life progress of young blind persons,\u201d said Mette Laursen, a former board member of the Index competition.\u201cJust imagine the first time you used an iPad and the possibilities it opened for you,\u201d Ms. Laursen said. \u201cBlitab can do the same for the blind.\u201dMs. Laursen was also a member of the jury of the 2018 Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Awards, an annual international business plan competition funded by the luxury jeweler that rewards innovative projects by women entrepreneurs. At its awards ceremony in April in Singapore, Ms. Tsvetanova was the top prize winner, or \u201claureate,\u201d from Europe.\u201cCartier\u2019s prize is a springboard to help our laureates secure investment from banks and investors who rely on our due diligence and our assessment that these businesses are viable,\u201d said Cyrille Vigneron, president and chief executive of Cartier.While she awaits closing on a new round of financing this month, Ms. Tsvetanova is negotiating with a number of American service providers in the telecom and banking sectors to integrate Blitab into their businesses.\u201cWith our technology, a visually impaired employee can review a document unassisted, and a blind client can read a contract before signing it,\u201d Ms. Tsvetanova said.An earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of blind students in the United States who were considered Braille readers in 2017 and 1974. The statistics, posted online by the American Printing House for the Blind, were taken out of context. They were reported in conjunction with a registration program that helps Congress allocate money to states to buy educational materials for students who meet the definition of blindness. They were not intended to indicate overall Braille readership; such statistics were not available.Advertisement"}

Tired of being defined more by her offscreen aura than by her acting \u2014 hello, she was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe \u2014 Ms. Sevigny produced \u201cLizzie\u201d so that she could, for the first time in her 50-film career, play the lead part. Set in 1892, the movie finds a rage-filled Ms. Sevigny, 43, romancing Kristen Stewart\u2019s Irish housemaid and literally smashing the patriarchy (in the face, with an ax) in a series of scenes involving full nudity.\u201cNow I\u2019m ready to direct a feature,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sure. It\u2019s where I hope I\u2019m headed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never lived west of Third Avenue, and it feels very adult,\u201d she said with a giddy smile, as we sat on buckets of plaster and drank iced tea from a bougie shop down the block.Ms. Sevigny is perhaps one of her generation\u2019s finest character actresses. \u201cChlo\u00eb\u2019s artistic choices are refreshingly dangerous,\u201d said Bob Gazzale, president of the American Film Institute. \u201cTime and again, she invites us into her own fragility \u2014 and that invitation is hand-delivered with a strength, courage and confidence that few are able to convey.\u201d\u201cEveryone is made up of different colors, and sometimes I do feel like I only get to be one,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said.She sighed and stared out the window in silence.\u201cIt sounds so pretentious,\u201d she said after a long time. \u201cBut I have to work harder because of the annoying It Girl thing. It gets in the way of recognizing my acting. I\u2019d rather be cool than a bunch of other things, I guess.\u201dShe offered a tight smile, which seemed to serve as an edict: Let\u2019s change the subject.Ms. Sevigny decided to produce the project. \u201cI\u2019d never gotten to carry anything, and so I decided, for the first time, to take the producing plunge,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard because I had no idea what I was doing. I used to have a weird removal from the business side of film. I\u2019d retreat to, \u2018It\u2019s an art!\u2019\u201d\u201cLizzie is this feminist American outlaw, sort of a pioneer for the idea of female autonomy,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cEven today, I think a lot of women find themselves in circumstances where they\u2019re under a man\u2019s control \u2014 husband, father, boss \u2014 and are desperate to change those circumstances.\u201dMs. Sevigny said she hoped that \u201cLizzie,\u201d with its central theme of patriarchal oppression and abuse, would \u201ccontinue the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up conversation.\u201d While directed by a man, Craig William Macneill, \u201cLizzie\u201d was also financed by women, produced by women and employed women as principal crew members (production designer, editor).But Ms. Sevigny added that she had not experienced #MeToo abuse during her career, at least not to the degree as some other actresses, including those who have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Ms. Sevigny said her worst moment came during an audition, when a female casting director, using vulgar language, told her, \u201cYou have to make men want to\u201d have sex with you \u201cand women want to be you.\u201d\u201cI left that room, which was full of people, and cried in the parking lot,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cI\u2019d never been made to feel like such a commodity.\u201d She added, \u201cPTSD is too strong, but that moment affected me for years, and it still does.\u201dAnother tight smile.Yet \u201cLizzie\u201d also seems to represent an effort by Ms. Sevigny to push into more populist territory.\u201cI have been very calculated in my career, and now I\u2019m kicking myself for some of those decisions \u2014 the things I didn\u2019t do,\u201d Ms. Sevigny said. \u201cI used to be afraid to do anything that might be seen as frivolous or silly. Big, commercial, whatever. When I was younger, I guess I was snobby.\u201dShe continued, \u201cI\u2019ve got to have more fun with acting. I\u2019ve always been so stressed and nervous about getting it right.\u201dWith that, Ms. Sevigny started asking me questions. Was the plaster dust bothering me?

{"Headline": "The Rise of Authoritarian Capitalism", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKevin Rudd is a former prime minister of Australia and is president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York.Liberal democracy and capitalism have been the two commanding political and economic ideas of Western history since the 19th century. Now, however, the fate of these once-galvanizing global principles is increasingly uncertain.Democratic capitalism is showing signs of deep, systemic sickness in the United States, Europe and Australasia, even as varieties of state or authoritarian capitalism are slowly becoming entrenched around the world, particularly in China and Russia.In the developing world, democratic capitalism has always had a mixed reputation. While the West preached its freedoms at home, it happily engaged in political and economic exploitation abroad. The hypocrisy of colonialism is still lost on many in the West, who ask why so many people in the developing world have found the truths of Western political and economic freedom to be less than self-evident in their own national experiences.After the end of the Cold War, however, four structural challenges emerged to endanger the future of democratic capitalism: financial instability, technological disruption, widening social and economic inequality and structural weaknesses in democratic politics. If the West cannot overcome these challenges, they will, over time, spread to the rest of the world and undermine open polities, economies and societies.Revolutions in technology threaten democracies\u2019 ability to cope with the complexity, speed and trajectory of change. Democracies, like corporations, can now be hacked. Social media distorts the free flow of facts that has been the lifeblood of democratic capitalism. In the past, disruptions to employment brought about by rapid technological change resulted in a movement of lower-skilled jobs to newer industries. But now we may no longer be capable of providing enough new jobs in areas where they are needed.The financial and technological challenges are compounded by a rising economic inequality. The extreme concentration of wealth in the United States in recent decades is well documented. The new barons of capital and technology thrive while the American middle class stagnates and the American dream fades. The bottom line is simple: Citizens will continue to support their democratic capitalist systems so long as there is reasonable equality of opportunity and a humane social safety net. Take these away and the citizenry no longer has a material stake in mainstream democratic politics. Nationalism and xenophobia take over.Lastly, there are the inherent structural failings in modern democratic politics. In the United States, unrestricted campaign financing continues to undermine democracy. The spectacular corruption of the electoral redistricting system \u2014 gerrymandering \u2014 only compounds the problem. On top of this, the polarization of traditional news media by Fox News and others is poisoning the capacity of the democratic system to build a sustainable consensus around what is left of the political center, as shown by the debacle of the American gun-control debate.As Western democracies look increasingly sick, other systems of governance are now on offer. Russian nationalism represents a departure from Western political, economic and diplomatic norms. China has become increasingly confident in its own model, described as authoritarian or state capitalism. And its \u201cBeijing consensus\u201d is held up to the non-Western world as an example of a more effective form of national, and even international, governance.If the United States wants to remain a global beacon of democratic capitalism, it must first confront its domestic challenges. The American social contract needs to be rebuilt through a revised New Deal. The social impact of technological change must be politically managed, rather than left to the market. Finance should return to its historical role as the servant of the real economy, rather than its master. And the Supreme Court must set a new direction on campaign finance (by overturning the Citizens United decision), gerrymandering and some of the crazier interpretations of the Second Amendment used to justify a breakdown in basic law and order.The United States also needs to re-embrace its responsibilities to the liberal international order it painstakingly created after World War II. This order was anchored in the United Nations Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Monetary Fund and other institutions and principles that have become the bedrock of free societies, free economies and free polities. The world now asks: Does the United States still embrace this order?Both democracy and capitalism are relatively recent developments in the long history of the West. They represent even more recent developments in the considerably longer history of the East. Both represent the enduring idea of freedom. Yet both rest on increasingly fragile political and economic institutions. History cautions us against any belief that democratic capitalism will somehow inevitably prevail. Unless, of course, we make it so by tending the garden while there is still time.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Protesters Shut Afghan Election Offices as Political Crisis Brews", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 Protesters demanding anti-fraud measures shut down the offices of Afghanistan\u2019s election commission in three of the country\u2019s major provinces on Saturday, just weeks before a vote for Parliament, the latest symptom of a political logjam that could turn violent amid a raging war with the Taliban.The last-minute jockeying over an election already delayed by three years has again exposed a depressing reality: that after five elections over 17 years, costing about $1 billion, Afghanistan still lacks the most basic consensus on how an election should be held and a credible body to oversee it.The offices were shut in Balkh Province in the north, Kandahar in the south, and Herat in the west, according to Abdul Aziz Ibrahimi, a spokesman for the election commission. The protesters, largely supporters of powerful regional figures who have intensely feuded with President Ashraf Ghani, locked the gates of the commission\u2019s offices in all three provinces and pitched tents outside to hold sit-ins.Gen. Akhtar Ibrahimi, the deputy minister of interior, said the government had instructed security forces to protect the election offices and \u201cto use force if necessary.\u201dA spokesman for Mr. Ghani, Shah Hussain Murtazawi, said the government was supportive of proposals to make the election more transparent, but would not allow anyone to impede the process.\u201cAfghan security forces have the responsibility to protect the election process,\u201d Mr. Murtazawi said.Afghan political parties, who have previously fought bloody wars with one another, have united in recent months to demand a delay in the October 20 vote until convincing measures to ensure fairness are put in place. The parties say that the number of registered voters, announced as more than nine million by the country\u2019s election commission, is unrealistically high and the result of fraud. They said that can only be corrected through biometric verification.The government, and to an extent Western officials in Kabul, accuse the political parties of holding the election process hostage and of trying to negotiate influence because they cannot rally enough of their supporters to register.Hassan Dehqanzada, a member of Jamiat party, said it had seen evidence that one person had registered to vote as many as five times. He was one of about 100 people \u2014 including at least seven armed men counted by a reporter \u2014 blocking access to the Balkh office.\u201cThe voters need to go through biometric verification,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, we will not allow a fraudulent election to take place.\u201dA larger concern is a lack of faith in mechanisms to resolve election disputes, which could worsen the country\u2019s volatility.Abdullah Ahmadzai, a former chief of Afghanistan\u2019s election commission, said electoral reforms have often been used for short-term \u201cpolitical exploitations.\u201d\u201cFollowing each election, commissioners and leadership of the election commission have been continuously replaced, making institutionalization of elections management even more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not had a single commission manage more than one election in Afghanistan. On the other hand, we have not witnessed a single case where candidates were held to account for encouraging fraud and intimidations.\u201dAfghanistan\u2019s coalition government, born out of the disputed 2014 election, missed deadline after deadline on reforms, postponing parliamentary elections for three years.They were scheduled for October after the government came under pressure from international donors, who see elections as the most basic litmus test for the democratic system they helped put in place. President Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, flew in to deliver a stern message: holding the elections was of \u201cthe biggest importance for the U.S.\u201dCreation of small, local voter lists was a basic step that gave reformers some hope. Potential voters had to show up to a registration center and get their identity cards stamped with special stickers.Political parties now say massive fraud took place in that voter registration, where identity cards were faked and verification stickers were misused.Registration had gotten off to a demoralizingly slow start: With just over 6,000 people registering per day, the pace was so slow that it raised fears there would be too few voters to justify an election. Then, the number picked up at rapid pace, without any improvement in security around the country.Sayed Hafiz Hashimi, an election commissioner, called the claims of fraud a conspiracy to derail the process.\u201cIf it had been fraud, the numbers would have been 20 million, not what we have now,\u201d Mr. Hashimi said. \u201cThese are real numbers. I can\u2019t reject a small percentage of possible fraud, or repeat registrations, but that is a small portion.\u201dFahim Abed contributed reporting from Kabul, Taimoor Shah from Kandahar, and Najim Rahim from Mazar e Sharif.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Policymakers Saved the Financial System. And America Never Forgave Them.", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCrisis and ConsequencesBut for all that anger, the engineers of the American crisis response got the economics mostly correct, and more right than most of those \u2014 including leading economic thinkers and prominent politicians \u2014 who were second-guessing them.To understand the challenges and ultimately the failure of the politics of their response, it helps to put yourself back in 2008 and 2009, when the financial might of the United States government \u2014 trillions of dollars, cumulatively \u2014 was deployed to try to contain the crisis. Mr. Geithner, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke are centrists in the context of modern American politics, but they are conservatives in the traditional sense \u2014 people trying to preserve a system they inherited. Their strategy was to patch things up as quickly as possible. The goal was not to try to reinvent Wall Street on the fly, but to keep the flow of capital coursing through the global economy while minimizing the depth and duration of the recession that the crisis had caused.Mr. Geithner\u2019s disinclination to nationalize banks drew fierce criticism from liberals who argued that the government was essentially funneling money to banks with little assurance they would resume lending.These attacks were misguided.Mr. Paulson\u2019s financial rescue package did not herald an era of socialism on Wall Street; nor did it come at a huge continuing cost to taxpayers. By many measures, it made money.Mr. Geithner\u2019s stress tests achieved their goal of restoring confidence in major banks without the cost and political damage of nationalizing them. They were successful enough that similar stress tests are now a part of regulators\u2019 tool kits both in the United States and overseas.Mr. Bernanke\u2019s aggressive monetary policy probably played a role in getting the expansion on track starting in mid-2009. Quantitative easing and low interest rates did not cause a collapse of the dollar or spiraling inflation.Nobody would argue that the United States economy is perfect, or that the policymakers got everything exactly right.If Mr. Paulson had secured financial rescue legislation before Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, perhaps the most severe phase of the crisis could have been avoided altogether, though it is a puzzle how he could have gotten the votes for such a plan before the crisis became more severe. If Mr. Bernanke had moved faster \u2014 putting an open-ended quantitative easing program in place in 2009 or 2010 instead of waiting till 2012 \u2014 maybe full recovery would have come sooner. It\u2019s not clear how the recovery might have looked had Mr. Geithner embraced a more activist approach to replacing management and taking greater government control of the most troubled large banks, notably Citigroup and Bank of America. Or if he had welcomed a larger program to help relieve borrowers who were underwater on their homes. The tactics the men chose can be second-guessed, but the result of their efforts speaks for itself. The expansion has lasted nine years, the second longest on record. Although job gains were disappointingly slow for years, the unemployment rate is now 3.9 percent, among the lowest in decades.From 2007 to 2017, per-person inflation-adjusted G.D.P. rose 6.3 percent in the United States, compared with only 3 percent in the eurozone, where similar policies were embraced more slowly.It was Feb. 19, 2009, less than a month into the Obama administration. Mr. Geithner and his colleagues had introduced plans to assist struggling homeowners, which many liberal critics considered deeply inadequate. The human cost of the foreclosure crisis was indeed immense; there were 2.8 million foreclosures that year alone. But the politics of helping troubled homeowners were more toxic than the crisis managers had foreseen.From the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CNBC broadcaster Rick Santelli began a rant for the ages. \u201cHow many of you people want to pay for your neighbor\u2019s mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can\u2019t pay their bills?\u201d Mr. Santelli said, as traders cheered behind him. \u201cPresident Obama, are you listening?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about having a Chicago tea party in July,\u201d he continued.The term stuck, and was embraced by the conservative activists who propelled Republicans to victory in the 2010 midterm elections \u2014 driven, in no small part, by opposition to economic stimulus, financial bailouts and the work of the Federal Reserve.The policymakers knew history\u2019s warnings about economic policy that reacts too sluggishly to financial crisis.There\u2019s a reason, of course, that they were in their roles as appointed technocrats and not politicians. But it isn\u2019t clear that George W. Bush or Barack Obama had any better ideas for bringing along the public than did the men they chose to lead financial policy. The crisis response may well have been a Rubik\u2019s Cube of political and economic challenges too complicated to solve.It was foreseeable, perhaps, that many on the left would view the Geithner-Paulson-Bernanke strategy as too friendly to Wall Street interests. It was also foreseeable that the libertarian right would loathe the bailouts. More surprising were the ways in which some of the biggest beneficiaries of the strategy became vocal opponents.The Geithner strategy was based on rescuing Wall Street, using hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars \u2014 while building a more rigorous regulatory system to try to prevent a similar crisis.Even as Mr. Bernanke\u2019s easy money policies pushed the stock market upward and coincided with a gradually improving economy and low inflation, the drumbeat of commentary was overwhelmingly negative.Success has rarely been so unpopular.Might the rise of anti-establishment parties around the world \u2014 not least Donald J. Trump on the right and Bernie Sanders-esque socialists on the left in the United States \u2014 be traced to their work as crisis responders?\u201cWe know from history that financial crises, particularly big ones, do tend to get followed by a populist reaction,\u201d Mr. Bernanke said. \u201cI think we all tried our best to explain what we were doing and work with the politics, as difficult as it was. I think back to the crisis, we were very focused on preventing the collapse of the financial system. And developing our communication to the broad public wasn\u2019t always our first priority.\u201dHe argued, though, that longer-term trends \u2014 like stagnation in middle-class wages, social dysfunctions, rising mistrust in government and hostility to immigration \u2014 were a bigger explanation for the rise in a politics of extremes.This analysis seems both correct and incomplete. Of course, the embrace of anti-immigrant nationalism on the right and of socialism on the left have roots considerably deeper than a bank bailout or a quantitative easing program.But it was the experience of the crisis, and the sense among Americans of all ideological dispositions that they were being asked to foot the bill for someone else\u2019s mistakes \u2014 whether by Wall Street C.E.O.s or by Mr. Santelli\u2019s neighbor with the renovated bathroom \u2014 that helped make those long-simmering problems boil over. It turns out, when you throw trillions of dollars at rescuing a system that most people don\u2019t like very much in the first place, the result isn\u2019t relief.It\u2019s anger.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Top Trump Adviser Says Ted Cruz Could Lose Texas Senate Race", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA pair of top Republicans acknowledged in a private meeting on Saturday that the party was battling serious vulnerabilities in the midterm elections, including what one described as widespread \u201chate\u201d for President Trump, and raised the prospect that Senator Ted Cruz of Texas could lose his bid for re-election because he is not seen as \u201clikable\u201d enough.The two Republican leaders, Mick Mulvaney, the federal budget director, and Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee chairwoman, assured party officials and donors at a closed-door event in New York City that the right would ultimately turn back a purported \u201cblue wave\u201d in November. Mr. Mulvaney also questioned whether Democrats could marshal support from outside the left, criticizing them as a party defined solely by opposition to Mr. Trump.But Mr. Mulvaney and Ms. McDaniel also offered an unusually raw assessment of their own party\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in the midterm elections. They pointed to the burning energy among Democratic voters and the dozens of open House seats, where Republican incumbents decided not to seek re-election, as fearsome obstacles to retaining control of Congress. And Mr. Mulvaney suggested Republicans would fare better if they could \u201csubtract\u201d the president\u2019s divisive persona from voters\u2019 minds, and stress instead that the country is in a \u201cpretty good\u201d condition.\u201cYou may hate the president, and there\u2019s a lot of people who do, but they certainly like the way the country is going,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said, adding of voters: \u201cIf you figure out a way to subtract from that equation how they feel about the president, the numbers go up dramatically.\u201dTheir comments were captured in an audio recording that was obtained by The New York Times from a person who attended the party meeting.Even as Mr. Mulvaney conceded that Mr. Trump\u2019s personal unpopularity was a problem for the party, he predicted it would not ultimately be a decisive factor for most voters. He also alluded to Mr. Cruz, without mentioning his name, as a lawmaker who might lack the charm to win a contested race this year.Mr. Cruz responded dismissively hours later, waving off Mr. Mulvaney as \u201csome political guy in Washington.\u201dMr. Mulvaney, a former member of Congress from South Carolina, who was elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, said Democrats had not marshaled a broad movement of opposition to Washington the way Republicans did that year. He argued that they lacked an issue to unify their cause, unlike Republicans eight years ago, who rallied in opposition to the Affordable Care Act.Instead, Mr. Mulvaney said, Democrats were putting forward a \u201cmovement of hate,\u201d and asked rhetorically: \u201cWhat is the signature piece of legislation they\u2019re against? The tax bill?\u201dMs. McDaniel, a former chairwoman of the Michigan Republican Party, alluded more delicately in her remarks to the explosive Democratic turnout in the midterm primary elections that Mr. Trump had helped stir, telling the meeting, which included many major donors, that Republicans were spending money aggressively to build a voter-turnout machine to block a Democratic takeover.She framed the election as an asymmetrical contest \u2014 Republican organizing prowess and financial supremacy versus raw Democratic energy \u2014 and mocked the Democratic National Committee for its precarious finances.The Democratic National Committee raised $116 million through the end of July, compared with $227 million raised by the Republicans.\u201cIt does cost, right now, more money to engage our voters, to get them knowledge of the election,\u201d Ms. McDaniel said. \u201cThey have their energy. We have our infrastructure.\u201d\u201cThat is why this ground game and this money is making such a huge difference,\u201d she said, adding that the Republican National Committee would exceed the $250 million mark this week, \u201cand it will be the most ever raised by a political party headed into a midterm.\u201dSpokesmen for the R.N.C. and Mr. Mulvaney declined to comment.Republicans have used their financial advantage in a way that can offset any enthusiasm gap, asserted Ronald N. Weiser, a former finance chairman for the party\u2019s national committee who now leads the Michigan Republican Party.\u201cThe party that is out of power always has an enthusiasm level that is higher because they don\u2019t like who\u2019s in and they want to replace them,\u201d said Mr. Weiser, who did not attend the meeting in New York. \u201cWe have better field operations, data and digital, which I think can make up for it.\u201dHe argued that Republican candidates should not try to run away from Mr. Trump \u201cbecause he has a base that is important.\u201dThe suggestion, by Mr. Mulvaney, that Republicans might fare better without Mr. Trump as the dominant factor in voters\u2019 minds is a far cry from the president\u2019s personal approach to the campaign. He has held rallies across the country in recent days, focusing on red states where Democratic senators are seeking re-election, and warning conservative voters in intensely personal terms that a victorious Democratic Party would try to hound him from office.Yet if he broke in places with the president\u2019s political posture, Mr. Mulvaney, in his weekend comments, came closer to matching the private strategic thinking of Republican congressional leaders.The budget chief, who has been seen at points as a potential White House chief of staff, acknowledged that Republicans had nominated poor candidates in some important races and might struggle to defend a huge number of open seats in the House, where dozens of Republican lawmakers decided not to run for re-election.Democrats must gain 23 seats in the House to take control of the chamber. Senior Republican strategists have grown sharply concerned about a collection of open seats where they have put forward flawed nominees, including in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and North Carolina. Mirroring in some respects the Republican campaigns of 2010, Democratic candidates have been running on a message of blocking Republican health care and economic policies, and reining in an unpopular White House.The Senate appears more secure for Republicans at this point. Even though they hold only a slim, 51-seat majority, Democrats are defending far more seats than Republicans, and many of the Democratic incumbents up for re-election are running in conservative states.Still, there is a path for Democrats to capture the Senate, and Mr. Mulvaney pointed to crucial Senate races in Texas and Florida as places where candidate quality could be decisive.\u201cThere\u2019s a very real possibility we will win a race for Senate in Florida and lose a race in Texas for Senate, O.K.?\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely, but it\u2019s a possibility. How likable is a candidate? That still counts.\u201d\u201cThe president asks me all the time, \u2018Why did Roy Moore lose?\u2019\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said. \u201cThat\u2019s easy. He was a terrible candidate.\u201dMr. Mulvaney\u2019s comments about the Texas Senate race represent perhaps the most candid admission by a senior Republican that Mr. Cruz, a first-term lawmaker who battled Mr. Trump for the presidential nomination in 2016, is actually facing a fight for his political life. He is being challenged by Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, a maverick Democrat who has raised enormous sums of money online.Public polling has shown the two men locked in a close race, but with Mr. Cruz holding a consistent advantage.Addressing Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s assessment, Mr. Cruz told reporters after a rally outside Houston Saturday that he was uninterested in the budget director\u2019s view of his race.\u201cI don\u2019t worry about what some political guy in Washington says,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI worry about what the people of Texas say.\u201dRepublicans have also been hopeful about the election in Florida, where the party has nominated Gov. Rick Scott, a former hospital executive with a vast personal fortune, to challenge Senator Bill Nelson.The two men have been effectively tied in the most recent polls.Still, Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s freewheeling comments appeared intended more to reassure allies than to alarm them, and he insistently played down the possibility of a Democratic takeover. \u201cWave elections are extraordinarily rare,\u201d he said, though there have been several in the last dozen years.At the same conclave of Republicans on Saturday, one of the party\u2019s key Senate candidates, Mike Braun, a wealthy former Indiana state legislator who is running against Senator Joe Donnelly, a Democrat, framed the stakes of the election in grimmer terms.At a forum for Senate candidates, Mr. Braun pleaded with party donors to put up the money needed for Republicans to defend their control of the Senate, warning that if the party did not govern successfully under Mr. Trump it could face a long political winter.\u201cWe\u2019ve got four to six years to get this right, and if we don\u2019t, it\u2019ll go the other direction, demographically and all those other things that point negatively for us,\u201d Mr. Braun said, in comments captured on a second recording. \u201cWe\u2019ll be miserable for 15 to 20 years.\u201dJonathan Martin and Matt Flegenheimer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Volkswagen Trial Offers Hedge Funds a Chance to Settle Old Scores", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 A decade ago, an epic stock market battle between Volkswagen\u2019s biggest shareholder and a group of mostly American hedge funds ended badly for the investors. Now, for at least one of those funds, it\u2019s payback time.Elliott Management, the hedge fund founded by Paul E. Singer, was among the firms burned in 2008 trying to bet against Volkswagen shares. The stock price rose instead, and while the funds claimed market manipulation, they never found a court that would agree.Now a new case offers Elliott a chance at redemption. A subsidiary of the fund is bankrolling a group of institutional investors who are suing Volkswagen because of the losses they suffered as a result of the company\u2019s emissions cheating. A German court will begin hearing evidence in the case on Monday.The trial is part of a group of similar suits claiming 9 billion euros \u2014 more than $10 billion \u2014 in damages. For the first time, high-ranking Volkswagen executives may testify in open court about the origins of the scandal. Interest in the case is so intense that the proceedings will be held in a convention center in Braunschweig, near Volkswagen\u2019s headquarters \u2014 none of the local courtrooms could handle the expected crush of lawyers, plaintiffs, journalists and spectators.The shareholders backed by Elliott, including the California state teachers\u2019 pension fund and the fund that invests Norway\u2019s oil wealth, are seeking \u20ac2 billion in damages, or about a fifth of the total claims.Over all, roughly 4,000 shareholders have filed suits in various German courts, including hundreds of individuals. Fewer than half of those cases will be at issue in Braunschweig on Monday, and the outcome of that trial will set a precedent for the others.Volkswagen has tried to portray the Braunschweig case as a crusade by greedy speculators. The carmaker has already paid nearly $32 billion in settlements and fines over the diesel scandal. Loyal, long-term shareholders will suffer even more, it argues, if it has to shell out additional billions in court judgments.The case, Volkswagen said in a defense brief, is \u201cessentially a struggle to redistribute the economic consequences of the diesel matter between new investors and old shareholders.\u201dThe lawsuits in Braunschweig contend that the carmaker illegally kept shareholders in the dark about risks.The scandal involved illegal software in vehicles that could detect when an emissions test was taking place, and then crank up pollution controls. At other times the vehicles polluted far more than allowed.Volkswagen, which has refused to settle the case, contends that the wrongdoing was the work of engineers and managers at a level below the management board.Even after top-level managers learned of the cheating, the company contends, they were blindsided by its impact. It has argued in court documents that it could not have predicted the astronomical cost of fines and civil settlements with Volkswagen owners.In September 2015, Volkswagen was accused of evading emissions standards in the U.S. The scandal has hit the company hard.Lawyers for the shareholders argue that ignorance is no excuse.\u201cAll that counts,\u201d said Nadine Herrmann, a partner at the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan who is representing the investors financed by Elliott, \u201cis whether Volkswagen, its board members and senior executives could have known about the emissions fraud if they had not deliberately or with gross negligence turned a blind eye.\u201dFor Mr. Singer and his hedge fund, the case offers an opportunity to make money \u2014 but also to even the score after winding up on the losing end of a notorious clash.While Volkswagen made far more vehicles than Porsche, Porsche was more profitable. The family company tried to leverage its financial might into outright control of Volkswagen. The takeover attempt was financed with a complicated derivatives scheme that depended on Volkswagen shares maintaining their value.But the plan was thrown into doubt by the market panic that followed the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank.Hedge funds, including one managed by Elliott, began targeting Volkswagen stock, betting that the company was vulnerable. They used a risky strategy known as short selling. They sold borrowed shares in anticipation of buying them back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference.It was a zero sum game. Porsche desperately needed Volkswagen shares to rise. The short sellers were just as eager for the stock price to fall.Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.The clash came to a head on Oct. 26, 2008, a Sunday. The Porsche holding company issued a statement that, hedge funds later contended, falsely created the impression that almost all of Volkswagen\u2019s voting shares were locked up. That implied few shares were left for the short sellers to cover their bets, exposing them to huge losses.The maneuver rescued Porsche\u2019s takeover bid, allowing the family company to acquire majority voting rights in Volkswagen.Elliott has also sued Porsche Holding separately, accusing the company of violating German stock market laws in connection with the diesel scandal.The lawsuit going to trial in Braunschweig on Monday is a classic case of who knew what when. Under German law, members of a company with publicly traded stock are obliged to warn shareholders about risks that could affect the share price.The plaintiffs are trying to prove that members of Volkswagen\u2019s top management knew about the illegal emissions scheme months, if not years, before the Environmental Protection Agency revealed its existence. Volkswagen, however, has maintained that members of its management board were ignorant of the cheating.Advertisement"}

Again.", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookWhen the broadcast networks unveil their fall lineups, there are a few sure bets. There will always be a cop show. There will always be a lawyer show and a doctor show. There will always be a comedy that seems doomed to fail. These days, there\u2019ll be a reboot or revival, too, and probably something based on a movie.Some years, there\u2019s a big-swing drama, or a high-profile comedian finally landing a plum gig.And some years \u2014 this year and last among them \u2014 there\u2019s that quirky light drama with a spiritual or religious tinge. A lighthearted yet poignant show in which some Joe or Jane Schmo begrudgingly embarks on a weekly quest to do good at the behest of some higher power.And maybe \u201cGod\u201d is too. It\u2019s part of a noble tradition of shows like \u201cJoan of Arcadia,\u201d \u201cReaper,\u201d \u201cBeing Erica,\u201d \u201cKevin (Probably) Saves the World,\u201d \u201cWonderfalls,\u201d \u201cEli Stone\u201d and \u201cDead Like Me.\u201dThese supernatural deed-oriented procedurals start the same way. Our lead is somewhat dissatisfied with his or her lot in life (aren\u2019t we all? the show suggests), until one fateful day: A voice, a song, a vision! A dog that goes crazy, a tchotchke that suddenly speaks. Maybe there\u2019s some other explanation \u2014 a meteor, an aneurysm, a panic attack \u2014 but there\u2019s no avoiding it. The noise, the stranger, the Facebook add, whatever it is, it\u2019s insistent.And so our heroes acquiesce. Jaye on \u201cWonderfalls\u201d obeys the talking wax lion. Joan on \u201cJoan of Arcadia\u201d believes the strangers who tell her they\u2019re God in various forms are telling the truth. Eli of \u201cEli Stone\u201d decides his visions are a prophecy and he\u2019s going to be a better man. Erica on \u201cBeing Erica\u201d embraces her new therapist\u2019s odd technique of sending her back in time to right the wrongs of her past. Sam on \u201cReaper\u201d agrees to be a bounty hunter for Satan himself. Kevin on \u201cKevin (Probably) Saves the World\u201d sets out with his guardian angel to discover the lost righteous souls of this generation. George on \u201cDead Like Me\u201d decides to join the undead as a grim reaper.And now Miles of \u201cGod Friended Me\u201d accepts God\u2019s friend request.The weekly duties bind these shows together, but more essentially, these are all family shows. Each character has significant, though sometimes fraught, relationships with his or her siblings and parents, and there\u2019s a primal familial wound that remains unhealed \u2014 a death or catastrophic accident, or sometimes just a lie or a secret that\u2019s lingered without resolution.The bigger danger than hokiness or blandness is simple cancellation. The strange thing about the persistence of this genre is that these shows never find much of an audience. Of the ones mentioned here, only \u201cBeing Erica\u201d made it past Season 2 \u2014 and that was in Canada, so it was playing a different ratings game. Some of these, \u201cWonderfalls\u201d especially, are great shows, special shows, beautiful tender creatures. Almost all were too precious for this cruel and indifferent world. So precious in fact that many are not even available to stream. (The absence of \u201cWonderfalls\u201d and \u201cJoan of Arcadia\u201d from even a la carte streaming purchases is cultural cruelty.)So the fact that we keep making these shows is itself a curious act of faith, perhaps part of a desire to create tidy stories not devoted solely to murder. It doesn\u2019t help that these shows keep getting made in essentially the same ways, with the same weepy monologues and bottled up fear, the same frustrating jobs and the same kooky sidekicks who immediately get on board with the visions and the tasks. With the same love interests who can\u2019t be let in on the big secret, and the same dads who are loving in their gruff and broken ways. With the same family tensions that are so entrenched that sometimes it takes an act of God, or really an act of faith, to get everyone around a dinner table.When we watch cop shows, we know the cop wants to solve crimes. Doctors want to heal patients. But what do podcasters, or big-box store clerks, or temps, or souvenir-shop employees, or former finance bros want? They want the same thing those cops and doctors really want, too, what most of us want: purpose. We want to believe we matter, and that our decisions have some influence on the grander scale of wins and losses.

{"Headline": "Waiting for the Next Arthur Ashe", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the second of two occasions when he had the privilege of a conversation with Arthur Ashe, MaliVai Washington, having just become the country\u2019s No. 1 college player as a Michigan sophomore in 1989, happened to mention that he was thinking of turning pro.Ashe did not exactly tell him what he wanted to hear.\u201cI don\u2019t think he thought it was a very good idea,\u201d Washington said.After all these years there are the formidable but not mutually exclusive legacies of Ashe: as the only African-American man to win a Grand Slam tournament and as a venerated humanitarian. Washington came tantalizingly close to living up to the former and has found a contextual purpose in the latter.Washington, who made it to the Wimbledon final in 1996, can recall some self-imposed pressure to hoist the trophy Ashe had claimed there 21 years earlier because \u201cwhen you\u2019re the No. 1 black player, you feel a sense of responsibility.\u201dThat said, Washington was admittedly more focused on the biggest payday of his career, potential lifetime membership in the All England Club and a permanent engraving on its champions wall.Washington\u2019s program is affiliated with the National Junior Tennis League, which Ashe co-founded in 1969 to promote discipline and character through tennis among under-resourced youth. If, in the process, another Ashe happened to emerge, so much the better. But that was not the primary function, or point.\u201cWe\u2019re not a pathway to pro tennis by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Washington said. \u201cAt my foundation, we don\u2019t have that ability, that capacity, never had an interest in going in that direction. We highly encourage kids to play on their high school team, go on to play or try out for their college team.\u201cBut our biggest bang for our buck is teaching life skills. Stay in our program, and you\u2019ll have a focus on high school education, be on a good track when you leave high school. You\u2019re not going to leave high school with a criminal record, or with a son or daughter.\u201dWhy there was no African-American male Grand Slam champion successor to Ashe in the years soon after his trailblazing is no great mystery, Washington said.Fifty years ago, tennis was largely the province of the wealthy and white, lacking a foundational structure to facilitate such an occurrence. Which doesn\u2019t mean that Ashe didn\u2019t influence the rise of a Yannick Noah, the French Grand Slam champion whom Ashe himself discovered in Cameroon. Or the likes of Richard Williams and Oracene Price, whose parental vision birthed the careers of Venus and Serena Williams. They in turn have been followed by a raft of African-American female players, including the 2017 U.S. Open women\u2019s champion, Sloane Stephens, and the runner-up, Madison Keys.This year\u2019s women\u2019s final, on Saturday afternoon, will feature Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka, a half-Japanese, half-Haitian player whose father used the Williams family as a model for his own daughters\u2019 tennis ambitions.Looming over the lack of an African-American Grand Slam successor to Ashe is the vexing question of why the United States hasn\u2019t produced a male champion since Andy Roddick won his only major title in New York in 2003. That most of the men\u2019s titles have been claimed by a small handful of European players might be more of a tribute to them than a defining failure of the United States Tennis Association\u2019s development capabilities.But on the home front, the issue is a pressing one, especially during America\u2019s Grand Slam tournament, year after year.Washington retired in 1999 with four tour victories and a 1994 quarterfinal Australian Open result in addition to his Wimbledon run. He was followed by James Blake, who rose to No. 4 in the world during a 14-year career that included 10 tour titles and three Grand Slam quarterfinals, including two at the U.S. Open.Martin Blackman, the U.S.T.A.\u2019s general manager for player development, agreed that a breakthrough by one or two young Americans \u2014 white or black \u2014 in the foreseeable future could help trigger a wave of next-generation stars from an expanding landscape of prospects at a time when African-American participation has significantly declined in baseball, and football is confronted with health concerns.\u201cWith tennis starting to be recognized as a really athletic sport, I think we do have a unique opportunity to pull some better athletes into the game,\u201d said Blackman, an African-American man who played briefly on tour and once partnered with Washington to make the junior doubles semifinals of the 1986 Open. \u201cSo now it comes down to what can we do at the base to recruit and retain as many great young players as possible, make the game accessible and then get them into the system to stay.\u201dThe son of immigrants from Sierra Leone, Tiafoe, 20, was introduced to the sport at a club in College Park, Md., where his father, Frances Sr., had found custodial work. Talent and a noticeable work ethic attracted well-heeled benefactors and helped Tiafoe climb to his current ranking of No. 44.He gained his first victory at the U.S. Open over France\u2019s Adrian Mannarino, the 29th seed, in the first round before losing next time out. His father watched from the player\u2019s box on the Grandstand court, high-fiving Frances\u2019 coaches and trainer when the Mannarino match ended, and soon after contended that his son wasn\u2019t all that unique.\u201cThere have to be thousands of kids like Frances out there, thousands who don\u2019t have the same opportunities,\u201d Frances Sr. said. \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about going to college, but going to the pro level, or just to have that chance, see if it\u2019s possible.\u201dThis is where Washington holds up a metaphorical sign for caution, if not for an outright stop. Most people, he said, have little understanding of just how forbidding the odds are of becoming a pro, much less a champion.Like the Williams sisters, Washington \u2014 who was born in Glen Cove, N.Y., but grew up in Michigan \u2014 had the benefit of a tennis-driven father, William, who saw four of his five children play professionally. MaliVai, who typically goes by Mal, had by far the most success.\u201cWhen I was a junior player, I was playing seven days a week and there were times when I was in high school where I was playing before school and after school,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is so very difficult to win a major. I tried to win one, came close.\u201dThen, speaking of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, he added: \u201cFederer and Nadal, they\u2019ve won 20 and 17. What makes them so great is hard to understand. You just can\u2019t throw money at kids and think it\u2019s going to happen.\u201dSo how is it done? Where does one start?With smaller social achievements, Washington said. With helping young people love the game recreationally, while pursuing a better life than those in less affluent African-American communities have been dealt.He talked of a young female graduate of his program who recently finished college without any debt, thanks to a tennis scholarship. And for the foundation\u2019s head tennis pro, he hired Marc Atkinson, who began playing at Washington\u2019s facility in sixth grade and walked onto the Florida A&M tennis team.\u201cHe\u2019s married with three kids, and at some point, I imagine he\u2019s going to introduce the sport to his kids,\u201d Washington said. \u201cYou know, I often think back to my ancestors and the challenges they had, whether it\u2019s my parents growing up in the Deep South in the 1940s and 1950s, or my great-great-grandpa who was born a slave. I can trace my lineage back to people who were getting up and getting after it, who were trying to make a better life for themselves and their kids.\u201cSo with the thousands of kids that we\u2019re helping, that tennis champion may be part of that next generation, or the one after that. You don\u2019t know, but maybe 20 years from now, or 50 years from now, you\u2019ll be able to look at a kid and track back a lineage to my youth foundation and that would be really cool.\u201dTold that he sounded more like Ashe the humanitarian than Ashe the Grand Slam champion, Washington nodded with approval. His two meetings with Ashe produced \u201cno deep conversations,\u201d he said, and he did not heed Ashe\u2019s advice on staying in school, though he eventually earned a degree in finance from the University of North Florida.A voice was nonetheless heard, and still resounds.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Newest Curse of the Mummy: Bad Drainage", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut at the ancient temple of Kom Ombo, 400 miles south of Cairo, where archaeologists recently unearthed a stack of decaying mummies, peril takes a more prosaic form: waterlogged foundations.Decades of flood irrigation in the surrounding fields, which were once desert, have soaked the soil beneath the temple. Water has penetrated the sandstone foundations, combining with salt and heat to scrub some hieroglyphs from the temple walls. The symbols and figures, effectively the lines of an ancient story, are fading to dust.\u201cExpanding into the desert is a nice dream,\u201d said the project engineer, Tom Nichols, standing on a hill behind the temple. He pointed to the fields of lush sugar cane, dotted with farmhouses, that pushed up against the temple walls. \u201cBut you need to look at the other consequences, too,\u201d he said.Unusually, a team of archaeologists is working alongside the laborers, hoping to save any treasures that are uncovered in the dig. It has found significant objects, including a bust of Marcus Aurelius, an Old Kingdom pottery workshop and a relief of Sobek, the crocodile god of the temple. On a searing July afternoon, one archaeologist held forth an ancient lunch: a fistful of charred, 4,000-year-old grains of wheat, discovered in an excavated urn.\u201cThis project allows us to rewrite the history of the temple,\u201d said the director of Kom Ombo, Ahmed Sayed Ahmed.The most exciting discovery may have been in recent weeks, when archaeologists pulled a sand-encrusted sphinx from a damp hole. It has been dated to the Ptolemaic era, which ran from 305 B.C. to 30 B.C.At less than two feet tall, the sphinx is a dwarf compared with the famed Great Sphinx of Giza, which rises to 65 feet and stretches 240 feet from head to tail. It also had a broken paw and no identifying markings.But unlike the Giza sphinx, whose features are badly eroded by time and the elements, the Kom Ombo sphinx is finely preserved \u2014 as is the sense of its mythic power: a man\u2019s head on a lion\u2019s body, its wide eyes once again staring out after 2,000 years in the dark.Even a diminutive sphinx symbolized a fierce devotion to the temple gods, said Matthew Douglas Adams, a research scholar at New York University\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts. \u201cIt signified that the king was guarding the temple and keeping out the forces of chaos,\u201d he said.Keeping the water out is another matter.The water troubles at Kom Ombo, and at many other Pharaonic sites along the Nile, are a product of one of Egypt\u2019s proudest successes.In the decades since, though, the unwanted side effects of the Aswan Dam have become gradually more apparent. In some parts of the fertile Nile Delta, the dam has caused increased salinity, forcing farmers to switch crops or abandon fields entirely. And the Pharaonic temples lining the river have also suffered.Many of the temples were built at a time when the surrounding area was desert, and down through the centuries became cocooned in layers of sand \u2014 near ideal conditions for preservation. But today the temples are hemmed in by lush fields, farmhouses and a country of nearly 100 million people.Climate change has brought harsher, more variable weather, and it has accelerated the decay caused by rising groundwater. Untreated sewage and leaking water from informal houses have also contributed to the problem.The first sign of water damage is often faded hieroglyphs, said Mr. Adams, the scholar. \u201cEven if it just concerns a few areas of inscription, what remains of ancient Egypt is a very finite resource,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen any piece of it is gone, it is gone forever.\u201dThe money has been particularly welcome by the financially struggling government of Egypt, where tourism has slumped since the Arab Spring in 2011. But American funding is now less assured: The Trump administration has signaled its intention to slash billions from the United States Agency for International Development\u2019s budget, as part of its \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda.In some ways, the temple trouble is the opposite of what concerns most Egyptians, whose worry is not too much water, but too little. Their country faces chronic water shortages because of pollution, waste and the demands of a soaring population. A massive hydroelectric dam under construction in Ethiopia, on the Blue Nile, has heightened public anxiety.The story may come to a conclusion next year when the Grand Egyptian Museum, under construction near the Pyramids of Giza, is scheduled to open its doors. The $1 billion museum will store over 100,000 artifacts, making it the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 including all 5,000 pieces from Tutankhamen\u2019s tomb, on display for the first time since their discovery.Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trudeau Sought Support From Mexico\u2019s President on Nafta", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada appealed to President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico this week to help salvage a three-country North American Free Trade Agreement as the White House prepared to send Congress a bilateral trade deal with Mexico.The telephone conversation between the two leaders, which took place on Thursday, came as the United States and Mexico were poised to release text of the trade pact reached last month that excludes Canada. The White House had set a Sunday deadline for delivering text of the agreement to Congress and was expected to release the details sometime this weekend. Those close to the discussions said the situation remained fluid and that discussions between the three countries were expected to continue over the weekend.The overture by Mr. Trudeau comes at a rocky moment between the United States and Canada, as President Trump threatens to leave Canada out of the 25-year-old Nafta and tax its cars as punishment for not agreeing to the United States\u2019 trade demands.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, speaking to reporters on Friday, said that Mr. Trudeau had asked him \u201cto intervene to bring the United States to an understanding\u201d and that he had agreed to help.\u201cWe want to maintain a good relationship with Canada of course and a good relationship with the United States,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said.Mexico\u2019s economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said late Friday that Canada and the United States would be involved in an intense effort over the weekend to reach an agreement over the remaining issues dividing them.\u201cFor the first time there is real effort\u201d on both sides, he said. \u201cIn the next 48 hours, we will know whether we will have a trilateral text or whether we will have to release the text of a bilateral understanding\u201d which could then be adapted to incorporate Canada.It is unclear whether the United States and Canada can bridge the differences that have so far stymied an agreement. And Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said he had no plans to reopen the trade pact that Mexico, under the leadership of Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, had reached last month.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put our economic future, our financial stability at risk. We want there to be investment in Mexico so that there are jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why we are not going to reopen the deal, the agreement with the United States. We have already concluded this matter.\u201dHe added: \u201cI told him that we would insist that the treaty would be trilateral.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office said that the prime minister and the president-elect \u201cagreed to work closely together to further strengthen the dynamic partnership between Canada and Mexico,\u201d and that \u201cthey discussed Nafta and the mutually beneficial economic and trading relationship between our two countries.\u201dA spokesman for the office of the United States trade representative declined to comment. At a United Nations summit meeting in New York this week, Mr. Trump said that he rejected a meeting with Mr. Trudeau, which the prime minister said he never requested.The Sept. 30 deadline is being fueled by political considerations in both the United States and Mexico. Mr. Trump and Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto want to sign the pact by Nov. 30, before the new Mexican administration takes over and before a potential change in control of the United States Congress.But the agreement faces an uncertain fate without Canada. Lawmakers have urged the White House to continue working to retain a trilateral pact that has become critical to automakers, farmers and other businesses across North America.The release of the text does not preclude Canada from joining the agreement but, for that to happen, the United States and Canada must resolve some the remaining issues that have so far prevented a deal.Many of the most significant changes to Nafta involve the rules governing car manufacturing, which are being altered in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico.The preliminary agreement unveiled in August required that at least 75 percent of a car\u2019s value be produced in North America for a company to import it into the United States duty free. That is up from 62.5 percent under the original Nafta.Carmakers also would be required to use more local steel, aluminum, glass and other parts. And 40 to 45 percent of vehicles would have to be made by workers earning at least $16 an hour. That increase is intended to increase jobs in the United States and Canada, where wages are higher.Those changes are generally acceptable to Canada, but it remains resistant to broadening access to the Canadian dairy market and to abandoning an independent tariff dispute settlement system. Mexico has agreed to put off discussions over removing tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on steel and aluminum imports, but Canadian negotiators have argued that these should be lifted as part of a new Nafta deal.Robert E. Lighthizer, the Trump administration\u2019s chief negotiator, told lawmakers this week that talks with Canada would continue even after the release of the agreement with Mexico. Administration officials are hopeful that Canada will be more willing to make concessions after provincial elections take place in October. Modest changes to the text can be made after it has been released and even after it has been signed.\u201cGoing forward, Ways and Means and Finance Republicans and Democrats will be analyzing this carefully and looking for ways to advance a three-country agreement,\u201d Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on Friday.He added: \"I\u2019m hopeful Canada steps it up and steps to the table in a big way.\u201dBusiness groups have also been expressing their trepidation about moving forward with a free-trade agreement that does not include Canada.\u201cIf Canada doesn\u2019t come into the deal, there is no deal,\u201d Thomas Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, warned last week. Those concerns were echoed on Friday by the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that represents the leaders of major American companies. \u201cOur northern ally is critical to allow trade to strengthen the U.S. economy,\u201d the group said.Relations between the governments of the United States and Canada have fallen to their lowest point in recent memory, leaving open the possibility that no deal will be reached anytime soon. Mr. Trump said this week that he was frustrated with how Canada had been behaving during negotiations and vowed that he would be just as happy to levy tariffs on imports of Canadian cars \u2014 a move that would likely spur backlash from carmakers and consumers in the United States.After imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports against the wishes of businesses, Mr. Trump does not appear to put much stock in those concerns.\u201cYou have to believe when he threatens to do it on automobiles that he might, even though this would be incredibly painful for Americans as well,\u201d said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.Preserving a healthy trade relationship with the United States is pivotal to Canada\u2019s economy, but many in the country have been supportive of Mr. Trudeau\u2019s firm stance in the face of threats from Mr. Trump.\u201cHad Trudeau caved in to the demands on a whole range of issues, it would have been politically indefensible in Canada,\u201d said Lawrence Herman, an international trade lawyer in Toronto.For months now, Canadians have followed the Nafta negotiations with the rapt attention normally reserved for hockey playoffs. Almost three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports flow south across the border. But more worrisome to the Canadian economy than an end of Nafta is the prospect of a 25 percent tariff on automobile and auto part exports heading into the United States that Mr. Trump has threatened.That would cripple Canada\u2019s largest manufacturing sector, putting an estimated 250,000 people out of work, according to one forecast. It would also cast a shadow over the government of Mr. Trudeau, who faces his own re-election in a year\u2019s time.\u201cThat can only hurt the prime minister,\u201d said Janice Stein, founding director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \u201cWere that to happen, once you unroll tariffs, it\u2019s not easy to roll them back.\u201dMs. Stein, however, remained optimistic that negotiators come out with deal in the next 10 days. \u201cEveryone knows what\u2019s at stake,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated Lawrence Herman\u2019s law practice location. He is an international trade lawyer in Toronto, not Ottawa.Catherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Biography Is Not Enough, for John McCain or Anyone Else", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe senator\u2019s heroism should not blind us to his political failures.Mr. Buskirk is editor and publisher of the journal American Greatness and a contributing opinion writer.Biography does not predict success in office. It never has. And yet we\u2019re all drawn to it. We love personal stories of heroism, sacrifice, challenges overcome, outstanding virtue. That said, we should also recognize that a compelling back story may be necessary, but it is not a sufficient condition for political greatness. Which brings me to John McCain.The rationale behind his political career was always his personal story: son and grandson of admirals, Annapolis, naval aviator and finally long-term prisoner of war. Military service, especially under the extreme duress of combat and imprisonment, is certainly noble. But surely we can agree that not everyone who has sacrificed for his (or her) country would make a great statesman. Aristotle describes the primary virtue needed for statesmen as prudence, what might be better described as practical wisdom. Yet prudence is a word that has rarely, if ever, been invoked in relation to Senator McCain. What we heard instead were terms like maverick, honorable, heroic \u2014 and it\u2019s these charismatic qualities that afforded Mr. McCain a large degree of latitude when he chose to oppose his own party.Throughout Mr. McCain\u2019s long political career, he was the Republican most beloved by Democrats. The reason is simple: They often agreed, especially when it came to sticking a thumb in the eye of Republicans and undermining conservative priorities. His service to the country as an aviator and a prisoner of war deserves nothing but praise and commendation. Such devotion to the country cannot be emulated too often. But Mr. McCain\u2019s political legacy is more complicated. When discussing it, we must not conflate his military service or even his personal sacrifice with political wisdom or effectiveness. In fact, John McCain\u2019s career is an example of the danger of electing \u2014 and re-electing \u2014 politicians based on their personal story rather than on demonstrated political accomplishments. Throughout his political life Senator McCain either misunderstood or disagreed with the principles that animate the party whose members he relied upon for electoral success. He ended up staying in office with votes from a coalition of Republicans afraid that abandoning him would mean electing a Democrat and Democrats who saw him as an ally. I speak as a lifetime Arizona Republican who has heard fellow conservatives justify voting for Mr. McCain in just such terms for decades. His 2016 re-election is a case in point. To win his narrowest victory, he patched together 53.7 percent of the vote (down from 58.7 percent in 2010) by winning 16 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of independents.What I found truly objectionable was that legitimate criticism of Mr. McCain\u2019s politics and policies here in Arizona was countered by the reply that he was a war hero. While that should earn someone personal respect, even deference, it should not be used as a weapon to silence dissent. During his long political career, Mr. McCain maintained a very high profile as one of the most quoted Republican senators and most sought-after television guests. Yet he left virtually no legislative mark. The one major piece of legislation which he underwrote was the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill that, in directing money away from political parties and into independent expenditure groups, had precisely the opposite effect from what was intended. Likewise, he was a relentless proponent of military spending, but there is no significant national security legislation that exists because of Mr. McCain. Yet his fingerprints are clear on some signal Republican failures. This was often characterized as \u201cindependence.\u201dMr. McCain built a brand around being an un-Republican and the media lavished praise on him for that. He clearly relished the role of an outsider who would tell it like it is. But was that really who he was? Or was he just another senator with presidential aspirations and a flare for fraternal invective?Of course, Mr. McCain was not the first or the last politician to use his military service as a prophylactic against criticism. But that\u2019s dangerous. No politician should be beyond the reach of public criticism regardless of prior service to the country. The issues at stake are too important. What\u2019s worse is that this sense of invulnerability encourages the self-regard to which many politicians are already prone.Much responsibility lies with voters, who must not allow themselves to be hypnotized by a compelling biography. Mr. McCain was out of step with his Republican constituents on virtually every major issue of the past generation, including Obamacare, immigration and foreign policy, where Mr. McCain had long supported military intervention around the globe \u2014 a policy that has cost our nation dearly. In the senate, Mr. McCain was the Democrats\u2019 near-perfect instrument for hectoring Republicans. He relished his role as a gadfly, and Democrats were eager to encourage him because doing so made the Republican conference less united and less effective. Of course, the paeans to Mr. McCain ended briefly when he ran for president against Barack Obama.The formula was simple: when he was a foil against Senate Republicans, he was a straight-talking American hero; when he was running for president against Mr. Obama, he was a dangerous madman. It didn\u2019t help that his behavior in the 2008 election was quirky to the point of being erratic. Remember that at one point during the financial crisis he unilaterally suspended his campaign and flew back to Washington, and then began campaigning again a few days later having done nothing noteworthy. It demonstrated for the nation the sort of impulsiveness Arizonans had grown used to. It was supposed to be a grand gesture that demonstrated that he was above politics and therefore more worthy of the presidency than his opponent. It actually demonstrated self-indulgence and a lack of political maturity. As a result, when he faced Mr. Obama and his substantial political talents, he lost the Electoral College by 2 to 1.In some sense, McCain\u2019s biography \u2014 and the overheated rhetoric it encouraged in discussions of his political persona \u2014 deprived him of agency. He often seemed to be playing a role created for him by others. Even his work on campaign finance reform with Russ Feingold seemed to lack a guiding principle. It was more a form of penance for his implication in the pay-to-play Keating Five scandal. He became a symbol when what Arizona needed was a legislator.Part of Mr. McCain\u2019s legacy, which is yet to be fully understood, should serve as a warning to us. We can honor John McCain the man while having reservations about his political career. Among the things for which he will be remembered are his service to the country in the United States Navy, his advocacy for a strong military, his opposition to torture, the Keating Five scandal, two unsuccessful presidential runs, his yearslong feud with conservatives in his own party and the vote that killed Obamacare reform. It\u2019s a mixed bag. So let\u2019s honor the good and noble in Mr. McCain\u2019s life while not being afraid to be point out \u2014 and even carry on \u2014 legitimate political disagreements.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Post-\u2018Rahmbo\u2019 Chicago and the Death of Triangulation", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe centrist mayor will no longer seek re-election, leaving a power vacuum in the city.Ms. Bellware is a Chicago-based news and culture reporter.CHICAGO \u2014 Harold Washington, Chicago\u2019s first Black mayor, famously said that in this town, \u201cpolitics ain\u2019t beanbag.\u201d The battles can be ruthless. A former senior White House aide to Presidents Clinton and Obama, he\u2019s long been credited for his ability to triangulate between voting constituencies and business interests. In the beginning, Mr. Emanuel\u2019s national stage experience and confrontational style were welcomed by a wide majority of voters as a necessary force to bring stability to the city and its tattered finances.But the enthusiasm surrounding him soon faded with a spate of decisions that would come to embody, at least in his critics\u2019 eyes, the legacy of the Emanuel agenda: Investment in big business, tourism and amenities for the already-affluent at the expense of the city\u2019s most vulnerable. Although he\u2019s unlikely to ever admit it, the bombshell announcement, six months from Election Day, was a tacit acknowledgment that his triangulating balancing act could no longer manage a tenuous coalition that once included black ward bosses, upper-middle-class North Siders, the city\u2019s megawealthy, centrist elderly voters and a mix of local labor unions. His exit from the race is an obvious boon for the dozen or more mayoral candidates who no longer have to face a two-term incumbent with a multimillion dollar war chest; and yet whoever emerges victorious will still have to navigate these same shifting and dissolving coalitions. Perhaps more important, they\u2019ll have to find out how to be an effective leader of the nation\u2019s third largest city without being seen as overly controlling, a perception which led to Mr. Emanuel\u2019s collapse in support. (A soft-focus campaign ad for his 2015 re-election effort featured his admitting \u201cI can rub people the wrong way,\u201d and that he talked, when he \u201cshould have listened.\u201d) The unique, highly concentrated, \u201cboss\u201d type structure of Chicago\u2019s mayoralty traditionally enables a unilateral style. City rules give the mayor power to appoint and oversee school board members and the chief of public schools \u2014 without real City Council oversight \u2014 as well as the leaders of the fire, police, transit and water departments. The mayor also has the ability to fill vacant seats on the City Council, can quietly wield the threat of suppressing new funding to unsupportive wards and controls a multimillion dollar discretionary fund, siphoned from local taxes, known as Tax Increment Financing. Chicagoans have already signaled they want a mayor with less power and more accountability. In 2015, voters overwhelmingly backed a (nonbinding) referendum that would transfer school board control from the mayor to voters. And state lawmakers are working on a bill to make it a reality. Progressive voters and activists, meanwhile, have also called for civilian oversight of the police department.In a phrase, mayoral hopefuls must now argue for their vision of Chicago, and not simply against the legacy of Rahm Emanuel \u2014 and once in power, they\u2019ll likely have less of it than him. Finding answers to the same questions that bedeviled Mr. Emanuel throughout his two terms will be tricky: How to pay for the city\u2019s massive pension liability while keeping taxes and fees low enough to prevent working class residents and businesses from fleeing? How to navigate public safety and intractable gun violence when the residents most affected by it have little trust in police while the city as a whole lacks consensus on the best solutions?As mayor, Mr. Emanuel quickly wooed new businesses and jobs to an increasingly desirable downtown, led a much-needed expansion of O\u2019Hare International Airport and an extension of the school day while narrowing the city\u2019s budget deficit. But those wins weren\u2019t enough to offset the anger at his most controversial decisions, like his closing half of the city-run mental health clinics in his first budget or his appointed school board shuttering 50 public schools in largely Black and Latino neighborhoods, a move that angered and alienated many voters. And of course, there\u2019s the albatross of the Emanuel administration: his handling of the Laquan McDonald shooting.In no coincidence to his critics, Mr. Emanuel\u2019s announcement \u2014 which will do much to take him out of the spotlight \u2014 came on the eve of the trial for Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago police officer facing murder charges for the 2014 killing of Mr. McDonald, a black teenager Mr. Van Dyke shot over a dozen times. The McDonald incident is hardly the lone high-profile shooting death during Mr. Emanuel\u2019s tenure. But the dramatic release of a police dashcam video that drastically contradicted the official police account sparked outrage and calls for the resignation of Mr. Emanuel and his appointed police superintendent, Garry McCarthy. (Mr. Emanuel later fired Mr. McCarthy, and Mr. McCarthy is now running to replace Mr. Emanuel.) The chant \u201c16 shots and a cover-up\u201d became a rallying cry against Mr. Emanuel, who (for whatever his word is worth) has always refuted the accusations and maintains he didn\u2019t view the dashcam video until shortly before it was publicly released. The Van Dyke trial will conclude while Mr. Emanuel is still mayor, but the political fallout surrounding the outcome is sure to dominate at least the first couple years of his successor\u2019s tenure. Chicago\u2019s next mayor must oversee the implementation of the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s forthcoming consent decree with a police department resistant to reform, operating disproportionately in Black and Latino communities, which make up more than half of the city and are highly skeptical of law enforcement\u2019s intentions.Above all, the end of the Emanuel era almost guarantees a wider shift in power citywide. One of the mayor\u2019s most effective cudgels was money; his local and national fund-raising networks could boost the campaigns of loyal City Council allies and scuttle those of his opponents. Without that threat, individual aldermen could very well break free of their infamous \u201crubber stamp council\u201d label and substantively push back on the next mayor\u2019s agenda. And the city\u2019s activist community, which is deservedly viewing Mr. Emanuel\u2019s exit as a victory, is poised to draw more clout, if not a big seat at the table. Advertisement"}

But you\u2019re not doing anything impressive, and you know it. Here\u2019s how to keep your groove from turning into a rut.I work at a very large nonprofit in a creative role. I am paid well, with good benefits and absolutely fantastic colleagues. The general line of work is exactly what I want to be doing; specific assignments range from \u201ceh\u201d to enjoyable. There are enough fringe benefits to support personal growth (though I haven\u2019t used them much).That said: I\u2019m in a niche role with pretty much zero possibility for vertical growth. I stay here largely because I have a great thing going. My creative body of work (my \u201cportfolio\u201d) has stagnated as a result. It isn\u2019t bad, just increasingly unremarkable. And that\u2019s been a constant ache in the back of my mind for at least three years now. But the truth of the matter is that I\u2019m not really motivated to leave or to bolster my portfolio on the side. I\u2019m happily content saving money, investing in my future and putting my energy into social and personal matters. And yet I fear my career is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode in my face. How do I reconcile?NEW YORKActually, you\u2019re not happily content. If you really were, you wouldn\u2019t be writing to the Workologist, describing a \u201cconstant ache\u201d and a fear that your career is a \u201cticking time bomb.\u201d You\u2019d be blithely going about your business without a care in the world. But in fact this stagnation, as you describe it, is clearly bothering you. If you want to make that aching fear go away, you\u2019ll have to do something about it. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to quit a job that you enjoy and thrust yourself into some new situation that\u2019s a nonstop creative challenge. But you could, for instance, seek out work within your current job that forces you to learn new things, or otherwise push your own boundaries. To be clear, there\u2019s nothing wrong with contentment, and I\u2019m not an advocate of change for the sake of change. If you\u2019ve got a good thing that you appreciate, keep it. But the danger of contentment, particularly in the modern job market, is that it can slide into complacency. That ache you feel might indeed be a kind of warning signal to yourself. Take it as motivation to push a little, before your groove becomes a rut. Over time you\u2019ll find it\u2019s better to be engaged and learning and growing than it is to feel that it\u2019s \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d from here on out. You don\u2019t have to reinvent your life, just find new ways to keep work interesting. Sometimes the best way to attain real contentment is to make yourself, now and then, a little uncomfortable. I was an executive recruiter for over 20 years, and if an omission like that had been discovered, it probably would have ended the applicant\u2019s candidacy immediately. How would you feel if your spouse had been married previously for five months but figured it wasn\u2019t worth mentioning to you, so he or she never did? BARBARA P., CHICAGOOf course one should exercise both common sense, and common ethical decency, in crafting a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Don\u2019t claim to have walked on the moon if you didn\u2019t; don\u2019t cover up your conviction for embezzlement when applying for a finance job. That said, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is not a legal document; it\u2019s a personal marketing document. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sin to leave off a five-month gig that was just a bad match, says nothing about your skills or your character, and was a one-off negative experience. I hesitate to equate an employer with a spouse, but this is less comparable to a prior marriage than to an ill-fated fling. Still, individual opinions about that may vary: If it feels uncomfortable or dishonest to leave a job off, then don\u2019t. Agreed, there is at least some potential risk that an employer could find out and sour on you. That\u2019s why the option was mentioned as something to consider, and most of the column focused on how to best explain a bad experience that you\u2019ve chosen to disclose. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Human Rights Council Ratchets Up Pressure on Myanmar", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGENEVA \u2014 The United Nations Human Rights Council stepped up pressure to punish Myanmar\u2019s military commanders for a brutal campaign against Rohingya Muslims, deciding on Thursday to create a body to expedite criminal prosecutions.The council overwhelmingly supported a resolution to set up an \u201cindependent mechanism\u201d that will collect and analyze evidence of the \u201cmost serious international crimes\u201d and prepare dossiers that will make it easier for prosecutors to bring cases to trial in national, regional or international courts.The council\u2019s action came a month after a United Nations fact-finding team said Myanmar\u2019s army commander, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, and other top generals should be prosecuted in an international court. It recommended prosecution on charges of genocide for a campaign that forced some 750,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh, and crimes against humanity in connection with actions against other ethnic minorities.The team presented a 444-page report to the council this month, setting out harrowing details of a Myanmar Army campaign that led to the systematic slaughter of thousands of people, the mass rape of women and girls, and the wholesale destruction of villages.Myanmar has flatly rejected charges that its security forces committed mass atrocities, and it refused to cooperate with the fact-finding team. Its ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Kyaw Moe Tun, told the council that the team\u2019s report was based on \u201cunverified information\u201d and that the resolution would impede dialogue and the repatriation of those who fled.Thirty-five of the council\u2019s 47 members backed the resolution. The only countries to oppose it were China, the Philippines and Burundi. The others abstained or did not vote.Thursday\u2019s resolution was the product of a collaboration between all 28 countries in the European Union and all 57 states in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. It was co-sponsored by more than 100 countries from all regions.\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Farukh Amil, Pakistan\u2019s ambassador and the coordinator of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, told reporters after the vote, referring to the level of cooperation. \u201cThis is a very powerful message that has gone to the government of Myanmar.\u201dThe body created by the council will be similar to the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism set up by the General Assembly two years ago to assist in investigation and prosecution of those responsible for human rights atrocities in Syria. Diplomats expected the new entity to be up and running within the year.A significant difference is that unlike the Syria body, which operates on voluntary contributions from states, the Myanmar body will be financed from core United Nations funds and spared of the need to lobby internationally for resources.The council also voted to extend the mandate of the fact-finding team for a year.Diplomats saw Thursday\u2019s decision as a first step toward tackling the far more contentious issue of how or where to prosecute those identified as responsible.The International Criminal Court has ruled that it has jurisdiction to investigate the forced eviction of Rohingyas from Myanmar. But calls for the United Nations Security Council to refer Myanmar to the court for investigation of the full range of atrocities would likely be vetoed by China.Another option would be the creation of an ad hoc tribunal of the sort set up to prosecute crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. But that would also require Security Council backing, and China could block that, too.\u201cThe pressure to move forward on this is very high,\u201d Walter Stevens, the European Union\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told reporters.Diplomats and human rights groups saw the Human Rights Council vote as demonstrating its ability to deliver meaningful action on critical human rights issues soon after the United States decided to pull out on the grounds that it was ineffective.It \u201cshows multilateralism remains very important,\u201d Mr. Amil, Pakistan\u2019s ambassador, said. \u201cThe U.N. works, the Human Rights Council works.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the European Union\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva.

She was 68.The cause was complications after surgery for an intestinal blockage, said Don Sherry, a friend and former colleague who made a documentary about her life.A charming, towheaded child, Pam was first chosen to represent a local chapter of the infantile paralysis foundation in her native Oklahoma City. She then rose through what the March of Dimes archivist David Rose, in a telephone interview, compared to \u201ca farm system in baseball\u201d to become the charity\u2019s national poster child for polio in 1959.\u201cIt\u2019s not given to you as a punishment; it is a random thing that happens on planet Earth,\u201d she said.Ms. Henry made an impression on the many celebrities she met on her tour of the country, including Mamie Eisenhower, Tony Curtis, Lena Horne, John F.

Businesses are desperate for workers. Yet at the same time, a large group of people can\u2019t find a job.  Jesibel Done is 20. She\u2019s a high-school graduate supporting others members of her family. She\u2019d love to buy a house. But the most she\u2019s ever made is $10.25 an hour. (Do that for a year, and you make $21,320.) She\u2019s worked at Walmart, Family Dollar, Hollister and 7-Eleven. She\u2019s often left a job because family problems needed attention or because of conflicts with co-workers. But she finds another one quickly. \u201cIf I keep looking and calling, I usually get a job in a week or two,\u201d she said. At 7-Eleven, she worked the night shift, sometimes running a store alone overnight in Elizabeth, N.J. \u2014 not a great place for doing that. Still, she considers that the best job she has ever had \u2014 because 7-Eleven pays workers even during their lunch breaks. \u201cYou get your whole paycheck,\u201d she said. There are millions of people like Ms. Done. They\u2019d love to have a real career and be able to support a family. But life gets in the way: Training can cost tens of thousands of dollars. They can\u2019t take time off from work to study. They have no one to take care of the children. The car has broken down. They\u2019ve lost their driver's license. Bus fare costs too much.  The best job-training programs understand that students lead complicated lives. What can work for people reading at elementary school level, who can\u2019t do fractions, who didn\u2019t graduate from high school? (Or even worse \u2014 they graduated, but without those skills.) \u201cWe are cradle to grave,\u201d said Rodney Brutton, the director of work force development. New Community offers infant day care, a nursing home and a lot in between: therapeutic counseling, high-school equivalency classes, housing, health care, a charter school, a food pantry \u2014 even a community newspaper. Job training has been a centerpiece for many years. For example, the Ford Motor Company spent a million dollars 25 years ago to create an automotive training facility for New Community \u2014 a giant mechanic\u2019s garage with a classroom in the back. Ford did it so its dealerships could hire the graduates. New Community also has courses in construction and building trades, culinary arts, medical assistance and patient care. I met Ms. Done in the clinical medical assistant course, whose schedule is 9 to 3, five days a week, for six months. Her goal is to get a job at the beige brick complex of University Hospital, which you can see from New Community\u2019s window. Starting pay is $19.80. Because New Community is an accredited postsecondary school, students can get federal Pell grants. No student can owe more than $1,800. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t put me in much debt,\u201d Ms. Done said. (Students at for-profit trade schools can emerge from a course with $20,000 or more in debt.) Three years ago, New Community started working with Local Initiatives Support Corporation to improve its wallet-related programs. The company helped New Community to start and fund what it calls a financial opportunities center, making it one of about 90 community organizations with such an attribute. Typically, such centers include a job coach; a social services expert to connect clients to supports that they qualify for, such as bus passes or supplemental food aid; and a financial adviser to help clients reduce debt, set goals and start to save. New Community had been doing some of those things, but piecemeal. \u201cYou can say we were connecting students to living-wage jobs and careers, but it was almost a half-baked cake,\u201d Mr. Brutton said. \u201cYes, we got them a job, but they still went to the local check-cashing place. They did not develop strategies on how to save. They didn\u2019t have a financial goal, what it is they want to save for.\u201d The other big Local Initiatives innovation is Bridges to Career Opportunities. New Community just started Bridges two weeks ago. Bridges teaches basic math, science and reading, tailored to each course. The health care courses, for example, are using a number line to put unit measures in order and learning fractions by calculating dosage. They study the prefixes, suffixes and roots of medical terminology. The automotive, culinary and building trades courses will have their own tailored lessons. The students might not have been paying attention in high school, but they\u2019re paying attention now. \u201cThis is why we need to know fractions,\u201d Mr. Brutton said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just because my math teacher said so. It\u2019s that I have to cut this piece of Sheetrock and frame up this room.\u201d Bridges runs at the same time as the course it serves, at least two hours a day, three days a week. Traditional remedial education elsewhere is a prerequisite to real courses \u2014 and students don\u2019t earn credits for it. This is why a lot of students leave college. \u201cThey might not even get into that training program because their math skills are not up to snuff, and they \u2018re going to use their Pell money on remedial education and they\u2019re going to hate it and be out,\u201d said Seung Kim, the Local Initiatives organization\u2019s senior program director for family income and wealth. The Bridges program is two years old and now in 31 Local Initiatives sites, in 11 cities. The organization said the average Bridges class raises math and reading skills about two grade levels. What separates the Local Initiatives organization and its partners from other job-training programs is its holistic approach. \u201cOften people just do work force \u2014 just that one component,\u201d said Maurice Jones, the president and chief executive of Local Initiatives. \u201cBut there\u2019s all the other things: financial competency, transportation and housing and child care. You have to really do all of these things simultaneously if you really want to have a lasting impact helping people get into living-wage jobs and careers.\u201d Mr. Jones said the study showed that clients were getting jobs, but having trouble keeping them. \u201cThey had these other things they were battling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had challenges keeping people in jobs long enough for wages to increase.\u201d The organization began telling its job coaches to stay with clients, even after they found employment. \u201cThe value of coaching does not stop when someone gets a job,\u201d Mr. Jones said. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t have been a revelation, but it was.\u201d Now the Local Initiatives company is also starting a pilot program of retention-focused coaching in three sites. Transportation and child-care issues don\u2019t go away, Mr. Jones said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t help folks solve these problems, I don\u2019t care how great your skill imparting is. They won\u2019t be able to get to work on time.\u201d A previous version of this article misspelled the name of a nationwide company that supports community organizations.

{"Headline": "Cheaper Battery Is Unveiled as a Step to a Carbon-Free Grid", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLithium-ion batteries have become essential for powering electric cars and storing energy generated by solar panels and wind turbines. But their drawbacks are also by now familiar: They use scarce minerals, are vulnerable to fires and explosions, and are pricey.A plentiful, safe and more affordable alternative would be worth a lot.On Wednesday, an energy company headed by the California billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong announced that it had developed a rechargeable battery operating on zinc and air that can store power at far less than the cost of lithium-ion batteries.Tests of the zinc energy-storage systems have helped power villages in Africa and Asia as well as cellphone towers in the United States for the last six years, without any backup from utilities or the electric grid, Dr. Soon-Shiong said.\u201cIt could change and create completely new economies using purely the power of the sun, wind and air,\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong, a surgeon and a biotechnology entrepreneur, said in an interview in Los Angeles before the announcement.The battery units, in conjunction with solar arrays, can be combined to create a microgrid system powering a village or a larger area, Dr. Soon-Shiong said. They have been deployed to support 110 villages in nine countries in Asia and Africa \u2014 including places that otherwise relied on generators or even lacked electricity, he said.The International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank fostering private-sector projects in developing countries, was an early investor in NantEnergy, and an agency representative sits on the company\u2019s board.The United States Department of Energy made development grants to NantEnergy (formerly known as Fluidic Energy) totaling $5 million, Dr. Soon-Shiong said.NantEnergy, based in Phoenix and in El Segundo, Calif., says it expects to expand the use of its product in telecommunications towers and eventually extend it to home energy storage, beginning in California and New York. Beyond that, it anticipates use in electric cars, buses, trains and scooters.His energy company says it is the first to commercialize the use of zinc air batteries and has more than 100 related patents. It is taking orders for delivery next year and sees the potential for a $50 billion market.Dr. Soon-Shiong said the cost of his zinc air battery had dropped steadily since development began. NantEnergy says the technology costs less than $100 per kilowatt-hour, a figure that some in the energy industry have cited as low enough to transform the electric grid into a round-the-clock carbon-free system.The prevailing cost of lithium-ion technology varies, depending on the scale and application. Yogi Goswami, distinguished university professor and director of the Clean Energy Center at the University of South Florida, estimated that it is most likely $300 to $400 a kilowatt-hour.Engineers want to turn the dam into a vast reservoir of excess electricity from the solar farms and wind turbines that represent the power sources of the future.\u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d Dr. Goswami, who was not involved in the effort, said of the advances claimed by NantEnergy. \u201cYou have to have storage.\u201dDr. Goswami said he warned in congressional testimony a quarter-century ago that storage advances would be needed as the use of solar and wind power grew. That imperative has been somewhat overshadowed as the fracking boom made natural gas plentiful.\u201cUntil recently it didn\u2019t make any sense to worry about storage because we had cheap gas,\u201d said Mark Cooper, senior research fellow for economic analysis at the Institute for Energy and the Environment at the Vermont Law School.But energy storage is increasingly needed to manage the ebb and flow of solar and wind energy that sometimes forces places like California to pay other states to take surplus power. And that need is driving innovation and decreasing cost.\u201cObviously it comes at a point where everyone is already looking for storage,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cCapitalism isn\u2019t going to deal with a problem where there isn\u2019t scarcity. In capitalism what we get is relentless reductions in cost.\u201dIn addition to their deployment in Asia and Africa, NantEnergy\u2019s batteries have been used to power more than 1,000 communications towers in the United States, Latin America and Southeast Asia. They include a Duke Energy location in North Carolina that withstood the effects of Hurricane Florence recently and Hurricane Irma last year.Sherif Abdelrazek, a senior engineer at Duke Energy, said that because the zinc air battery does not pose fire hazards as lithium-ion batteries can, it does not need external cooling systems to prevent overheating.The system\u2019s success means the Duke tower no longer needs to be connected to the electric grid, he said. As a result, 13 acres of land in the Great Smoky Mountains that was used for power lines is being turned over to the National Park Service.NantEnergy\u2019s announcement that it had reached the $100-per-kilowatt-hour threshold made the device even more attractive, Mr. Abdelrazek said.The product design is simple: plastic components and shell casing, a circuit board and zinc oxide, all in a package the size of a briefcase.In charging the batteries, electricity from solar installations is stored by converting zinc oxide to zinc and oxygen. In the discharge process, the system produces energy by oxidizing the zinc with air.The NantEnergy battery can provide power for up to 72 hours on a single charge, meaning it could have lasted throughout the period of cloud cover and stormy weather from Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas.Dan Reicher, an assistant secretary of energy in the Clinton administration, said successful development of a rechargeable zinc air battery could be a milestone in energy storage. He said the challenge had been to make such batteries reliable for continuous use. \u201cThat\u2019s an attractive characteristic if it\u2019s true,\u201d he said.But he cautioned that a battery\u2019s cost per kilowatt-hour depended on the application and scale. And he said the company\u2019s technology would have to live up to scrutiny. \u201cPeople do make claims and offer what they feel like is a legitimate set of data,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always elated to hear progress in storage, but you have to be careful.\u201dLyndon Rive, a co-founder of SolarCity \u2014 now a part of his cousin Elon Musk\u2019s company, Tesla \u2014 said recently that solar and storage innovations were likely to transform the electricity market. \u201cOver all, the trajectory is for solar to be the No. 1 source,\u201d said Mr. Rive, who left Tesla after the two companies merged two years ago.Dr. Soon-Shiong said he knew Mr. Musk \u2014 a fellow South African native \u2014 and considered him a visionary for his accomplishments in electric vehicles and energy storage. \u201cWe both are trying to make the world a better place,\u201d Dr. Soon-Shiong said.Tesla has based its businesses on lithium-ion technology, and Mr. Musk has told shareholders that the company may get the cost of lithium-ion cells down to $100 a kilowatt-hour this year.NantEnergy made its announcement weeks after California mandated 100 percent carbon-free electricity in the state by 2045. Legislators have also approved a bill providing about $1 billion in subsidies for residential energy storage.\u201cCalifornia is obviously in need of that kind of breakthrough to meet our goals,\u201d said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group. \u201cI cannot claim to be in absolute certainty that this is everything they say it is, but it\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s this kind of breakthrough that we expect from our innovators.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the status of a California move to provide subsidies for energy storage. Such a bill has been approved by legislators; it has not been signed into law.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Growing Legal Team Has a Problem: It\u2019s Operating Partly in the Dark", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Nearly a dozen lawyers now assist President Trump in contending with two federal investigations, one in Washington and one in New York, that could pose serious threats to his presidency and his businesses. But the expanding legal team is struggling to understand where the investigations could be headed and the extent of Mr. Trump\u2019s legal exposure.The lawyers have only a limited sense of what many witnesses \u2014 including senior administration officials and the president\u2019s business associates \u2014 have told investigators and what the Justice Department plans to do with any incriminating information it has about Mr. Trump, according to interviews with more than a dozen people close to the president.What is more, it is not clear if Mr. Trump has given his lawyers a full account of some key events in which he has been involved as president or during his decades running the Trump Organization.His plea brings to four the number of former close associates of Mr. Trump who have agreed to cooperate with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election and obstruction of justice by the president. And while Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers insist Mr. Mueller has nothing on their client about colluding with Russia, they are bracing for him to write a damaging report to Congress about whether the president obstructed justice.The sense of unease among the president\u2019s lawyers can be traced, in part, to their client. Mr. Trump has repeatedly undermined his position by posting on Twitter or taking other actions that could add to the obstruction case against him. But those close to the president also blame the strategy pursued by the first head of his legal team, John Dowd, to cooperate fully with Mr. Mueller while negotiating few concessions.By early this year, the president had concluded that the strategy Mr. Dowd promised would help bring the Mueller investigation to a quick conclusion had failed, and shortly afterward, he was gone.Mr. Dowd took Mr. Trump at his word that he had done nothing wrong and never conducted a full internal investigation to determine the president\u2019s true legal exposure. During Mr. Dowd\u2019s tenure, prosecutors interviewed at least 10 senior administration officials without Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers first learning what the witnesses planned to say, or debriefing their lawyers afterward \u2014 a basic step that could have given the president\u2019s lawyers a view into what Mr. Mueller had learned. And once Mr. Dowd was gone, the new legal team had to spend at least 20 hours interviewing the president about the episodes under investigation, another necessary step Mr. Dowd and his associates had apparently not completed.\u201cPresident Trump has been ill served by a legal team that failed to negotiate access, debrief and prep witnesses, constrain information flow and manage expectations,\u201d said Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, an opinion shared by many friends of the president\u2019s. \u201cHe finds himself in a legal mess today because of their incompetence.\u201dNew questions about the president\u2019s first legal team arose after the journalist Bob Woodward\u2019s new book \u201cFear,\u201d was published this month. The book said that Mr. Dowd believed that Mr. Trump was a liar who was not capable of answering questions from Mr. Mueller. And in a meeting with prosecutors, Mr. Dowd said nearly as much, Mr. Woodward reported, telling Mr. Mueller that the president would most likely provide a false statement in an interview.Mr. Dowd has told associates that he believed the president when he told him he had done nothing wrong, and that he had to cooperate because he would not have prevailed in court if he fought Mr. Mueller\u2019s requests to interview witnesses or obtain documents. But he declined several requests to be interviewed about his legal strategy.In a short email on Monday, Mr. Dowd said: \u201cNone of this true. You have been badly misinformed.\u201d When asked again if he would get on the phone with reporters, he said, \u201cNo thanks.\u201dRudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s replacement for Mr. Dowd, acknowledged that given the benefit of hindsight, \u201cI think I would have done it differently.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cnow we can work with the fact that there was such complete cooperation.\u201dMr. Giuliani said that following a different strategy would have come \u201cif I knew then that Mueller would not keep his word.\u201d But he added that Mr. Dowd\u2019s efforts \u201cput us in a good position to resist a subpoena because there is no \u2018particularized need\u2019 for the president\u2019s testimony.\u201dMr. Mueller was appointed in May 2017 to investigate links between Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, but the more time the president has spent in office, the more his legal problems have grown.Even after Mr. Mueller\u2019s appointment, Mr. Trump did things like ask witnesses about what they told Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigators and put out misleading statements about contacts between his campaign and Russia, which appear to have deepened the special counsel\u2019s examination of possible obstruction.To deal with two simultaneous investigations, Mr. Trump has a patchwork of lawyers divided into separate teams inside and outside the White House, in Washington and in New York. Coordinating the group is Jay Sekulow, a prominent conservative lawyer who also works with Mr. Giuliani to manage the president\u2019s perpetual furor over the inquiries.The approach was a contrast to the initial, more cooperative phase of the president\u2019s defense begun in June 2017 when Mr. Dowd first met Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. Mr. Dowd, who had come out of retirement to help one of the president\u2019s longtime personal lawyers, Marc E. Kasowitz, offered a quick solution to the president\u2019s legal problems.Mr. Dowd explained that he had a special bond with Mr. Mueller because they had both served in the Marine Corps, and that he thought he could get him to end the investigation in a matter of weeks. Mr. Dowd said that he thought that he might even get the Justice Department to declare that Mr. Trump was not under investigation.All the president had to do, Mr. Dowd said, was cooperate with Mr. Mueller. Mr. Trump, often enticed by promises of speedy and simple fixes to complex problems, embraced Mr. Dowd\u2019s thinking.In the months after Mr. Dowd\u2019s arrival, Mr. Kasowitz, who had never intended to serve as the president\u2019s chief lawyer, saw his influence at the White House wane. Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and daughter Ivanka Trump grew wary of him, particularly as Mr. Kushner became a focal point of news articles about where Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry might lead.A tipping point for the makeshift team came that July, when The New York Times broke the news of the meeting that Mr. Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and other Trump aides, including Mr. Kushner, held during the 2016 campaign with Russians offering dirt on Mrs. Clinton.The haphazard and misleading response to the news \u2014 including a statement dictated by Mr. Trump himself \u2014 led to finger-pointing in the Trump camp and to Mr. Kasowitz\u2019s departure. And with Mr. Dowd in control, he brought in another longtime Washington lawyer, Ty Cobb, who helped move ahead with the strategy of cooperation with Mr. Mueller by turning over tens of thousands of White House documents.Mr. Cobb also predicted a quick end to the investigation. \u201cI\u2019d be embarrassed if this is still haunting the White House by Thanksgiving and worse if it\u2019s still haunting him by year end,\u201d Mr. Cobb was quoted as saying.But Mr. Dowd\u2019s personal relationship with Mr. Mueller never developed, and he began clashing with the special counsel\u2019s office over whether Mr. Trump would be interviewed. Mr. Dowd has since said that he believes Mr. Mueller \u201csnookered\u201d the Trump team into cooperating.In March, Mr. Dowd resigned, telling associates that he disagreed with the president\u2019s desire to sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller \u2014 one form of cooperation he opposed \u2014 and leaving Mr. Sekulow with the task of rebuilding the legal team from scratch, and without knowing many of the details of the case. Mr. Dowd left few notes or files about the case, which had to be recreated months after the fact.Because Mr. Trump and his advisers had concluded that the only real threat to him was impeachment, Mr. Giuliani was brought in to lead the effort to undermine Mr. Mueller\u2019s credibility with the public, while a husband and wife legal team, Jane and Marty Raskin, former federal prosecutors based in Florida, was hired to deal directly with Mr. Mueller\u2019s office. To deal with the investigation of Mr. Cohen in New York, Mr. Trump hired Joanna C. Hendon.And with Mr. Flood brought on to replace Mr. Cobb, who had also departed, a new, more aggressive team had taken shape.But if the policy of cooperation had ended, the turmoil among the lawyers had not.Since then, Mr. Trump has had discussions with Mr. Flood about replacing Mr. McGahn. But Mr. Flood is hesitant, in part because that could pull him away from one of the main reasons he initially joined the White House: to represent another president in impeachment proceedings.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, China\u2019s Richest Man, to Retire From Company He Co-Founded", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Alibaba\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, said he planned to step down from the Chinese e-commerce giant on Monday to pursue philanthropy in education, a changing of the guard for the $420 billion internet company.\u201cHe\u2019s a symbol of the health of China\u2019s private sector and how high they can fly whether he likes it or not,\u201d Duncan Clark, author of the book \u201cAlibaba: The House Jack Ma Built,\u201d said of Mr. Ma. \u201cHis retirement will be interpreted as frustration or concern whether he likes it or not.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Ma said his retirement is not the end of an era but \u201cthe beginning of an era.\u201d He said he would be spending more of his time and fortune focused on education. \u201cI love education,\u201d he said.Mr. Ma will remain on Alibaba\u2019s board of directors and continue to mentor the company\u2019s management. Mr. Ma turns 54 on Monday, which is also a holiday in China known as Teacher\u2019s Day.The retirement makes Mr. Ma one of the first founders among a generation of prominent Chinese internet entrepreneurs to step down from their companies. Firms including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com have flourished in recent years, growing to nearly rival American internet behemoths like Amazon and Google in their size, scope and ambition. For Chinese tycoons to step aside in their 50s is rare; they usually remain at the top of their organizations for many years.Mr. Ma, a natural salesman and charismatic leader, co-founded Alibaba with 17 others \u2014 some of them his students \u2014 out of his apartment in Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province in 1999.Alibaba started as an online marketplace for businesses to sell their products to other businesses. But it did not take off until it began the Taobao marketplace in 2003, which merchants used to sell goods directly to consumers. Alibaba later rolled out Alipay, an online payment service, to facilitate transactions in a country where few people had credit cards. Alipay later became Ant Financial, the financial subsidiary that Mr. Ma also controls.Today, Alibaba\u2019s empire encompasses e-commerce, online banking, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment \u2014 and even a corporate messaging service similar to Slack. The company owns or holds stakes in some of China\u2019s most important media assets, including the Twitter-like social media site Weibo and the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper The South China Morning Post.Among China\u2019s biggest companies, Alibaba is viewed as one of the firms with the deepest ranks of management talent. Many of the co-founders are still around, and professionals who joined the company later are now in charge.While Alibaba has become dominant in China, it has faced a tougher time expanding internationally. The company has increased its presence outside of China by investing in e-commerce and online finance companies in India and Southeast Asia. But its efforts to muscle into the United States largely have not been successful.As Beijing has increased its involvement in the private sector, Mr. Ma has shifted what he has said about China\u2019s government. He used to say that businesses should be in love with the government but never get married to each other, indicating that an arms-length relationship was preferred.At a conference last November, Mr. Ma was more positive. \u201cThere\u2019s no country like China in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWith political stability, social safety and 6 percent-plus economic growth, we have the best business environment.\u201dAs Alibaba has flourished, Mr. Ma has talked many times about how he did not want to spend his whole life at the company, saying he would retire one day and go back to teaching.In 2014, he created the Jack Ma Foundation, which has worked to improve education in rural China. Mr. Ma\u2019s Weibo social media handle is \u201cspokesman for village teachers \u2014 Jack Ma.\u201d Within Alibaba, he is known and referred to as \u201cTeacher Ma.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Paul Taylor Company Without Paul Taylor", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThen, in May, it was announced that Michael Novak, a 35-year-old dancer in the Taylor company, would become the artistic director-designate of the Paul Taylor Dance Foundation. The idea was that Mr. Novak would listen, watch and take notes until Mr. Taylor decided that he was ready to retire.Now, following Mr. Taylor\u2019s death from renal failure at 88, Mr. Novak is preparing \u2014 perhaps sooner than he expected \u2014 to take the reins of an organization that includes two dance companies, an archive and a school.He will also have a significant role in preserving and interpreting the legacy of one of the most important American choreographers of the 20th century. Mr. Taylor was a towering figure whose career as a choreographer began in the 1950s, rooted in experimentalism. He went on to become known for striking musicality, accessibility, an often eccentric sense of humor and a refined, at times highly technical use of everyday movement. Over the decades, he created many works now regarded as modern classics.Mr. Novak said in a telephone interview that he intended to be a responsible steward of Mr. Taylor\u2019s work while bringing it to a younger audience, and acknowledged some of the challenges he expected to face.\u201cHow do we take something that is a historical legacy,\u201d he said, \u201chow do we make it relevant and exciting and contextualize it for audiences now without diminishing the integrity of the history of the work?\u201dThe steps Mr. Taylor took over the past few years stand in contrast with how other prominent modern choreographers prepared for what would come after their deaths. Each grappled with a central question: How can works invented by a master choreographer and interpreted by a dedicated company survive their creator?Something of a cautionary tale emerged from the events that followed Martha Graham\u2019s death in 1991. Court battles over the ownership of her works lasted about a decade before a federal judge ruled that they belonged to the Martha Graham Dance Company rather than to Graham\u2019s designated heir.Mr. Tomlinson said that the foundation is the main beneficiary of Mr. Taylor\u2019s estate.Under the terms of Mr. Taylor\u2019s will, the 147 dances he created are to become the property of the foundation, Mr. Tomlinson said, along with real estate and other assets, including works by artists like Jasper Johns and Alex Katz.(Five Rauschenberg works that Mr. Taylor had owned were sold earlier for a total of $6.25 million to finance the operations of Paul Taylor American Modern Dance, an initiative to perform work by other choreographers that he announced in 2014.)In many ways, Mr. Tomlinson said, the Taylor organization will proceed as usual, but some changes are possible. For instance, he said, Taylor dancers and other employees have traditionally worked without contracts. Now, Mr. Tomlinson said, the foundation may consider giving those people, including the 18 dancers in the Paul Taylor Dance Company and the six in the company known as Taylor 2, formal employment agreements.Both companies are expected to remain largely intact, Mr. Tomlinson added. But even with that continuity, it remains to be seen how the company that bears Mr. Taylor\u2019s his name will fare without the benefit of his presence and instruction.\u201cOnce the master is gone things obviously change,\u201d said Edward Villella, the New York City Ballet star who went on to become the founding artistic director of the Miami City Ballet. \u201cA certain amount of trepidation is involved.\u201dOver the past couple of months, Mr. Novak said, he sought to soak up as much as he could from Mr. Taylor, making a series of early morning visits to his apartment on the Lower East Side to present and discuss his ideas for the 2019 and \u201920 seasons.In the future, he said, he plans to turn to other foundation veterans for assistance and guidance, including Bettie De Jong, the longtime rehearsal director and a former lead dancer; the associate rehearsal director, Michael Trusnovec, who just celebrated his 20th season as a dancer in the company; and the assistant to the artistic director, Andy LeBeau.He will also be able to draw upon the Taylor organization\u2019s Repertory Preservation Project. Mr. Tomlinson said Mr. Taylor began that effort in the early 1990s, using videotape and Labanotation, a method for recording dance movements on paper, to create an exacting record of how works were performed.Since then, close to 100 dances have been videotaped, Mr. Tomlinson said, and many dozens described on paper. Mr. Novak will also be able to call upon past company members with experience in performing particular dances to help inform current members of the company.Calling Mr. Taylor \u201ca guide, a counselor, a rebel who wasn\u2019t afraid to buck the trends and be different,\u201d Mr. Novak said he had solicited his thoughts on programming and on running a company that maintains a sense of community.During the morning meetings on the Lower East Side, he said, the two had discussed what outside choreographers the company might work with, how to create programs that combined dances with varying moods, and the importance of avoiding the expected.About programming, Mr. Taylor told him \u201cnot to be too predictable and to keep the audience guessing,\u201d Mr. Novak said. \u201cHe also told me to trust the dancers, and that they are much stronger and more resilient than people give them credit for.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But anyway \u2026 who do you think it is?By the way, about Jeff Sessions. A lot of people feel that even though he was a weasel throughout his career, they\u2019re glad he\u2019s attorney general right now. I know you\u2019re definitely not a fan, so what\u2019s your take?In that connection, I\u2019m generally of the view that people in the administration who think \u2014 as that anonymous author does \u2014 that they\u2019re saving us from Trump are really just enabling him. My only exception to this rule is Jim Mattis and anyone else in the national security apparatus, since they make me sleep better at night.We\u2019re all grateful to anybody who\u2019s staying with the administration in order to keep things from blowing up. Whoever they are, I say, stick with it, guys.But there\u2019s a heck of a lot more going on than the road to Armageddon. Trump is also delivering on a very traditional conservative wish list \u2014 tax cuts for the rich, the attempt to undermine public education in favor of private schools and charters, the assaults on Obamacare and organized labor.That\u2019s why I\u2019m so eager to see the Democrats take control of Congress. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll lead to impeachment \u2014 unless the president starts wandering around in his underwear babbling about space alien takeovers. But I want them to put the brakes on his assaults on environmental protection, health care and the safety net for the poor. Am I right in guessing you don\u2019t look at the elections the same way?But this isn\u2019t a normal presidency, so I\u2019m rooting for a Democratic Congress as a check on a dangerous and lawless president. I also think Trump is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors for conspiring with Michael Cohen to violate campaign-finance laws and that he ought to be impeached, convicted and removed from office. Conservatives should be delighted by the prospect: They would get a more typical Republican, Mike Pence, as president.The big question, of course, is whether pursuing an impeachment strategy is politically wise for House Democrats. Republicans remember that it didn\u2019t exactly serve them well in 1998, when they managed to make themselves look extreme and Bill Clinton appear comparatively sympathetic. What do you think? How should Democrats use a House majority, if they get it?My prediction, for what it\u2019s worth, is that the Democrats will retake control of the House and possibly the Senate in November. That we\u2019ll then manage to stagger through two more years of craziness during which everybody but the Trump kids gradually abandons ship. And I\u2019m not even totally sure about Jared.And then finally in 2020, we elect a new president who is hopefully both a Democrat and kind of boring. What say you?Advertisement"}

Scherr, who runs the firm\u2019s consumer bank, as chief financial officer, according to an internal memo reviewed by The New York Times.Mr. Waldron, 49, will take his new role on Oct. 1, the same day that Mr. Solomon will become chief executive. Mr. Scherr, 54, will take on the finance chief job on Nov. 5, in conjunction with the filing of Goldman\u2019s quarterly results.The promotions of Mr. Waldron and Mr. Scherr solidify the dominance of executives from Goldman\u2019s investment-banking division. Mr. Solomon and Mr. Waldron, friends who both worked at Bear Stearns before they joined Goldman, ran its investment bank together for two years before Mr. Solomon was named the firm\u2019s president. Mr. Scherr was the investment bank\u2019s chief operating officer for six years before being named Goldman\u2019s chief strategy officer and then the head of its consumer bank.Mr. Waldron and Mr. Scherr will help \u201cdevelop and execute our strategy, grow our client franchise, ensure strong risk and capital management and safeguard our unique culture,\u201d said the internal memo from Mr. Solomon and Lloyd C. Blankfein, the bank\u2019s outgoing chief executive.The shift comes as Goldman\u2019s traditionally strong trading business is in decline. R. Martin Chavez, Goldman\u2019s current chief financial officer, will return to the securities division to help run it. He will also become a vice chairman of the firm. He is 54.Goldman has said Mr. Solomon didn\u2019t discourage Mr. Katzman from reporting perceived misconduct but that Mr. Katzman\u2019s concerns were unfounded.Goldman\u2019s board of directors wasn\u2019t fully informed of Mr. Katzman\u2019s grievances at that time, but following the article board members were expected to receive a briefing at Thursday\u2019s meeting, said people familiar with the plans.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Showtime! Staging a House for Sale", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRight at HomeWhen you put your house on the market, it may start to feel less like a place to live and more like a set to be decorated.My dresser would have to go. Leave two dressers in a master bedroom and a potential buyer might suspect the closets are small.That wouldn\u2019t be the only change I\u2019d have to make if I put my house on the market and opened it up to a parade of strangers. My new bedspread, the one I bought after a year of searching for the perfect midcentury look, wouldn\u2019t cut it, either. Instead, my bedroom was apparently begging for a fluffy white duvet with plenty of throw pillows. Throw pillows, you see, are key to selling a house. They should be big, bold and abundant, or so I\u2019ve been told.I\u2019d invited my real estate broker over to help me decide whether I should sell my house and buy a larger one. As she toured my home, telling me what would need to be done to make it more appealing to potential buyers, I began to see that readying a house for sale is not unlike decorating a stage for a play, and perhaps just as hard. Consider these two basic rules of home staging.One: Your house should not appear to be lived in by real people who own stuff.Two: Buyers, who by their very nature apparently lack imagination, are wowed by \u201cgreige,\u201d a color neither gray nor beige, but one where personal flair goes to die. (In other words, paint all your walls a pale shade of greige.)She pointed to a light fixture at the top of the stairs that had been installed by a previous owner and that, I admit, is dated. But who really cares about a small, yet surprisingly effective, fixture at the top of the stairs? Buyers, that\u2019s who.\u201cThey\u2019ll see it out of the corner of their eye, they might not even realize it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019ll think of their grandmother.\u201dAnd if there\u2019s one person you do not want buyers thinking about when they tour your house, it\u2019s grandma. \u201cThey\u2019ll think your house is old,\u201d she explained, and trotted down the stairs.But my house is old, I thought.And so I began to see my house not as the place where I live my life, but as a set to be dressed so someone else could briefly live out a fantasy as they wandered through it.And then maybe pay me a lot of money.Home staging has become big business. What was once an indulgence for the luxury market has trickled down to the middle market, with sellers shelling out huge sums to transform their living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms into (greige) resort-like retreats meant to wow a potential buyer into not noticing that the living room is oddly shaped, with no logical place to put a television, or that the bathroom window looks out on the air shaft from the neighboring apartment building.The trend has been fueled in part by an endless loop of home makeover shows on networks like HGTV, where we watch homeowners burst into tears of joy at the sight of a shag rug and a statement wingback chair. There\u2019s a good chance the furniture will be gone with the production crew, just like the furniture in that house or apartment you buy. But somehow, a well-appointed room convinces us that the perfect home is just one oversized brass mirror away.Mr. Hunter and Mr. Fazio, both of whom worked in finance before they retired, were surprised by the transformation, particularly by how the stager, Studio D, managed to make an oddly shaped foyer look like a useful sitting room with a small sofa and coffee table. They were as dazzled as they hoped some future buyer might be. \u201cWe said: Wow!\u201d Mr. Fazio said. \u201cFor the first time, that space comes alive.\u201dBetween the makeover and the lower price (the apartment was originally listed for $2.45 million), the open houses have been busier, and the listing has gotten more traffic online, Mr. Fazio said. But no one has made an offer yet.Do some house hunting and odds are your broker (the same one who may have insisted you stage your old place) will spend the day reminding you to ignore the flawless bowl of fruit on the kitchen table, and instead look at the countertop beneath it \u2014 the thing you\u2019re actually buying.But who wants to think about boring stuff like boilers and square footage? Instead, staging lets you walk in and \u201cgo on a journey,\u201d as Ms. Saidenberg put it. It is meant to divert your eye from the shortcomings, so you can see the potential, and maybe have a little fun imagining what your life would be like after you dole out a huge sum of money.\u201cWhy are you O.K. with walking out of Anthropologie paying $100 for a T-shirt?\u201d my broker, Leslie Kunkin, a sales associate for West of Hudson Realty Group in Montclair, N.J., asked me soon after she toured my house. \u201cWhen you walk into the store it feels different, and when you get home, you\u2019ve got that nice waxy bag.\u201dBut unlike an Anthropologie T-shirt, you can\u2019t return the house if you later realize that it doesn\u2019t fit.As I considered all I\u2019d have to do to package my house properly, I began to wonder about those other staged houses, the ones I would be looking at if I decided to move. Would I be able to see through the theater and actually know if the house was worth all the effort and money it would take to buy it? Or would I be distracted by the shiny objects and get swept up in the fantasy?So I decided to put the fantasy future on hold for now and continue to make do with my small closets and the two dressers in the master bedroom.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From New York\u2019s Primary Election Results", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo brushed past Cynthia Nixon in Thursday\u2019s Democratic contest. But other challengers benefited from the progressive fervor sweeping national politics.Mr. Cuomo said nothing at all. He didn\u2019t need to. The voters had spoken for him by giving him more than 65 percent of the vote.Here are five takeaways from a race that drew 1.5 million New Yorkers to the polls \u2014 roughly two and a half times the turnout of four years ago:He had the unions. He had the money. He had the television ads and mailers. She had the buzz. She had the celebrity. She had what seemed like grass-roots energy.She got crushed.\u201cHe effectively worked the institutional groups. I would argue his view of the world is fairly outdated,\u201d said Bradley Tusk, who served as campaign manager for former New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. \u201cBut in terms of executing that approach, he\u2019s as good as it gets.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team seemed to be relishing their victory lap over Ms. Nixon, and was disdainful of her social-media-first approach to campaigning.On paper, Ms. Nixon had a unique and potentially potent mix. She was a woman in a year in which female candidates have been popular and successful. As a longtime activist and education advocate, she had heartily embraced ideas like universal health care and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, both catnip for progressives. And as an award-winning actress with an easy manner, Ms. Nixon could be charming in person and fiery and inspiring in her rhetoric, particularly in her denunciations of Mr. Cuomo.Several things may have contributed to Thursday\u2019s outcome: Ms. Nixon had stumbled on a couple of policy questions, and never really seemed to completely warm to public speaking. But in the end it may have been something simpler.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s focus in the race never wavered: He was running against President Trump, not Ms. Nixon. The strategy allowed Mr. Cuomo \u2014 who has spent most of his career ruling and running from the center \u2014 to present himself as a progressive warrior in a way that his record might not always support. For most of his seven-plus years in office, after all, Mr. Cuomo has had a friendly working relationship with Republicans, and has failed to push hard for a number of liberal priorities, such as campaign finance reform. During the early days of the Trump administration, Mr. Cuomo had scrupulously avoided criticizing the president by name, even suggesting there might be a benefit to New York if Mr. Trump helped pay for infrastructure. The remark about America\u2019s lack of greatness earned howls of criticism and predictions of the end of his always-denied presidential ambitions \u2014 as well as some sniping from Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter account \u2014 though it didn\u2019t seem to affect the outcome of the primary race. Whether it comes up in the race against Marcus J. Molinaro, the Republican candidate, remains to be seen. But Albany in 2019 will not be the same as Albany in 2018.That is because six of the eight members of the rogue Independent Democratic Conference were felled on Thursday, including their leader, Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx. The results represented an almost once-in-a-generation upheaval for a capital city where change can cause allergic reactions.Democrats must still pick off at least one Republican seat this fall to seize the State Senate majority. But if they do, the party will be represented by a drastically different cast of characters.\u201cSome of the elements that won\u2019t be around anymore were sources of division,\u201d said Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who feuded with Mr. Klein. \u201cIt should be more unified.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tax Breaks for Luxury Towers Spur Redevelopment, and Backlash", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetTwenty years ago, it was unimaginable that a new residential high-rise would ever adorn the modest skyline of downtown Kansas City, Mo. But in the last three years, two luxury apartment towers have opened, and a third is planned.The buildings are part of a revitalization effort in the city\u2019s core, but some officials are questioning whether tax abatements and other incentives given to the developer, Cordish Companies of Baltimore, are appropriate for residential projects that cater to the affluent.The debate over incentives is not exclusive to Kansas City as new luxury apartment developments are driving urban renewal in other mid-tier markets around the nation. But the concessions given to developers are criticized by community advocates, who say that the sweeteners crimp tax revenue that would otherwise flow to infrastructure, libraries, schools and other needs.Large cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York have long used tax breaks to lure developers, but the trend, and the pushback, is starting to heat up in smaller markets as developers return to downtown areas.\u201cThere\u2019s an ideological problem with granting incentives to luxury apartments,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s going to be luxury housing somewhere, and we want high earners living here paying some taxes rather than in the suburbs paying no taxes.\u201dIn Kansas City, Cordish\u2019s projects, known as One Light and Two Light, are the first high-rise apartments to be built in or near downtown since the 1970s. They also are part of a revitalization effort that has added housing, a new arena, a streetcar system and other amenities to the urban core, and Cordish has played a big role in the renewal as developer of the Power & Light District entertainment quarter.\u201cPeople saw One Light and Two Light lease up and wondered why the city was subsidizing high-end apartments when schools are underfunded and sidewalks are crumbling,\u201d Dr. Ward, the school district representative, said.\u201cIn the long run, we are investors in communities, and it would be shortsighted of us to try to extract a concession we don\u2019t deserve,\u201d Mr. Ungar said. \u201cBut is it better to have a surface parking lot, as there has been for years, or it is better to have a building that eventually is going to pay very significant taxes?\u201dCritics acknowledge that incentives have spurred development that may not have happened otherwise. But as urban cores grow, they argue, cities should taper the programs to realign tax burdens and priorities.Dr. Ward, who wrote a dissertation on the impact of incentives in Missouri, said the Kansas City Public Schools district and area charter schools were missing out on $35 million a year.\u201cNo one is under the illusion that all of those taxes would have been generated or that all of the construction would have occurred without incentives,\u201d Mr. Arkills said. \u201cOn the flip side, no one has been asking how many incentives are actually necessary.\u201dAt Cordish\u2019s Three Light project, for example, Kansas City approved a tax abatement for 25 years, and it committed to fund a $17.5 million garage, in accordance with a longstanding agreement. In return, the developer is paying $16.4 million to the city, the school district and other taxing jurisdictions over the abatement period \u2014 some $5 million more than it is paying as part of the Two Light incentive agreement \u2014 and will take over some of the city\u2019s downtown garage management duties. Cordish also will develop affordable units in an old office building that it plans to convert into apartments.\u201cThere are a lot of people that think it\u2019s time to take the foot off the gas downtown,\u201d Mr. Flisram said. \u201cBut Kansas City still has a long way to go to achieve the density that supports transit, urban retail and major corporations, and there will be pressure to use incentives until we get there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Claire McCaskill Is in a Rugged Political Fight. She\u2019s Survived Them Before.", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTAGEVILLE, Mo. \u2014 Senator Claire McCaskill had rolled through miles of cotton and soybean fields, heading deep into enemy territory \u2014 Missouri\u2019s Bootheel, Trump Country.As her S.U.V. pulled up amid a scrum of pickups, the man Republican Party leaders handpicked to unseat her \u2014 Josh Hawley \u2014 was already inside shaking hands, a Stanford- and Yale-educated constitutional law scholar nevertheless looking very much at home in jeans and cowboy boots.Fully aware that Mr. Hawley, a conservative Republican who serves as Missouri\u2019s attorney general, was the favorite among the gathering of farmers, Ms. McCaskill acknowledged to the crowd, \u201cSometimes this job is all about showing up,\u2019\u2019 even if \u201cnot everybody\u2019s for you.\u201dMs. McCaskill, 65, is playing to tough audiences these days as she faces the political fight of her life. She\u2019s come a long way from the McCaskill & Son feed mill her family once operated in the southern part of the state, moving up the ranks of Democratic politics in Missouri and then to Capitol Hill, where she has served for nearly 12 years. Along the way, she also became wealthy by virtue of her second marriage to a St. Louis developer.Now her opponents are seizing on that wealth, pouring millions of dollars into one of the most hotly contested races of the midterms in an effort to paint Ms. McCaskill as out of touch with Missourians, co-opted by the liberal Democratic establishment and corrupted by the business arrangements of her husband. Everything from her Washington condo to her use of a private plane is under attack.\u201cHe has me shining Chuck Schumer\u2019s shoes and doing Nancy Pelosi\u2019s hair,\u201d said Ms. McCaskill.In a largely rural state that\u2019s trended increasingly red as conservative voters abandoned the Democratic Party \u2014 President Trump won here by 19 points in 2016 \u2014 being labeled \u201cout of touch\u201d is something Ms. McCaskill can ill afford, particularly with a vote looming on whether to confirm Mr. Trump\u2019s conservative Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh.Polls show Ms. McCaskill in a statistical tie with Mr. Hawley in a race Republicans view as one of their best opportunities to pick up a Democratic seat. With Republicans holding a fragile 51-49 lead in the Senate, the outcome in Missouri could prove crucial in determining who controls the chamber.While there is no evidence that Ms. McCaskill had done anything in Washington to advance her husband\u2019s real estate interests, that\u2019s not the implication of the ads, which portray the couple\u2019s actions as an unseemly attempt to profit off a public program.\u201cThey both get rich and you pay for it,\u201d proclaimed an ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\u201cWhat the voters hear, and what they remember, is $131 million,\u201d said Gregg Keller, a Missouri Republican operative who believes Ms. McCaskill needs a major tailwind to win.Attacks on Mr. Shepard have cropped up previously during Ms. McCaskill\u2019s campaigns, but this year they have reached a particularly vicious level.One controversial ad financed by a conservative group called Club for Growth Action Missouri revisited a 1998 police complaint filed against Mr. Shepard by his first wife following a domestic dispute.Ms. McCaskill accuses Mr. Hawley of \u201cpurposely distorting the facts to demonize a good man that I love.\u201d\u201cThe worst is the lies, the factual inaccuracies about my husband\u2019s business and my activity in the Senate,\u201d she said in an interview on her R.V. following a Labor Day picnic in Springfield. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that I\u2019ve done nothing in the Senate to help my husband\u2019s business. That money doesn\u2019t go to him.\u201dAcknowledging that she\u2019s in a tough election fight, Ms. McCaskill said: \u201dI\u2019m in a hard state. I worry about all of it. I worry about everything because everything has to go well in a race like this.\u201dIn a tweet last week, she called the campaign a \u201cpressure cooker,\u201d and included a photo of a low-calorie salad.\u201cAnd yes I eat too much under pressure (in case you haven\u2019t noticed I\u2019m overweight), so tonight when I got home I whipped up a healthy noodle salad,\u201d the tweet said.Ms. McCaskill nevertheless says she senses an emotional energy in the electorate.She\u2019s loath to call it a blue wave, but this year reminds her of 2006, she says, when Democrats took control of both the Senate and House. Volunteers are up \u2014 many of them women who show up at rallies wearing #TeamClaire stickers. Small individual contributions are up. Crowds are bigger.\u201cPeople are tired of cussing the TV and want to do something,\u201d Ms. McCaskill said.In past elections, she has been able to pick off rural and Republican votes with her image as a common-sense Missourian, tough on law and order as a county prosecutor and tough on public expenditures as state auditor. She has frequently invoked the populist Missourian Harry S. Truman and emphasized her moderate voting record and her small-town Missouri roots, endearing herself to Missourians with brash talk, sometimes off message \u2014 once telling Tim Russert that she didn\u2019t want her daughters around Bill Clinton.Many Missourians saw that as a breath of fresh air, but her opponents say that this side of Ms. McCaskill has been supplanted by someone who toes the party line.\u201cWe\u2019re a long ways away from saying she wouldn\u2019t leave her daughters alone with Bill Clinton,\u2019\u2019 said Jeff Roe, a Republican political strategist who advises the Club for Growth. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of Claire ago. Her curb appeal for Republicans has been squashed.\u201dMs. McCaskill has survived tough fights before.Six years ago, she was labeled the Senate\u2019s most endangered incumbent. But that was before her opponent, Todd Akin, the former congressman, suggested that women rarely get pregnant from a \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d His campaign imploded and Ms. McCaskill won easily.There\u2019s no indication she will get such a gift from Mr. Hawley, but Democratic operatives, citing her long record in the state, even wonder if negative advertising can work against Ms. McCaskill.\u201cAlmost everything the Republicans are running right now is negative, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s moving any independent voters,\u201d said Abe Rakov, the campaign manager in 2016 for the Democratic Senate nominee Jason Kander. \u201cMissourians know Claire, so it\u2019s going to be hard to convince them of something that isn\u2019t true.\u201dAt a barbecue restaurant in Sikeston, Ms. McCaskill stopped to talk with Richard Toon, a retired low-voltage contractor who recently moved back to his home state from Georgia. Mr. Toon described himself as \u201cpro-life, pro-gun and pro-Trump\u201d but said he is keeping an open mind. \u201cShe used to be state auditor and she takes care of money very well,\u201d he said.On campaign stops, Ms. McCaskill focuses mainly on consumer and pocketbook issues. Among the farmers, it was Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war \u2014 which Mr. Hawley supports \u2014 and its effect on agriculture prices.At the same time, Mr. Hawley recently said he supports coverage for pre-existing conditions, a concern for many voters and one that Ms. McCaskill can relate to \u2014 she was treated for breast cancer in 2016. Even in this stance, however, Ms. McCaskill found a target to exploit; turning the tables on Mr. Hawley, she portrayed him as a Beltway operative.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, he\u2019ll fit right in in Washington because that\u2019s called the Potomac Two-Step,\u201d she told the crowd, to laughter and applause.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Britain, Even Children Are Feeling the Effects of Austerity", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBritain\u2019s Big SqueezeMORECAMBE, England \u2014 It was half past eight, and the school day was just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run elementary school in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the head teacher, pointed to a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast \u2014 his first meal of the day.Teachers, she said, had sometimes found him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. \u201cHe\u2019d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.\u201dSome students trickled through without stopping; they had already eaten. But a few dozen headed straight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Ms. Collingwood reckoned.During Ms. Collingwood\u2019s 13 years as head teacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there were always a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors\u2019 offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.Over all, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than $40 billion in benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.\u201cIt\u2019s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we\u2019re in a child poverty crisis,\u201d said Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. \u201cAnd it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.\u201dThe new system is \u201cinfinitely better than what it replaced,\u201d said Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. \u201cThe process of stepping into work is easier.\u201d\u201cWe tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the U.K.,\u201d Ms. Garnham said. \u201cThe government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there\u2019s hardly any left. That\u2019s a problem of the past.\u201dJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a 6-year-old son, was in financial meltdown. His rent had fallen into arrears, and he could no longer pay the family\u2019s utility bills. Then he began to dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He stopped socializing and sometimes skipped meals to ensure that his son ate three times a day. But he could no longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.\u201cHe basically can\u2019t go to any of his mates\u2019 parties or houses,\u201d Mr. McCullough said. \u201cI literally can\u2019t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.\u201dWhat had thrown his affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, Mr. McCullough received around $900 every month to supplement the roughly $650 a month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.What really hurt Mr. McCullough was how that loss was compounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment, a dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In Mr. McCullough\u2019s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.\u201cIf this is going to be a regular occurrence,\u201d Mr. McCullough asked, \u201cwhere is the incentive to work?\u201dMr. Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledged problems with the way the system has been put in effect: He even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional $5 billion from the welfare budget. \u201cI thought that was too much,\u201d Mr. Duncan Smith said.But \u201cthe system itself is the right system,\u201d he added. \u201cThough a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they\u2019re better off.\u201dOn a recent afternoon, as his phone buzzed with debt notices from the local water board, Mr. McCullough\u2019s eyes welled up as he described how he struggled to provide his son with some of the basic things in life \u2014 like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.Mr. McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and said he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party\u2019s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.\u201cUntil you walk a mile in someone\u2019s shoes, you can\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. McCullough said. \u201cUntil you\u2019ve seen how it works, you don\u2019t understand.\u201dIn Morecambe, the area\u2019s Conservative lawmaker, David Morris, said in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blamed \u201cleft-wing political activists\u201d for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused Ms. Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.At the Morecambe Bay Food Bank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-8 from 656 in 2013-4. At the local branch of Citizens Advice, a national charity that offers legal and administrative support to Britons in hardship, the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children\u2019s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children\u2019s center, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.\u201cThe caseload is growing, and the systems by which we would have supported them is diminishing,\u201d Ms. Collingwood said. \u201cWe feel much more like an island.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Howell of the Federal District Court in Washington, required many nonprofit groups that placed advertisements supporting or opposing political candidates to disclose the identities of donors who had contributed more than $200. Before the ruling, such groups could generally shield their donors from public scrutiny.The case was brought by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, a watchdog group. It sued the Federal Election Commission and Crossroads GPS, a conservative group. Judge Howell struck down a federal regulation that had effectively allowed secret contributions, saying it conflicted with a federal statute.A federal appeals court will hear an appeal of Judge Howell\u2019s ruling, but no decision is expected until after the elections in November.

{"Headline": "Millions of Carolina Homes Are at Risk of Flooding. Only 335,000 Have Flood Insurance. ", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s why the federal flood insurance program won\u2019t pick up the slack.If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because the same thing happened last year after Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston and, to a lesser extent, after Hurricanes Irma in Florida and Maria in Puerto Rico.Here\u2019s why.Congress established the program in 1968, hoping to lure insurance companies back into a market they abandoned after the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. That year, multiple levees failed, leaving thousands of people homeless. Insurers saw that paying flood claims on that scale could wipe them out.Congress eventually decided it would be better to identify flood-prone homeowners, require them to buy insurance every year, let a pool of reserves build up and pay flood claims out of it to keep the taxpayers off the hook.The program started out as a partnership between the government and about 130 insurers. But there were policy clashes, and by 1983 the companies were gone and the government was running the program alone. Today the National Flood Insurance Program is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\u201cThe problem is that the mandate is not enforced,\u201d said Howard Mills, a former New York State insurance superintendent who now works at the consulting firm Deloitte.The enforcement mechanism \u2014 requiring people in flood zones to buy insurance \u2014 is supposed to be the mortgage industry. Any time a house on a federally designated flood plain changes hands, the lender is supposed to make the buyer purchase a flood-insurance policy.Although those metrics are more precise, it\u2019s unlikely the government will take advantage of them.Congress has repeatedly cut federal funding for flood mapping in recent years, so the government probably won\u2019t embrace a change that would significantly increase the flood insurance program\u2019s costs.The research report, published by Environmental Research Letters, found that existing flood maps accurately measured the risks along the coasts, but didn't capture nearly all the risk in inland areas.And it\u2019s many of the people affected by those hazards who don\u2019t have flood insurance. In the Carolinas, a quarter to half of the households near the coast are insured, said Ray Lehmann, a member of SmarterSafer, a coalition of taxpayer groups, environmental organizations, insurers and others that has pushed for flood-insurance reform.Further inland, it\u2019s another story.\u201cWe\u2019re talking about places in North Carolina where the coverage is less than 1 percent,\u201d said Mr. Lehmann, also the director of finance, insurance and trade policy at the R Street Institute, a think tank that promotes free-market policies.Uninsured homeowners can still get loans from the federal government to pay for repairs to their flood-damaged homes, but the loans have to be repaid. And finding a suitable loan program, filing the paperwork and waiting for the money takes longer than filing an insurance claim would have.Not well. It needs more premium-paying policyholders, said Mr. Lehmann. That would spread the risks over a bigger group. As of now, the program does not bring in enough revenue to cover the cost of payouts to homeowners. On average, it has run a $1.4 billion annual deficit since Hurricane Katrina.The program currently owes the Treasury more than $20 billion, but that\u2019s only because Congress forgave $16 billion of debt last fall.That debt forgiveness was essentially a taxpayer bailout. In other words, federal taxpayers are still paying to repair flood-damaged houses today, much as they did before the flood-insurance program was established.\u201cBut there are more storms on the way,\u201d he said.Lawmakers have been working on wide-ranging reform proposals, but those have been lingering for more than a year. And with the midterm elections approaching on Nov. 6, an agreement on a long-term solution will be elusive.Advertisement"}

The Trump administration has blocked the reappointment of judges to the W.T.O.\u2019s dispute resolution panel, threatening to cripple it.\u201cThe E.U., along with many partners, wishes to see political support from the G20 to strengthen the W.T.O.\u2019s negotiating, monitoring and dispute settlement functions,\u201d the European Commission said in a statement Friday.The Trump administration broke with the longstanding international consensus on free trade soon after Mr. Trump took office, when G20 finance ministers and central bankers met in Germany.At the insistence of Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, the communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of that meeting in March 2017 did not include the usually commonplace commitment to open trade. The statement also omitted boilerplate language condemning protectionism that was used in the past.That was the beginning of a steady deterioration in the tone of summit meetings that culminated in June when Mr. Trump refused to sign a joint statement with American allies after a meeting of the more exclusive Group of 7 in Canada. As he flew away from the meeting, Mr. Trump tweeted that Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, was \u201cvery dishonest and weak.\u201dMost countries sent cabinet-level officials this week to Mar del Plata, but the United States was represented by Dennis Shea, the deputy United States trade representative.The event in Mar del Plata was one of several issue-specific meetings taking place in Argentina ahead of a November summit meeting of G20 leaders in Buenos Aires.Daniel Politi reported from Buenos Aires and Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt.Advertisement"}

There are quotes about truth and justice from George Orwell, Reinhold Niebuhr and Mark Twain. But the kicker is a line from Ramsay Bolton, a character from \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d: \u201cIf you think this has a happy ending, you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\u201d It\u2019s not because people aren\u2019t interested in what he has to say.\u201cI\u2019m kind of a loner,\u201d Mr. Klarman said last week in his 17th-floor office close to the Boston Common. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m willing to come out of my shell and talk to you is because I think democracy is at stake.

I have no way of knowing how much more he\u2019ll contribute this cycle, but it\u2019s entirely possible that Klarman could end up giving more than him.\u201dThere are many people who are similarly situated to Seth Klarman \u2014 wealthy, hawkish, socially liberal, fiscally conservative types who felt politically homeless long before Mr. Trump came onto the scene. Many of them, like Mr. Klarman, were alarmed by Mr. Trump\u2019s rise. Many of them, like Mr. Klarman, spoke out forcefully during the campaign.But these days, thanks to Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, his Supreme Court picks and the roaring economy, they are far more inclined to dump on the president over crudo with their friends than to say anything publicly, let alone change their giving. After all, is life not better for them under this president?Mr. Klarman is mystified by this behavior.\u201cPeople should be asking themselves: Why are we writing checks to these same people who are cowards?\u201d His message to such people: \u201cPlease join me.\u201d Is Mr. Klarman concerned that he\u2019s helping the Democratic Party even as it moves well to the left of his political comfort zone? \u201cIn a lot of ways I\u2019m actually excited about somebody like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez coming along because it\u2019s a way of younger people and people of color and people who are different finding their voice and being part of the process,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "How Brett Kavanaugh Would Transform the Supreme Court", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Most Supreme Court appointments are in a way inconsequential. A conservative replaces a conservative, a liberal replaces a liberal, and the court\u2019s basic direction is unchanged.That is not the case with the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, whose Senate confirmation hearings will begin on Tuesday. Judge Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative than the justice he would replace, Anthony M. Kennedy.But there is a more subtle, and important, reason that President Trump\u2019s pick of Judge Kavanaugh could remake the court. His confirmation would result in a rare replacement of the court\u2019s swing justice, moving Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u2014 a much more reliably conservative vote than Justice Kennedy \u2014 to the court\u2019s ideological center.It has been more than 80 years since a chief justice was the swing vote. If Chief Justice Roberts assumes that position, legal scholars said, he will lead a solid five-member conservative majority that would most likely restrict access to abortion, limit the use of race-conscious decisions in areas like college admissions, uphold voting restrictions, expand gun rights, strike down campaign finance regulations and give religion a greater role in public life.\u201cJohn Roberts would be the least swinging swing justice in the post-World War II era,\u201d said Justin Driver, a law professor at the University of Chicago.That would be a major break from the role that Justice Kennedy, a moderate conservative who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, played for years on the court. Justice Kennedy at times voted with the court\u2019s four-member liberal wing on issues like abortion, affirmative action, gay rights and the death penalty.In that change on the court, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. replaced the more moderate Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. That made Justice Kennedy the sole justice at the court\u2019s ideological center.\u201cJustice Kennedy\u2019s departure is likely to lead to far more dramatic change in the court than the departure of Justice O\u2019Connor did,\u201d said Irv Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University.Political science data on the justices\u2019 voting patterns confirm that analysis. \u201cThe shift in the court\u2019s center from Kennedy to Roberts is likely to be far more important than the 2006 shift from O\u2019Connor to Kennedy,\u201d Professor Epstein said. \u201cO\u2019Connor and Kennedy were much closer, ideologically speaking, than Roberts and Kennedy.\u201dBy contrast, the other appointments since 2005 did not alter the court\u2019s basic direction. Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s replacement of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Neil M. Gorsuch\u2019s replacement of Justice Antonin Scalia substituted conservatives for conservatives. Justice Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s replacement of Justice David H. Souter and Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s replacement of Justice John Paul Stevens substituted liberals for liberals.While Chief Justice Roberts, 63, would represent a sharp change as the swing justice, that does not mean that the court will make a sudden leap to the right. Chief Justice Roberts is generally inclined to move in incremental steps, and he cares about the Supreme Court\u2019s legitimacy and prestige. \u201cIt is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent,\u201d he said at his confirmation hearings in 2005.\u201cI would be somewhat surprised if any of the cases relating to affirmative action, abortion, same-sex marriage or the death penalty are flat out overruled,\u201d Professor Gornstein said. \u201cBut it would not surprise me in the slightest if the court never upholds another affirmative action plan, never finds another restriction on abortion to impose an undue burden, never extends the rights of gays and lesbians beyond where they are now, and never again expands the category of persons who may not receive the death penalty.\u201dRepublicans are confident that they can quickly confirm Judge Kavanaugh. Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, said there was a good way to determine where the Supreme Court would head if that happens.\u201cThe key is,\u201d he said, \u201cthe many areas where Kennedy was with the liberals in 5-4 decisions: abortion, affirmative action, gay and lesbian rights, criminal punishments and allowing proof of discrimination based on disparate impact. In all of these areas of law, Kavanaugh replacing Kennedy likely will mean a significant change.\u201dBoth decisions would almost certainly have come out differently had Justice Gorsuch, Mr. Trump\u2019s first appointee, and Judge Kavanaugh been on the court.\u201cThe court\u2019s jurisprudence on affirmative action and abortion have been administered last rites many times,\u201d Professor Driver said. \u201cBut if Kavanaugh is confirmed, it is virtually assured that they will be extinguished sooner rather than later.\u201dBut recent appointees have almost never disappointed their supporters, and Judge Kavanaugh is not likely to be an exception.\u201cA dominant narrative of the Supreme Court during the last five decades has been the apostasy of Republican-appointed justices,\u201d Professor Driver said. \u201cKavanaugh\u2019s confirmation would almost certainly spell the end of that story line, and cement a generation of G.O.P. constitutional orthodoxy.\u201dThirteen years ago, Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s performance at his confirmation hearings was so smooth and winning that Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said he had \u201cretired the trophy\u201d for an outstanding performance by a judicial nominee.Chief Justice Roberts has since joked about the \u201codd historical quirk\u201d that gives chief justices only one vote. If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed, Chief Justice Roberts will still have just one vote. But it will be the crucial one.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rwanda Eyes Biogas to Help Curb Deforestation", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 The kitchen of Ecole Secondaire Kanombe Efotec, a boarding school here, is busy from dawn to dusk while the staff cooks meals for more than 1,000 hungry teenagers.At onetime, the school went through about 330 pounds of firewood a day for the porridge and rice that boil in industrial-size vats. But since 2014, the kitchen is using one-third less wood, and spending less on fuel, after it started using biogas derived from a renewable energy source: methane from the school\u2019s latrines.Anaclet Karamuka, director of study, pointed out the school\u2019s row of tiled latrines. Gigantic concrete receptacles buried beneath a grassy clearing collect human waste along with the methane it creates. The school\u2019s 20 dairy cows also contribute their share of methane. Narrow pipes carry the odorless methane to the kitchen. In the airless underground \u201cbiogas digester\u201d bacteria eventually convert the solid waste into fertilizer.The biogas system was provided and built by Rwanda\u2019s government; the school pays for minor maintenance. It is part of the country\u2019s larger initiative to curb an urgent environmental problem: deforestation that results from felling trees to make charcoal and firewood for cooking. Biogas and liquefied petroleum gas are two promising alternatives.In Rwanda, a small nation of about 12 million people, 82 percent of the population relies on charcoal or wood for cooking.Much of sub-Saharan Africa relies on wood and charcoal, which is made by slow-burning trees in dirt-covered pits. The process has led to severe deforestation as growing populations boost the demand for cooking fuel.Removing trees leads to soil erosion, a dangerous phenomena in countries where the majority of people eke out a living from farming, and contributes to landslides across the nation\u2019s mountainous terrain.Rwanda launched its national biogas program in 2009 following an initial pilot program supported by aid from GIZ, formerly the German Technical Cooperation Agency, and the Dutch nonprofit SNV. The Rwandan government eventually took over the biogas program and helped establish more than 50 private companies to support projects at homes and schools.Today there are biogas systems at more than 80 Rwandan boarding schools, and all of the nation\u2019s prisons use biogas from latrines for cooking. Rural homes also rely on more than 11,000 biogas systems to create methane from cow dung and other types of animal waste.Cost, however, is a significant barrier, especially for poor families in Rwanda, where the average monthly income is $70. Until 2016, there were subsidies of about 300,000 francs (about $350) for biogas systems, according to Mr. Niyonsaba of the Energy Development Corporation, and financing plans were set up through the country\u2019s bank cooperatives. Biogas systems cost between 400,000 and 800,000 francs, depending on size, he added.Some biogas projects have not worked as smoothly as the one at Ecole Secondaire Kanombe or have outright failed. The systems face a number of challenges, including having enough waste to produce methane, as well as access to water to push the waste into the digester. Mr. Niyonsaba estimated that a boarding school would need at least 400 students for a biogas digester to work. Training and education are also essential.More than 400 masons, supervisors and appliance manufacturers were also trained by SNV in Rwanda to support the biogas project, helping to create valuable jobs in rural areas.The other promising alternative cooking fuel in Rwanda is liquefied petroleum gas. Although the gas is derived from fossil fuel, it is less destructive for the country than chopping down precious forests. It is normally an expensive imported fuel, but the government has made it exempt from import taxes.Charcoal can cost about 36,000 francs a month for a family, but because people can buy small amounts of charcoal for a modest sum each time, they often don\u2019t realize it is more expensive than gas in the long run.In addition, cooking with charcoal retains a cultural hold on people, even the urban elite.Because equipment and cooktops are expensive, many people need financing programs. Loans can be acquired through Rwanda\u2019s cooperative banks.Hotels and restaurants in Rwanda will soon be required to switch to liquefied petroleum gas for cooking, though grilled meat, which is beloved in Africa, will be exempt. Many businesses have not yet made the change, and it is unclear how the rule will be enforced.Mr. Karamuka of Ecole Secondaire Kanombe has switched to the fuel at home. He used to think the gas was for \u201cmzungus,\u201d a Swahili term for foreigners, he said, adding that it was also too expensive. Now, he said, \u201cthe government is making it as cheap as possible.\u201dHe recalled that his family paid about 32,000 francs for four sacks of charcoal each month. Now, he estimated that they spend 28,000 francs a month for liquefied petroleum.\u201cWe can use gas in a few minutes. It\u2019s a big difference,\u201d he said enthusiastically. \u201cI am regretting that I didn\u2019t use it before.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She appeared in Cannes in May to promote a coming spy blockbuster with Jessica Chastain, Marion Cotillard, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Lupita Nyong\u2019o.She has more than 62 million followers on China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter, Weibo, and appears in ads for products around the world \u2014 from vitamins in Australia to lipstick by Guerlain, the watches of Montblanc and the diamonds of De Beers.Now she is missing.Ms. Fan, who turns 37 on Sunday, has dropped out of public view for more than three months \u2014 the victim of a sudden and precipitous fall from grace.Her disappearance has been greeted with concern among fans and fear among her counterparts in the industry. It has fueled a flurry of rumors of personal rivalries and political intrigue, even at the pinnacles of power in Beijing, though few concrete facts.That so little is known about someone so famous in China \u2014 even whether she is in detention, or in hiding \u2014 says much about the murky intersection of politics and business, entertainment and celebrity.\u201cShe\u2019s like collateral damage,\u201d Hung Huang, a critic and publisher, said.Ms. Fan\u2019s disappearance appears to be related to a government investigation into tax evasion in the film business, but she has not been charged with any crime, and no officials have confirmed that she is even under investigation. Few who know her, or the industry, believe it is simply a matter of paying taxes, though. And the damage to her reputation \u2014 and perhaps her livelihood \u2014 has already been done.The film\u2019s release, originally scheduled for August, has also been delayed until October, though whether that is linked to her situation remains unclear. (The name in Chinese is \u201cDa Hong Zha,\u201d which, inauspiciously for any movie, can mean \u201cThe Big Bomb.\u201d)Another film in which she had a role, a sequel of an animated motion-capture film, also was delayed in June and has not yet been rescheduled. Raymond Zhou, an independent film critic, claimed in an interview that Ms. Fan\u2019s role had been edited out.A promotional video Ms. Fan recorded for De Beers, posted on YouTube on May 24, amounts to one of her last public appearances.In it, Ms. Fan describes how her parents sent her to music school as a child and wanted her to be a teacher, though she decided as a teenager to pursue an acting career. (She compares cutting a diamond for jewelry to the process of making a film.)\u201cWomen today are very powerful,\u201d she says, \u201cthey take control of their work and career, and in the meantime take care of their families.\u201dThe practice of having dual contracts \u2014 known as \u201cyin and yang\u201d contracts \u2014 is widespread in many industries in China as a way to avoid taxes, but Mr. Cui\u2019s accusation prompted the State Administration of Taxation to announce a broad inquiry into the entertainment industry.Its announcement did not mention Ms. Fan, but included this warning: \u201cIf violations of tax laws and regulations are found, they will be handled in strict accordance with the law.\u201dMr. Cui later retreated from his initial accusations, saying he did not mean to target Ms. Fan. His ire appeared to be directed as much toward the director of \u201cCell Phone,\u201d Feng Xiaogang. Mr. Cui previously had accused him of slander because the plot \u2014 in which a prominent television anchor has an affair with an assistant, played by Ms. Fan \u2014 bore striking, though he said inaccurate, parallels to Mr. Cui\u2019s own career. A person at Mr. Cui\u2019s office said he was no longer making any statements on the matter.Efforts to reach Ms. Fan or a spokesman in recent weeks proved unsuccessful.Officials declined to comment on the status of the investigation, or whether Ms. Fan has since become a focus of it. An official with the Public Security Bureau in Wuxi, the city near Shanghai where her studio is based, refused to comment on whether the bureau had, as rumored, taken over the case.\u201cThe situation is that we all speak with one voice from top to bottom: that is that we don\u2019t accept interviews and we have no comment,\u201d the official said.Until now, at least, a partnership with Ms. Fan has been a prize for international luxury companies. She is a regular sight at red carpets and fashion shows around the world, and has a well-documented love of Louis Vuitton, Valentino and Chopard.Luxury brands, though, tend to be careful with China, because their biggest growth is in Asian markets.Montblanc, a German accessories brand that has worked with Ms. Fan since April, confirmed that it had terminated her contract. The company praised Ms. Fan as \u201cthe quintessential modern woman\u201d when it brought her on in the spring.De Beers, the diamond company, has had a long relationship with Ms. Fan, who wore De Beers jewelry at the Cannes Film Festival this year. On Wednesday, she was missing from company web pages. After inquiries about the removal, she reappeared.Jeff Trexler, associate director of the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham University, said displays of conspicuous wealth are seen as an affront to the message being promoted by the Chinese government: that everyone in the country is rising upward on an economic wave.\u201cThe more wealthy your spokespeople are, the greater the risk is,\u201d he said.Companies also worry that if they upset the Chinese government by continuing to promote someone who has fallen from favor, as Ms. Fan appears to have, they might suffer in a variety of ways, from taxes audits to obstacles opening new stores.When it comes to the entertainment industry, which is heavily censored in China, the authorities appear to be particularly sensitive to the influence stars can have \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 on public opinion.Ms. Hung, the critic, said the investigation clearly had been intended to send a message about celebrity excess \u2014 and perhaps even about tax evasion. She noted the often-cited idiom \u201cto kill a chicken to scare the monkey,\u201d and said even the uncertainty around Ms. Fan\u2019s case would have a chilling effect.\u201cIt makes people more nervous,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen it is unclear what is going on.\u201dJonathan Ansfield, Claire Fu, Olivia Mitchell Ryan, Iris Zhao and Zo\u00e9 Mou contributed research.

It\u2019s by Stephanie Clifford, better known as Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film star and unlikely feminist resistance hero, who has waged a legal battle over a nondisclosure agreement designed to prevent her from talking about a sexual relationship she claims she had with Donald Trump.On Wednesday, St. Martin\u2019s Press announced that it will publish Ms. Clifford\u2019s memoir, \u201cFull Disclosure,\u201d (pun likely intended) this October, just before the midterm elections.In a news release, the publisher said Ms. Clifford will tell \u201cher whole story for the \ufb01rst time,\u201d including how she came to be a successful actress and director in the adult film business, her alleged affair with Mr. Trump and \u201cthe events that led to the nondisclosure agreement and the behind-the-scenes attempts to intimidate her.\u201d\u201cI own my story and the choices I made,\u201d Ms. Clifford writes. \u201cThey may not be the ones you would have made, but I stand by them.\u201d\u201cFull Disclosure\u201d could inflict further damage, and is likely to put the White House on edge. The publication will bring Ms. Clifford\u2019s story back into the headlines, just weeks before the contentious midterm elections, and could draw new public scrutiny to her allegations about the affair and efforts by Mr. Trump and his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to cover it up.The scandal may pose one of the most serious legal threats to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Last month, Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws by making the payment to Ms. Clifford, and said that he did so at the direction of Mr. Trump.Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump recently indicated that they are willing to tear up the nondisclosure agreement, but Ms. Clifford and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, have not accepted the offer.In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Avenatti said the book has been in the works for some time, and called it an \u201cextraordinarily detailed\u201d account that will bring to light new information about Ms. Clifford\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump and \u201cits aftermath.\u201d (Ms. Clifford is not currently giving interviews, Mr. Avenatti said.)\u201cWhen people read this book, they are going to have newfound respect for the human being and the woman who is known as Stormy Daniels,\u201d Mr. Avenatti said. \u201cI think they will be very moved by her story.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "At Typhoon\u2019s Eye in Philippines, Whipping Debris and Fervent Prayers", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBy late Monday, the unofficial count from the Philippine police was 66 dead nationwide, but that number was almost certain to rise.In Benguet Province in the northern Philippines, a landslide crushed a church and a bunkhouse for miners. By Monday evening, more than 40 bodies had been recovered from the site and searchers had compiled a list of 61 people still missing but presumed dead.Elsewhere in mountainous parts of the island, landslides buried homes, killing inhabitants who had chosen not to take shelter in one of the many evacuation centers opened for the storm.Still, the toll was brutal.Four members of the Allaga family were buried alive when their mountain home was deluged by a landslide in Nueva Vizcaya. The family had sent three of their children to an evacuation center, but the father, Gilbert Allaga, stayed behind with the youngest siblings to care for their livestock, said Francis Tolentino, who is leading the government relief operation.\u201cIf you have to choose between your life or your animals, you should choose your life,\u201d Mr. Tolentino said.In the Centro 2 neighborhood of Aparri, a fishing town on the north coast of Luzon, 40 of the 108 houses were damaged by the storm.An additional eight homes were beyond repair, said Jefferson Labbao, the community leader. With unemployment pushing 30 percent and 80 percent of residents considered indigent, it was unclear how repairs would be financed.On Sunday afternoon, the first time the skies cleared since the storm swept past Aparri, Gloria Panlasigui surveyed the wreck of the residential compound where she had lived for more than six decades.Earlier that day, neighbors had helped right her home, pushing its lopsided frame straight again. But the roof was gone, as were most of the walls. The door was jammed into place, its hand-painted message still clear: \u201cGod bless us.\u201dMs. Panlasigui, 71, said Typhoon Mangkhut, known in the Philippines as Ompong, was the worst storm she had ever experienced. \u201cI just prayed that I would see my children again,\u201d she said, mimicking the furious hum of the wind \u2014 hoot, hooot, hoooooot.As I was crossing north Luzon, the eye of Typhoon Mangkhut was maybe 12 miles away. We had driven past downed electricity poles, uprooted trees and coconuts that fell from the sky with alarming constancy. A branch hit the window with the crack of a bullet.We knew we had to take shelter. \u201cTime to get inside a decent structure/basement to ride out the worst of it,\u201d wrote Tug Wilson, The Times\u2019s security specialist, in a WhatsApp message.But there was no decent structure or basement on this stretch of the northwest coast of Luzon in the Philippines. The nearest solid building, a Seventh Day Adventist church, was padlocked shut.Gen Paz was driving. He parked the car perpendicular to the wind to lessen the chance that the gusts would flip the vehicle. The wind vibrated in a low, haunting whistle that made me realize, for the first time, what a whistling wind really sounded like.During a brief respite in the storm, Mr. Paz inched the car forward and parked next to a gas station, hoping the bulk of the building would shield us. Then we heard the tin roof of the building across the street rattling an increasingly rapid syncopation.We could not go south, away from the storm, because a recently felled tree blocked our path. So Mr. Paz edged the car toward the storm. As we drove away, the tin roof unmoored itself, flying into the air like a prop for \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201dIn the days before Mangkhut made landfall in the Philippines, local authorities swung into action, going door to door in vulnerable neighborhoods to encourage residents to evacuate. At least 105,000 people had sought temporary shelter, officials said. In other neighborhoods, volunteers pre-emptively sawed branches off trees that looked likely to snap during the typhoon.A NASA satellite captured the intense rainfall of 2018\u2019s strongest storm so far.Even if Mangkhut didn\u2019t kill thousands like Haiyan did, the storm still punished north Luzon. This fertile farmland is a favored path of typhoons, which gather strength over the western Pacific and pummel their way across the Philippines toward China.Five percent of local budgets are dedicated to calamity funds \u2014 and they rarely go unused. \u201cThere are a lot of calamities here,\u201d said Rewin Valenzuela, the leader of the Bangan community in Sanchez-Mira. \u201cIt\u2019s the Philippines.\u201dOff the coast, the sea was stained the color of milky coffee at least half a mile out, rather than tropical turquoise. Paddy fields were inundated, the rice bowl of the country transformed into a vast lake. Only the green roof of the Calog Sur elementary school protruded from the floodwaters, along with the top of a basketball hoop.On mountain roads, neighborhood work crews \u2014 an escape valve for chronic underemployment in the Philippines \u2014 used chain saws to chop up trees that landslides had thrust on the road. For an hour and a half, our vehicle was the only one negotiating one mountain pass, where the road was so thickly carpeted by palm fronds and other foliage that the road surface was barely visible.On Sunday, in the community of Pacupac, on the north coast of Luzon, pigs marooned on a hillock snuffled for food. Buffalo waded through the muck. Children splashed because splashing is fun, even if it\u2019s muddy floodwater.Villagers spread sodden rice on the road to try to save their crop. Men beat sheets of tin into new roofs. The storm had passed, until the next one.Reporting was contributed by Kimberly dela Cruz and Gen Paz from Aparri, and Richard C.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s \u2018One Tough Year\u2019 After Hurricanes Tore Through British Virgin Islands", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORTOLA, British Virgin Islands \u2014 Every morning, Helen Penn wakes up to the clamor of power drills and hammers.From her hillside home, she sees construction trucks clogging the streets below and tourists spilling out of cruise ships that have slowly begun to dock again on Tortola, the largest of the British Virgin Islands.A white roof tarp still covers a section of the bright yellow house where Ms. Penn, 74, lives with her two children. The interior walls of the house are still gone. Without electricity, the family relies on small solar-powered lamps at night.\u201cI try my best to not get stressed about it,\u201d Ms. Penn said. \u201cI need to keep strong for my children.\u201dMany here also see Irma and Maria as signs of what\u2019s to come, and the rebuilding effort as an existential race against the clock \u2014 they know these vulnerable and isolated islands are at the forefront of climate change.\u201cWe\u2019re going to see more and more of these weather pattern events, whether they\u2019re hurricanes or cyclones,\u201d said Paul Bayly, the chief executive of the Recovery and Development Agency, which was created to oversee the territory\u2019s long-term reconstruction.The hurricanes severely damaged all major marinas and hotels of the British Virgin Islands, a vacation getaway 60 miles east of Puerto Rico known as a playground for the wealthy and the sailing capital of the world. The storms also destroyed 70 percent of homes on the islands, which have a population of about 30,000.\u201cIt absolutely breaks my heart that there are still people living in houses that are very destroyed,\u201d said Gov. Augustus Jaspert.\u201cMs. Irma decided to take them, so she did,\u201d Ms. Nibbs, 60, said.\u201cTerrible, terrible, terrible,\u201d said Mr. Nibbs, 73, who worked all his life for the famed Peter Island Resort, which hasn\u2019t opened since the hurricanes. \u201cOne tough year.\u201dMr. Nibbs said the local government planned to rebuild his home as part of a $15 million loan and grant program aimed at helping vulnerable families. But he is unsure when that would be or how he would afford the repairs. Mr. Nibbs is paying off an old loan; Ms. Nibbs uses most of her Social Security payments to buy medicine.Still, the British Virgin Islands are expected to borrow heavily to finance the long-term recovery, which officials say will include greener, more resilient infrastructure.Britain has committed to provide $13 million in grants and guarantee close to $400 million in loans to allow the local government to borrow at cheaper rates. Early estimates show the territory could need up to $700 million in loans, said Orlando Smith, the premier and top locally elected official.\u201cI\u2019m feeling very optimistic,\u201d said Mr. Smith. \u201cThe rebuild is in full force. We are ready to receive visitors.\u201dConstruction was initially delayed by the difficulty of importing supplies like lumber and roofing from Florida and Puerto Rico, which were also rebuilding. Many residents waited months for new doors and windows. Others gave up altogether.But construction has picked up and wooden scaffolds have begun to cover the facades of government buildings, businesses and hotels across the island.The efforts are bearing fruit: Electricity was largely restored within six months. Roads are clear of debris. Coastlines are clean and iconic beach bars, like Foxy\u2019s and the Soggy Dollar on Jost Van Dyke, the smallest of the four islands, have roared back to life.Disney Cruise Line returned earlier this month and Norwegian Cruise Line is expected to follow later this year. The charter and sailing industry rebounded quickly after the storms, and close to 3,000 berths are available throughout the territory for motorized boats and sailboats, according to tourism officials.The government expects about a half-million cruise passengers to visit this winter, around 30 percent fewer than usual. And more than 1,000 rooms \u2014 about one-third of the islands\u2019 hotel inventory \u2014 are expected to be available for booking.Yet some of the most popular resorts, like the Bitter End Yacht Club and Rosewood Little Dix Bay, on Virgin Gorda, the third-largest island, won\u2019t reopen until late 2019. And more than 300 wrecked boats remain strewn on bays and beaches.\u201cWe wish that these things would happen quickly and overnight, but the damage was so much,\u201d Mark Vanterpool, the minister of communication and works, said from his temporary office above tourist shops on Tortola\u2019s main cruise ship pier. \u201cWe are pleased that we have made good progress.\u201dEven so, the scars of the hurricane linger.On the western part of Tortola, the customs office is still rubble, and elementary school students attended class in tents until recently. Repairs have not begun at the territory\u2019s largest public high school. Its 1,280 students will resume classes this month on a half-day schedule in what used to be a home supplies store.And a handful of people, like Travis Smith, still live in tents.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a depressing state,\u201d said Mr. Smith, 38, a sanitation worker who has been living in a donated white tent on the front lawn of his ruined house since December. He bathes with buckets of water, cooks in a fire pit and keeps his clothes in trash bags. Rats recently poked holes into his tent and the mosquitoes are a torment at night.He had been in touch with the government about rebuilding his house, he said, but \u201cthere\u2019s some kind of red tape holding it up.\u201dOn the anniversary of Hurricane Irma\u2019s landfall earlier this month, residents gathered in churches, government buildings and beach bars to mark the date.At Nanny Cay \u2014 a complex with a hotel, marina and condominiums \u2014 the occasion brought together shipyard workers, hotel employees, boat owners and the community of American and European expats who live there.\u201cYour life has been impacted by Irma,\u201d Miles Sutherland-Pilch, the general manager, said in a speech. \u201cTo some there has been bigger and worse impact.\u201dThen Mr. Sutherland-Pilch proposed a minute of silence to remember the four people who died as a result of the hurricane and to honor the less fortunate who are still piecing their lives back together.One by one everyone closed their eyes, lowered their heads and fell silent until only the sound of waves crashing on the shore filled the air.Advertisement"}

They walked past its grand wooden doors and moved right through the stuffy chandelier-lit dining room, where middle-aged customers looked up from their veal marsala and clams casino to consider the stylish spectacle.One of the first arrivals was a 20-year-old model/skateboarder with a million followers on Instagram. He flipped his dreadlocks to the side and strode through the place like it was a fashion runway. A thin woman wearing military boots and hoop earrings appeared next and remarked to a friend: \u201cI\u2019ve never been, but I keep hearing about it. This is my first time. I\u2019m so excited to be here.\u201d Outside, a fashion designer wearing dark sunglasses and smoking a cigarette shrieked when his date arrived, and he greeted her with a kiss on the cheek.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of this restaurant before,\u201d Mr. Barrett said. He had been there for the celebration at hand \u2014 the birthday party of a social-media influencer and creative consultant. \u201cI am only here for Jenn\u00e9 Lombardo. This restaurant only matters because of Jenn\u00e9 Lombardo. This restaurant did not even exist before tonight.\u201d He stepped into an SUV with his crew and disappeared into the night.When lunch breaks at 1 p.m., Forlini\u2019s becomes a neutral site, where prosecutors and defense attorneys enjoy chicken piccata together. Judges hold court from booths bearing plaques etched with their names. (Actual inscription: \u201cJudge Leslie Crocker Snyder. Founded First Sex Crimes Prosecution Bureau in U.S. 25 Years Patron.\u201d) Legal teams await verdicts before celebrating victories with Champagne or slinking off to the bar to wash off defeats. Robert M. Morgenthau, the former Manhattan district attorney, used to eat at Forlini\u2019s twice a week, and is still referred to by the staff simply as \u201cthe Boss.\u201dNow 99, Mr. Morgenthau visits Forlini\u2019s less often, but he remembers the restaurant fondly. \u201cForlini\u2019s was a friendly and nonpolitical atmosphere,\u201d he said over the phone. \u201cYou could see people who were adversaries in court but without any hostility, and that\u2019s why we liked it.\u201d He added: \u201cMy favorite dish was linguine with white clam sauce. Because it was the whole clam in the shell. Which was particularly good.\u201dNow, on any given night, mixed among the stalwarts in suits and ties, you\u2019ll find customers like Pablo Douzoglou, 34, who works for an indie music label. Mr. Douzoglou took out his phone to show the Slack channel (#forlinis) he and his colleagues maintain devoted to the restaurant. A typical message in the chat read simply: \u201cbeen thinking about forlinis.\u201dThe locust descent of the young and beautiful, the skateboarders and the models, upon this Old World restaurant is also part of a grand and subversive New York tradition. In a city whose famed grit is being sanded away, a certain young romantic chases authenticity. And this purity tends to be found in holdouts like Forlini\u2019s.The court crowd regulars are dimly aware of the newcomers. Cynthia Sittnick, 64, a former assistant district attorney, was unwinding recently at Forlini\u2019s. She tucked into her clams oreganata and considered the new breed as an anthropological curiosity. \u201cSo now I\u2019m hearing that the hipsters are coming to Forlini\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I get it. Forlini\u2019s is so unhip it\u2019s now become hip to them.\u201d She cast a glance at the rustic landscapes hanging on walls. \u201cLook, I love Forlini\u2019s, but if someone proposed to me here, I\u2019d probably kill them.\u201dOver at the bar, Kevin Magee, a 55-year-old police detective, nursed a beer. \u201cThey come in at night,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you see them. You\u2019ll have old people talking with the young hipsters from the neighborhood. Swedish models dancing with their boyfriends. I heard one tell her friend they\u2019re in a \u2018hidden gem.\u2019\u201dAt a table nearby, Jonathan Rosenberg, 32, a criminal defense lawyer, forked into some lasagna. \u201cIf you want to do business, you go to Forlini\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to avoid work, you go to Forlini\u2019s. And if you want to show off to your hipster friends, now you also go to Forlini\u2019s.\u201d He continued with an academic air: \u201cI think hipsters are desperate for places no one knows about but that everyone talks about. You\u2019re not supposed to be at Forlini\u2019s as a millennial, so I think that\u2019s what makes it cool for them. It becomes counterculture.\u201dThe Forlini\u2019s selfie became a coveted social media accomplishment shortly after the spectacle. Recently, a Vogue writer named Brooke Bobb happened to be dining at Forlini\u2019s, and she had some thoughts on the phenomenon. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming a spot,\u201d said Ms. Bobb, 31. \u201cOne of those places that has become Instagrammable. It\u2019s not really about the food. It\u2019s about looking cool on the couches. Getting a million likes from sitting in the booths and posing like models. That\u2019s just what happens when something goes viral now.\u201dIn the background of these selfies with people posing like models are paintings of the Northern Italian countryside that depict Groppallo, the mountain village that Joseph Forlini emigrated from in 1938. He opened a restaurant in Little Italy in 1943, and over a decade later his sons started Forlini\u2019s at 93 Baxter Street. Today, third generation cousins, Joe and Derek Forlini, run the restaurant. \u201cMy father always used to say, \u2018We came from Italy with nothing, and now judges know me by name,\u2019\u201d said Derek, 60.He recalled how the summer of Forlini\u2019s began when he got a call from Vogue last spring.\u201cWe want your restaurant,\u201d said the caller. \u201cWe want to close you down on a Saturday.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to close on Saturday, to be honest,\u201d he replied.\u201cWell, what would it take to make that happen?\u201d the caller asked. \u201cSo I threw them a number,\u201d he continued. \u201cFigured she\u2019d walk away. But she said yes. Then she said they needed to come in early. I asked why. She said: \u2018Well, we need to prep. We have to prep.\u2019\u201dSince that May evening, a dozen stylish parties that have lasted until daybreak have been booked at the restaurant. \u201cI even got one this coming Monday, in fact,\u201d Mr. Forlini said. \u201cThey told me they want to do it identical to the Vogue party and want the same stuff on the menu.\u201d As for their fresh-faced visitors, Forlini\u2019s has nothing but kind words. \u201cThey\u2019re all nice kids,\u201d said Mr. Forlini. \u201cGood kids. They\u2019ve never caused trouble. Some are so thin though you wonder how they can even drink liquor.\u201dOn a recent summer evening, the court crowd had left, the stylish people had yet to arrive, and a group of writers and artists had the restaurant to themselves. They didn\u2019t see themselves as newcomers: they had discovered the place before the models and the Instagram crew, and they felt a proprietary claim to the spot.Sara Blazej, 29, and Josh Citarella, 31, sat at this lively table in the main dining room. They run an art gallery out of their apartment nearby, and Forlini\u2019s has become their favorite haunt. \u201cWe like it here because it doesn\u2019t have the sleek, overpriced feel of the Lower East Side,\u201d Ms. Blazej said. \u201cIt\u2019s also not filled with \u2026\u201d She whispered the rest of her thought. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to use the word, but: hipsters.\u201dMr. Citarella huffed. \u201cThe skater kids will be here soon,\u201d he added ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m certain of it.\u201dSeated further down the table was an actress named Sheila Vand. She sipped wine as a male model walked into the restaurant; he acknowledged nobody and stared hard ahead as he strode toward a private dinner starting in the restaurant\u2019s back room. \u201cI follow that guy on Instagram,\u201d Ms. Vand said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to think he looks cool every time he walks past us. But who even is he? I\u2019m pretty sure he does nothing. He\u2019s Instagram famous. He\u2019s just one more kid with an Instagram account.\u201dShe described her affection for Forlini\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m a transplant,\u201d she said. \u201cI came here from the West Coast. What the hell happened to the New York that I was promised? A city that is raw and real? Now I pay thousands of dollars for an apartment, and what did I get? Williamsburg? Finance bros and hipsters? I\u2019m twisting someone\u2019s arm every night just to go out and dance and have a good time. This place still has character.\u201dA month later, summer started to wane and the fate of Forlini\u2019s was unclear: Was it over already? A lunchtime visit suggested its allure remained intoxicating. Joe Forlini, 65, counted up cash in the restaurant\u2019s cluttered office. And Phoenix Johnson, 23, entered the restaurant to order some pappardelle Bolognese.When the dish arrived, Mr. Johnson stood on top of his chair and started photographing the meal. Mr. Forlini walked by and chided him. \u201cYou gotta eat the pappardelle before doing that!\u201d he said. The young man smiled before adjusting some noodles on the plate with his hand. Later, Mr. Forlini passed by, more distressed. \u201cYou going to eat that?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting cold.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you this,\u201d said Mr. Johnson. \u201cBut probably not.\u201dAlex Vadukul is a city correspondent for Metropolitan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stealing From a Cashierless Store (Without You, or the Cameras, Knowing It)", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA start-up uses visual tracking and behavioral data to operate a new San Francisco market, which lets shoppers walk out unimpeded. And sometimes mischarged.SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 One recent afternoon, the city\u2019s newest grocery market was trying to figure out whether I would buy, steal or leave behind a bag of white Cheddar popcorn \u2014 and so was I.On its side: 27 cameras along the ceiling and a wealth of behavioral data.On my side: crippling indecision. Five of the seven founders came from the Securities and Exchange Commission, where they built artificial intelligence software to detect fraud and trade violations, before starting Standard Cognition in 2017. Now these fraud experts are working to discern something equally complicated: whether I am stealing a snack.The goal is to predict, and prevent, shoplifting, because unlike Amazon\u2019s Go stores, which have a subway turnstile-like gate for entry and exit, Standard Market has an open door, and the path is clear.Once the system decides it has detected potential theft behavior, a store attendant will get a text and walk over for \u201ca polite conversation,\u201d Mr. Suswal said.Predicting theft requires a lot of data about shoppers, much of which does not exist yet \u2014 \u201cor at least no one is willing to give it to us,\u201d he said.So a few days before Standard Market opened, Standard Cognition hired 100 actors to shop there for four hours. In Japan, the team has worked with a convenience store chain, whose name it has not disclosed, in a very useful data collection effort.\u201cThey all talk about new services, making shopping more fun, making it worthwhile to shop offline,\u201d Mr. Suswal said.And they talk about data. While a store owner can look at receipts to see who bought a generic ketchup, cashierless technology can help tell if the shopper first picked up a Heinz bottle and how long he or she looked at it. Basically, now an owner can see what a customer did not buy. On a recent Friday, a line stretched down the street from Standard Market as a bouncer at the door took in one shopper at a time for the automated experience. The store is in San Francisco\u2019s gentrifying Mid-Market neighborhood, between Chanvi Eatery, a Pakistani restaurant, and Huckleberry Bicycles, a high-end bike shop. People outside were downloading the app and typing in their credit card numbers.Walking out was Yoshimasa Takahashi, 32, who works nearby in finance. A receipt popped up on his phone. It said he had bought noodles and Kraft Macaroni & Cheese \u2014 except, he had not bought the Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. \u201cI was playing with it but didn\u2019t take it out,\u201d Mr. Takahashi said, smiling at his win over the tech. The bouncer gave him a refund.Inside, Rebecca Schiffman, 28, was working the floor. She had been an employee at Whole Foods when the Standard Cognition team recruited her. She liked the idea of getting out from behind a cash register and said she was unfazed about having to intervene with potential shoplifters.\u201cI used to do that all the time anyway,\u201d she said. To shop, I opened my phone, which flashed blue, letting the store know I had entered. I wandered, throwing items into my tote. Then I left.Outside I found Mr. Suswal. A minute went by, and a notification popped up on my phone with my receipt: one white Cheddar popcorn and one roll of toilet paper for a total of $1.19. In fact, I had left with two bags of popcorn. I had toyed with the second bag, debated buying it, considered my dinner plans, put it back and finally took it with a quick impulsive grab. The system missed it.\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d Mr. Suswal said. And yet it did. He shrugged and said I had won it.But for now it\u2019s not quite good enough. And I'm covered in crumbs.Paul Mozur contributed reporting from Shanghai.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can the Democrats Rise Above?", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThere is a lot of pressure on their coalition coming from within.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.As the Democratic electorate has bifurcated along economic and racial lines, intraparty tension is rising.The countychanged its paradigm about whom the special schools should serve: not the students with the highest abilities across the county, but rather, those students who are outliers at their neighborhood schools, with fewer than 20 peers with similar abilities.The new policies are not universally welcome. As Goldstein writes,The changes have left some parents, mostly Asian and white and living in the county\u2019s more affluent areas, anxious. They worry their children will be excluded from selective programs, or that the level of instruction at the magnet schools will fall as students are accepted from lower-performing elementary schools.At the same time, Kimberly Petrola, a teacher at Fox Chapel Elementary School in Germantown, one of the local Centers for Enriched Studies, told Goldstein:It\u2019s good for the community to see that the gifted students are not just the typical students that you think of when you think of gifted and talented. Anybody from any diverse background can be gifted.The prestigious high schools make 5,000 admissions offers to incoming ninth-graders. Yet, this year just 172 black students and 298 Latino students received offers. This happened in a city where two out of every three eighth-graders in our public schools are Latino or black.This may seem like only an educational issue, but the political ramifications are significant.Let\u2019s take a look at another divisive issue that Democrats have struggled to address.Virtually every prospective Democratic presidential candidate has singled out the broader problem of inequality as one of the most serious facing the country.All this, and we haven\u2019t even gotten to Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.What would once have been an attractive solution to the problem of inequality, increasing taxes on the rich, now poses a potential problem for a Democratic Party that has made huge gains among the affluent.Who are the prime beneficiaries of surging incomes at the top? Simple answer: predominately high-income Democratic professionals in technology, finance and law who now outnumber Republicans in presidential voting in the top income brackets.Who, in turn, are the losers in an economy where the top 20 percent gains far more than those at the bottom, whose wages have hardly budged? Service workers, who are disproportionately people of color.A majority of those at the bottom, with annual household incomes under $30,000, backed Clinton over Trump, 51-43. So too did the economic winners: those making more than $100,000 a year. Voters from households making $100,000 to $199,999 annually voted 50-44 for Clinton; among those making $200,000 to $249,999, she won 56-41; at the very top, those making $250,000 or more, Clinton won by a landslide margin, 62-34.In other words, reviving the high tax rates of the past is no longer a clean shot for the Democratic Party.Income inequality and school reform both point to another core Democratic problem: the party can, and does, win elections, but it struggles when it is in power because it faces competing policy demands. Those policy demands often pose zero-sum choices for rival constituencies: what one group gains, another loses.This was apparent at the start of the administrations of both President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama.Clinton and Obama were elected alongside solid Democratic congressional majorities. The top priority for each president was universal health care, an initiative disproportionately beneficial to low-income minorities.Within two years of taking office, support for health care reform collapsed for both Obama and Clinton.The first off-year congressional elections in the two administrations, in 1994 and 2010, were Republican wave elections \u2014 spurred in part by public opposition to health care reform \u2014 that swept out Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. Those two outcomes stymied both Clinton and Obama and limited their ability to govern. They had hit the wall that often confronts Democratic policymakers: race.By 1994, however, as the benefits of the Clinton proposal to racial and ethnic minorities became more widely known, the numbers were reversed. A plurality of whites, 41 percent, said health care should be provided privately, as opposed to the 32 percent who still supported government health insurance.There was a clear precedent for the opposition Clinton and Obama encountered on health care that goes back to the mid-1960s, when the issue of civil rights (and white racism) knocked the support out from under the liberal New Deal coalition.In 1956, 1958 and 1960, before the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, solid majorities of whites ranging from 54 to 56 percent agreed that jobs and a good standard of living were the responsibility of the federal government. By 1968, that figure fell to 27 percent.For the period extending roughly from 1970 to 2008, many of the nation\u2019s racial and economic conflicts pitted Democrats on the left against Republicans on the right.Since then, with the growth of an educated, culturally liberal class of Democratic voters, the partisan aspect of these conflicts has changed. In addition to a struggle between the two parties, a struggle has emerged between the two wings of the Democratic Party.Americans in the top fifth of the income distribution \u2014 broadly households with incomes above the $112,000 mark \u2014 are separating from the rest. This separation is economic, visible in bank balances and salaries. But it can also be seen in education, family structure, health and longevity, even in civic and community life.Reeves calls for sacrifice from the liberal elite, himself included, because \u201cmuch of the criticism of our class is true.\u201d\u201cRight now,\u201d he goes on to argue,there is something of a culture of entitlement among America\u2019s upper middle class. It is about time those of us in the favored fifth recognized our privileged position. Some humility and generosity is required.The problem with Reeves\u2019s argument, of course, is that many of the white and Asian parents in reliably liberal New York and Montgomery County are not prepared to compromise the education of their own children, as they see it, in support of a social goal, no matter how laudable.Nor are well-to-do Democratic homeowners from the West Coast to Westchester County willing to risk a decline in property values by opening their communities to affordable housing.The \u201cmy gain is your loss\u201d problems of the Democratic Party are further complicated by research showing that as inequality has grown, support for liberal redistribution policies has declined.The authors described the \u201cmost important message\u201d flowing from their analysis as \u201chigh and low-income groups respond in remarkably similar ways to shifts in economic inequality.\u201dI emailed Kelly to ask if he had developed additional interpretations of the findings since the article was published.Kelly emailed back thatAmong those with inegalitarian racial attitudes, higher levels of inequality are associated with somewhat less support for redistribution. That relationship is reversed for those who are racial egalitarians, with these folks more supportive of redistribution when inequality is higher. Economic inequality and racial attitudes work in tandem with each other. Where there is racism, rising inequality undermines support for redistribution.In other words, race and racism help mold the views of many Americans toward inequality and income and wealth redistribution.The authors, Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren, both economists at Harvard, and Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, of the Census Bureau, found that between 1989 and 2015Hispanic Americans are moving up significantly in the income distribution across generations because they have relatively high rates of intergenerational income mobility. In contrast, black Americans have substantially lower rates of upward mobility and higher rates of downward mobility than whites, leading to large income disparities that persist across generations.Their adverse finding \u201cremains true even among children born to parents in the top 1 percent,\u201d Chetty and his collaborators write: Indeed, a black child born to parents in the top quintile is roughly as likely to fall to the bottom family income quintile as he or she is to remain in the top quintile; in contrast, white children are nearly five times as likely to remain in the top quintile as they are to fall to the bottom quintile.Despite their pessimism, Chetty and his co-authors offer a ray of hope. \u201cThe black-white gap,\u201d they write,is significantly smaller for boys who grow up in certain neighborhoods \u2014 those with low poverty rates, low levels of racial bias among whites and high rates of father presence among low-income blacks. Black boys who move to such areas at younger ages have significantly better outcomes, demonstrating that racial disparities can be narrowed.To create such an environment for even a modest percentage of poor black families, the financial, cultural and social commitment of resources would be huge. Such a commitment might include a willingness to frame the argument in terms of pressing more explicitly and strenuously for a focus on this target: that \u201cwhite and black Americans are roughly equal in their economic and social resources\u201d \u2014 a goal that Chetty, Hendren, Jones and Porter argue is linked to \u201cfather presence,\u201d however unpopular such stands are in segments of the liberal community.Despite the tremendous costs and political obstacles of such a large initiative, this objective \u2014 making the economic lives of white and black Americans \u201croughly equal\u201d \u2014 should command more serious attention from Democrats if they want to restore and strengthen a liberal coalition that will have staying power over the long term.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In 1993, \u2018Joy Luck Club\u2019 Changed Hollywood. Until It Didn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAsk many Asian-American actors and creators, and they\u2019ll tell you the tide is turning for representation of their community in Hollywood.Many of the actresses, as well as the director Wayne Wang, began receiving high-profile offers. \u201cI thought it would be a new beginning for Asian-Americans,\u201d Rosalind Chao, who played Rose in the film, said in an interview.But roadblocks proved shockingly resilient. Instead of ushering in a crop of Asian-American projects, \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d remained a token for more than two decades \u2014 until \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d became the next Hollywood blockbuster to feature a contemporary story with an all-Asian cast.In the wake of #AsianAugust, Mr. Wang, Ms. Tan, and five of the movie\u2019s actresses \u2014 Ms. Chao, Lisa Lu, Lauren Tom, Tamlyn Tomita and Ming-Na Wen \u2014 reflected on the challenges and prejudices they faced before and after \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d and whether they believe \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d truly signals a new era.Before \u201cThe Joy Luck Club,\u201d Asian characters with depth in Hollywood were few and far between. There were martial artists (often played by Bruce Lee), caricatures (Long Duk Dong in \u201cSixteen Candles\u201d) or yellowface roles (Mickey Rooney\u2019s I. Y. Yunioshi in \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d).Decades later, the \u201cJoy Luck Club\u201d daughters faced similar prejudices. Tamlyn Tomita, who plays Waverly in the film, described many of her early television and film roles as: \u201cShe\u2019s a loose girl; she\u2019s a girl from the wrong side of the tracks with a heart of gold.\u201dThe characters in the novel \u201cThe Joy Luck Club,\u201d which arrived in 1989, were a welcome contrast. They celebrated family bonds as they struggled with high expectations, psychological trauma and cultural differences. \u201cWhen I read the book, it was the first time I felt someone was writing about my life,\u201d Ms. Wen, who plays June, said.\u201cI always say that \u2018The Joy Luck Club\u2019 was my green card to Hollywood,\u201d Ms. Wen said.Mr. Wang\u2019s stature also took off. On the day of the film\u2019s opening, he recalled receiving a phone call from Harvey Weinstein, who agreed to finance his next project, \u201cSmoke,\u201d on the spot. (Mr. Wang says he wasn\u2019t aware of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s predatory behavior, but that working with him was difficult: \u201cHe was obviously a bully of some kind.\u201d) Mr. Wang would go on to direct diverse films like \u201cMaid in Manhattan,\u201d with Jennifer Lopez, and the family drama \u201cBecause of Winn-Dixie.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so easy in this industry to be pigeonholed,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get stuck.\u201dAs Mr. Wang broadened his reach, he also tried to pitch Asian-American films to studios \u2014 without success. While his large ideas, like an adaptation of \u201cWest Side Story\u201d set in Chinatown, were rejected, so were his more modest efforts to place Asian characters in his films. \u201cI would always say, \u2018I know this character wasn\u2019t written for an Asian, but why can\u2019t we take a good Asian actor or actress and put them in that role?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd that would always be a fight that I couldn\u2019t win.\u201dThe four daughters in \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d eventually found themselves competing against each other for the few paltry film roles available to Asian women; they mostly moved to TV, doing short arcs on shows like \u201cER\u201d and \u201cThe West Wing.\u201d\u201cA lot of my friends who were white, and were the same age and a similar type, they would get called in,\u201d Ms. Tom said of film auditions, \u201cbut my agent could not get me in the room.\u201d She eventually found stable work in voice acting, with characters like Amy Wong in \u201cFuturama,\u201d which she said she found freeing: \u201cIt didn\u2019t really matter what age you were, what you looked like or what gender, even.\u201dPerhaps the biggest opportunity that Hollywood offered to a \u201cJoy Luck\u201d alumni was to Ms. Tan herself. After the film\u2019s release, Disney offered to adapt her sophomore novel, \u201cThe Kitchen God\u2019s Wife,\u201d as a live action feature, Ms. Tan said in an interview. But she pulled out of talks in order to focus on her novel writing.\u201cIt would be horrible, and I would regret it,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody gets their finger in the pie, and they turn it into mush.\u201dBefore \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d arrived this summer, the tide had already begun to change for Asian actors and directors.A boom era of television has led to both the production of culturally insightful shows like \u201cFresh Off The Boat\u201d and the awarding of roles to a diverse pool of actors. Three of the \u201cJoy Luck\u201d daughters, for instance, are currently part of the casts of successful TV shows: Ms. Wen on \u201cMarvel\u2019s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,\u201d Ms. Tom on \u201cAndi Mack\u201d and Ms. Tomita on \u201cThe Good Doctor.\u201dIn the film industry, the presence of Asian executives at major studios \u2014 like Kevin Tsujihara at Warner Bros. \u2014 and the increased power of the Chinese box office has led to the creation of more Asian-centric stories. One is the live action adaptation of \u201cMulan,\u201d which will feature Ms. Chao as the title character\u2019s mother.And Ms. Lu, who is now 91 years old, forged a direct link between the two eras when she starred in \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d as Shang Su Yi, Nick\u2019s wealthy and stern grandmother. \u201cI\u2019m so happy the picture came out so entertaining, but so moving,\u201d she said.\u201cBack then, we were a little more self-critical. As an Asian-American community, we\u2019re starting to realize that self-flagellation only hurts,\u201d Ms. Chao said.Ms. Tom put it more succinctly: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any shutting us up anymore.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I\u2019m writing this as an open letter to a handful of readers, distressed by the general state of our politics and disgusted by what they see on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, who have the financial means to influence the outcome of elections in November and the course of the country in 2020.My pitch is simple: The next time you meet a candidate asking for your money, start the conversation with two questions. First: \u201cWhen did you last change your mind on a significant political, economic or social issue, and why?\u201d Second (if the candidate is already in politics): \u201cWhen did you vote with the other side?\u201dYou already know that the ability to change one\u2019s mind is a crucial mark of intelligence and maturity, whether in business or politics. You also know that at least some amount of partisan and ideological heterodoxy is good for the soul \u2014 and essential for democracy. Otherwise, what were the tributes to John McCain all about?Why is that? In person, many of you are nuanced, balanced and sane in your overall political outlook, irrespective of whether you lean left or right. The problem is that you tend to care mainly about specific policy outcomes \u2014 killing the Iran deal, say, or acting on climate \u2014 and you\u2019re willing to swallow your misgivings about the other stuff, like Donald Trump\u2019s character or the Democrats\u2019 Sandernista tendencies.Sacrificed in the bargain is much concern about the tone of campaigns, the rules of politics, the process of policymaking, and ordinary considerations of collegiality and respect.Let me ask you to think hard about the increasing cost of that bargain. A president who rages like King Lear on the heath because an op-ed in The Times was mean to him. Senate Democrats who cheerfully turn a Supreme Court confirmation hearing into a carnival show while they audition for the Democratic nomination. The collapse of regular order. The vanishing filibuster. The constant threat of government shutdowns. The ceaseless campaign that always comes at the expense of governance. The administrative state on which we increasingly rely to run things because elected officials can\u2019t. The rush to the exits by the more honorable public servants.This is the politics of maximum polarization and total paralysis, waged with the intensity of the Battle of the Somme and yielding about as much ground. Right now, you\u2019re contributing to this. Stop.There\u2019s an alternative. Split more of your money between the parties. Fund candidates with proven or potential cross-party appeal. Help out politicians with scores below 100 percent from the N.R.A. or the Sierra Club. Set up a PAC \u2014 call it SanePAC or NotNutsPAC \u2014 to help candidates facing primary challenges from the further-right or further-left. Expand the reach of purple America at the expense of deep red or deep blue.There are political leaders who fit that description today: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan in blue-state Maryland; Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper in purple-state Colorado and Republican Gov. John Kasich in purple-state Ohio; Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen in red-state Tennessee. Plenty of other names. You could contribute by securing their base and amplifying their national profile.For many of you, professional and personal success has not meant getting everything you want. It\u2019s about knowing the difference between what\u2019s essential and what you can live without. What\u2019s essential today is a healthier political culture, not a temporary policy win.

{"Headline": "Viral Videos Are Replacing Pricey Political Ads. They\u2019re Cheaper, and They Work.", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese are not the stories that candidates usually turn to the camera and open up about in ads.One talked about her father\u2019s violent temper and how she once watched him throw her mother through a plate glass door. Another recalled watching his brothers struggle to find steady work because of their criminal records. A third spoke of suffering a decade of sexual abuse as a child.The wave of female, minority and outsider candidates that is breaking cultural barriers and toppling incumbents in the Democratic Party is also sweeping aside a longstanding norm in campaigns: That the public image of politicians \u2014 especially women \u2014 should be upbeat, uncontroversial and utterly conventional.For many of these Democrats who were running against better-financed rivals, the breakthrough moment came after they got personal in relatively low-cost videos that went viral, reaching millions of people. Using documentary-style storytelling, which can last for several minutes, candidates have found a successful alternative to the traditional model of raising huge sums of money that get spent on expensive, 30-second television commercials.The videos are chiefly intended as ads, but they also served a fund-raising purpose. For a fraction of the cost, these videos can help to spread a candidate\u2019s story in a way that is easily shareable and can inspire donations.In the housing project where she was raised, says Ms. Hayes, who was named National Teacher of the Year in 2016, \u201cpeople are strong, but they aren\u2019t supposed to run for Congress.\u201d\u201cIf Congress starts to look like us, no one can stop us,\u201d she says.Republican candidates this year have been using their own personal, sometimes primal, approach \u2014 though with far different messages and audiences in mind. They have largely stuck to the 30-second commercial format rather than the narrative videos, however.If the Republicans are appealing overtly to Trump supporters and conservatives, many Democrats are trying to telegraph a sense of shared struggle and life experience, while making the explicit assertion that a government cannot adequately represent the people it is supposed to serve unless its servants look like and live among the people.\u201cI have stayed, on purpose, in close proximity to the hurt, acutely uncomfortable so that I\u2019ll never grow complacent in tackling these inequities,\u201d she says.\u201cWe knew we would be outraised and outspent, without a doubt,\u201d said Sarah Groh, Ms. Pressley\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cSo when it was a question of how do we deploy our resources we looked at where our voters were consuming their information.

It was one of the first races in this election season to signal the disconnect many liberals feel from their leaders.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s video came out of a three-person firm called Means of Production in Detroit.

{"Headline": "How Michigan Became the Epicenter of the Modernist Experiment", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA perfect storm of manufacturing money, ample space and robust industry created one of Modernism\u2019s most fertile and important outposts in and around Detroit.Kahn came from humble means. He was a Jewish immigrant from the former Kingdom of Prussia whose family had settled in Detroit in 1881. He founded his eponymous firm in the city in 1895, at the age of 26. Early in his career, with the 1904 design for Building 10 of the city\u2019s Packard automotive plant, Kahn revolutionized industrial architecture by replacing wood materials with reinforced concrete, a safer alternative that also allowed for more dramatic structures. The Packard plant was a small city unto itself that at its height employed 40,000 workers in a 3.5-million-square-foot complex with vast rows of windows. (Kahn, who designed the entire complex, was, according to a 1956 article in the Detroit Free Press, \u201can apostle of sunlight,\u201d someone who \u201cdidn\u2019t think much of windowless factories.\u201d) Ford would hire Kahn on the basis of Building 10 and other similar factories he worked on, which pulled American design into the 20th century.The same year Kahn submitted his designs for the Highland Park plant, he completed work on a manor home about 20 miles north of the city, in what would become the suburb of Bloomfield Hills but was at the time still farmland. The commission came from George Gough Booth, the publisher of The Detroit News. Booth and Ford could not have been more different. During the 1920s, Ford, who once said, \u201cI don\u2019t like to read books,\u201d also owned a newspaper, The Dearborn Independent, which ran a year-and-a-half-long series of anti-Semitic articles that began with a piece titled \u201cThe International Jew: The World\u2019s Problem\u201d; a connoisseur of Asian art and literature, Booth was scholarly, and a proponent of the Arts and Crafts movement.Related: What to See, and Where to Eat Square Pizza, in DetroitWright\u2019s mantra is as good as any at summing up the Modern era \u2014 constant toil in the name of progress. If Michigan isn\u2019t the first place that comes to mind when considering this period \u2014 unlike, say, Germany or France in the 1920s \u2014 it should be. The presence of Ford in the city and Booth in the country was enough to make Michigan ground zero for the Modernist experiment, which was, on an aesthetic level, concerned with clarity and flexibility: Ford wanted all the messy components of manufacturing to be housed under one enormous roof, and Kahn made it so. But ideologically, architectural Modernism was more complicated, rooted in the idea that if one were to reshape an environment in a kind of magnificent, functional order, then that environment would encourage a level of social harmony and cohesion. This experiment failed, of course, but its remnants still stand throughout Michigan, making the state home to perhaps the most diverse and best-preserved collection of early Modernist experiments in the world.10 PhotosTHERE IS NO greater testament to Michigan\u2019s role in Modernist design than Cranbrook. Eliel Saarinen \u2014 who arrived in America in 1923 from Helsinki and taught for a year at the University of Michigan, where Booth\u2019s son Henry was one of his students \u2014 was soon poached by Booth to design and run his art school. Saarinen\u2019s campus home, which he designed in 1928, is one of the great structures of its time. Here was something altogether new, hidden in the Michigan countryside. Inside, every corner, every angle was considered in masterful detail to such an extent that Saarinen even had a paperback copy of Jack London\u2019s \u201cThe Sea-Wolf\u201d bound in leather so that it would blend better with the surroundings. The house became Saarinen\u2019s studio, where, at least as much as Ford\u2019s factories, a new direction for American design was conceptualized.Yamasaki won the commission for New York\u2019s World Trade Center in 1962 and appeared on the cover of Time magazine a few months later \u2014 an honor afforded to only about a dozen other architects, Eero Saarinen and Frank Lloyd Wright among them. In 1972, he completed work on his own home, near Cranbrook, which had by now transformed from wilderness into suburban sprawl. As an architect, Yamasaki took the Modernist project more literally than any of his contemporaries \u2014 he truly believed he would improve people\u2019s lives through his work, and that his buildings were monuments to \u201cman\u2019s belief in humanity.\u201dAnd so here we are again, back at the notion of endless progress, no matter the cost. But progress for whom? It is not only a quintessentially American idea but a Modernist one: Knock down the low-income neighborhood to build the factory or the condo tower or the sports stadium, and let history record it as human achievement. This was the case a century ago, and the whole country saw what happened the first time around. Michigan\u2019s Modernist heritage is more than just history now up for grabs; it is also a cautionary tale.The day before I left Michigan, I drove to the suburb of Southfield to see the former Reynolds Metals Regional Sales Office, designed by Yamasaki. Completed in 1959, it is an elaborate monument to aluminum in a city whose fortunes once depended on the material. The building sits directly off the freeway in a drab and mostly deserted office park. The late afternoon sun bounced off Yamasaki\u2019s grille \u2014 a woven pattern of gold-anodized aluminum rings. In 1959, the building would have been surrounded by a pool that reflected the glassed-in lobby, with its white concrete floors and marble-and-aluminum reception desk. But Reynolds had long since departed. Most recently, the building was home to an LA Fitness, but it has sat vacant for several years. I got out of my car and walked up the steps to the front entrance. Someone had wrapped the railing with streams of Christmas tinsel. The front door was boarded up with rotting plywood. The decaying art piece off the freeway was for sale for $900,000. I got back in my car and left.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "India\u2019s Top Court Limits Sweep of Biometric ID Program", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 In a landmark ruling on Wednesday, India\u2019s Supreme Court placed strict limits on the government\u2019s national biometric identity system while also finding that the sweeping program did not fundamentally violate the privacy rights of the country\u2019s 1.3 billion residents.A five-justice panel of the court decided by 4-1 to approve the use of the program, called Aadhaar, for matters involving the public purse, such as the distribution of food rations and other government benefits and the collection of income taxes.But the panel struck down Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s efforts to require the digital ID for other purposes, including verifying the identity of students taking exams, and established new protections meant to prevent the government from misusing the data in the name of national security.The justices also threw out a powerful provision in the 2016 Aadhaar Act that had allowed private companies like banks and cellphone companies \u2014 sometimes at the government\u2019s behest \u2014 to use the ID to verify customer identities. That was at least a temporary blow to the dreams of technology billionaires, like Nandan Nilekani and Vinod Khosla, who saw the system as crucial to a new generation of digital businesses like online vehicle insurance and pre-employment background checks.Aadhaar, a Hindi word meaning \u201cfoundation,\u201d was conceived as a difficult-to-forge ID that would reduce fraud and improve the delivery of government welfare programs. The intention was to scan the fingerprints, irises and faces of every Indian and then use those unique biometric attributes to check identity when someone picked up subsidized rice or joined a government work program.In its 1,448-page decision \u2014 broken up into two concurring opinions and a stinging dissent \u2014 the court relied on precedents from around the world to set broad parameters for how the ID system could be used in India, a country that is adding tens of millions of new internet users a year but has few laws governing data protection.Writing for the majority, Justice A.K. Sikri said that, with the court\u2019s restrictions, \u201cwe find that the Aadhaar Act has struck a fair balance between the right of privacy of the individual with right to life of the same individual as a beneficiary.\u201dThe ruling on Wednesday affects a vast swath of Indian life, from who can collect benefits like food assistance and pensions to how mobile phone providers create new accounts. Some states, such as Andhra Pradesh, had planned to integrate the ID system into far-reaching surveillance programs, something that will now be difficult, given the court\u2019s restrictions on how the data can be used.The decision could also have influence beyond India\u2019s borders, as other countries, including Britain and the Philippines, try to balance privacy against the needs of government in their own national identity and surveillance programs.\u201cIndia is a great case study,\u201d said C.V. Madhukar, who leads the digital identity efforts of the Omidyar Network, an investment firm based in California. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s thinking on this so far can provide guidance to many countries in Africa and the developing world, even the United States.\u201dMr. Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party and the opposition Indian National Congress, which began the Aadhaar program nearly a decade ago when it was in power, both claimed the ruling as a victory.Rahul Gandhi, who is challenging Mr. Modi in the 2019 national elections, said the court had rejected the current government\u2019s use of Aadhaar as \u201ca tool of oppression and surveillance.\u201dHowever, Mr. Modi\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, said the court had recognized the vast savings to the taxpayers from the program, which he estimated at $12 billion a year, from weeding out fake or duplicate recipients of government benefits.\u201cTechnology as a tool of governance, as an instrument of conferring benefits to people, as an instrument of revenue collection, I think is a concept which nobody now really can deny,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were entering uncharted areas, and one of the purposes of judicial review is what is the direction in which you can move and how much.\u201dTens of millions of the initial enrollments were done by poorly trained or corrupt agents who recorded incorrect biometric or other personal data like birth dates. Sloppy security practices by state and local governments led to more than 200 data breaches of sensitive information, including Aadhaar numbers.After Mr. Modi\u2019s government made participation in Aadhaar mandatory for recipients of government benefits, millions of the poorest Indians were denied vital food rations when distribution shops had trouble reading fingerprints from work-worn hands or could not connect to the central server through India\u2019s unreliable cellphone networks.At least 25 Indians died of starvation after Aadhaar-related verification problems, according to a tally by one professor, Reetika Khera, who has conducted extensive field research on the program. Some local governments, such as New Delhi\u2019s, stopped using the system for food programs.Proponents argued that such problems were just teething pains. They said that a digital ID would be transformational in a country where hundreds of millions of poor people have long lacked a reliable, universally accepted way of proving who they are. For private companies like cellphone providers, Aadhaar turned a paper-intensive, two-day process of verifying a new customer\u2019s identity into a 30-second fingerprint scan.The court, which held 38 days of hearings in the spring on more than 30 challenges to the law, noted the security lapses in its decision and acknowledged that some Indians were losing important benefits because of the reliance on digital identification. But the court said it trusted the government to resolve the problems.Shyam Divan, the veteran lawyer who kicked off the oral arguments for the plaintiffs challenging the law, said in an interview that the court had \u201ccontained\u201d the government\u2019s efforts to use Aadhaar to build a surveillance state. \u201cAnd they have completely knocked out the private sector from this,\u201d he said.Srikanth Nadhamuni, the chief executive of Khosla Labs, which set up a business to offer private Aadhaar authentication services, said that the court\u2019s ban on the commercial use of the digital ID was disappointing and that he hoped lawmakers would find a way to restore it in the coming data-protection legislation.\u201cThere are a lot of small companies who need verification done,\u201d he said, adding that the cost of performing such verification via an Aadhaar scan was 10 rupees, or about 14 cents, compared with 1,000 rupees for traditional paper verification.For ordinary Indians, who had faced ever-increasing demands for their digital ID cards, the court\u2019s limits could bring some peace.Sat Pal, a taxi driver in New Delhi, said he had been asked to produce his Aadhaar everywhere, including to get his driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration.\u201cLately they started demanding it at school admission,\u201d he said. \u201cI went to my bank to ask for a checkbook. They demanded Aadhaar. I asked them why. They said you have to produce it. So it became a tool for harassing people. Now it will be a big relief.\u201dHari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What the Experts Want Us to Know About Public Health", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareThings like clean water, immunization and mosquito control are crucial, yet easily overlooked or taken for granted.The United States receives tremendous benefits from public health spending \u2014 with far more value per dollar than with most other types of health care spending. We asked some experts \u2014 officials who run public health departments, academics and leaders of funding organizations \u2014 what they think we should be doing in public health, and a few themes emerged. Although we spend huge sums on health care, it\u2019s not always on the right things. \u201cThe key to better health isn\u2019t always to build more hospitals and train more specialists,\u201d said Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general. \u201cIn fact, it usually is not.\u201d\u201cIt ensures that our water is safe to drink and our pools and lakes are safe for swimming,\u201d he added. \u201cIt provides screening for cancer and works to prevent injuries.\u201dKaren DeSalvo, a former New Orleans health commissioner, said: \u201cOf the $1 trillion in federal spending, only 1 percent is on public health \u2014 an infrastructure that saves lives\u201d and that can \u201creduce suffering and improve community well-being and vitality.\u201d We could do a better job at providing access to the things we know that already work. Ursula Bauer, who manages the nation\u2019s chronic disease prevention portfolio at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, \u201cNot all adults have access to appropriate cancer screenings, and we don\u2019t do a good job of managing high blood pressure.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for most Americans to integrate routine physical activity into our lives. We don\u2019t have destinations within walking distance or sidewalks to get there. We can\u2019t find the stairs to use in most buildings.\u201dThomas Farley, the health commissioner for Philadelphia, said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of money to be made selling products that, over the long term, kill people.\u201d These include tobacco, alcohol, unhealthy food, addictive drugs (legal and illegal) and guns.Dr. Bauer said policies could do better at using carrots and sticks, including taxes and subsidies, in these cases: \u201cThere are more incentives and opportunities for people to consume unhealthy foods and beverages than there are for them to make healthy food and beverage choices.\u201d \u201cPublic health needs to take a leadership role in confronting and influencing the social, political and economic factors that determine population health,\u201d said Sandro Galea, the Robert A. Knox professor and dean of Boston University\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cThe patterns of disease and death track along this nation\u2019s deep divides of race and income,\u201d said Mary Travis Bassett, the former New York City health commissioner, who recently took a position at Harvard. She said America needed to divest in prisons and \u201cput that funding toward new systems of justice, better housing or universal child care.\u201dDr. Murthy also argued that \u201cthe way the Congressional Budget Office scores health legislation does not recognize much of the cost savings from prevention, which creates a further disincentive for legislators to pursue prevention-oriented legislation.\u201dPerhaps the biggest change needed is for public health to do a better job at trumpeting its success. Too often, it seems to be the unsung hero. \u201cIt can be difficult to maintain support for public health systems when they are so often invisible,\u201d Dr. Besser said. Few public health initiatives will make anyone wealthy. In the American political environment, that makes it difficult to organize a winning coalition for any specific policy. But that outlook misses a crucial fact about public health: Many campaigns have achieved a rare double victory: They have lengthened and improved lives, and they have also saved more money than they\u2019ve cost.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Prosecutors Are Said to Issue Subpoenas Over Pelvic-Mesh Surgery Financing", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal prosecutors in Brooklyn are intensifying an investigation into allegations that a network of doctors, lawyers, financiers and consultants lured women into having pelvic mesh implants removed, according to the two people familiar with the matter.In the past month, the prosecutors have issued subpoenas seeking information about whether women had been tricked into undergoing unnecessary surgery and whether doctors or others had received improper payments, said the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to do so publicly.A spokesman for Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment.The Florida attorney general\u2019s office, in an emailed statement, said it was also investigating the matter but declined further comment. Many of the procedures in question were performed at walk-in medical centers in the state and were arranged by consultants there.Millions of women around the world have received mesh implants to correct a condition called pelvic organ prolapse, which occurs when a woman\u2019s organs fall and press against her vagina because of weakened pelvic muscles. That causes urinary and other problems. The mesh reinforces the pelvic wall.The devices have helped many women without incident, but tens of thousands have said they were harmed by the products and have joined so-called mass tort lawsuits against the companies that made them.The women were flown to Florida, put up in motels and operated on by doctors they often met for the first time the day of their surgery. All costs were paid by finance firms in return for a portion of settlements the women might ultimately receive from makers of the devices, including Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson.Law Cash, which is based in Brooklyn, was one such firm.George Arzt, a spokesman for Law Cash, which specializes in providing cash advances to consumers with active personal injury lawsuits, said the firm did not comment on \u201cinvestigations real or imagined.\u201dMany of the women were represented in the mass tort suits by a Minnesota law firm, McSweeney Langevin. The law firm\u2019s engagement letters with clients often included a clause requiring that disputes between it and its clients be resolved through arbitration.One client of the McSweeney firm is now suing her lawyers there, Law Cash and others, claiming they misled her about the need to get the mesh removed. The woman, who lives in Arkansas, won a court victory last month when a federal judge in Little Rock denied a move by McSweeney to force the matter into arbitration.The federal judge, James Moody Jr., called the arbitration agreement between the woman, Jerri Plummer, and the law firm \u201cunconscionable.\u201dThe judge said the law firm and its agents \u201csomehow got their hands on Plummer\u2019s cellphone number and, after instilling fear of death in her, solicited her to not only undergo a surgical procedure in another state, but also to allow them to represent her.\u201dA lawyer representing the McSweeney firm said no decision had been made on whether to appeal the ruling in the Arkansas case.Advertisement"}

Bharati Mukherjee, Henry Roth and Amy Tan might say no; Vladimir Nabokov and V. S. Naipaul, yes. Gary Shteyngart is still thinking about it.Shteyngart\u2019s fourth and latest novel, \u201cLake Success,\u201d veers from its forebears by placing a Long Island-born financier at its center, rather than Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s or their children, and for the most part shuns themes of transnational displacement and the hyphenated existence. Yet the fuel and oxygen of immigrant literature \u2014 movement, exile, nostalgia, cultural disorientation \u2014 are nevertheless what fire the pistons of this trenchant and panoramic novel. Shteyngart\u2019s subject may be America, but it\u2019s Trump\u2019s America: seething, atomizing, foreign and hostile even to itself. \u201cCan it be that we\u2019re all exiles?\u201d Roberto Bola\u00f1o once asked, a question that goes echoing through this novel. \u201cIs it possible that all of us are wandering strange lands?\u201dThe chief wanderer in \u201cLake Success\u201d is Barry Cohen. In casting his lead, Shteyngart doesn\u2019t pander to contemporary sympathies: Barry is a white, middle-aged hedge-fund manager \u201cwith $2.4 billion of assets under management.\u201d He has Goldman Sachs on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and lives in the same Manhattan apartment building as Rupert Murdoch. He has a congenital inability to remember the names of women, though not those of men, and unironically idolizes Hemingway. Until college (Princeton) he\u2019d never so much as spoken to a black person, and after college \u2014 well, \u201chis industry did not employ many African-Americans.\u201d The closest gesture he\u2019s made toward social welfare, aside from social- and tax-minded philanthropy, is a \u201cplan to launch a collection of billionaire trading cards for poor kids, with all the billionaires\u2019 financial stats, such as net worth, Forbes list ranking and liquid and paper assets on the back \u2026 so that the \u2018black kids could get inspired to do better at school.\u2019\u201d When we meet him, he\u2019s staggeringly drunk \u2014 from Japanese whiskey that retails for $33,000 a bottle \u2014 and bleeding from wounds bestowed upon him by his wife and his child\u2019s nanny. He\u2019s the anti-mensch. (Readers allergic to unlikable protagonists should approach this book armed with an EpiPen.)The writer Larry Brown employed a storytelling tactic he called \u201csandbagging,\u201d loading his characters with immense heaps of trouble to see if and how they might wriggle free. This is Shteyngart\u2019s tack with Barry. Barry\u2019s marriage has imploded, due partly to his inability to reckon with his 3-year-old son\u2019s autism diagnosis. The Securities and Exchange Commission is after him for dirty trading. And like many middle-aged men, rich and poor, \u201che didn\u2019t really know who he was.\u201d So, on a boozy whim, Barry undertakes that most iconic of American responses: He lights out for the territories, in this case boarding a Greyhound bus with a rollerboard suitcase containing six precious wristwatches, \u201cthe implements of his true desire.\u201d He ditches his phone, then later his credit cards. By the time he hits Baltimore, he\u2019s already shivering with Kerouacian ecstasy: \u201cBarry had broken free of the surly bonds of his own life. He had been granted refuge in America.\u201dThis is a mirage, of course, in much the same way Barry\u2019s success has been, and the reader is in on the joke. We do not root for Barry; we root for his comeuppance. The source for that, we suspect, may be Barry\u2019s wife, Seema, the latter half of a couple Shteyngart itemizes as \u201cone powerful, the other beautiful.\u201d The 29-year-old daughter of Indian immigrants, Seema was a Yale-degreed law clerk before she married Barry, had a son, then took \u201cto doing what hedge-fund wives did best, building a carefully curated life for the family.\u201d (\u201cMarrying an accomplished woman and taking her off the job market,\u201d Shteyngart writes, \u201cwas a way to telegraph success among Barry\u2019s peers.\u201d) With Barry on the lam, Seema immediately commences an affair with a novelist, but like most affairs it\u2019s doomed and a little dreary. She frets about their son, Shiva, and, because it\u2019s the summer of 2016, frets about the coming election, and every so often ponders just how she\u2019s \u201cbecome this scummy rich person,\u201d exiled from her principles. The alternating Seema chapters lack the antic verve of Barry\u2019s, and not only because Barry is high-tailing his way across America while Seema is back in their apartment scheduling therapists for their son. With Barry, the reader senses (and shares) Shteyngart\u2019s glee as he sinks pin after pin into his finance-bro voodoo doll. With Seema, however, the reader discerns authorial restraint, even remorse. After a while Shteyngart mercifully flies in her parents from Cleveland for support.Barry, thankfully, gets no such assistance. Set adrift on Greyhound, with a dwindling stake of both cash and delusions, he embarks upon a nostalgia tour, seeking to reunite with a college girlfriend who\u2019s now a single mother teaching Holocaust studies in El Paso. Along the way he goes bumbling into an America that to him is so foreign as to require subtitles. \u201cIn the town of South Hill he saw a Walmart,\u201d Shteyngart writes, \u201cand wondered if that was the first one he had seen in real life.\u201d In West Baltimore he talks wristwatches with a drug dealer and ends up with a rock of crack cocaine tinged with the sharp yellow \u201cof a newborn Parmesan.\u201d En route to Jackson, Miss., he strikes up an improbable romance with a young African-American woman whose generosity he mistakes for thievery. In between it all he takes in the bus window scenery sweeping by: \u201cfake-hacienda suburbs,\u201d a \u201cdiorama of cotton, oil and cattle.\u201d A \u201cpayday loans sign lit up red and green like an advertisement for a Christmas that would never come.\u201d (Shteyngart tosses lines this good like confetti.)

(There\u2019s a difference, after all, between fasting and starving.)

{"Headline": "Trump to Preside Over U.N. Security Council, Prompting Anxiety All Around", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Three weeks from now, in New York, President Trump will find himself in the setting he most relishes: seated at the head of a polished table, calling on those seated around him, rewarding those he likes and cutting off those who displease him.It is not a revival of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d or even a meeting of his cabinet. Mr. Trump will be presiding at the United Nations Security Council, a rotating role that falls to the United States this month. His star turn is prompting anxiety among people, inside and outside the administration, who worry that the president will bring reality-TV antics to the world stage.Exercising the prerogative of the chairman, Mr. Trump plans to focus on Iran and its malign activity around the Middle East. European diplomats said they fear that this will only underscore the disunity of the West, given the unpopularity of Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal.Already, the president\u2019s choice of subject has drawn objections from Russia, which said the focus of the meeting should be entirely on the nuclear deal and Mr. Trump\u2019s exit from it, and Iran, which accused Mr. Trump of abusing his leadership of the council to vilify a single country.The resistance is not limited to foreigners. At the State Department, the National Security Council and the American mission to the United Nations, there are privately voiced qualms about Mr. Trump leading a discussion on a complex, divisive subject with foreign leaders who were fiercely opposed to his handling of the nuclear deal.American officials are discussing whether to reframe the session on the broader region or a different theme to reduce the risk of things going awry, though it is unclear whether the president will be receptive.By all accounts, Mr. Trump is excited about presiding over the most exclusive club devoted to world peace and security. And he appears equally ready to shake up the customs of that club, where the last time an American leader presided \u2014 Barack Obama in 2014 \u2014 he chose a theme that the other members could readily embrace: combating foreign terrorist fighters.Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, accused Mr. Trump on Wednesday of using the session to \u201cblame Iran for horrors US & clients have unleashed across\u201d the Middle East. He noted that the only Security Council resolution currently in force on Iran is the nuclear deal.Under the rules of the Security Council, Mr. Zarif or even Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, is entitled to a seat at the meeting and to be called on by Mr. Trump. Administration officials said they believed it was unlikely that Mr. Rouhani would turn up, though he is scheduled to attend the General Assembly, which meets at the same time.Even if he did come, officials said Mr. Trump might leave the meeting before it was Iran\u2019s turn to speak. It would be called on only after all 15 members of the Security Council had spoken, a process that could take half a day. If Mr. Trump left early, he would most likely hand over his seat to the American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ms. Haley acknowledged that some council members would find Iran an \u201cuncomfortable\u201d subject. But, she said, \u201cI personally think that when we talk about things that are uncomfortable in the Security Council, good things happen.\u201d\u201cPresident Trump is very adamant that we have to start making sure that Iran is falling in line with international order,\u201d Ms. Haley added. \u201cAnd we continue to see them engage in things that are not helpful, whether it\u2019s in Lebanon, whether it\u2019s in Yemen, whether we\u2019re looking at Syria.\u201dThat is one of the primary arguments for Mr. Trump\u2019s decision to focus on Iran, other American officials said. The furor over the nuclear deal, they said, had crowded out discussion of Iran\u2019s other activities.The United States is warning allies, for example, that Iranian missiles pose a threat to civilian aircraft in the Persian Gulf. But particularly among Europeans, officials said, those dangers often get subsumed in the continuing discussion of why Mr. Trump abandoned the deal.Some officials played down the risks of Mr. Trump\u2019s appearance. Diplomatic protocol almost guarantees that the meeting will be a series of canned speeches rather than a freewheeling debate, in which Mr. Trump could either be rattled or be seen as bullying other leaders.In any event, Mr. Trump has shown himself to be gleefully unconcerned with bruising feelings.In his first visit to the General Assembly last year, he declared, \u201cI will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always and should always put your countries first\u201d \u2014 a call for sovereignty at odds with the mission of the United Nations as a body created to deal collectively with problems that transcend borders.He referred to the country of one African leader as \u201cNambia,\u201d prompting questions about whether he had conflated Namibia with Gambia or Zambia (the White House later clarified that he meant Namibia). From the rostrum of the General Assembly, he said of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, \u201cRocket Man is on a suicide mission.\u201dMr. Trump returns to the United Nations after having launched an audacious diplomatic overture to Mr. Kim. While in New York, Ms. Haley said, he planned to meet President Moon Jae-in of South Korea to discuss the nuclear negotiations, which have stalled in recent weeks.Mr. Trump can also claim progress in his efforts to isolate Iran, however unpopular they have been. The country\u2019s currency, the rial, plummeted to record lows this week amid fears that the sanctions Mr. Trump is reimposing will cripple its oil exports and broader economy.Beyond faulting Iran\u2019s behavior, though, it is not clear what Mr. Trump hopes to accomplish when he sits at the horseshoe-shaped table in the Security Council\u2019s chamber. With so much resistance to his Iran policy from Russia, China and other veto-wielding members, there is no prospect of winning support for any kind of resolution.When Mr. Obama first led a council meeting in 2009, the United States won passage of a resolution that promised tougher scrutiny of countries that proliferated nuclear weapons. Days later, the White House revealed intelligence showing that Iran had built a secret uranium enrichment facility in a mountain near the holy city of Qum.In 2014, with the Islamic State terrorizing Iraq and Syria, Mr. Obama pushed a resolution in the council to crack down on the financing, and movement of people signing up to fight for foreign terrorist organizations.While an American-led military campaign largely vanquished the Islamic State, Mr. Obama\u2019s 2009 nonproliferation resolution did nothing to prevent North Korea from making new nuclear bombs, although he did negotiate the deal that blocked Iran\u2019s ability to do so.For Mr. Trump, marshaling global support against Iran seems less of a priority in New York than defiantly advancing his own get-tough policy. Aides said the decision to focus on Iran was very much the president\u2019s \u2014 and no one actively pushed back on it, whatever their qualms.For a president who hushed dissent in his reality-TV days with a simple \u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d the question is, how will he react if the would-be apprentices from Iran and Russia refuse to go quietly?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In McCain Memorial Service, Two Presidents Offer Tribute, and a Contrast to Trump", "Date": "2018-09-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 He drove them crazy. He berated them on the way to the White House and badgered them once they got there. He stood by them when he thought they were right and tore at their heels when he was convinced they were wrong. And when it came time to depart this world, John McCain wanted them to tell his story.That they were asked, and not the current president, spoke volumes about the man and the moment. And while neither explicitly mentioned President Trump, who, uninvited and unwelcome, went golfing instead, their tributes could hardly be heard without the unspoken contrast to the current occupant of the Oval Office, a message amplified by a more overt rebuke from the senator\u2019s daughter.\u201cSo much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse, can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult, in phony controversies and manufactured outrage,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s a politics that pretends to be brave, but in fact is born of fear. John called us to be bigger than that. He called us to be better than that.\u201dMr. Bush praised Mr. McCain for his \u201ccourage and decency,\u201d an exemplar of the storied American values of standing up to bullying and oppression. \u201cIf we are ever tempted to forget who we are, to grow weary of our cause, John\u2019s voice will always come as a whisper over our shoulder \u2014 we are better than this, America is better than this,\u201d Mr. Bush said.If their better-than-this eulogies were widely seen as an implicit reproach of Mr. Trump, Meghan McCain left no mystery who she had in mind with a powerful, emotional, sobbing remembrance of her father that also sounded like a defiant cri de coeur against the tycoon-turned-president who once belittled the senator\u2019s wartime service.\u201cWe gather here,\u201d she said, \u201cto mourn the passing of American greatness \u2014 the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\u201dMocking Mr. Trump\u2019s favorite slogan, she later declared: \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.\u201d The audience then burst out in applause, something that rarely happens during the traditionally solemn funerals held at the cathedral.While Mr. Trump was absent, political figures from both parties made their way to the house of worship on a dreary, overcast and humid morning. They came to bid farewell to John Sidney McCain III, son and grandson of admirals, naval aviator, tortured prisoner, congressman, six-term senator, two-time presidential candidate, patriot, maverick, reformer, warrior, curmudgeon, father, husband and finally, in death, American icon.They also came to mourn an ideal that he represented and a town that he once dominated with verve and humor and memorable flashes of temper. Like Mr. McCain, many of the Republicans who attended have found themselves deeply discouraged by their own party\u2019s president. But unlike Mr. McCain, most of them do not say so out loud, for fear of rage by Twitter or retribution by the base. It was almost as if it were a meeting of Washington\u2019s political underground, if the underground met in a grand cathedral with 10,650 organ pipes.For his part, Mr. Trump spent the morning railing again on Twitter about his opponents, the news media and the investigation into his campaign\u2019s interactions with Russia during the 2016 election.He quoted supporters asserting that the inquiry was rigged \u201cto spy on Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s political opponent\u201d (misspelling his predecessor\u2019s name) and that \u201cthis is the scandal here \u2014 a police state.\u201d He complained about \u201ccorruption at the DOJ & FBI\u201d and said the news media \u201chas become tainted and corrupt!\u201dOn his way to his Virginia golf club, he unleashed a few more combative tweets threatening to terminate a trade agreement with Canada and warning that \u201cCongress should not interfere w/these negotiations.\u201d By the end of the day, in a possible rejoinder to Ms. McCain, he tweeted in all caps: \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.\u201dStanding in for Mr. Trump at the cathedral were his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as his chief of staff, John F. Kelly, and national security adviser, John R. Bolton, seated not far away from former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s lawyer and a longtime political ally of Mr. McCain\u2019s, also attended.As he battled brain cancer, Mr. McCain told his advisers months ago that he wanted Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama to speak at his funeral, then called each of them to make the request. The point was to emphasize the common values that they shared despite their differences.\u201cThat\u2019s what McCain\u2019s trying to say,\u201d said Mark Salter, his longtime confidant. \u201cThe message of the whole service is supposed to be there\u2019s a better way to do this, there\u2019s a better way to do politics than the way we\u2019ve been doing it lately.\u201dMr. Obama admitted to a \u201ccertain surprise\u201d when Mr. McCain called to ask him to speak at his service, but said he came to realize it demonstrated the senator\u2019s relish for unpredictability, disdain for self-pity, largeness of spirit and mischievous streak.\u201cAfter all,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cwhat better way to get a last laugh than to make George and I say nice things about him to a national audience?\u201dThe former president noted that despite their debates, he and Mr. McCain shared a commitment to overhauling immigration and campaign finance laws, and he praised the senator for his fidelity to American principles like the rule of law and a free press.He recalled that during their 2008 contest, Mr. McCain corrected a supporter who denounced Mr. Obama as an Arab. \u201cI was grateful, but I wasn\u2019t surprised,\u201d he said. \u201cI never saw John treat anyone differently because of their race, or religion, or gender.\u201dThat did not mean they agreed all the time, he noted. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret, it\u2019s been mentioned, that he had a temper,\u201d Mr. Obama said, \u201cand when it flared up, it was a force of nature, a wonder to behold \u2014 his jaw grinding, his face reddening, his eyes boring a hole right through you. Not that I ever experienced this firsthand, mind you.\u201dBut he said that every so often while he was president, Mr. McCain would come to the White House to \u201cjust sit and talk\u201d about their disagreements. \u201cWe never doubted the other man\u2019s sincerity or the other man\u2019s patriotism, or that when all was said and done, we were on the same team,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cWe never doubted we were on the same team.\u201dMr. Bush, who refused to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, was more oblique in his talk than Mr. Obama, but his description of his onetime rival still struck many in the audience as a contrast to the current president. \u201cPerhaps above all, John detested the abuse of power,\u201d Mr. Bush said. \u201cHe could not abide bigots and swaggering despots. There was something deep inside him that made him stand up for the little guy \u2014 to speak for forgotten people in forgotten places.\u201dMr. Bush defeated Mr. McCain for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 after an acrid campaign, and the two clashed regularly over the next eight years, perhaps most notably over the issue of torture. Mr. McCain forced Mr. Bush to accept legislation intended to ban the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods.But when the war in Iraq went badly and Mr. Bush was abandoned by virtually everyone, Mr. McCain stuck with him and supported a surge of troops and strategy shift that helped turn the war around.Mr. Bush acknowledged their tense history but said it eased after he left office. \u201cIn recent years, we sometimes talked of that intense period like football players remembering a big game,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the process, rivalry melted away. In the end, I got to enjoy one of life\u2019s great gifts: the friendship of John McCain. And I will miss him.\u201dMr. McCain\u2019s flag-draped coffin was taken by motorcade on Saturday morning from Capitol Hill to the cathedral, stopping along the way at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, where Cindy McCain laid a wreath in honor of her husband, whose five and a half years of captivity during that war vaulted him to national prominence.At the cathedral, the coffin was brought into the vast chamber and a bourdon bell tolled. The United States Naval Academy Glee Club and Navy Band Brass Ensemble performed music that included the Navy Hymn, \u201cMy Country, \u2019Tis of Thee,\u201d \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d and \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201dCindy McCain sat bereft but remarkably composed throughout before finally weeping and leaning on her son Jack\u2019s shoulder during Ren\u00e9e Fleming\u2019s rendition of \u201cDanny Boy.\u201d Roberta McCain, the senator\u2019s 106-year-old mother, was also on hand, quietly grieving.At Mr. McCain\u2019s request, former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent Democrat from Connecticut, and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger also spoke. Mr. McCain said earlier this year that he wished he had picked Mr. Lieberman as his running mate in 2008 instead of Sarah Palin, who was not invited to Saturday\u2019s service.The senator\u2019s son Jimmy McCain, wearing his military uniform, read \u201cRequiem,\u201d by Robert Louis Stevenson, the same verses the senator used to end his most recent book. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina; former Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire; and Sidney McCain, another daughter, all read from Scripture.The honorary pallbearers were a who\u2019s who of the senator\u2019s life and across-the-aisle friendships, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, the actor Warren Beatty and a bevy of current and former senators, advisers, fund-raisers and friends. A prominent Russian dissident, Vladimir Kara-Murza, was also included, underscoring the senator\u2019s longstanding opposition to the authoritarian government of President Vladimir V. Putin.The senator\u2019s remains will be interred on Sunday at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery, next to his lifelong friend and 1958 academy classmate, Adm. Charles R. Larson.\u201cHome is the sailor,\u201d Stevenson wrote, \u201chome from the sea.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the friend and classmate by whom Senator John McCain will be buried. He was Adm. Charles R. Larson, not Lawson. It also misquoted a line from Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s poem \u201cRequiem.\u201d It is \u201cHome is the sailor, home from the sea,\u201d not \u201cHere is the sailor, home from the sea.\u201dReporting was contributed by Katie Rogers, Emily Cochrane, Catie Edmondson and Emily Baumgaertner.Follow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hackers Went After a Now-Disgraced G.O.P. Fund-Raiser. Now He Is After Them.", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOf all the scandals swirling around the Trump White House, the Republican fund-raiser Elliott Broidy is in a category of his own.Mr. Broidy, though, is not going quietly. His lawyers said this week that, after more than 80 subpoenas and months of forensic analysis, they had managed to identify as many as 1,200 other individuals targeted by the same cybercriminals.The list of names the lawyers compiled, they argue, will bolster Mr. Broidy\u2019s case that the rulers of Qatar \u2014 the tiny Persian Gulf emirate that is a nemesis of the U.A.E.\u2014 had targeted him for his advocacy against them.Many of the other targets are well-known enemies of Qatar: senior officials of the U.A.E. and also of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Syria; American, British and Dutch commentators known for their criticism of Qatar; and two former employees of a Washington public affairs firm with U.A.E. ties.Others on the list, though, have no obvious appeal as targets for Qatar, including several Syrian Americans, activists on multiple sides of the Syrian conflict, a former official of the Central Intelligence Agency and, incongruously, a handful of Bollywood actresses.Before the scandals, Mr. Broidy served as vice chairman of the Republican finance committee and enjoyed extensive access to President Trump and his White House.Mr. Broidy, his wife, and some other associates all received similar phishing emails trying to trick recipients into clicking a link to a bogus website and typing a password.The response was 11,000 pages of \u201cgibberish,\u201d said Lee Wolosky, a lawyer for Mr. Broidy, so \u201cwe knew we were dealing with a serious player.\u201dThose 11,000 pages contained computer code setting up thousands of bogus web pages intended to trap at least 1,200 targets, and the code for each web page contained the email address of its intended victim. Although it was unclear which targets fell for the trick, the hackers sent repeated emails to those who did not.Lawyers for Mr. Broidy argued in court filings that the hackers who had stolen his emails almost always hid their location, but at one point they appeared briefly to have operated from a telecommunications network in Qatar. The government of Qatar has said it was not responsible.Jassim Bin Mansour Al-Thani, media attach\u00e9 for the Qatar Embassy in Washington, said Thursday in a statement that the assertions of Mr. Broidy\u2019s lawyers were \u201cweak supposition and conjecture.\u201dNow the new list of targets that the lawyers say they have identified adds other suggestive details to the claim.At least two of the targets were American former employees of the Glover Park Group, a Washington public affairs firm that has worked for the U.A.E.Several other targets were outspoken critics of Qatar, including the American Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, the British-based commentator Amjad Taha Yassin and the former Dutch intelligence analyst Ronald Sandee.Others, however, were not obvious antagonists of Qatar. Another, Kristin Wood, is a former official of the C.I.A. who is now an adviser to a private security company that is part of DynCorp, which had worked for the U.A.E. But there is no indication she was involved in that work or any other project that might have drawn Qatar\u2019s interest. It is possible that hackers were hired to carry out many attacks for multiple clients.The Bollywood targets \u2014 including the stars Aishwarya Devan, Anushka Sharma, Meghanna Raj and Nikki Galrani \u2014 suggest the hackers may have been fans, the lawyers said. \u201cMy guess is this was a frolic of the hackers,\u201d Mr. Wolosky said.Whatever the outcome in the courts, Mr. Wolosky argued, \u201cwe have evidence that establishes in the court of public opinion what really happened.\u201dAdam Goldman contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amos Rex Museum Is Helsinki\u2019s New Homegrown Star", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHELSINKI, Finland \u2014 The novelist Meg Wolitzer once wrote that Helsinki is \u201ca place no one ever thinks about unless they\u2019re listening to Sibelius, or lying on the hot, wet slats of a sauna, or eating a bowl of reindeer.\u201d The city leadership here is keen to add something new to that list: fine art.The weeklong series of parties and special events around the official Aug. 30 opening drew some 10,000 visitors, including the national art cognoscenti and scores of international journalists, making it one of the most eventful cultural happenings in the Finnish capital in years. \u201cIt\u2019s what we hoped for but it\u2019s more than we dared to expect,\u201d said the museum\u2019s director, Kai Kartio. \u201cSince the opening, we\u2019ve had endless lines.\u201dAfter the five-year controversy dissipated, Mayor Jan Vapaavuori of Helsinki said, everyone took a step back to reconsider the city\u2019s cultural priorities.\u201cWhat the Guggenheim process led to was a quite serious reflection among all important art players in the city, where they were forced to assess their own place and role in today\u2019s world,\u201d Mayor Vapaavuori said in an interview. \u201cThe positive side of the discussion is that we have a more comprehensive understanding of what culture and art does for the city. It could be that without the Guggenheim discussion we would not be that far along.\u201dIn many ways, Amos Rex vindicates the city\u2019s decision to turn down the Guggenheim project, and instead champion a homegrown Finnish institution. The new contemporary art museum is funded by private money, whereas the Guggenheim was designed as a public-private partnership, which some artists feared would sap funding for local arts initiatives.Mr. Kartio, who said he would have welcomed the Guggenheim, notes that planning for Amos Rex was already underway when the Guggenheim project fell apart. However, he added, \u201cThe timing was fortunate for us because of course politically, internally in Finland, we were compared to Guggenheim all the time. Since this was completely privately financed and homegrown, people were very fond of us, especially the people who weren\u2019t in favor of the Guggenheim.\u201dThe money to build the new museum came from a foundation established by the museum\u2019s Finnish founder, Amos Anderson, a newspaper publisher and a patron of the arts, who died in 1961 and earmarked his fortune for the building of the Amos Anderson Art Museum. Four years after he died, the museum opened in his own home in Helsinki with a collection of mostly Finnish and other European art.Seeking to build a new larger home, Amos Anderson museum and its officials chose the Lasipalatsi, or glass palace, a landmark of Finnish functionalist architecture that houses an entertainment and shopping center with an Art Deco cinema called Bio Rex.Designed by architecture students in 1936 as a temporary site for the Olympics (scheduled to take place in Helsinki in 1940 but postponed until 1952 because of World War II), the Lasipalatsi was supposed to be torn down afterward, but remained, and became a cherished national landmark.The private Amos Rex Foundation formed a real estate company with the city of Helsinki to jointly own the old entertainment complex, and to build a new museum, which it owns independently. The foundation leases the land on which both buildings sit from the city.To build the museum while preserving the existing building, the architects came up with an ingenious idea to excavate the central plaza and create 24,000 square feet of exhibition space. Below the exhibition halls, two stories down, are archive and storage rooms.Amos Rex, which derives its name from the museum\u2019s founder and the cinema, has helped create a kind of \u201cmuseum mile\u201d that joins up with the three of the city\u2019s nearby art institutions \u2014 Kiasma Contemporary Art Museum, the Helsinki Art Museum and Kunsthalle Helsinki. \u201cIt\u2019s one big cluster, and we bind it together in a way, and we all support each other,\u201d Mr. Kartio said.For its first exhibition, Mr. Kartio highlighted the international curatorial ambitions of the museum by choosing the Japan-based art collective teamLab. For \u201cMassless,\u201d its digitally based exhibition, teamLab has blacked out the walls of four gallery spaces in the subterranean museum, using immersive and interactive installations.

They described the United Nations program\u2019s shortcomings as a symbol of a broken promise.Some observers say the fund\u2019s funding shortfall and bureaucratic malaise have dimmed expectations for the talks in Poland, which were already bound to be difficult.\u201cCertainly, the richer countries should bear more of the burden in the G.C.F. because they have more means and more at stake,\u201d said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, referring to the fund by its initials. \u201cRicher countries also have benefited from wealth accumulated over decades when climate issues were not at the forefront.\u201dMs. Raman said that while she still hoped to see other developed nations \u201cstep up\u201d by contributing more to the fund, they had not yet made their exact commitments clear.\u201cWe\u2019re very horrified by the stance taken by the United States, but it\u2019s not the only one,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the developed countries are united around the United States in not making any progress on finance.\u201dBut even critics of the fund worry about the shortfall, saying it poses risks for people in poor regions where governments are either unable or unwilling to spend more on climate mitigation and adaptation.Southeast Asia is a case in point.Of 74 approved Green Climate Fund projects worth $3.5 billion, three are in Southeast Asia and they have a combined value of nearly $156 million, according to data provided by the program. Nineteen others in the program\u2019s pipeline directly target the region and are worth $904 million.Ms. Nacpil said climate finance was important in Southeast Asia partly because so many cities are in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea-level rise and must adapt. And because the number of coal-fired power plants in the region is expected to increase, she added, governments should be encouraged to bend national policies toward investments in renewable energy.Jenty Kirsch-Wood, a climate specialist with the United Nations Development Program, defended the Green Climate Fund by pointing to its benefits in Vietnam, where part of a $30 million grant from the program has funded the distribution of free, storm-resistant housing to people in typhoon-prone coastal areas.\u201cThe Green Climate Fund has revitalized hope for countries like Vietnam that they can meet their Paris agreement targets \u2014 embracing the green energy revolution, but also helping their citizens to adapt to climate change,\u201d Ms. Kirsch-Wood said.\u201cFor its part, G.C.F.\u2019s pipeline of climate projects in developing countries shows that demand for climate finance already exceeds supply,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

The competition attracted 11,000 applicants, from over 1,000 universities and more than 80 countries, to develop new types of trading algorithms. Up for grabs? Potential full-time positions or internships at the hedge fund.This month, 47 finalists from 15 countries met in Singapore for the finals. An all-women team from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology was declared the overall winner, but all of the finalists were given the chance to interview for full-time and internship roles at the fund.As the world has computerized, demand for the computer scientists and engineers who can build the algorithms that run our lives has exploded. The biggest companies want the brightest minds, and that has led to a fierce battle within corporate America, especially between Silicon Valley and Wall Street, for such talent.Other industries \u2014 most notably big tech \u2014 now attract huge numbers of math and science graduates, many of whom were historically lured to hedge funds by big paychecks.WorldQuant\u2019s international contest was born out of this fight and is part of the fund\u2019s broader effort to nurture learning about quantitative finance around the globe. Its Virtual Research Center offers people from around the world a chance to learn about the subject, build financial models and maybe even be considered for jobs at the hedge fund.Igor Tulchinsky, the founder and chief executive of WorldQuant, says highly talented computer scientists, engineers, physicists and mechanics can be found outside the world\u2019s financial centers and prestigious colleges.

{"Headline": "Pinterest Is a Unicorn. It Just Doesn\u2019t Act Like One.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ben Silbermann does not enjoy being interviewed. He isn\u2019t a fan of speaking at tech industry conferences. Nor does he like sitting for glossy magazine portraits. He doesn\u2019t think he should have to explain Pinterest, the web service that allows people to save images to virtual pinboards, to anyone other than those who want to use it.That is the case even in the last couple of years, when Pinterest and Mr. Silbermann, its co-founder and chief executive, could have been shouting the company\u2019s virtues from the rooftops.Its peers, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been drowning in toxic harassment, fake news and Russian disinformation campaigns. Critics have denounced social media-induced anxiety and addiction.Pinterest, by Mr. Silbermann\u2019s design, is the opposite: the web\u2019s last bastion of quaint innocence. Having de-emphasized its social media elements years ago, Pinterest aims to be a safe and happy place for inspiration, self-improvement and salted caramel cookie recipes. It also rejects Silicon Valley\u2019s typical unicorn formula of moving fast, breaking things, chasing growth at all costs and bragging about every victory.But the reserved, slow and steady approach has long frustrated some investors and employees, who believe that it has neutered growth, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with or for the company. Many of those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the company\u2019s private affairs.Matt Novak, a partner at All Blue Capital, said his firm was trying to sell its stake in Pinterest, which the firm acquired on the secondary market, because it had not lived up to its potential.\u201cIf they don\u2019t keep up, they very quickly become prehistoric,\u201d said Mr. Novak, who would not disclose the size of his firm\u2019s stake in Pinterest.And yet despite Mr. Silbermann\u2019s approach \u2014 or maybe because of it \u2014 the company is worth $12.3 billion and growth is accelerating. In the past week, the company crossed a new milestone \u2014 250 million monthly active users. Those users have pinned 175 billion items on 3 billion virtual pinboards. The company is on track to top $700 million in revenue this year, a 50 percent increase over last year, according to a person familiar with the company. There is wide speculation that it will go public next year.If Pinterest continues its trajectory, it could change the narrative of what it takes to build a successful company in Silicon Valley, a meaningful feat at a time that the start-up world is seeking new templates for leaders. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll serve as another example of wasted potential, or worse, a cautionary tale.\u201cI tell them, \u2018You have to tell your story, especially now,\u201d said Scott Belsky, an entrepreneur who was an early investor in Pinterest.Mr. Belsky said, \u201cHe is so comfortable being misunderstood and underestimated.\u201dWhen Mr. Silberman was asked about his limited public profile in a recent interview, he noted with a hint of exasperation that he was right there, talking to me for this article.\u201cThat\u2019s something!\u201d he said.Tech companies usually reflect the personalities of their founders. Mark Zuckerberg infused Facebook with a \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d hacker mentality. Uber\u2019s founder, Travis Kalanick, pushed a \u201ctoe-steppin\u2019\u201d and \u201chustling\u201d culture at Uber.Mr. Silbermann, 36, grew up in Des Moines in a family of doctors and assumed he\u2019d also go to medical school. But his first encounter with high-speed internet, at Yale in 1999, changed his mind. \u201cYou could find your people there and really explore inside yourself,\u201d he said.He has tried to instill that same thinking at the company. Pinterest values \u201cknitting,\u201d a term its employees use to describe collaboration among groups. \u201cWe believe innovation happens when disciplines knit,\u201d the company\u2019s website says.In the beginning, when Pinterest was desperate to hire engineers as quickly as possible, Mr. Silbermann screened potential hires for their values before even considering their technical skills.Mr. Silbermann is someone who \u201cmeasures twice, cuts once,\u201d said Rick Heitzmann, a managing director at FirstMark Capital and early investor in Pinterest.\u201cPerfectionist doesn\u2019t overstate it,\u201d said Jeff Jordan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Pinterest board member.Pinterest\u2019s offices in San Francisco display the sort of cutesy, self-referential bric-a-brac that\u2019s common at start-ups \u2014 a giant statue of a pushpin made of Legos, a Pinterest surfboard. But Mr. Silbermann\u2019s demeanor is serious and reserved. In conversation, he listens carefully and responds with earnest sincerity, qualifying statements as his own opinion, rather than declaring them as facts.He also doesn\u2019t focus on Pinterest\u2019s image in the business world. Instead, he dedicates an outsize amount of time to meeting with Pinterest users, going on six tours a year and holding weekly lunches at Pinterest\u2019s offices. That\u2019s a meaningful time commitment for the chief executive of a 1,500-person organization.If Pinterest addresses the needs and desires of its users, he said, \u201cthe business will take care of itself.\u201dPinterest has always confounded Silicon Valley insiders. Its first users were not teenagers \u2014 the typical early adopters of digital services \u2014 but Midwestern women. And Mr. Silbermann and his co-founder, Evan Sharp, were not engineers, a prerequisite for many venture capital investors.\u201cFrom the beginning, this company did things differently from how most storybook Silicon Valley companies have operated,\u201d said Jeremy Levine, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, Pinterest\u2019s largest shareholder.The business case was simple and powerful: It was a shopping mall disguised as a mood board that held its users\u2019 aspirations, unearthing pure and unfiltered commercial desire. \u201cYou can draw a direct line from those interests to a commercial opportunity or retail category,\u201d said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at eMarketer.But just as the company began selling ads in 2014, user growth stalled and it wasn\u2019t clear why, according to multiple people familiar with the company. The company disagreed that growth had stalled, arguing that it had \u201cslightly slowed.\u201dExecutives on Pinterest\u2019s \u201cgrowth\u201d team proposed spending $50 million a year to acquire users through marketing, a common tactic for web companies. Other executives argued that the company should court celebrities and pay influencers to share content on Pinterest, similar to YouTube\u2019s premium content program.Mr. Silbermann opposed both, according to people familiar with the decision. He preferred what he called \u201cquality growth.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a natural rate at which you can scale a company that\u2019s healthy,\u201d Mr. Silbermann said. So Pinterest stuck to its knitting.Not everyone was sold on the message. Even by the standards of start-ups, where employee turnover is common, the number of executives leaving Pinterest has been notable in recent years. Since 2015, the company lost people who ran media partnerships, operations, finance, growth, engineering, brand, product, tech partnerships, marketing, corporate development, communications and customer strategy, along with its general counsel and president. Jamie Favazza, a Pinterest spokeswoman, said, \u201cTurnover is natural at high-growth start-ups, but we\u2019ve built a strong team of leaders for the long-term.\u201dSome former executives argue that the company should have hired salespeople faster. Several ex-employees say morale would have been better if Pinterest had taken big swings on hype-worthy cutting-edge tech, like Snap\u2019s camera-embedded sunglasses, introduced in 2016.But those glasses, called Spectacles, became a costly punch line. And unlike most of its money-losing start-up peers, Pinterest, with $1.5 billion in venture backing, has flirted with breaking even in recent quarters, according to the company.What Pinterest\u2019s critics identify as negatives (conservative decision-making, less urgency, squandered opportunities), its supporters cite as positives (bullets dodged, wasted time avoided).As a result, conversations about Pinterest tend to raise fundamental questions about the nature of success in Silicon Valley.\u201cI want to believe that more thoughtful, slower growth is better,\u201d said Tracy Chou, a former Pinterest engineer. \u201cBut the examples that are very visible seem to suggest that really aggressive growth wins, at least in the near term.\u201dInvestors and former executives say that Pinterest has rallied in the past year under a new chief operating officer, Francoise Brougher, and a new head of sales, Jon Kaplan, both formerly of Google.Pinterest\u2019s founders \u201chave this look in their eye like this is working now,\u201d said Mr. Belsky, the early investor.The company has accelerated growth in users, up 27 percent over last year. More than half of all users now come from international markets. That change happened after the company realized it needed to promote local content, not what was popular in the United States, to new users in each region. (British users did not respond to American Crock-Pot recipes, it turns out.)Revenue growth is also picking up, which Mr. Kaplan attributed to having the right measurement data to show brands that ads on Pinterest are effective. The company has hired more salespeople, introduced more ad options and refocused on small- and medium-size advertisers. It is preparing to start selling ads in non-English speaking countries, starting with France.The company is even trying to raise its profile a little bit, hiring a new chief marketing officer and coming up with a new marketing plan to emphasize the service\u2019s benefits. Ms. Brougher said she, like Mr. Silbermann, prefers to under-promise and over-deliver. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t always work well in the tech world,\u201d she said.Mr. Silbermann said, \u201cIn technology, people are very, very fast to declare something a winner or loser, like, \u2018That\u2019ll never work,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019ll take over the world.\u2019 The truth is always somewhere in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Credit Crunch and the Great Recession (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBen Bernanke argues that it was mainly about finance. I have (friendly) questions.Opinion ColumnistOK, this is weird. There\u2019s an economic dispute underway about the causes of the Great Recession \u2014 but that\u2019s not what\u2019s weird. What\u2019s so strange in these days and times is that it is being carried out among well-informed people who actually look at data and argue in good faith. Hey, guys, don\u2019t you know that sort of thing went out a couple of decades ago?This isn\u2019t quite a head-on debate, since Bernanke is mainly focused on the first year or so after Lehman, while both Baker and I are more focused on the multiyear depressed economy that lasted long after the financial disruption ended. (Bernanke\u2019s measures show the same spike and fast recovery as other stress indexes.) But there\u2019s still a clear difference.Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be at the Brookings panel where Bernanke\u2019s paper is discussed. But maybe I can raise the big question I have about his conclusions.What Bernanke does is, as I see it, a kind of reduced-form analysis, identifying factors in the credit markets and using time series to estimate their impact on output. What Baker does, and I largely follow, is more of an accounting-based structural analysis: look at the components of aggregate demand, and ask what their behavior seems to imply about causes. In principle, these approaches should be consistent.My problem with Bernanke\u2019s paper, on a first read, is that I don\u2019t quite see how that consistency can work. Specifically, I have trouble seeing the \u201ctransmission mechanism\u201d \u2014 the way in which the financial shock is supposed to have affected actual spending to the extent necessary to justify a finance-first account of the slump.Let me focus specifically on investment, which is what you\u2019d expect a credit crunch to depress \u2014 and which did indeed plunge in the Great Recession. First, there was the housing bust, which led to a huge decline in residential investment, directly subtracting around 4 points from GDP:So can we attribute this decline to credit conditions? If so, why did residential investment remain depressed five years after credit markets normalized?Meanwhile, there was also a sharp decline in nonresidential, i.e., business investment:But this decline was only about the same size as the decline in the early 2000s slump \u2014 which, admittedly, was partly because of the collapse in telecom spending, but still. And it seems pretty easy to explain simply by the accelerator effect: business investment always plunges when the economy is shrinking, which it was doing mainly because of the housing bust.So when I look at these two key drivers of the Great Recession and subsequent depressed period, I don\u2019t see an obvious role for financial disruption. Bernanke\u2019s VARs tell a different story; but I generally don\u2019t trust VARs unless I can relate them to phenomena we see from other perspectives.Could Bernanke be right while Baker and I are wrong? Of course. But I really, really want to see the transmission mechanism.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Taming of Initial Coin Offerings", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite Collar WatchIf initial coin offerings have been the wild West of the investment world, then the sheriff has just arrived to bring order.Issuers of digital tokens clothed their offerings in the guise of being unregulated cryptocurrencies that do not fall under the federal securities laws. But a recent decision in Federal District Court in Brooklyn may be a first step in putting an end to that view.The Justice Department accused him of conspiracy and securities fraud, based on allegedly false statements he made to attract funding. Mr. Zaslavskiy filed a motion to dismiss the charges. He argued that virtual currencies from REcoin and Diamond were not securities, and that therefore the government did not have jurisdiction over them and could not prosecute him for fraud.Judge Dearie rejected the defense argument that purchases of REcoin and Diamond tokens were not an \u201cinvestment of money\u201d because they were just an exchange of one currency (dollars) for another (digital tokens). The judge also found that statements promoting the offerings had promised profits, with REcoin described as \u201can attractive investment opportunity\u201d that \u201cgrows in value.\u201dThe decision makes it clear that it will be up to a jury to decide whether the digital tokens were investment contracts. But by allowing the case to go forward, Judge Dearie provided the first opinion finding that they could come within the federal securities laws.The message from the TokenLot\u2019s case is that those who want to cater to investors in digital tokens will need to adhere to S.E.C. oversight of their exchanges. Although becoming a broker is costly, a firm that does so could use that status as a marketing tool by telling potential customers that they will be much safer trading through its platform than on unregulated exchanges where assets could be stolen with no recourse for the victims. Like car companies that tout their safety measures under rules they long fought, a properly registered broker can offer much greater client protection that customers may be willing to pay up for.Advertisement"}

If they succeed, it will be a result of an unlikely alliance as they seek common ground amid the rockiest relations between the United States and Canada in decades.\u201cBob and I joke sometimes that we could switch chairs, we know each other\u2019s positions so well,\u201d Ms. Freeland said this month in between meetings with Mr. Lighthizer.Ms. Freeland, who has spent the past several weeks commuting between Canada and Washington, arrived here on Wednesday in a T-shirt that read \u201cKeep Calm and Negotiate Nafta.\u201d As has become the norm, she departed on Thursday night with no deal in hand. After two long days of talks with Mr. Lighthizer, Ms. Freeland said that they were working through \u201ctough issues\u201d and maintained that striking a fair deal for Canada, not an end-of-the-month deadline, was the driving force behind the discussions.But negotiations, tense from the start, have become increasingly strained, with both sides fighting to win concessions and to protect themselves from the appearance of caving politically.To the chagrin of Canadians, Mr. Trump has publicly \u2014 and at times gleefully \u2014 berated their country over its treatment of the United States, particularly its dairy farmers, and rebuked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d after the Group of 7 summit meeting in June. He has slapped steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada, claiming their metal imports threaten the United States\u2019 national security.Mr. Trudeau has openly questioned whether Mr. Trump\u2019s promises are to be believed while Ms. Freeland has angered administration officials by giving speeches lamenting the decline of Democratic values in the West \u2014 a thinly veiled barb at Mr. Trump \u2014 and courting free-trade lawmakers on Capitol Hill.After being promoted to foreign minister last year, Ms. Freeland gave a high-profile speech in Parliament playing up Canada\u2019s prominent role internationally in upholding human rights, multilateralism, democracy and free trade. Ms. Freeland suggested Canada was needed to fill the breach as the United States retreated from its role in world leadership. She echoed that theme again during a June speech in Washington, warning, \u201cIf history tells us one thing, it is that no one nation\u2019s pre-eminence is eternal.\u201dMs. Freeland told reporters that she gave a version of her speech to Mr. Lighthizer, though she did not characterize his response. Administration officials, who had already begun to sour on Ms. Freeland for her courtship of free-trade oriented members of Congress, were taken aback by what was seen as a direct attack on the president, according to people familiar with the matter.Ms. Freeland recently received a standing ovation in Canada for her stance, yet opponents called the speech politically na\u00efve, aimed at scoring points domestically when the country\u2019s economy is on the line given the United States is its biggest trading partner. They also questioned the \u201cprogressive trade agenda\u201d she presented at the outset of the Nafta negotiations, declaring that Canada would be looking for new chapters on women and indigenous rights as well as climate change.\u201cThat was not a smart move. We\u2019d already seen the president withdraw from the Paris climate change accord and the TPP,\u201d said Erin O\u2019Toole, a Conservative foreign affairs critic in Canada, referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cDid we really think he\u2019d bake in carbon pricing into Nafta?\u201dDiscussions between Ms. Freeland and Mr. Lighthizer have been described by those in meetings with them as cordial, yet punctuated with disagreements over Canada\u2019s dairy protections, a Nafta dispute mechanism and Canadian intellectual property.Their negotiating styles differ markedly, those people also say. Mr. Lighthizer, who comes to meetings steeped with a historical understanding of how Canada\u2019s trade barriers came into existence, is blunt, delivering statements with a gravelly voice. Ms. Freeland asks probing questions and lays out her country\u2019s positions with a friendly Canadian lilt.Ms. Freeland is also Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s polar opposite in public. Chatty and outspoken, Ms. Freeland holds numerous briefings with reporters waiting outside the offices of the United States trade representative each day. One morning this month, she handed out Popsicles to the news media. Mr. Lighthizer usually takes the opposite approach, dashing briskly between the offices and the White House, gaze averted.\u201cActually I do enjoy hot weather,\u201d he said outside his office, in a rare demonstration of small talk.Those who have known Mr. Lighthizer for decades say he prefers to do his work behind the scenes.\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s seeking press or looking for some larger opportunity \u2014 his job is to do what he\u2019s doing,\u201d said William E. Brock, who was the United States trade representative under President Ronald Reagan.\u201cI think he probably feels that he can get more done by just working on the task,\u201d said Mr. Brock, a former Republican senator of Tennessee.Ms. Freeland, by contrast, has become a popular public figure in Canada. She is known for bicycling to events and slipping into bathrooms to change out of her cycling gear before taking the podium. Together with her husband, Graham Bowley, a New York Times reporter, she juggles three children with help from a rotation of aunts and is known to have meetings at her house that turn into working dinners.\u201cShe\u2019s super comfortable in her own skin and very genuine always,\u201d says Lawrence Summers, President Barack Obama\u2019s top economic adviser, who was a professor of Ms. Freeland\u2019s at Harvard and has kept in touch ever since.He added, \u201cThe way she is so diametrically opposite to the cultural characteristics of the current U.S. leadership makes her a very strong voice of the international community at the moment.\u201dMs. Freeland, 50, grew up in northern Alberta on a canola farm and in a feminist, Ukrainian housing cooperative.She entered Canadian politics with no experience in brokering international trade deals. The revised version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Canada signed onto was based on negotiations that took place under the previous Conservative government.But Ms. Freeland is credited with salvaging a trade pact with the European Union, which took years to negotiate. In 2016, Ms. Freeland, visibly frustrated, walked out of last-minute talks after a regional parliament in Belgium objected to some of the terms under discussion. Her departure helped galvanize Europe, which relented, and the deal was signed shortly afterward.Mr. Lighthizer, 70, has a far longer history in cutting trade deals. In the 1970s, he worked on trade and tax issues as the chief of staff to Senator Bob Dole on the Finance Committee and later went on to become the deputy trade representative under President Reagan. There he focused on agricultural and industrial issues and in the execution of bilateral trade deals \u2014 an experience that has served him well under Mr. Trump.When he left government, Mr. Lighthizer put his legal expertise to work defending companies in the steel industry, which had been decimated by globalization and the offshoring of manufacturing. He filed lawsuits on behalf of corporations like United States Steel that sought government protection in the face of an onslaught of competition from abroad.During his confirmation hearing in 2017, Mr. Lighthizer said that he subscribed to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade policy.Mr. De Arment said that Mr. Lighthizer\u2019s quiet public persona belies a wry sense of humor and of adventure. In the 1980s, Mr. Lighthizer drove a Ferrari and Porsche, which he would occasionally race. A fitness buff with a gym in the basement of his 200-year-old Georgetown townhouse, he is also known to play pranks on the golf course, drawing laughs by stealthily filling his partner\u2019s bags with golf balls so they suddenly cannot reach their clubs.\u201cWhen he goes into a meeting, nobody is going to know it better than him,\u201d Jim Lighthizer said of his younger brother. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t get outprepared.\u201dJim Lighthizer said that his brother has found a rare kindred trade spirit in Mr. Trump, one who has empowered the trade representative to make the kinds of changes to the balance of international commerce that he always dreamed of. After decades as a Republican \u201cvoice in the wilderness,\u201d he has now embraced his role as a blunt-talking \u201cbulldog\u201d who is empowered to carry out the president\u2019s goals of pressuring countries to lower their trade barriers.Although Mr. Lighthizer does not traffic in the bombast of his boss, he is well schooled in the art of the deal. In the 1980s, during a deadlock in negotiations with Russia over wheat policy, he presented his counterparts with a tally of the costs of traveling to and from Moscow and told them that if a deal could not be reached, he would not return. At that point, they came to terms.That approach could come into play as the United States and Canada struggle to hash out their remaining differences.\u201cIn negotiations, you\u2019ve got to be willing to pull the trigger and blow it up,\u201d said Jim Lighthizer, a former Democrat in the Maryland State Legislature, who communicates almost daily with his brother. \u201cIf he tells you he\u2019s going to do something, expect it to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stable After Attack, Brazilian Candidate May See Political Fortunes Rise", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO \u2014 The front-runner in Brazil\u2019s presidential election, Jair Bolsonaro, was in a serious but stable condition on Friday, recovering from near-fatal stabbing amid predictions that the attack will lift his standing and ratchet up tensions in the most uncertain vote in years.After emergency surgery to repair perforations to his intestines and an abdominal vein at a local hospital, he was transferred on Friday to Albert Einstein Hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo.Mr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, is a deeply polarizing figure, at once the most popular and most reviled candidate in a presidential race that remains splintered just weeks before the Oct. 7 vote.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s injuries could force him to sit out the next week or two in the hospital, but there was widespread agreement on Friday that the stabbing was likely to extend his lead.\u201cThis plays straight into his message: the security issues, the violence and the need to address those issues,\u201d said Monica de Bolle, the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThere are still a lot of undecided voters. It might be that a number of them now say \u2018Bolsonaro is our guy.\u2019\u201d\u201cI prepared myself for a moment like this because you run risks,\u201d he said, before asking, \u201cCould it be that human beings are so bad? I\u2019ve never done anything bad to anyone.\u201dThe attack has already scrambled the strategy of his adversaries, who condemned the violence, canceled campaign events in solidarity and pulled ads that targeted Mr. Bolsonaro.Wall-to-wall coverage of the attack and interviews with two of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s sons, who are also running for office, have already vastly increased his presence on prime time television. This will offset his paltry 15 seconds of free television campaign time and small share of public campaign financing \u2014 both a result of his failure to make alliances with major political parties.A suspect in the attack, Ad\u00e9lio Bispo de Oliveira, was arrested at the scene on Thursday. Police said they believed he may be mentally unstable, but the fact that he belonged to the left-wing PSOL party for seven years until 2014 has fueled speculation among Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s followers of a conspiracy.Many Brazilians view Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, as a kind of Brazilian Trump \u2014 a political outsider who shoots from the hip. He wants to make it easier to own guns, and easier for police to shoot criminals.\u201cJair Bolsonaro is stronger than ever and ready to be elected president of Brazil in the 1st ROUND!\u201d he posted on Twitter.Brazil\u2019s markets rose after the attack, as investors also bet that voters will now rally around a candidate they view as more market-friendly than many of his rivals.But concern grew that competing political camps could step up verbal attacks at a delicate time for Brazil\u2019s democracy, which emerged from two decades of military dictatorship in the mid-1980s.\u201cThe next days should be used by the campaigns, including Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s, to calmly reflect on the what the next steps will be,\u201d M\u00edriam Leit\u00e3o, a columnist for O Globo, cautioned on Friday.The stabbing was just the latest instance of the violence that has roiled Brazilian politics. Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco was killed on March 14 after assailants fired on her car. Days later, buses participating in a campaign caravan with Mr. da Silva were shot at in southern Brazil.\u201cIf the answer is more radicalization, the climate will get worse and more dangerous in the weeks that separate us from the polls,\u201d Ms. Leit\u00e3o wrote.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Kavanaugh\u2019s Supporters and His Accuser Are at an Impasse Over Her Testimony", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The confrontation between Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and his accuser devolved into a polarizing stalemate on Wednesday as Democrats and Republicans advanced competing narratives to convince voters that the other side has been unfair in the Supreme Court confirmation battle.Dr. Blasey\u2019s resistance to appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday seemed to galvanize Republicans and drew wavering Republican senators back into Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s camp. Barring new information or an agreement by Dr. Blasey to testify after all, Judge Kavanaugh may now have enough momentum to be confirmed as early as next week. Republicans set a committee meeting for Wednesday for a possible vote to move the nomination to the floor.Hanging over the impasse were the midterm elections, now less than seven weeks away. Republicans were determined to confirm Judge Kavanaugh before then, knowing that if Democrats managed to win control of the Senate, it would be exponentially harder to approve any nominees sent by Mr. Trump. Conversely, for Democrats, a delay in voting on Judge Kavanaugh would increase the chances of blocking his confirmation and enhance the influence Democrats would have over who eventually fills the vacant seat.In a statement, Lisa J. Banks, a lawyer for Dr. Blasey, said on Wednesday that her client was still willing to work with the Judiciary Committee, but was not convinced that a hearing featuring just her and Judge Kavanaugh would be adequate.\u201cThe committee\u2019s stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding,\u201d Ms. Banks said. \u201cThe rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the committee discovering the truth.\u201dSenator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the committee chairman, said he was flexible on how to handle the questioning of Dr. Blasey but not on the date. He offered to hold a public hearing or to conduct the interview behind closed doors, whichever she preferred. He said she could be questioned by staff members rather than senators, and that he would even send lawyers to California to interview her, if she liked.But he rejected Dr. Blasey\u2019s request that the F.B.I. investigate her charges before any hearing and made clear that he would not postpone it past Monday. \u201cIt would be a disservice to Dr. Ford, Judge Kavanaugh, this committee and the American people to delay this hearing any further,\u201d he wrote in a letter to committee Democrats.[Read what Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s and Dr. Blasey\u2019s supporters are saying about her accusations against him.]The mood at the White House improved on Wednesday, and Mr. Trump referred to Judge Kavanaugh as \u201cJustice Kavanaugh\u201d three times during a seven-minute exchange with reporters. He again avoided directly attacking Dr. Blasey, but said he found her charges hard to believe.\u201cI think it\u2019s a very unfair thing what\u2019s going on,\u201d the president said.Still, he seemed to leave open the possibility that he might have to find another nominee if Dr. Blasey proved persuasive.\u201cLook, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and we\u2019ll have to make a decision,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBut I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.\u201dDemocrats acknowledged that Republicans seemed to have reassured the members of their conference uneasy over the allegation and could confirm Judge Kavanaugh on the strength of their razor-thin 51-to-49 majority.\u201cClearly, the Senate Republicans have decided to tough it out, and they are worried about one constituency at this point,\u201d Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said in an interview. \u201cIt is not the American public; it is the six or seven Senate Republicans who objected last week to a hurry-up hearing. They think they have them back in their corner.\u201dStill, the emergence of Dr. Blasey\u2019s allegation may have cost Republicans the chance of winning support from any of the red-state Democrats they were hoping to enlist. Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat facing a competitive re-election in Missouri, announced Wednesday that she will vote against confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.Ms. McCaskill said she was concerned about the accusation against the judge, but based her decision on campaign finance law. \u201cHe has revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations, which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation,\u201d she said in a statement.Another high school friend, Patrick J. Smyth, came forward on Wednesday, saying he was one of two other people Dr. Blasey identified being elsewhere in the house at the time of the alleged assault. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Smyth said he did not remember anything like it.\u201cI have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d he wrote. He added, \u201cI have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women.\u201dWith the conflict over the confirmation and the supercharged allegations taking place so close to the midterms, both sides were deeply anxious about the possible effect and were eager to blame the other. Republicans argued that they have given Dr. Blasey an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate, either in public or in private, while Democrats said the refusal to call in the F.B.I. showed that the president\u2019s party was not really interested in finding the truth.\u201cThis process has been off the rails for a long time now, but the last 24 hours signal a new low,\u201d said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island. He noted that Dr. Blasey has been harassed and forced to leave her own home since bringing her account to the public. \u201cIn the face of this, Republicans are jamming her into a \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 kangaroo hearing without even the courtesy of proper investigation of her claims. It is a disgrace.\u201d\u201cIt is imperative the Judiciary Committee move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination and a committee vote be taken as soon as possible,\u201d Mr. Graham said in a statement.Three of the Republican senators who had insisted on postponing a committee vote on Judge Kavanaugh originally scheduled for Thursday until hearing from Dr. Blasey have now said she should testify on Monday.\u201cI don\u2019t think she can reject all those options because otherwise there are these very serious allegations hanging over the head of a nominee who has emphatically denied them,\u201d Senator Susan Collins told a radio station in her home state, Maine, on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s just not a good way for us to end. So I think she needs to come forward, and we need to provide her with any protection she may ask for herself and her family.\u201dMs. Collins noted that Dr. Blasey had secured the services of lawyers and should be prepared for testifying. \u201cThere\u2019s more than a week between when she made the allegations and the date of the hearing,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why the hearing shouldn\u2019t go forth.\u201dFollowing the advice of aides, Mr. Trump refrained from any inflammatory comments about the court fight. \u201cIf she shows up, that would be wonderful,\u201d he told reporters before leaving for North Carolina. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t show up, that would be unfortunate.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d really want to see her,\u201d the president said. \u201cI really would want to see what she has to say.\u201dWhile Dr. Blasey and Democrats have called for an F.B.I. investigation before a hearing, it is unlikely the bureau would open a criminal investigation of Judge Kavanaugh because Dr. Blasey\u2019s accusations do not involve a potential federal crime. Sexual assault would typically be a state crime, and the passage of more than three decades would make any prosecution problematic, according to legal experts.Democrats pointed out on Wednesday that the F.B.I. was asked to investigate Anita F. Hill\u2019s sexual harassment claims against Clarence Thomas when he was nominated for the Supreme Court in 1991. But Mr. Grassley said that happened when Ms. Hill\u2019s allegations were still confidential and pointed out that she testified at a hearing only five days after her charges became public, much as Dr. Blasey is being asked to do.The F.B.I. does conduct background checks on Supreme Court nominees and passes along information to officials running the confirmation process, but it does not make judgments on the credibility of the claims, according to Justice Department guidelines.\u201cThe F.B.I.\u2019s role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers,\u201d according to background check guidelines issued in 2010 during the Obama administration.While the F.B.I. should \u201capprise the president or his designated representative\u201d when new information surfaces that raises questions about the suitability of an appointee, \u201cthe F.B.I. does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation.\u201dKatie Benner and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.Follow Peter Baker and Nicholas Fandos on Twitter: @peterbakernyt and @npfandos.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Prayed With Al Sharpton at Breakfast. But Other Democrats Stay Away.", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Rev. Al Sharpton sat at a table at the Loews Regency hotel on Park Avenue one morning last week, his shoulders hunched as he prayed with an unlikely dining companion: Michael D. Cohen.\u201cHe seemed to be resolved that he was facing some time,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said of his second meeting with Mr. Cohen in recent months. \u201cHe even asked me to pray with him, and we did at the table.\u201dBut Mr. Sharpton is one of the few prominent Democrats who have offered Mr. Cohen anything verging on warmth as his life has spiraled downward.When Mr. Cohen was considering pleading guilty, some of his associates assured him that the anti-Trump cavalry would swiftly offer him support. They suggested to him that he would be embraced as an ally in the campaign to take down the president.Mr. Cohen has instead remained isolated and politically toxic. Despite Mr. Cohen\u2019s comments in court that were seen as damaging to Mr. Trump, some Democrats still dismiss him as a Trump lackey who deserves everything that he gets, legally or otherwise.Mr. Sharpton, who has known Mr. Cohen for many years, said Mr. Cohen seemed bewildered about how quickly his life had been upended.\u201cHe seems like a guy who feels like he\u2019s been wronged even though he\u2019s willing to admit that there may have been some things that he should not have done,\u201d Mr. Sharpton said.Mr. Cohen and his adviser, Lanny Davis, declined to be interviewed for this article.Prosecutors have not said whether they are using Mr. Cohen\u2019s guilty plea to expand their investigation further into the Trump Organization.The office of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia inquiry, and the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, which prosecuted Mr. Cohen, have also not indicated whether they are interested in information from him about Mr. Trump\u2019s political, business or personal affairs.Donny Deutsch, the television personality and advertising executive who is a longtime friend of Mr. Cohen, said Mr. Cohen wants to be helpful to prosecutors, although he does not know the parameters of the ongoing investigations.\u201cHe really is looking forward to in every way cooperating going forward,\u201d Mr. Deutsch said. \u201cHe feels like many others do \u2014 betrayed by Trump.\u201dSome people who have worked around Mr. Cohen for years and have felt abused by Mr. Trump are reluctant to call him with well wishes. Others are staying away because they themselves are caught up in the investigation.\u201cMichael is a friend and I feel sorry for his unfortunate circumstances,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former colleague of Mr. Cohen who worked with him to establish the Trump campaign\u2019s early format in 2015.Still, some major Democratic donors said they saw no reason to support Mr. Cohen, a former Democrat.\u201cHe\u2019s not our natural ally, and he\u2019s not a trustworthy person,\u201d said Sarah Kovner, a prominent Democratic donor and activist, a reference to Mr. Cohen\u2019s many denials of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump before his guilty plea. \u201cI hope he\u2019s got the goods. But how could we rush to him, what would we do?\u201dRobert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member, said Mr. Cohen might be telling the truth now, but he added he believes it\u2019s \u201ccompletely self-serving.\u201dOthers said that this approach was misguided.\u201cIf the tables were turned, Republicans would be all over this.\u201dMr. Avenatti, who is considering mounting a campaign to challenge Mr. Trump in 2020, added that he believed \u201cthere is a considerable amount of additional damaging information that is going to come from Michael Cohen.\u201dMr. Sharpton also suggested that there were things Mr. Cohen could offer Mr. Trump\u2019s critics.\u201cI think in an ideal world, whether he\u2019s tainted or not, his information can certainly be used to question the presidency,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Deadly Raid, Pentagon Weighs Withdrawing Almost All Commandos From Niger", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon is considering withdrawing nearly all American commandos from Niger in the wake of a deadly October ambush that killed four United States soldiers.Three Defense Department officials said the plans, if approved by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, would also close military outposts in Tunisia, Cameroon, Libya and Kenya, as well as seven of the eight American elite counterterrorism units operating in Africa.The shift in forces is part of the Pentagon\u2019s defense strategy to focus on threats from China and Russia. But they represent a more severe cut of Special Operations forces in Africa than initially expected, leaving a lasting, robust military presence primarily in Somalia and Nigeria.The proposal does not say that any additional troops would return to Africa even as Special Operations units gradually draw down. Officials said that could reverse progress that has been made against Al Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates, while diminishing alliances across Africa as both Russia and China move to increase their influence.With the reassignment of the counterterrorism teams, American troops could also lose the ability to partner with local forces who act as surrogates to help track and hunt down insurgents. It could also strip those local forces of some of the more advanced American gear they are given when teamed up with American troops.The military\u2019s Special Operations Command is authorized to spend up to $100 million annually to support partner forces around the world under the program that the counterterrorism teams fall under, known as 127e. The command spent $80 million during the 2017 fiscal year to finance 21 of the programs worldwide, Gen. Tony Thomas, the Special Operations commander, told Congress in February.To comply with the proposed change, the United States Africa Command will reassign hundreds of American troops that are currently spread across the continent. That move is expected to be carried out over the next 18 to 36 months, but one Defense Department official said the timeline was likely to be accelerated once the proposal was approved and final.In an interview with The New York Times in July, Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, head of the Africa Command, said other training teams could still rotate in periodically for days or weeks of instruction if the Pentagon reduced its permanent troop presence in Africa.He said those teams could be brought in from National Guard units from California, Indiana, Michigan and other states.\u201cWe won\u2019t walk away and abandon this,\u201d General Waldhauser said.The defense strategy that was unveiled in January, coupled with the deadly attack in Niger, has fast-tracked decisions by Mr. Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to end some of the missions in Africa, military officials have said.General Dunford and Mr. Mattis, a former four-star Marine general, had little experience working directly with commando units when they were younger officers progressing up the chain of command. That has fostered an institutional skepticism about the American military\u2019s increasing reliance on Special Operations Forces in recent years, like those spread across Africa.In the interview, General Waldhauser said that other combatant commands, such as those that cover the Middle East and the Pacific, will face similar changes. But one Defense Department official familiar with the deliberations said the Pentagon\u2019s changes would largely affect the Africa Command, which was created only in 2007, years after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan got underway.Another Defense Department official said the move to close the commando outposts would greatly diminish American influence in Africa and could prove to be shortsighted.The first official, however, said local African forces had become increasingly capable in fighting extremists on their own, and do not need permanent assistance from American troops, at least in some areas. Additionally, that official said, the American commandos could return if necessary.American troops on the ground in Africa have already found their missions scaled back by stringent restrictions placed on Special Operations forces following the Oct. 4 ambush in Niger. Extremists linked to the Islamic State attacked the Green Beret team following its search for a militant near the Mali border, leading to an hourslong gunfight that killed four American soldiers, their translator and four Nigerien troops. A Pentagon investigation found failures at every level of the mission.Since then, American commandos have been refocused strictly to advising and assisting missions from within the walls of their remote bases. During a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Mattis said the Pentagon was changing training requirements for Special Operations teams to be better prepared for missions in Africa.Under the new plans, American forces would most likely work on limited missions in certain countries in Africa for what are called Joint Combined Exchange Training programs. The missions, conducted in nonhostile environments, last 30 to 60 days.Many American commandos in Africa are currently on six-month deployments that seek to forge relationships and provide training that has a lasting impact on local troops.An Africom spokesman referred questions about the plans to the Pentagon.

{"Headline": "Turkey\u2019s Erdogan Changes His Tune, Seeking Support and Cooperation in Germany", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 A year ago, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey told Germans of Turkish origin not to vote for Chancellor Angela Merkel, branding her governing coalition \u201cenemies of Turkey.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Erdogan arrived in Berlin for a three-day state visit, complete with military honors, a state banquet and a lunch with Ms. Merkel.The rapprochement is striking and no coincidence: With Turkey suffering the aftershocks of its worst economic crisis in 15 years, Mr. Erdogan has radically changed tune and toned down his anti-Western rhetoric.\u201cWe want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany just like it used to be,\u201d he said earlier this week.For Germany, the aim of this week\u2019s state visit in Berlin, officials say, is to normalize prickly relations with an important NATO partner on Europe\u2019s southeastern flank. For Turkey, indirectly, one goal is to repair relations with the United States, which imposed sanctions this summer over the continued detention of an American pastor.But the visit has also underscored that, like him or not, Europe has to deal with Mr. Erdogan and the reality of a budding dictator on its border. Turkey\u2019s stability \u2014 both economic and geopolitical \u2014 remains a strategic priority for Germany and Europe.It is a tough pill, and the realities surrounding the divergent trajectories of the two leaders only make it harder to swallow.Fifteen years in power already, Mr. Erdogan, his country\u2019s economic troubles notwithstanding, is secure since his re-election in June to a newly expanded presidency that has given him sultan-like powers. Ms. Merkel, now in her 13th year as chancellor and increasingly weakened at home and abroad, is considered a lame duck.Absent a common understanding on democratic necessities, the relationship is increasingly transactional, even as the two nations remain intimately entwined, as Germany is home to about 3 million people with roots in Turkey.What Mr. Erdogan needs is economic buttressing, and what Ms. Merkel needs is for Turkey to remain economically stable and for the Turkish leader to continue to stem the tide of refugees and migrants that pass through his country from war-torn nations \u2014 be they Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan \u2014 an issue that has become the chancellor\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s economy is teetering. The Turkish lira has come under heavy pressure \u2014 losing nearly 40 percent of its value this year \u2014 amid high inflation and spiraling foreign debt. Turkish private sector debt amounts to more than $200 billion, and as the lira has fallen in value Turkish companies have struggled to meet payments.If he is not quite coming to Germany chastened, with cap in hand, Mr. Erdogan is certainly looking to reassure financial markets, improve business ties and seek political support.Exasperated with Mr. Erdogan\u2019s jibes, and detentions of German citizens and threats to a list of its businesses in Turkey, Germany last summer announced a policy change that curtailed European economic assistance to Turkey.Analysts say the policy has worked, though Turkish officials insist the mood has calmed because German and Turkish elections are now out of the way.\u201cThat\u2019s the language that Erdogan understands \u2014 but you have to be willing to speak it,\u201d said Cem Ozdemir, a prominent Turkish-German lawmaker and member of the Green Party who has been a vocal critic both of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s authoritarian politics and Germany\u2019s longtime caution in countering it.As prime minister, Mr. Erdogan had visited Germany several times in recent years. But the three-day visit this week is his first full-blown state visit as president.The German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, whose role is largely ceremonial, had extended the invitation after Mr. Erdogan won elections in June, prompting a wave of criticism.Ms. Merkel will attempt to make the best of it, but she is conspicuously not attending the state dinner, even as the chancellery insists the snub is not a breach of protocol.Several German lawmakers have said they would boycott proceedings by not attending the banquet as well, and by taking part in protests instead.Bijan Djir-Sarai, the foreign policy speaker of the Free Democrats, said he could not dine with Mr. Erdogan \u201cwhile German citizens sit in Turkish prisons.\u201dThe visit comes after a recent confidence-building trip by the Turkish finance minister, Berat Albayrak \u2014 Mr. Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser \u2014 who sent the right messages about fiscal stability, raising interest rates and curbing expenditure.\u201cVery positive developments may happen soon and that will bring positive outcomes in the economy,\u201d Cemil Ertem, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s chief economic adviser, predicted of the German visits in the daily newspaper Milliyet on Tuesday.Turkish analysts, too, noted that there has been a sudden improvement in German-Turkish relations in the last two months, including the release of Germans imprisoned under Mr. Erdogan\u2019s crackdown against political opponents and critics.Germany\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Adebahr, said another German citizen had been released on Sept. 20, bringing the number of arrested Germans down to five.Turkey\u2019s relations with the United States have worsened over the detention of the American pastor Andrew Brunson and a dozen other Turkish-Americans and consular employees. President Trump announced sanctions against Turkey early this summer, precipitating the plunge of the lira.Though it has taken its own tough line against Turkey, Germany voiced support for Ankara, in part fearful of the effects of a teetering Turkish economy on Europe.Still, \u201cGermany will not and cannot bail out Turkey,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara director for the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a research organization.There is little chance of reinvigorating Turkey\u2019s accession process to European Union membership. That demands unanimity among European Union members and Turkey\u2019s backsliding on democratic standards has gone too far for European leaders to overlook it, he said.But Germany can offer political support at a critical time. \u201cTurkey seeks German support in fixing its relationship with the United States and fixing its economy,\u201d Mr. Unluhisarcikli said.Both sides also have an interest in continuing, or reinforcing, an agreement under which Turkey has curbed the flow of refugees through Turkey into Europe. The arrival of more than one million migrants into Germany since 2015 continues to reverberate politically.Despite its differences with Turkey, Germany has no interest in seeing the Turkish economy slide. German companies have also suffered from the downturn in the Turkish economy and the fall of the lira.\u201cWe have no interest in the situation in Turkey escalating,\u201d said Mr. \u00d6zdemir, the Turkish-German lawmaker, who is attending the banquet with Mr. Erdogan, who, as he put it, would have to \u201csuffer him.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t always choose your guests,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Erdogans and Putins and Trumps of this world are a reality and we have to talk to them.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s important that we get more out of this visit than nice pictures,\u201d he said. \u201cErdogan wants money. We need to be clear what we want: democracy, human rights, press freedom and no interference into the German-Turkish community in Germany.\u201dChristopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

No liberal I know thinks that President Trump should be impeached because he covered up sex with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Those lies are the least of Mr. Trump\u2019s offenses.There is a trove of circumstantial evidence that Russia has a financial and personal hold on Mr. Trump, and that Mr. Trump and the crooks he surrounded himself with colluded with the Russians to attack our democracy to throw the election Mr. Trump\u2019s way. There are many indications that Mr. Trump is using the office of the president for financial gain and to satisfy his Russian overlords, and that he is obstructing justice by very serious means, such as firing the F.B.I. director James Comey.None of this remotely resembles the Clinton impeachment fiasco. Stormy Daniels and campaign finance fraud are to Donald Trump what tax evasion was to Al Capone \u2014 just one foothold that prosecutors can use to lay bare a far more serious criminal operation that is being obscured by criminal means.To the Editor:President Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency set a low standard, preparing the stage for an even lower standard set by our current president. Both administrations defended their president\u2019s reprehensible behavior and lies out of loyalty to their parties, irrespective of the consequences it could have on our civic culture.

{"Headline": "The Lives of the Wealthy Were Enriched Most After Lehman\u2019s Bust", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe impact of the easy money that followed Lehman Brothers\u2019 demise shows that inequality takes off when interest rates are maintained at artificially low levels.This is what happened in the U.K., where the Bank of England followed the Fed\u2019s playbook. A 2012 study by the bank found that quantitative easing had boosted household wealth by more than 600 billion pounds (around $775 billion), but that nearly two-thirds of these gains had gone to the richest 10 percent of households. Another study by S.&P. Capital IQ found that in the aftermath of the crisis the wealthiest decile of UK households had increased their share of financial assets at the expense of the poorest. As the former U.K. financial regulator Adair Turner wrote: \u201cquantitative easing has been good for the rich, and ultra-easy monetary policy thus exacerbates inequality.\u201d Few would disagree with this conclusion.American income inequality has been especially aggravated by the Fed\u2019s interest-rate policy. Most executive pay is linked to share-price performance. When easy money gooses the stock market, as it did in the years after the Lehman bust, corporate chieftains and their extended retinue receive an unearned windfall. Management has also used cheap debt to repurchase shares rather than invest in new plant and equipment, as the Fed intended. Since 2013, companies in the S.&P. 500 Index bought back approximately $2.4 trillion of stock, helping boost share prices, according to Standard & Poor\u2019s. The executive pay bonanza got even bigger.Easy money has particularly aided Wall Street as it recovered from the Lehman shock. The financial sector, including insurance and real estate, soon regained its position as a U.S. economic powerhouse, accounting for nearly a third of G.D.P. growth between 2010 to 2015, up from 14 percent between 1998 and 2008, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Bankers\u2019 bonuses returned with a vengeance \u2014 with the average payout rising to the highest level since 2006, New York state\u2019s comptroller estimates. These bonuses derive largely from fees levied on securities issuance, corporate-finance activity and on assets under management.U.S. corporate-debt levels doubled since 2008, says Goldman Sachs. M.&A. activity soared to a record $2.5 trillion in the first half of 2018, according to Thomson Reuters. AT&T\u2019s recent $85 billion takeover of Time Warner could generate up to $390 million in bank fees, Freeman & Co. has said. Investment-management fees also picked up as the stock market rebounded after 2009. Activists have pushed venerable companies from Procter & Gamble to Campbell Soup to engage in financial engineering to increase shareholder returns, and thereby justify their management fees.Life has been particularly sweet for the private-equity world. The current leveraged-buyout boom has been spurred by some of the cheapest financing in history. Private-equity firms even used low-cost debt to snap up repossessed properties after the housing bust. Blackstone\u2019s residential business, Invitation Homes, has become one of the country\u2019s largest landlords. The buyout barons have never had it so good. Over the past five years, Blackstone founder Stephen Schwarzman is estimated by The Wall Street Journal to have earned more than $3.2 billion in dividends and fund payouts.But consider how easy money has treated the not-so-privileged. The financial crisis hit them hard. As many as 10 million homes were repossessed, according to the St. Louis Fed. Since the middle classes have most of their wealth tied up in their houses, they experienced the greatest proportionate losses in the downturn. New York University economist Edward Wolff estimated that median wealth fell by 47 percent between 2007 and 2010. The surge in unemployment after the financial crisis and a weak jobs market in the subsequent years further contributed to income inequality.Nor did the poor benefit directly from the Fed\u2019s zero interest rates. In fact, interest charges for \u201csubprime\u201d households actually rose as banks tightened lending standards. Because the less well-off maintain a higher proportion of their liquid assets in cash, they have also suffered most from deposit rates being held below the level of inflation.Most workers own financial assets indirectly through their pensions or retirement plans. The decline in long-term rates has pushed up the value of pension liabilities, more than offsetting gains from investments. A pensions crisis, affecting both private and public pension plans, looms on both sides of the Atlantic. Ultralow rates have sounded the death knell for the defined-benefit pensions which enabled the postwar generations to enjoy a secure retirement.Commentators, from the Greek philosopher Aristotle to the French economist Thomas Piketty, have argued that high interest rates aggravate inequality. Yet the ultralow rates of recent years have made it harder for the \u201chave-nots\u201d to accumulate the resources to buy a home or build a nest egg. The \u201chaves\u201d have enjoyed soaring wealth gains. The chief beneficiaries of easy money have been those on Wall Street with access to cheap loans.Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, puts it this way: \u201cNever in the field of monetary policy was so much gained by so few at the expense of so many.\u201d And he\u2019s right.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "25 Years After Oslo Accords, Mideast Peace Seems Remote as Ever", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERICHO, West Bank \u2014 When the Oslo peace accords were signed a quarter-century ago, residents of Jericho celebrated. Their dusty, 11,000-year-old desert city was given autonomy before anywhere else on the West Bank. Palestinians saw it as a foothold for what they trusted would become their own new state.But nothing has turned out as they expected.A shiny new casino, opened with great fanfare in 1998 to entice Israeli gamblers, has been empty since 2000, when they were barred from entering the city. The two-decade-old public hospital finally just got an elevator thanks to a donation from Japan. Perhaps the best-known institution of self-government in town is the jail, widely feared as a dungeon for political prisoners.The brilliant Palestinian future conjured by Oslo has instead become a bitter trap.They called for a comprehensive peace agreement by 1999, which was widely expected to lead to statehood for the Palestinians, and for Israel, realization of the long-held goal of land for peace.Today, however, the Oslo process is moribund, having produced neither a peace agreement nor a Palestinian state. About its only lasting substantive achievement is the Palestinian Authority, established as an interim self-government but still going two decades after its expiration date. The authority has made strides in providing basic services and created jobs for roughly a quarter of the work force, but it has grown increasingly autocratic and has been plagued by accusations of corruption.\u201cThe Oslo agreement was a catastrophe for the Palestinian people,\u201d said Ahmed Daraghmeh, 26, a clerk from Tubas, in the northern West Bank, who was in Jericho to pick up a friend being released from an Israeli jail. \u201cThere is no work. I work for the Palestinian Authority, even though I am against it.\u201dThat the Palestinian Authority has endured and the peace process has collapsed attests to how much Israel has gained. Oslo made the Palestinians responsible for policing themselves in the West Bank, which has led to vast improvements in Israeli security from terrorism in recent years at little cost to Israel. It gave the authority responsibility for providing services like sanitation and hospitals that would otherwise cost Israel, as the occupying power, hundreds of millions of dollars. And it has allowed Israel to postpone, seemingly indefinitely, a broader withdrawal from the West Bank.What the Palestinians have to show for these 25 years, however, is a much more muddled ledger \u2014 and a cautionary tale of how statehood delayed can harden into statehood denied.If Oslo has failed the Palestinians, part of that failure is self-inflicted. An increase in terrorist attacks after Oslo\u2019s signing, followed by the deadly Second Intifada that erupted in 2000, soured many Israelis on peacemaking and eventually led Israel to sideline the process.Palestinians have been left in a depressing limbo: Even as their leadership has consistently failed to establish a coherent, united front for independence, the authority\u2019s bureaucrats have become steadily more effective at administering, and controlling, the lives of West Bank residents.In Israel, the peace camp that backed Oslo has withered from waves of violence. The dominant right wing debates whether merely to manage the occupation in perpetuity or to declare victory and annex much of the West Bank. The number of Israeli settlers there, in what much of the world considers a violation of international law, has more than tripled, to about 400,000. Another 200,000 live in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their future capital.With the Arab world largely uninterested in coming to the Palestinians\u2019 aid, President Trump has been overturning the fundamental axioms of everyone who has tried to broker peace. He boasts of having taken Jerusalem \u201coff the table\u201d by recognizing it as Israel\u2019s capital, is working to minimize the problem of refugees by trying to strip their descendantsof refugee status, and has refused even to endorse the two-state solution, the goal that led the Palestinians to Oslo in the first place.All of which leaves the Palestinians stuck, having pursued the Oslo dream as far as an antechamber only to conclude that the cramped room has no exit.Oslo\u2019s security arrangement \u2014 which gave the Palestinians responsibility for internal security and, in coordination with Israel, fighting terrorism \u2014 undergirds that trap. The deal reduced the need for Israeli soldiers to patrol hostile areas of the West Bank, and protected the authority\u2019s leadership against Hamas.Economically, too, the current arrangement serves Israel\u2019s interests: The authority\u2019s foreign donors subsidize government services on the West Bank, relieving Israel of the obligation. Palestinians exist on Israeli goods, food, fuel and electricity. And rising consumer debt is only cementing the status quo, experts say.\u201cYou have a whole group of Palestinians in the West Bank who are dependent on P.A. jobs for their car payments and their mortgages,\u201d said Nathan Thrall, the director of the Arab-Israeli Project at International Crisis Group, \u201cand they look with real fear at the possibility of Oslo, which is to say the P.A., collapsing.\u201dApportioning blame occupies a cottage industry of analysts, ex-negotiators, lobbyists and partisans.It was a right-wing Israeli extremist who massacred 29 Muslims in Hebron in 1994, setting off a first wave of bombings, and another who assassinated Mr. Rabin in 1995, gravely imperiling Oslo. It was Israel that halted agreed-upon withdrawals from occupied territory, leaving itself in full control of 60 percent of the West Bank. Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from Gaza was so abrupt that critics say it contributed to the Hamas takeover.And Israel has expanded settlements, not only seizing more land but also demoralizing its Palestinian neighbors, said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former American ambassador to Israel. \u201cOn one side of the road is a Palestinian village, and on the other side is a brand-new Israeli town with red-roofed houses, swimming pools, greenery and trees, and on a commanding hill,\u201d he said.But there is also much for the Palestinians to rue in their own decisions and actions.Whatever the justification, Palestinian violence crippled the peace process and led to other lasting setbacks: Israel\u2019s re-invasion of West Bank cities in 2002, when it destroyed much the authority had built, and its construction of a barrier wall that bred resentment, entrenched some land grabs, and \u2014 in achieving the laudable goal of reducing terrorist attacks \u2014 allowed Israelis to largely tune out the Palestinians and the occupation altogether.\u201cWhat they got,\u201d said Mr. Kurtzer, who remembers a sinking feeling evident on the faces of some Palestinians at the 1993 ceremony, \u201cwas poorly negotiated.\u201dOthers question the wisdom of entrusting the P.L.O. with any counterterrorism responsibility early on. \u201cArafat didn\u2019t do enough to stop terror,\u201d said David Hacham, who represented the Israeli defense ministry in the Oslo process. \u201cEither because he couldn\u2019t, or because he didn\u2019t see it as important enough at the time.\u201dThe Israelis also soon realized that the Palestinians were not ready to bend on their principles and even denied Jewish historical claims in Jerusalem. At the Camp David talks in the summer of 2000, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, made what most Israelis considered a generous offer for a final agreement, but the talks collapsed.\u201cThere was really a feeling we were beginning a new chapter in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\u201d Mr. Hacham said of Oslo\u2019s beginnings. But by 2000 it was \u201ca dialogue of the deaf,\u201d he said. \u201cArafat was not ready to cross the Rubicon.\u201dSome Israelis argue that the Palestinians have still not tempered their ideology sufficiently to persuade them that Palestinian statehood need not threaten Israeli identity. \u201cWhat is the reason Netanyahu views a Palestinian state as a security risk?\u201d said Ofer Zalzberg, an analyst at Crisis Group. \u201cHe thinks Palestinians will continue to teach their children that Zionism is unjust and that the state next door should not exist as a state for the Jewish people.\u201dDespite the leadership\u2019s failures, many Palestinians still accept the authority as the least-bad option \u2014 although, given its longevity, nearly equaling the 26 years of pre-Oslo occupation from after the 1967 war until 1993, it is the only reality many of them know.Propped up with around $500 million a year in foreign aid, about 12 percent of its budget, the authority is the biggest Palestinian employer, providing livelihoods for around 150,000 workers and their dependents, roughly a quarter of the population. After the chaos of two uprisings, many credit it with restoring law and order.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the Palestinian Authority, people would be killing each other, left, right and center,\u201d said Tariq Halabi, 18, as he sat with friends in the hardscrabble Jalazoun refugee camp near a memorial to residents killed by Israeli fire.Palestinian Authority officials blame Israel for many of its problems, including the absence of democracy and economic progress. \u201cThe Israeli occupation controls the air we breathe in the West Bank or Gaza,\u201d said Jamal Rajoub, the deputy governor of Jericho. \u201cThe P.A. wants to improve the lives of the people, but everything is tied up with the Israeli occupation. The Palestinians are not free. We cannot open our wings and fly unless we are blind to reality.\u201dAnd the authority\u2019s supporters say that for all its faults, it has improved life for most Palestinians.\u201cMost people, including me, will say that after 25 years of Oslo we have nothing politically,\u201d said Dr. Nasser Anani,the director of Jericho\u2019s public hospital, which was built and equipped mostly with Japanese and American funds. \u201cBut life is better.\u201dGovernment health insurance is $22 a month, dozens of schools have been built, and a driving license can be had in about 10 minutes. \u201cI now have a Palestinian passport,\u201d Dr. Anani said. \u201cEven the United States recognizes it.\u201dBut many revile the authority \u2014 complaining of nepotism and corruption \u2014 as much as they may acknowledge its efficiency here or there.\u201cWhat Oslo created,\u201d said Mr. Tartir of Al-Shabaka, \u201cwas a clear benefit for some Palestinians and the political elite. Everyone else has to live with the consequences, but doesn\u2019t really have a say.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a jungle,\u201d said Ahmed Rashid, 22, an unemployed Jalazoun resident, who said he spent time in an Israeli prison in 2015 for throwing stones, then in the authority\u2019s Jericho jail in 2017 on vague security charges. \u201cThe strong eat the weak.\u201dHalf of Palestinians view the authority as a burden, the new survey found. Those aged 18 to 22 tend to have no trust in the elite and are more supportive of a one-state outcome than a two-state solution, seeing a corrupt and authoritarian state as \u201cnot worth having,\u201d said Khalil Shikaki, the director of the Ramallah-based polling center.\u201cIt\u2019s all lies,\u201d said Firial Qarawil, 53, a nurse from Awarta. \u201cThey promised us a state. Where is the state? All the agreements and all the authorities, including ours, have taken us back more than 60 years.\u201dWith Mr. Abbas and his lieutenants focused on surviving the Trump administration, others outside his circle are urging Palestinians to re-examine their increasingly undemocratic political system \u2014 and to reboot it, if not smash and rebuild it entirely.\u201cUltimately, the question is how many people on the ground are represented in the political system, and today that\u2019s few,\u201d said Sam Bahour, a Ramallah businessman. \u201cWithout giving the youth an opportunity to breathe, politically, they will remain in the streets. And that will lead to something negative.\u201dIn Jericho, resignation, more than anger, seemed the prevailing mood. \u201cWe sleep with our doors open,\u201d Said Hamis Ermalieh, 52, a school bus driver, said as he looked out over the city from his hilltop home. \u201cBut life is difficult.\u201dHis wife, Kamayil, 48, said of the Palestinian Authority, \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing.\u201dIt was twilight, and the neon lights on a Ferris wheel flickered on at an empty amusement park in the distance, twinkling like the Las Vegas that Jericho had never become.Rami Nazzal contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Don\u2019t Bet on It.", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCan seven insurgent State Senate candidates, fresh off Democratic primary victories, be enough of a catalyst for progressive change?They had already been hailed as courageous reformers, the insurgent candidates who dared take on New York State senators laden with money, influence and name recognition. \u201cBy a power of 10,\u201d George Albro, a co-chairman of the New York Progressive Action Network, said of how the Senate challengers\u2019 wins would supercharge progressives\u2019 influence in the state capital.\u201cA radically different Albany,\u201d said Bill Lipton, the state director of the progressive Working Families Party. But how much of that optimism is rhetorical, and how much of it is actually likely to become reality? Let\u2019s break it down.Before anyone can talk about a progressive agenda in Albany, there is one little obstacle: The Democrats need to take back the Senate.Currently, the Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the chamber, with 32 votes to the Democrats\u2019 31. For Democrats to regain leadership of the chamber, defeating once-disloyal Democrats in the primary isn\u2019t enough. They must also flip Republican seats in November\u2019s general election.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has called the Senate primary results \u201cessentially meaningless\u201d in the short-term, comparing them to \u201crearranging deck chairs.\u201dIf Democrats succeed in taking the Senate in November, what comes next is up for debate.For the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, a new majority could usher in long-awaited policies that have been sidelined for years by the Republicans. (The Democrats control the State Assembly by a virtually untouchable majority, and Mr. Cuomo is expected to win re-election as well.)That could mean, finally, the codification of Roe v. Wade. An overhaul of campaign finance laws. An expansion of voting rights.The Assembly has long passed bills to do all those things, only for them to die in the Senate. \u201cI think now it\u2019s maybe going to be the reverse dynamic. The Senate is going to take the lead on voting on a lot of these things,\u201d Mr. Albro said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in the wilderness for 20 years and are champing at the bit to do this.\u201d Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, who had recruited several of the anti-I. D.C. candidates to run, said the ouster of the renegade group\u2019s former members would embolden Democrats to pass legislation that may once have given them pause, for fear of pushing the I.D.C. back toward the Republicans.\u201cThat whole question of, \u2018Is that always a threat that\u2019s looming?\u2019 is for the most part settled now,\u201d Mr. Gianaris said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to walk on eggshells.\u201dIn order to flip swing seats upstate or on Long Island, Democratic candidates there would need to be more moderate than the victorious primary challengers, all but one of whom came from New York City\u2019s liberal bubble, said Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant.\u201cThe progressive pulse doesn\u2019t beat there nearly as strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could move the equilibrium point in the conference a little more to the center.\u201dAnd even if the Democrats do wrest away some Republican districts, then there is the matter of keeping them. Once in the majority, the Democrats would need to calibrate their progressive agenda carefully to avoid alienating those swing voters and losing their majority again, Mr. Gyory said.\u201cOur conference has conservative, liberal and progressive members within the conference. Everyone\u2019s going to have to learn how to work with each other,\u201d said Senator Luis Sep\u00falveda, a Democrat from the Bronx who said he identifies as progressive. \u201cGoverning is the more difficult part. Winning the election is the easier part.\u201dAndrew Gounardes, a Democrat who is hoping to flip a Republican Senate seat in southern Brooklyn, pointed to his own district as a reason that Democratic control might not immediately signal an onslaught of check marks on the progressive wish list.\u201cWe\u2019ll see some more activism and energy in the progressive wing. It\u2019s great for the State Senate finally to be flipping blue,\u201d Mr. Gounardes said of the anti-I.D.C. victories. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this is all of a sudden a radical takeover of Albany by any means.\u201d Kenneth Shapiro, a former counsel to the Democratic majority in the State Assembly, was more blunt in his assessment: \u201cSome of the people coming in right now are people who are not realistic as to what can get done,\u201d he said.Though they have often been spoken of as one progressive bloc, the challengers differ \u2014 sometimes significantly \u2014 on their particular blends of idealism and pragmatism. They all agree they want immediately to strengthen reproductive rights and protection for immigrants. But when it comes to more logistically complicated policies, such as rent regulation or health care reform, some signaled an appetite for slow, steady action, while others cited an electoral mandate to deliver on lofty campaign promises.\u201cFor the folks who may push back on some of the progressive agenda that we\u2019ve been talking about, the response to them is simply that the people are not going to stand for it,\u201d said Zellnor Myrie, who defeated a former I.D.C. member in Brooklyn. \u201cThere are going to be real consequences for not at least having these things discussed.\u201dSome of the primary winners said they would be interested in forming a progressive caucus within the Democratic conference. Others emphasized their desire to assimilate into the larger group.Their differences speak to a reality about the insurgents\u2019 victories: that they may have been propelled more by alliances between Democrats of all stripes, who shared a distaste for Republican-aligned Democrats, than by any surging energy in the more polarizing left-most wing alone.\u201cBut we did agree that it was incredibly important to have real Democrats in these seats,\u201d she said. \u201cThat specific starting point allowed the dialogue to begin.\u201dIn a news conference the day after the primary, he also seemed to downplay the significance of the anti-I.D.C. victories. He rejected the idea of a progressive wave that would knock out his own more moderate brand of politics. And he pointed out that some of the I.D.C. challengers had won the backing of major labor unions that also endorsed him over Ms. Nixon, a fact that had \u201cmade a difference\u201d in their races, he said.It was that union support \u2014\u00a0what he called the \u201cprimary power in politics\u201d \u2014 that had determined the Senate races,\u00a0Mr. Cuomo seemed to suggest, and not any swelling leftist energy.Some who believed that Mr. Cuomo deliberately stifled progressive legislation via the I.D.C. have wondered if he would find new ways to bottleneck policies he opposed.\u201cThe governor, he professes to be as frustrated by the inability of these things to pass as anybody else, \u201c Mr. Gianaris said. \u201cHopefully that\u2019s accurate.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Beyond Performance: Fund-raising Helps Pay the Bills", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen guests in tuxedos and long dresses arrive for the gala opening of the ballet season at the Palais Garnier, there will be much more than dance on the menu.The 1,400 or so attendees, who will have paid 1,500 euros to 5,000 euros (about $1,700 and $5,700) to attend, will make their way into foyers filled with bouquets and garlands where champagne and canap\u00e9s will be served. Later, those with higher-price tickets will sit down to a post-show dinner where each course will have been prepared by a different chef.This year\u2019s main course will be by the chef Tatiana Levha; past culinary contributors included the patissier Pierre Herm\u00e9, and Bertrand Gr\u00e9baut, head chef at Paris\u2019s Michelin-starred Septime. The evening will end with a strobe-lit, DJ-led after-party in the basement rotunda, where the director Sofia Coppola shot a scene from her 2006 \u201cMarie Antoinette.\u201dThe gala, which was started in 2015 by Benjamin Millepied, who was the director of dance at the time, nets around \u20ac1 million for the opera house, according to its organizers, A.R.O.P. (Association pour le Rayonnement de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra de Paris). The association was started in 1980 by a handful of French business leaders.\u201cIn the 1980s, the financing of culture in France was the exclusive domain of the state and local government, so the idea came up that individuals or companies could participate,\u201d said Jean-Yves Kaced, A.R.O.P.\u2019s longstanding director who is also the Paris Opera\u2019s development director.\u201cInitially, philanthropy was used as a stopgap solution: We would ask patrons to contribute because there was a funding shortage somewhere, or because the director of opera wanted to develop a project and couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201dSince then, philanthropy has become a much bigger source of income for the institution, generating some \u20ac18 million a year, Mr. Kaced said, twice what it did six years ago. That\u2019s as the French government, faced with deficit-cutting pressures, has slashed funding for culture. The Paris Opera now gets \u20ac95 million in subsidies, \u20ac10 million less than it did in 2010, or just over 40 percent of its annual budget.A.R.O.P. has benefited from a 2003 law that has made philanthropic donations tax-deductible. The association has also become more proactive and inventive in its fund-raising efforts since the 2014 arrival of the Paris Opera\u2019s director St\u00e9phane Lissner, who has sought private funding for a larger number of projects.Today, A.R.O.P. has 4,700 individual members and 180 corporate members. There are more than 25 fund-raising dinners each year for the corporate donors, at which companies buy tables. Themed donor clubs have also been set up, costing more but offering extra perks, such as the Cercle Berlioz (for lovers of French music), or the Cercle Noverre (for dance aficionados and named after Marie Antoinette\u2019s ballet master). A seat-naming initiative has separately brought in \u20ac650,000, Mr. Kaced said.He acknowledged that some of these new packages and programs were inspired by other major opera houses, such as the Royal Opera House in London, which has a mix of government and private funding, and the Metropolitan Opera in New York. \u201cWe watch what our friends are doing,\u201d he said.The A.R.O.P. board is led by Jean-Laurent Bonnaf\u00e9, the chief executive of BNP Paribas. Another key board member, who is the Paris Opera Ballet\u2019s biggest supporter, is Jean-Luc Petithuguenin, who runs Paprec France SA, a recycling and waste management company.Benefactors such as these can now expect to hobnob regularly with top talent. \u201cFifteen or 20 years ago, it was hard to get opera singers to play the game by meeting donors,\u201d Mr. Kaced said. \u201cNow, when we invite them, they come and attend the patron dinners. They know that the future of their discipline depends on public success but also on donor contributions.\u201dIn its fund-raising efforts, A.R.O.P. gets help from a sister foundation across the Atlantic: the American Friends of the Paris Opera & Ballet, set up in 1984 when the dancer Rudolf Nureyev was director of the Paris Opera Ballet and was starting the company\u2019s first New York tour. Michel David-Weill, an investment banker, was the chairman of the foundation at the time, and today it is overseen by Olivia Tournay Flatto, a New York-based philanthropist.Its board includes prestige names including Lee Radziwill (sister of the former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis), and the avant-garde American stage director Robert Wilson. Depending on the program, the foundation has 70 to 150 members who support specific projects.\u201cWe\u2019re approached a lot more often than we used to be, and there\u2019s a lot more communication with Paris,\u201d said Ms. Flatto, adding that the foundation raised $500,000 to $1.2 million a year for the Paris Opera.The American Friends\u2019 mission is bridge building between the United States and France, so they pick productions with American talents or themes for their fund-raising campaigns, said M\u00e9lite de Foucaud, the executive director.Trips to Paris are then organized for patrons each time, where they see productions, are invited to lavish receptions and get backstage tours and exclusive visits.This year, the foundation is supporting Giacomo Meyerbeer\u2019s \u201cLes Huguenots,\u201d starring the tenor Bryan Hymel of the United States, which is being staged for the first time in a century at the Paris Opera. Past performances they backed include a production of \u201cTristan und Isolde\u201d directed by Peter Sellars, with video projections by Bill Viola.The New York-based foundation\u2019s aim is to reach out to potential donors across the United States: in California, Florida, Chicago and Washington.Back in Paris, A.R.O.P. is busy planning its next big fund-raiser: a gala in May 2019. It will mark the 350th anniversary of the Paris Opera, with commemorative exhibitions on and off the premises, and feature a performance with the star soprano Anna Netrebko.Advertisement"}

Mr. Roth lived in Los Angeles and worked out of United Talent\u2019s offices in Beverly Hills.Visual artists are typically represented by art dealers, but a few who sometimes operate outside the traditional art world, like Julian Schnabel (painter and filmmaker) and Steve McQueen (video artist and filmmaker), have had talent agents.Mr. Roth established United Talent Agency\u2019s fine arts division because, he said, he saw a growing number of artists working across multiple fields and presenting a potentially lucrative opportunity that had been mostly overlooked by talent agencies.

{"Headline": "Trump Speech at U.N.: Scorn for Iran, Praise for Kim", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNITED NATIONS \u2014 President Trump thrust his commitment to an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy back onto the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday. But in his second address on this diplomatic stage, he sounded as eager to claim credit for his achievements after 20 months in office, as he was to disrupt the world order.If Mr. Trump had changed, so had his audience \u2014 no longer as daunted by the insurgent figure who left them slack-jawed last year when he vowed to \u201ccrush loser terrorists,\u201d mocked North Korea\u2019s leader as \u201cRocket Man\u201d and declared that parts of the world \u201care going to hell.\u201dThis time, emissaries from around the world listened quietly as Mr. Trump fulminated at foes like Iran and failing states like Venezuela. They nodded as he singled out an enemy-turned-partner, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, expressing optimism for a diplomatic opening that would have seemed far-fetched even a year ago.But when Mr. Trump declared, \u201cIn less than two years, my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country,\u201d the crowd broke into murmurs and laughter.Briefly disconcerted, the president smiled and said, \u201cI did not expect that reaction, but that\u2019s O.K.\u201dIt was a jarring moment for a leader who usually speaks to adoring crowds at \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies, where his use of superlatives to describe his success draws reliable cheers. Mr. Trump still commands the world stage and he is still capable of upending American foreign policy with a single tweet. But after a year of such bombast, many in the audience at the United Nations treated him almost as a source of levity, not fear.There is also evidence that foreign leaders are more willing to push back. Speaking after Mr. Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France said the Paris climate accord had survived despite America\u2019s decision to pull out. In a not-so-subtle slap at Mr. Trump, he proposed that countries refuse to sign trade deals with those who do not comply with the accord.On Monday, France joined Germany and Britain \u2014 as well as the other signatories, Russia, China, and Iran \u2014 in recommitting to the Iran nuclear accord, repudiated by Mr. Trump in May. They did so even as Mr. Trump urged Europe to isolate Iran and warned of draconian new sanctions that would penalize America\u2019s allies for not cutting off commercial ties with the Iranians.President Hassan Rouhani of Iran criticized Mr. Trump for quitting the agreement and made clear he thought the president\u2019s offer to talk with Iran\u2019s leaders was disingenuous (earlier in the day, Mr. Trump insisted it was the Iranians who had wanted to talk).\u201cIt is ironic that the United States government does not even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks,\u201d Mr. Rouhani said.Mr. Trump, for his part, condemned Iran\u2019s government as a \u201ccorrupt dictatorship\u201d that had looted its people and used the windfall from the nuclear deal to finance what he described as a terrorist campaign that is destabilizing the entire Middle East.\u201cIran\u2019s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,\u201d he declared. \u201cThey do not respect their neighbors or borders, or the sovereign rights of nations.\u201d\u201cNot good,\u201d he added.Shifting gears, Mr. Trump lavished praise on his efforts to shake up the established order, pointing to his withdrawal from trade deals and international organizations, his recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and his meeting last June with Mr. Kim of North Korea, which he said had produced far more than anyone expected.\u201cThe missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNuclear testing has stopped. Some military facilities are already being dismantled. Our hostages have been released.\u201d\u201cI would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cmuch work needs to be done.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s speech showed a president at once fickle and set in his ways. His emphasis on sovereignty was a repeat of the big theme of last year\u2019s General Assembly address, and it showed that on the core principles of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, Mr. Trump is not budging.Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s warm words for Mr. Kim were a 180-degree shift from 2017, when he said the North Korean leader was on a suicidal collision course with the United States. That showed he is open to radical shifts in approach, based on his idiosyncratic view of personal diplomacy and his self-avowed skill as a dealmaker in spotting opportunities.As he did last year, Mr. Trump relied on his senior domestic adviser, Stephen Miller, for much of the speechwriting. Mr. Miller has spearheaded the White House\u2019s immigration policy and its recent decision to cut significantly the number of refugees the United States will accept.The national security adviser, John R. Bolton, an even more ardent proponent than Mr. Trump of the virtues of sovereignty, also injected themes. In his own speech at a conference on Tuesday, Mr. Bolton alluded to the frequent description in Iran of the United States as the \u201cGreat Satan.\u201d\u201cIf you cross us, our allies, or our partners,\u201d Mr. Bolton said, \u201cif you harm our citizens, if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay.\u201dFor presidents, General Assembly speeches are a good guide to the evolution of their thinking. In 2009, his first year in office, Barack Obama delivered a soaring paean to the need for diplomacy and collective action. By 2014, Mr. Obama had cast off some early ambitions and dwelt instead on the threat from the Islamic State \u2014 an enemy Mr. Trump said Tuesday had been \u201cdriven out from the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria.\u201dMr. Trump has not yet faced a major foreign policy crisis, and his speech reflected his good fortune. He still spoke mostly about actions he had taken to unwind the legacy of Mr. Obama.But he also promoted his record in the Middle East, where he said his closer ties to Saudi Arabia had helped the fight against extremism, and to Israel, where he said the United States was no longer \u201cheld hostage to old dogmas, discredited ideologies, and so-called experts who have been proven wrong, over the years, time and time again.\u201dCritics said Mr. Trump\u2019s triumphalist tone provoked the derisive reaction. \u201cIf you\u2019re boastful, and in the most improbable ways, it\u2019s just becomes outlandish,\u201d said Nicholas Burns, a senior diplomat under President George W. Bush. \u201cIt was a sad moment for American leadership.\u201dThe president expressed resentment toward a familiar array of perceived malefactors: allies, who he said did not pay their fair share for military defense; trading partners, who he said exploited unfair agreements that harmed American workers; and oil producers, whom he accused of gouging the United States and other customers.\u201cOPEC and OPEC nations are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNobody should like it.\u201dMr. Trump also assailed countries, like China, that use industrial planning in their economies to undercut competitors on trade. The United States, he said, was systematically renegotiating what he called unfair trade deals and striking back against China\u2019s theft of intellectual property, predatory licensing agreements and the dumping of goods in the American market under President Xi Jinping.\u201cI have great respect and affection for my friend President Xi, but I have made clear that our trade imbalance is just not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s market distortions, and the way they deal, cannot be tolerated.\u201dAmerica\u2019s other great strategic rival, Russia, went unmentioned by Mr. Trump, except for a reference to what he described as Germany\u2019s dependence on Russian energy. That was also Mr. Trump\u2019s only mention of Germany, a staunch ally, though he praised its neighbor, Poland, which has an increasingly autocratic government, for its construction of a pipeline in the Baltic Sea to diversify its energy supply.After his speech, Mr. Trump took credit for a change in Iran\u2019s behavior since he withdrew from the nuclear deal. He claimed, without evidence, that Iran had abandoned its ambitions to build a land bridge to the Mediterranean Sea. At some point, he predicted, the United States and Iran would have \u201cmeaningful negotiations and probably do a deal.\u201d\u201cIran is a much different country today than it was a year ago,\u201d he said before meeting Colombia\u2019s president, Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez. \u201cThey have riots in the street. They have horrible inflation, the worst in the world. Their currency is a disaster. Everything in Iran is failing right now.\u201dAside from Iran, Venezuela drew Mr. Trump\u2019s harshest critique. He described the political tumult roiling the country as a \u201chuman tragedy\u201d and said the United States would impose new sanctions on the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Socialism, he said, had squandered Venezuela\u2019s oil resources and \u201cdriven its people into abject poverty.\u201dMr. Trump spoke of the great potential of the United Nations, but expressed little regard for any other international bodies. The United States, he said, had rightfully exited the Human Rights Council, refused to take part in the Global Compact on Migration or to recognize the authority of the International Criminal Court, which has recently considered investigating the conduct of American troops in Afghanistan.The president singled out India, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Poland as worthy partners: nations that he said had distinctive traditions and cultures, patriotic societies and a fierce commitment to independence.\u201cSovereign and independent nations are the only vehicle where freedom has ever survived, democracy has ever endured or peace has ever prospered,\u201d Mr. Trump declared. \u201cAnd so we must protect our sovereignty and our cherished independence above all.\u201dRick Gladstone and Megan Specia contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and the Koch Brothers Are Working in Concert", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThey disagree about trade, tariffs and immigration, but don\u2019t be fooled. Neither side can get what it really wants without help from the other. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.The Koch network \u2014 which in many respects has eclipsed the official Republican Party \u2014 has nurtured the careers of a host of politicians from Mike Pence to Scott Walker to Mike Pompeo. Major beneficiaries of the Koch network include the Tea Party, the Cato Institute, the National Federation of Independent Business and groups specifically created to act as conservative counterweights to a panoply of liberal interest groups \u2014 for example, the 60 Plus Association and the Center to Protect Patient Rights are conservative alternatives to the AARP. In this context, the public disagreement between Trump and Koch over trade, tariffs and even immigration clearly diminishes in importance.At a July gathering of Koch network donors in Colorado Springs, Charles Koch took a conciliatory approach when speaking specifically about Trump. Asked if Trump was to blame for heightened national divisiveness, Koch replied:We\u2019re all part of it. None of us are perfect. We\u2019ve had divisiveness long before Trump became president, and we\u2019ll have it long after he\u2019s no longer president. I\u2019m into hating the sin, not the sinner. Koch also told donors, \u201cWe\u2019ve made more progress in the past five years than I\u2019ve made in the previous 50.\u201d Trump and the Kochs are not just complementary; they are symbiotic. Trump is essential to marketing the Kochs\u2019 vision. Without him, the Koch agenda would fail. Any realistic assessment of the policy victories achieved by the Kochs shows that the public is firmly opposed to much of what the Kochs have gained from the Trump administration and a pliant Congress \u2014 and the public is opposed to much of what the Kochs still want and have not yet achieved. If public opinion were the guiding force, key elements of the Kochs\u2019 policy goals would be dead in the water. And without Trump\u2019s ethnonationalist appeal, these proposals (for the most part) would not survive either on their merits or on popular support.Put another way, the Charles Koch-Donald Trump collaboration has been productive, despite the distaste of the two men for each other.This war of words, however, is of only peripheral importance.\u201cRecently we have seen a much overhyped supposed split between Koch and the network and the Trump administration around free trade questions,\u201d Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, said by email. \u201cThis is mostly sound and fury with little impact.\u201dIn practice, Skocpol wrote,The Koch network has gotten 85 percent of what it has always wanted out of the Trump presidency so far \u2014 especially the huge government-starving, upward tilted tax cuts, the evisceration of the EPA, weakening of labor regulations and unions, cuts in social spending, and ultraright judges who will eviscerate government regulatory capacities and further weaken liberal forces.In 2016, according to Bruce Cain, a political scientist at Stanford, Trump was crucial to bridging the gap between his followers \u2014 \u201cprotectionist, anti-elite elements that are skeptical of globalization and free trade\u201d \u2014 and free-trade conservatives. Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a political scientist at Columbia, made a parallel point:On most issues the Trump administration, working together with a Republican Congress the Kochs helped to elect, has embraced the vision of the Republican Party that the Kochs have pursued aggressively over the past three decades. That includes implementing massive cuts to taxes, especially on businesses; dismantling the Affordable Care Act; appointing very conservative, free-market oriented judges to the federal judiciary; and efforts to undermine economic and environmental regulations.Hertel-Fernandez noted that trade and immigration are, to be sure, a point of disagreement between the Kochs and the Trump administration, but those are still only two areas where the Kochs have not gotten their way among many other successes.are longtime opponents of campaign disclosure laws. Unlike the parties, their network is constructed chiefly of nonprofit groups that are not required to reveal donors. That makes it almost impossible to tell how much of the money is provided by the Kochs \u2014 among the wealthiest men in the country \u2014 and how much by other donors.For some 50 years, Your Honor, since the Supreme Court in 1958 upheld the right of the NAACP to resist compulsion by the state of Alabama of its membership list, courts have recognized that the First Amendment protects against this sort of compulsion in this sort of circumstance.In practice, the Trump-Koch alliance has been extraordinarily productive, and the alliance is the odds on favorite to win the battle to put Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, where he is likely to cement a conservative majority for the foreseeable future.Despite his liabilities, Trump is determined to press forward in concert with the Kochs on behalf of a besieged Republican Party and an agenda of benefits for corporate entities and the wealthy.In the 2016 Republican primaries, the party\u2019s voters effectively declared that they were fed up with establishment candidates and demanded a red-meat nominee who would cater to \u201cworking white America.\u201dDespite their misgivings, the Kochs \u2014 and Republican politicians like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell \u2014 owe Trump a great deal. And because this is a political form of symbiosis, he owes them just as much. What will this alliance cost each partner? What are the possible consequences of their nonaggression pact? Everything temporary always looks permanent. The only certainty is that the equilibrium is bound to shift left or right. It can\u2019t stay like this forever.An earlier version of this column misstated the size of the tax cut that was enacted by Congress in December; it was $1.5 trillion, not $1.5 billion.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Manafort Is Said to Near Plea Deal With Prosecutors", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Manafort\u2019s trial on the second set of charges is scheduled to get underway on Monday in United States District Court in Washington. A pretrial hearing, which had been postponed this week, is scheduled for Friday.A jury in Northern Virginia convicted Mr. Manafort last month of eight counts of financial fraud based on much of the same evidence that prosecutors planned to present in the second trial. He would also probably face a tougher jury pool in politically liberal Washington than he did in the first trial, held in federal court in Alexandria, Va.Any plea by Mr. Manafort would be another unsettling development for a president who seems increasingly isolated and distrustful of members of his own circle. For months, Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Manafort for confronting Mr. Mueller instead of trying to negotiate a plea deal.The president railed against plea deals in general after Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty last month to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges, implicating Mr. Trump in the cover-up of a potential sex scandal during the 2016 presidential race. Mr. Trump said that trading information on someone else for lesser charges or a lighter sentence \u201calmost ought to be outlawed.\u201dMr. Manafort, who has repeatedly insisted that he would not cooperate with the special counsel, has been reassessing his legal risks after last month\u2019s trial. He was found guilty of eight counts of tax fraud, bank fraud and failure to report a foreign bank account, crimes that legal experts predicted were likely to result in a prison term of six to 12 years. Because of a single holdout, the jury failed to convict Mr. Manafort on 10 other charges. Prosecutors have yet to say whether they want to retry him on those charges.Prosecutors have been approaching the second trial much like the first: with a wealth of documentary evidence and a range of witnesses who worked with Mr. Manafort over the years. In pretrial filings, they listed 2,127 potential exhibits.The defense was hoping to show that the special counsel had targeted Mr. Manafort because he had overseen Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. But Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court for the District of Columbia had already signaled that the argument was out of bounds.Mr. Trump has repeatedly come to Mr. Manafort\u2019s defense. \u201cPaul Manafort is a good man,\u201d he said after the Virginia jury returned its verdict. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t involve me but it\u2019s a very sad thing.\u201d In private discussions with his lawyers, Mr. Trump has raised the option of pardoning Mr. Manafort.It was unclear whether that possibility has figured in Mr. Manafort\u2019s thinking. If he pleads guilty, his lawyers could argue that he deserves a lighter sentence because he has accepted responsibility for his crimes.By Thursday evening, the court hearing set for Friday was rescheduled for later in the morning, possibly to give the lawyers more time to complete an agreement.Whether Mr. Manafort would cooperate has been an issue during his plea negotiations, according to one person familiar with the discussions. He worked for the Trump campaign for five months in 2016 and arguably had deeper contacts with pro-Russian oligarchs and intermediaries than any other campaign adviser did.Prosecutors have previously said one of Mr. Manafort\u2019s close associates in Ukraine had contacts with a Russian intelligence agency. A Russian oligarch closely tied to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also lent Mr. Manafort $10 million that prosecutors have suggested was never repaid.Kenneth P.

It\u2019s a particularly challenging question this year, since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate, we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races, this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.All estimates based on 506 interviewsJust because one candidate leads in all of these different turnout scenarios doesn\u2019t mean much by itself.

{"Headline": "Inside Italy\u2019s Shadow Economy", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWithin a distressed labor market, thousands of low-paid home workers create luxury garments without contracts or insurance.But the woman, who asked not to be named for fear that she could lose her livelihood, receives just \u20ac1 from the factory that employs her for each meter of fabric she completes.\u201cIt takes me about one hour to sew one meter, so about four to five hours to complete an entire coat,\u201d said the woman, who works without a contract, or insurance, and is paid in cash on a monthly basis. \u201cI try to do two coats per day.\u201dThe unregulated work she completes in her apartment is outsourced to her from a local factory that also manufactures outerwear for some of the best-known names in the luxury business, including Louis Vuitton and Fendi. The most she has ever earned, she said, was \u20ac24 for an entire coat.That similar conditions exist in Italy, however, and facilitate the production of some of the most expensive wardrobe items money can buy, may shock those who see the \u201cMade in Italy\u201d label as a byword for sophisticated craftsmanship. Increased pressure from globalization and growing competition at all levels of the market mean that the assumption implicit in the luxury promise \u2014 that part of the value of such a good is that it is made in the best conditions, by highly skilled workers, who are paid fairly \u2014 is at times put under threat.Though they are not exposed to what most people would consider sweatshop conditions, the homeworkers are allotted what might seem close to sweatshop wages. Italy does not have a national minimum wage, but roughly \u20ac5-7 per hour is considered an appropriate standard by many unions and consulting firms. In extremely rare cases, a highly skilled worker can earn as much as \u20ac8-10 an hour. But the homeworkers earn significantly less, regardless of whether they are involved in leatherwork, embroidery or another artisanal task.In Ginosa, another town in Puglia, Maria Colamita, 53, said that a decade ago, when her two children were younger, she had worked from home on wedding dresses produced by local factories, embroidering gowns with pearl paillettes and appliqu\u00e9s for \u20ac1.50 to \u20ac2 per hour. Each gown took 10 to 50 hours to complete, and Ms. Colamita said she worked 16 to 18 hours a day; she was paid only when a garment was complete.\u201cI would only take breaks to take care of my children and my family members \u2014 that was it,\u201d she said, adding that she currently works as a cleaner and earns \u20ac7 per hour. \u201cNow my children have grown up, I can take on a job where I can earn a real wage.\u201dBoth women said they knew at least 15 other seamstresses in their area who produced luxury fashion garments on a piece-rate basis for local factories from their homes. All live in Puglia, the rural heel of Italy\u2019s boot that combines whitewashed fishing villages and crystal clear waters beloved by tourists with one of the country\u2019s biggest manufacturing hubs.Few were willing to risk their livelihoods to tell their tales, because for them the flexibility and opportunity to care for their families while working was worth the meager pay and lack of protections.\u201cI know I am not paid what I deserve, but salaries are very low here in Puglia and ultimately I love what I do,\u201d said another seamstress, from the attic workshop in her apartment. \u201cI have done it all my life and couldn\u2019t do anything else.\u201dAlthough she had a factory job that paid her \u20ac5 per hour, she worked an additional three hours per day off the books from home, largely on high-quality sample garments for Italian designers at roughly \u20ac50 apiece.\u201cWe all accept that this is how it is,\u201d the woman said from her sewing machine, surrounded by cloth rolls and tape measures.Few sectors are as reliant on the country\u2019s manufacturing cachet as the luxury trade, long a linchpin of Italy\u2019s economic growth. It is responsible for 5 percent of Italian gross domestic product, and an estimated 500,000 people were employed directly and indirectly by the luxury goods sector in Italy in 2017, according to data from a report from the University of Bocconi and Altagamma, an Italian luxury trade organization. Those numbers have been bolstered by the rosy fortunes of the global luxury market, expected by Bain & Company to grow by 6 to 8 percent, to \u20ac276 to \u20ac281 billion in 2018, driven in part by the appetite for \u201cMade in Italy\u201d goods from established and emerging markets.But the alleged efforts by some luxury brands and lead suppliers to lower costs without undermining quality have taken a toll on those on those operating at the very bottom of the industry. Just how many are affected is difficult to quantify.However, there is no official data on those operating with irregular contracts, and no one has attempted to quantify the group for decades. In 1973, the economist Sebastiano Brusco estimated that Italy had one million contracted home workers in apparel production, with a roughly equal figure working without contracts. Few comprehensive efforts have been made to examine the numbers since.This New York Times investigation collected evidence of about 60 women in the Puglia region alone working from home without a regular contract in the apparel sector. Tania Toffanin, the author of \u201cFabbriche Invisibili,\u201d a book on the history of home working in Italy, estimated that currently there are 2,000 to 4,000 irregular home workers in apparel production.Plenty of Puglian factory managers stressed they adhered to union regulations, treated workers fairly and paid them a living wage. Many factory owners added that almost all luxury names \u2014 like Gucci, owned by Kering, for example, or Louis Vuitton, owned by LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton \u2014 regularly sent staff to check on working conditions and quality standards.When contacted, LVMH declined to comment for this story. A spokesman for MaxMara emailed the following statement: \u201cMaxMara considers an ethical supply chain a key component of the company\u2019s core values reflected in our business practice.\u201d He added that the company was unaware of specific allegations of its suppliers using home workers, but had started an investigation this week. According to Ms. Lucchetti, the fact that many Italian luxury brands outsource the bulk of manufacturing, rather than use their own factories, has created a status quo where exploitation can easily fester \u2014 especially for those out of union or brand sightlines. A large portion of brands hire a local supplier in a region, who will then negotiate contracts with factories in the area on their behalf.\u201cBrands commission first lead contractors at the head of the supply chain, which then commission to sub-suppliers, which in turn shift part of the production to smaller factories under the pressure of reduced lead time and squeezed prices,\u201d Ms. Lucchetti said. \u201cThat makes it very hard for there to be sufficient transparency or accountability. We know home working exists. But it is so hidden that there will be brands that have no idea orders are being made by irregular workers outside the contracted factories.\u201dHowever, she also called these problems common knowledge, and said, \u201csome brands must know they might be complicit.\u201dInitially, in 2011, Ms. Ventura began legal proceedings against only Euroshoes, saying that consistently late payments, shrinking fee rates for orders and outstanding bills owed to her by that company were making it impossible to maintain a profitable factory and pay her workers a fair wage. A local court ruled in her favor, and ordered Euroshoes to pay the debts, which, after appealing unsuccessfully, the company did.Orders dried up in the wake of those legal proceedings. Eventually, in 2014, Keope went bankrupt. Now, in a second trial, which has stretched on for years without a significant ruling, Ms. Ventura has brought another action against Euroshoes, and Tod\u2019s, which she says had direct knowledge of Euroshoes\u2019 unlawful business practices. (Tod\u2019s has said it played no role in nor had any knowledge of Euroshoes\u2019 contract issues with Keope. A lawyer for Euroshoes declined to comment for this article.)\u201cPart of the problem down here is that employees agree to forgo their rights in order to work,\u201d Mr. Romano said from his office in the town of Casarano, ahead of the next court hearing, scheduled for Sept. 26. He spoke of the \u201cSalento method,\u201d a well-known local phrase that means, essentially: \u201cBe flexible, use your methods, you know how to do it down here.\u201d The region of Salento has a high unemployment rate, which makes its work force vulnerable. And although brands would never officially suggest taking advantage of employees, some factory owners have told Mr. Romano that there is an underlying message to use a range of means, including underpaying employees and paying them to work at home. The area has long been a hub of third-party shoemakers for luxury brands including Gucci, Prada, Salvatore Ferragamo and Tod\u2019s. In 2008, Ms. Ventura entered into an exclusive agreement with Euroshoes to become a sub-supplier of shoe uppers destined for Tod\u2019s. According to Ms. Ventura\u2019s lawsuit, she then became subject to consistently late payments, as well as an unexplained reduction in prices per unit from \u20ac13.48 to \u20ac10.73 per shoe upper from 2009 to 2012.While many local factories cut corners, including having employees work from home, Ms. Ventura said she still paid full salaries and provided national insurance. Because the contract required exclusivity, other potential manufacturing deals with rival brands including Armani and Gucci, which could have balanced the books, could not be made. Production costs were no longer covered, and promises of an increased number of orders from Tod\u2019s via Euroshoes never came, according to the legal papers filed in Ms. Ventura\u2019s case.In 2012, orders from Tod\u2019s via Euroshoes stopped completely, one year after Ms. Ventura first took Euroshoes to court for her unpaid bills. Ms. Ventura said that eventually put Keope on the road to bankruptcy, according to legal documents. Ms. Ventura was declared insolvent in 2014.When asked for comment, a Tod\u2019s spokeswoman said in a statement: \u201cKeope filed a lawsuit against one of our suppliers, Euroshoes, and Tod\u2019s, to recover damages related to the alleged actions or omissions of Euroshoes. Tod\u2019s has nothing to do with the facts alleged in the case and never had a direct commercial relationship with Keope. Keope is a subcontractor of Euroshoes, and Tod\u2019s is completely extraneous to their relationship.\u201dThe statement also said that Tod\u2019s had paid Euroshoes for all the amounts billed in a timely and regular manner, and was not responsible if Euroshoes failed to pay a subcontractor. Tod\u2019s said it insisted all suppliers perform their services in line with the law, and that the same standard be applied to subcontractors. \u201cTod\u2019s reserves the right to defend its reputation against the libelous attempt of Keope to involve it in issues that do not concern Tod\u2019s,\u201d the spokeswoman said.Home working textile jobs that are labor intensive or require skilled handiwork are not new to Italy. But many industry observers believe that the lack of a government-set national minimum wage has made it easier for many home workers to still be paid a pittance.Wages are generally negotiated for workers by union representatives, which vary by sector and by union. According to the Studio Rota Porta, an Italian labor consultancy, the minimum wage in the textile industry should be roughly \u20ac7.08 per hour, lower than those for other sectors including food (\u20ac8.70), construction (\u20ac8) and finance (\u20ac11.51). But workers who aren\u2019t members of unions operate outside the system and are vulnerable to exploitation, a source of frustration for many union representatives.\u201cWe do know about seamstresses working without contracts from home in Puglia, especially those that specialize in sewing appliqu\u00e9, but none of them want to approach us to talk about their conditions, and the subcontracting keeps them largely invisible,\u201d said Pietro Fiorella, a representative of the CGIL, or Italian General Confederation of Labour, the country\u2019s largest national union. Many of them are retired, Mr. Fiorella said, or want the flexibility of part-time work to care for family members or want to supplement their income, and are fearful of losing the additional money. While unemployment rates in Puglia recently dropped to 19.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from nearly 21.5 percent in the same period a year ago, jobs remain difficult to come by.A fellow union representative, Giordano Fumarola, pointed to another reason that garment and textile wages in this stretch of southern Italy have stayed so low for so long: the offshoring of production to Asia and Eastern Europe over the last two decades, which intensified local competition for fewer orders and forced factory owners to drive down prices. In recent years, some luxury companies have started to bring production back to Puglia, Mr. Fumarola said. But he believed that power is still firmly in the hands of the brands, not suppliers already operating on wafer-thin margins. The temptation for factory owners to then use sub-suppliers or home workers, or save money by defrauding their workers or the government, was hard to resist.Add to that a longstanding antipathy for regulation, high instances of irregular unemployment and fragmented systems of employment protection, and the fact that nonstandard employment has been significantly liberalized by successive labor market reforms since the mid-1990s, and the result is further isolation for those working on the margins.A national election in March swept a new populist government to power in Italy, placing power in the hands of two parties \u2014 the Five Star Movement and the League \u2014 and a proposed \u201cdignity decree\u201d aims to limit the prevalence of short-term job contracts and of firms shifting jobs abroad while simplifying some fiscal rules. For now, however, legislation around a minimum wage does not appear to be on the agenda.Indeed, for women like the unnamed seamstress in Santeramo in Colle, working away on yet another coat at her kitchen table, reform of any sort feels a long way off. Not that she really minded. She would be devastated to lose this additional income, she said, and the work allowed her to spend time with her children. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d she said with a sigh, closing her eyes and raising the palms of her hands. \u201cIt is what it is. This is Italy.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When we\u2019ve seen this before \u2014\u00a0in the Mexican peso crisis of 1994, the Thai baht collapse of 1997 and the Russian default of 1998 \u2014 investors had to contend with spillover of trouble from one country to others, dragging down economic growth or causing market stress. ArgentinaOne of South America\u2019s largest economies, Argentina spent much of the last two decades locked out of global markets, in the aftermath of its 2001 financial meltdown.But the 2015 election of President Mauricio Macri was a turning point. He focused on returning the country to the good graces of international investors, by removing restrictions on the flow of capital in and out of the country, and reaching settlements with creditors still owed money since the 2001 collapse.Argentina was able to regain access to the bond market in April 2016, when it raised $16.5 billion from international investors. Once it did, Argentina repeatedly turned to global investors, tempting them with high bond yields and pledges to gradually bring the country\u2019s spending problems under control. TurkeyThe Turkish economy enjoyed a ripping run over the much of the last decade. Growth has averaged roughly 6.8 percent since 2010, beating the world economy\u2019s 3.9 percent and other emerging markets, according to I.M.F. data.But much of that economic pep depended on a debt-fueled bubble. Turkish companies have binged on bonds, much of them denominated in the dollar and the euro. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government has been spending, too, subsidizing big-ticket infrastructure projects. Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly railed against high interest rates as the economy shows signs of slowing. And his growing control over economic policy \u2014 he installed his son-in-law as finance minister \u2014 has investors nervous about his strongman approach. President Trump\u2019s August decision to double the tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports seemed a catalyst for investors to beat a rapid retreat out of the country. Now, with the lira down about 40 percent against the dollar since Mr. Erdogan\u2019s re-election, companies that are earning lira but have to repay debts in dollars are struggling. Bankruptcies of Turkish corporations are expected to rise, and many economists now think Turkey will soon to fall into a recession.South AfricaBut in recent years, it has benefited from an influx of money from foreign investors. Much of that went to the government, which has tried to offset the nation\u2019s stark inequality \u2014 it is one of the world\u2019s most unequal countries \u2014 with large-scale social spending.As a result, the country\u2019s external debts grew to roughly 50 percent of gross domestic product last year, from 37 percent in 2013. Much of that borrowing has been done via markets, making those investments much easier to dump when the going gets rough.RussiaRussia\u2019s problems with global markets are fairly idiosyncratic. Since January 2017, the Trump administration has mostly continued the Obama administration\u2019s policy of imposing sanctions on individuals with ties to the country, citing issues such as aggression in Ukraine, interference in American elections, support for Syria\u2019s Assad regime, the poisoning of a former spy and his daughter with a chemical weapon in England, and trade with North Korea.As global investors factored in the country\u2019s increased isolation from the world economy, the ruble fell 18 percent this year. (Simply put, less integration and trade with Russia mean less demand for rubles, which you need to buy Russian goods.)A weak currency makes imports more expensive. Russian inflation, while low, has picked up, and interest rates are rising, both of which could be a drag on growth. The Russian government plans to increase government spending in an effort to keep the economy grinding ahead. In theory, Russia\u2019s relatively low debt level \u2014 government debt is less than 20 percent of G.D.P. \u2014 allows it plenty of breathing room to spend more on roads, health care and social welfare, as long as it can dig up the money somewhere.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Where does all this stop? No one is sure. It could be that the countries being battered may simply suffer from unique vulnerabilities to market pressure. It\u2019s also possible that other countries will become the next focus for jittery investors eager to avoid losses. But predicting precisely where things will spread isn\u2019t simple. Sure, there are some clues for what to look for. Investors are already looking askance at countries that owe a lot of money in foreign currency, for example. Screening for that kind of vulnerability would have identified Turkey as a potential problem spot. The amount of such hard-currency debt to be paid off, however, is only part of the story. The level of interest rates, the reliance on foreign borrowers, refinancing needs, the size of government deficits and the stockpiles of foreign currency that can be used to push back market pressures all play a role. Perhaps most important, and most difficult to measure, is a country\u2019s credibility with financial markets. If investors believe a country will continue to pay its bondholders in a currency that retains its value, they will likely put up with even the ugliest-looking levels of debt. If that trust starts to fray, look out below. Advertisement"}

If approved, the penalties would fuel an already bitter standoff with Beijing over trade and pressure on North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.Any new American sanctions would be announced by the Treasury Department after governmentwide consultations, including with Congress.Chinese officials have labeled the process \u201ctransformation through education\u201d or \u201ccounter-extremism education.\u201d But they have not acknowledged that large groups of Muslims are being detained.\u201cThe scale of it \u2014 it\u2019s massive,\u201d Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said of the Muslim detention centers in an interview. \u201cIt involves not only intimidating people on political speech, but also a desire to strip people of their identity \u2014 ethnic identity, religious identity \u2014 on a scale that I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve seen in the modern era.\u201d\u201cI hope and pray for my family to be let go and released,\u201d Ms. Hoja said. \u201cBut I know even if that happens, they will still live under constant threat.\u201dFor many years, Chinese officials have talked about the need to suppress what they call terrorism, separatism and religious extremism in Xinjiang. In 2009, ethnic violence began soaring in the region. Security forces carried out mass repression in response, but large-scale construction of the camps, which now hold as many as one million people, did not begin until the arrival of Chen Quanguo, who became party chief of Xinjiang in August 2016, after a stint in the Tibet Autonomous Region.The congressional demand, outlined in an Aug. 28 letter, singles out Mr. Chen among the seven Chinese officials who would be sanctioned.In Washington, officials grappling with the plight of the Uighurs and other Chinese Muslims are doing so in the shadow of the mass murders, rapes and forced displacement of Rohingya Muslims by Burmese military forces that began in Myanmar in August 2017. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighboring Bangladesh and live in squalid camps.Some American officials see the actions of the Chinese government as another form of the genocide that occurred in Myanmar, according to people with knowledge of the continuing discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they have not been authorized to talk publicly about the issue.Sam Brownback, the State Department\u2019s ambassador at large for international religious freedom and former governor of Kansas, supports taking a hard line against the Chinese government on the issue of Xinjiang, they said. Mr. Brownback declined to be interviewed.In a statement to The Times, the State Department said officials \u201care deeply troubled by the Chinese government\u2019s worsening crackdown\u201d on Muslims.\u201cCredible reports indicate that individuals sent by Chinese authorities to detention centers since April 2017 number at least in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions,\u201d the statement said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Utah Group Files Complaint Against Mia Love Over Fund-Raising", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA progressive group in Utah that advocates government transparency and accountability filed a federal complaint against Representative Mia Love, a Republican, on Tuesday over alleged campaign finance violations, escalating the liberal fight against the vulnerable incumbent just seven weeks before November\u2019s midterm elections.Alliance for a Better Utah, a progressive nonprofit, filed the complaint with the Federal Election Commission and sent a detailed letter to the commission\u2019s general counsel and the chief of the public integrity section at the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal division. The letter, which comes after the commission forced Ms. Love to acknowledge that some of her primary funds had been improperly raised, argues that Ms. Love\u2019s \u201cactions are a betrayal of the public trust and of Utah voters,\u201d and \u201cshould be subject to criminal penalties.\u201dIn a statement, Ms. Love\u2019s campaign called the complaint a political ploy.\u201cIt is no surprise that an extremely liberal-leaning organization such as \u2018Alliance for a Better Utah\u2019 is filing a complaint on completely false and desperate charges,\u201d said Sasha Clark, Ms. Love\u2019s campaign communications director.The crux of the allegation against Ms. Love stems from more than $1 million she raised leading up to her re-election campaign this year. Ms. Love did not face a primary challenger because of Utah\u2019s convention nomination rules, but, according to the commission, she raised the money during the primary challenge period, and an additional $372,468 even after she secured the state nomination and knew a primary would not take place.Chase Thomas, the executive director of Alliance for a Better Utah, said Ms. Love should pay back the full sum. Mr. Thomas said filing a complaint was also meant to speed up the investigative process on the matter.\u201cHer response was completely inadequate,\u201d he said.His organization became known around 2013 when a similar campaign finance complaint against state Attorney General John Swallow helped lead to Mr. Swallow\u2019s resignation and eventual arrest (Mr. Swallow was eventually acquitted of all charges).\u201cMia Love has been at this for a while \u2014 she\u2019s gone through multiple campaigns, and she knows what campaign finance laws are out there,\u201d Mr. Thomas said. \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that this was done willfully and knowingly.\u201dFormer F.E.C. commissioners said that even with the progressive alliance\u2019s new complaint against Ms. Love, it is unlikely she will experience additional consequences. The bar is extremely high to prove criminal wrongdoing in campaign finance cases, they said.\u201cIt seems like she\u2019s already acknowledged impropriety and agreed to remove and not keep some of the money, I just don\u2019t see this as something the F.E.C. would spend its resources on,\u201d said Ann Ravel, a Democrat who served as the organization\u2019s commissioner under former President Barack Obama.A Republican counterpart agreed.\u201cThis is going to be pretty tough for them to find anything really against her,\u201d said Bradley Smith, a former head of the commission under former President George W. Bush. \u201cLove\u2019s campaign may have tried to game the system, but if you can game the system \u2014 you game the system.\u201dBut the looming investigation could have political consequences for Ms. Love, who is facing a difficult re-election campaign this year. Her Democratic opponent, Ben McAdams has made \u201cfixing a broken congress\u201d one of his top campaign issues, and the Cook Political Report has rated the race as \u201cLean Republican\u201d instead of \u201cLikely Republican.\u201dWhen news of the F.E.C.\u2019s action against Ms. Love surfaced, Mr. McAdams called a news conference to accuse Ms. Love of \u201cgaming the system\u201d and that such behavior was indicative of a \u201cculture of corruption\u201d in Washington.\u201cBen\u2019s opponent, Rep.

{"Headline": "Paul Manafort Agrees to Cooperate With Special Counsel; Pleads Guilty to Reduced Charges", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Paul Manafort agreed on Friday to tell all he knows to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as part of a plea deal that could shape the final stages of the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.The deal was a surrender by Mr. Manafort, President Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, who had vowed for months to prove his innocence in a case stemming from his work as a political consultant in Ukraine. And it was a decisive triumph for Mr. Mueller, who now has a cooperating witness who was at the center of the Trump campaign during a crucial period in 2016 and has detailed insight into another target of federal prosecutors, the network of lobbyists and influence brokers seeking to help foreign interests in Washington.It is not clear what information Mr. Manafort offered prosecutors in three days of negotiations that led to the plea deal. But in court on Friday, Mr. Manafort agreed to an open-ended arrangement that requires him to answer \u201cfully, truthfully, completely and forthrightly\u201d questions about \u201cany and all matters\u201d the government wants to ask about.The president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, quickly sought to distance Mr. Trump from the plea deal.\u201cOnce again an investigation has concluded with a plea having nothing to do with President Trump or the Trump campaign,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe reason: The president did nothing wrong and Paul Manafort will tell the truth.\u201dMr. Mueller\u2019s investigation has maintained such secrecy that it is impossible to know what puzzle pieces he might still be trying to fill in or what Mr. Manafort\u2019s testimony might mean for Mr. Trump. But at a minimum, Mr. Manafort\u2019s cooperation gives Mr. Mueller additional visibility into some key moments in the campaign and the role of other senior figures.Mr. Manafort was a participant in the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower that had been arranged by a Moscow lawyer who said she was delivering damaging information about Hillary Clinton on the Kremlin\u2019s behalf. His cooperation could help Mr. Mueller establish how much, if anything, the Trump campaign knew about Russia\u2019s efforts to boost Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy.Mr. Manafort, 69, had insisted for a year that he would not help the special counsel\u2019s office. But after being convicted on eight felony counts in a federal court in Virginia last month, and facing a second trial on more felony charges in federal court here, Mr. Manafort was confronted with the very real prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison.Under the agreement announced on Friday, prosecutors replaced a seven-count indictment with one that charged two counts of conspiracy that carry a maximum penalty of 10 years behind bars. No sentencing date has been set for those charges or the ones he was convicted of in Northern Virginia.Mr. Manafort also agreed to surrender most of his once-vast personal fortune including three houses and two apartments \u2014 one in Trump Tower in Manhattan.At the court hearing, Mr. Manafort, who has been in jail since June, appeared weary and subdued. He sat grim-mouthed, eyes cast downward, as Andrew Weissmann, the lead prosecutor on his case, read through what Judge Amy Berman Jackson of United States District Court called the longest recitation of offenses she had ever heard in her courtroom. A full contingent of prosecutors and F.B.I. agents who had worked on Mr. Manafort\u2019s case showed up for the hearing.Kevin Downing, Mr. Manafort\u2019s lead lawyer, said it was a \u201ctough day for Mr. Manafort but he has accepted responsibility\u201d for criminal conduct that dates back \u201cmany years.\u201d He added, \u201cHe wanted to make sure his family was able to remain safe and live a good life.\u201dRoger Stone is the sixth Trump adviser or official charged in the special counsel investigation.In deciding whether to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors, Mr. Manafort weighed the possibility that Mr. Trump would pardon him, according to two people familiar with his situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity. His lawyers and Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyers had shared information about Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry under a joint defense agreement, according to one person close to the president. When weeks passed after his conviction in Northern Virginia with no word of a pardon, Mr. Manafort decided he needed to rethink his legal strategy, another person said.Mr. Trump assailed plea deals after Mr. Cohen, his longtime lawyer, pleaded guilty last month to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges, implicating Mr. Trump in the cover-up of a potential sex scandal during the 2016 presidential race. Mr. Trump said then that trading information on someone else for lesser charges or a lighter sentence \u201calmost ought to be outlawed.\u201dJohn M. Dowd, Mr. Trump\u2019s former lawyer, emailed lawyers representing other clients who have been drawn into Mr. Mueller\u2019s inquiry and said that Mr. Manafort \u201chas no info on president or campaign.\u201dHe also had a business relationship with Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. At one point, Mr. Deripaska lent Mr. Manafort $10 million that prosecutors suggested was never repaid.In July 2016, just before the Republican National Convention when Mr. Manafort was heading the Trump campaign, he sent a message to Mr. Deripaska through Mr. Kilimnik that he was ready to provide \u201cprivate briefings\u201d about the presidential race.Mr. Manafort could also be instrumental in investigations now underway of lobbyists and influence-brokers who worked with him in Ukraine, including Tony Podesta, a prominent Democratic lobbyist; Vin Weber, a former Republican member of Congress; and Gregory Craig, a former White House counsel in the administration of President Barack Obama. Prosecutors said on Friday that officials or employees from Mr. Podesta\u2019s and Mr. Weber\u2019s firms knew about Mr. Manafort\u2019s machinations to disguise his lobbying work.Although they dismissed some charges, the prosecutors used the conspiracy charges to which Mr. Manafort pleaded guilty as umbrella counts, encompassing crimes ranging from money laundering to obstruction of justice. In court, Mr. Weissmann described a decade of criminal activity in which Mr. Manafort enriched himself by promoting the political career of Viktor F. Yanukovych, who was president of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014.He described how Mr. Manafort had illegally operated as the hidden hand behind a multiyear campaign to burnish Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s reputation in the United States and damage the image of his main political opponent, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, Ukraine\u2019s former prime minister. The court documents revealed new details about how Mr. Manafort directed a host of players to lobby under false pretenses, pretending to be independent actors when they were in fact paid agents of Mr. Yanukovych.That secrecy was important because Mr. Manafort not only never reported the lobbying activity to the Justice Department, as required, but he also hid tens of millions of dollars in payments from Ukraine, laundering money through overseas bank accounts and avoiding taxes on $15 million of his income.Among other measures, Mr. Manafort orchestrated a widely panned 2012 report by an American law firm to try to tamp down criticism of the Ukraine government for prosecuting and jailing of Ms. Tymoshenko.Mr. Manafort also coordinated with an unnamed senior Israeli official to undermine support for Ms. Tymoshenko within the Obama administration by suggesting Ms. Tymoshenko was anti-Semitic. \u201cThe Jewish community will take this out on Obama on Election Day if he does nothing,\u201d Mr. Manafort wrote in one communication.He worked with European consultants to plant articles in the United States alleging that Ms. Tymoshenko had orchestrated the murder of a Ukrainian official. He wrote to one colleague that he wanted \u201cto plant some stink on Tymo,\u201d using a nickname for Ms. Tymoshenko, but stressed that there should be \u201cno fingerprints\u201d on the articles.And he waged an \u201call-out campaign\u201d to kill a Senate resolution that would have condemned Ms. Tymoshenko\u2019s treatment by Mr. Yanukovych\u2019s government without ever revealing to the senators that his lobbyists were paid by Ukrainian oligarchs backing Mr. Yanukovych. One consultant working for Mr. Manafort lobbied Mr. Obama directly on Ukraine by accompanying his country\u2019s prime minister to an Oval Office meeting, the prosecutors said.Mr. Manafort also acknowledged that he and Mr. Kilimnik, his Russian associate, tried to persuade two witnesses to lie to federal investigators about the lobbying campaign for Mr. Yanukovych in the United States.Maggie Haberman, Katie Benner and Emily Baumgaertner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Molly Kelly Wins in New Hampshire and Will Face Sununu for Governor\u2019s Seat", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTSMOUTH, N.H. \u2014 Democratic voters in New Hampshire selected Molly Kelly, a former state senator, as their nominee for governor on Tuesday, as female candidates for governorships continue to show their strength in primary elections this year.Backed by the local political establishment \u2014 she was endorsed by both of the state\u2019s United States senators \u2014 Ms. Kelly, 68, defeated Steve Marchand, a former mayor of Portsmouth who ran to her left, according to results compiled by The Associated Press. She held about 65 percent of the vote with more than 90 percent of the ballots counted.But Democrats rejected the bid of another female candidate, Maura Sullivan, a military veteran who had only moved to the state last year. She fell to Chris Pappas, a local party favorite, the A.P. reported, in a key House district that Republicans hope to target in November.Ms. Sullivan, an ex-Marine and former official in the Obama administration, was besieged by criticism during the campaign that she was carpetbagging, and was running in second place Tuesday in a field of 11 candidates, well behind Mr. Pappas. Her failure to gain traction reaffirmed New Hampshire\u2019s reputation as an insular state that is skeptical of outsiders.\u201cAt the end of the day, this election is about who we are and what we can accomplish together,\u201d Mr. Pappas said in a victory speech at his family\u2019s restaurant, the Puritan Backroom, in Manchester. \u201cWe need to say loudly and clearly this fall that we don\u2019t live in Donald Trump\u2019s America.\u201dThe group of candidates running for the seat included Levi Sanders, the son of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who was running well behind Mr. Pappas.In the governor\u2019s race, Ms. Kelly\u2019s path to victory in November is a challenging one: In the general election, she will face the Republican incumbent, Chris Sununu, who is one of the most popular governors in the country.Democrats have rallied around female candidates this year, but Ms. Kelly\u2019s immediate status as an underdog makes it unclear how much support she will receive from the national party heading into the general election.She has also said she would work with the White House if she were elected governor.\u201cI would certainly work with the Trump administration to bring benefit to this state,\u201d she told The Concord Monitor earlier this year.In a brief telephone interview Tuesday, Ms. Kelly did not seem deterred by the challenge she faces in the general election.\u201cDo not underestimate me,\u201d she said. \u201cDo not underestimate the voters here in New Hampshire as well. They are ready for a change.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to run on the issues that are most important to the people of New Hampshire,\u2019\u2019 she added, \u201cand make it clear that there are real differences between Chris Sununu and myself.\u201dMr. Pappas calls himself a progressive, but he does not lean as far left as the label has come to imply during this election cycle. He has said he supports universal health care, but not Medicare for All, now one of the hallmarks of left-wing progressivism.In an interview last month, he said he was in favor of immigration reform, but did not go as far as to call for abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, another item on some progressive agendas. And he declined to say whether he would support Representative Nancy Pelosi for speaker if Democrats win control of the House.\u201cThe leadership should clearly reflect the diversity of the Democratic caucus, and so we\u2019ll sort that all out once the election is over,\u201d he said in the interview.Mr. Pappas and Mr. Edwards will compete to succeed Representative Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, who is retiring. President Trump carried the district, in the Eastern half of the state, by two points in 2016, and Republicans see it as a potential target this fall, though election experts expect the seat to stay in Democratic hands.If Mr. Pappas\u2019s primary victory did not come as a surprise, given the backing he received from the local Democratic establishment, he had to contend with a strong opponent in a race that grew increasingly heated. In the final days before the primary, he and Ms. Sullivan traded barbs, with Mr. Pappas\u2019s campaign attacking Ms. Sullivan for not voting in the 2016 presidential primary and Ms. Sullivan questioning Mr. Pappas\u2019s progressive record.Ms. Sullivan enjoyed some national support, raising nearly $2 million through mid-August, but her tenuous connection to the state \u2014 she had been considered a possible House candidate in Illinois, her home state, before moving here last year \u2014 was viewed as potentially problematic.Also on the ballot was Mr. Sanders, whose father won the 2016 presidential primary here by 22 points but whose campaign seemed to puzzle everyone from his father\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters to his opponents. Though he insisted throughout his campaign that he was his own man, he assumed his father\u2019s loud, sometimes bellicose style and advocated for many of the issues his father had helped popularize, including single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and tuition-free public college. On his website was website a photo of his father, front and center.But his father never endorsed him, and he gained a reputation more as a gadfly \u2014 during campaign forums, he stridently attacked other candidates, including for their positions on health care and campaign finance \u2014 than as a credible candidate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaked Kavanaugh Documents Discuss Abortion and Affirmative Action", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 As a White House lawyer in the Bush administration, Judge Brett Kavanaugh challenged the accuracy of deeming the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision to be \u201csettled law of the land,\u201d according to a secret email obtained by The New York Times.Judge Kavanaugh was considering a draft opinion piece that supporters of one of Mr. Bush\u2019s conservative appeals court nominees hoped they could persuade anti-abortion women to submit under their names. It stated that \u201cit is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\u201dJudge Kavanaugh proposed deleting that line, writing: \u201cI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\u201dHe was presumably referring to then-Justices William Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia, along with Justice Clarence Thomas, conservatives who had dissented in a 1992 case that reaffirmed Roe, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The court now has four conservative justices who may be willing to overturn Roe \u2014 Justices Thomas and John G. Roberts Jr., Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 and if he is confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh could provide the decisive fifth vote.Still, his email stops short of saying whether he personally believed that the abortion rights precedent should be considered a settled legal issue.Democrats have complained about relying on Mr. Bush\u2019s lawyer rather than the National Archives to decide what to provide to the Senate, as one part of a larger fight over how many documents from Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s years in the Bush administration the Senate and public should be able to vet before his confirmation vote.A White House spokesman, Raj Shah, had no immediate comment on the disclosure of the secret files. But late on Wednesday, in the context of some of the documents, he condemned the disclosure of \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d documents as a violation of Senate rules.On Wednesday, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, seemed to allude to the existence of such an email, grilling Judge Kavanaugh about whether his testimony at his May 2006 appeals court hearing that he had not seen or heard anything about the Bush administration\u2019s warrantless surveillance program before its existence leaked the previous December was accurate.\u201cThe fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is a naked racial set-aside,\u201d he wrote, adding that he thought the court\u2019s four conservative justices at the time would probably \u201crealize as much in short order and rule accordingly.\u201dIn that email, Mr. Kavanaugh questions Native Hawaiians as a protected group like Indian tribes. He wrote that prepared testimony \u201cneeds to make clear that any program targeting Native Hawaiians as a group is subject to strict scrutiny and of questionable validity under the Constitution.\u201dAnother document obtained by The Times shed further light on the extent to which Judge Kavanaugh was viewed inside the Bush administration as playing a significant role in trying to get a disputed appeals court nominee, Charles W. Pickering Sr., confirmed.But one of the newly obtained documents shows that when another White House lawyer, Brad Berenson, was invited to a meeting in March 2002 with two top Republican senators, he referred to both Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Francisco as two colleagues who were \u201cmuch more involved\" in that nomination.\u201cI could probably make it, but Brett and Noel have been much more involved in the Pickering fight, which is what I assume this is about,\u201d Mr. Berenson wrote.Noting that rule was arguably more expansive than another part of the regulations the panel had struck down, Judge Kavanaugh wrote that the decision by two of the judges to uphold that rule was \u201cboth strange and dangerous.\u201d Fortunately, he added, the Supreme Court was likely to take a fresh look at the issue and would \u201cnot care\u201d what the lower-court judges thought.\u201cShe should not talk about her views on specific policy or legal issues,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe should say that she has a commitment to follow Supreme Court precedent, that she understands and appreciates the role of a circuit judge, that she will adhere to statutory text, that she has no ideological agenda.\u201dNicholas Fandos contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

After more than a year of tense talks and strained relations between President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, negotiators from both sides came to a resolution just ahead of a midnight deadline set by the White House.The 11th-hour agreement was punctuated by a frenetic Sunday, with Canada\u2019s leaders teleconferencing throughout the day with top American officials in Washington. Mr. Trudeau convened a 10 p.m. cabinet meeting in Ottawa to brief officials on the deal, as Jared Kushner, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest advisers, and Robert E. Lighthizer, the president\u2019s top trade negotiator, hashed out the final details. Mexico\u2019s under secretary of foreign trade, Juan Carlos Baker, was expected to present the texts of the agreement to the Mexican senate just before midnight.In a joint statement, Mr. Lighthizer and Canada\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, said the new deal \u201cwill give our workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses a high-standard trade agreement that will result in freer markets, fairer trade and robust economic growth in our region.\u201dThe trilateral deal will no longer be called Nafta, they said, but will be named the \u201cUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\u201dThe deal represents a win for President Trump, who has derided Nafta for years and threatened to pull the United States from the pact if it was not rewritten in America\u2019s favor. Overhauling trade deals has been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top priorities as president and he has used tariffs and other threats to try and force trading partners to rewrite agreements in America\u2019s favor.The agreement reached on Sunday includes changes to several provisions in Nafta.\u25a0 International settlement dispute: A system that allows Nafta countries to rely on an independent body to resolve disputes will remain intact. Canada had insisted on keeping this provision, known as Chapter 19.\u25a0 Dairy: The United States will be allowed to increase dairy exports into Canada, a win for Mr. Trump, who had insisted on greater access for United States dairy farmers.\u25a0 Autos: Requires a higher percentage of a car to be manufactured in North America to qualify for zero tariffs. For the first time, the deal requires that a percentage of any vehicle that qualifies for zero tariffs must be manufactured in a factory where the average production wage is at least $16 an hour.\u25a0 Tariffs \u2014 Steel and aluminum tariffs remain in place on Canada and Mexico, pending further negotiations. Canada and Mexico secure at least a partial exemption from any potential future American tariffs on automobiles.Canada\u2018s agreement to ease protections on its dairy market will provide access that is greater than what the United States would have gained through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty that Mr. Trump withdrew from last year.The United States also relented on its demands to eliminate an independent tariff dispute settlement system that Canada has said is a red line in negotiations. Keeping that was a major concession for the United States and a change for what was agreed with Mexico.The countries also reached an understanding that would protect Canada from the automobile tariffs that Mr. Trump has routinely threatened, though it is not clear how far those protections would extend. A senior administration official said that if those tariffs were imposed on global imports, Canada and Mexico would receive \u201caccommodations\u201d for their existing car production.But in a sign of how fraught trade relations remain, Canada did not win assurances that Mr. Trump would lift the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed earlier this year. Administration officials said that no changes had been made and that those levies are being addressed on a different track.The agreement builds upon the deal that was reached with Mexico in August. That made updates to provisions surrounding the digital economy, agriculture and labor unions. Most importantly it made alterations to rules governing automobile manufacturing, in an effort to bring more car production back to the United States from Mexico.\u201cIt\u2019s a good day for Canada,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said late Sunday, after convening a meeting with his cabinet. He said he would deliver more details about the agreement on Monday.President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of Mexico said on Friday that Mr. Trudeau had appealed to him to help pave the way for a three-nation deal and that he would insist that a revised Nafta include Canada.While Canada had played down the end-of-the-month deadline, the talks were restarted in earnest this weekend as the United States and Mexico signaled they would release text of their bilateral trade agreement as early as Friday. Mexico wants a deal signed before Dec. 1, when the new Mexican administration takes over, and the Trump administration wants the current, Republican-controlled Congress to vote on the deal quickly, given a potential change in control after the November midterm elections.Industry groups cheered the deal on Sunday night.\u201cManufacturers are extremely encouraged that our call for a trilateral agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico has been answered,\u201d Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.A revised Nafta that includes Canada has a far greater chance of being ratified by Congress but its fate is still somewhat uncertain. Democrats could take control of the House or the Senate in the midterm elections in November and attempt to call for changes to the agreement.\u201cThe crucial test for a new Nafta, or any new trade agreement, is whether it is enforceable, particularly with respect to promises to protect worker rights and the environment,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. \u201cAmericans are sick of hearing speeches about the benefits of new trade agreements when the agreements in place aren\u2019t even enforced and their opportunities don\u2019t materialize.\u201dLawmakers have said they do not expect Congress to vote on the deal until early next year.Catherine Porter contributed reporting from Toronto and Katie Rogers from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats, Eyeing a Majority, Prepare an Investigative Onslaught", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Democrats, increasingly optimistic they will win back control in November, are mining a mountain of stymied oversight requests in preparation for an onslaught of hearings, subpoenas and investigations into nearly every corner of the Trump administration.While they continue to distance themselves from the most extreme recourse \u2014 impeaching President Trump \u2014 senior Democrats who stand to control key House panels could soon oversee inquiries into some of the most precarious threats to Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Those include whether his campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election, if the president obstructed a federal investigation into the matter and what role Mr. Trump played in paying to silence two women in the closing weeks of the campaign who say they had affairs with him.Their scrutiny could also extend beyond Mr. Trump\u2019s legal troubles to include his administration\u2019s remaking of federal regulations and other policies that the party has disagreed with.\u201cI am not looking for headlines,\u201d said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. \u201cI am going to be defending the truth. We want to look at what is happening under this administration because all of us can agree this is not normal.\u201dRepublicans, who have used their majority to systematically block Democratic demands of the administration, privately fear the onslaught could knock Mr. Trump\u2019s government into a defensive posture or worse. In hopes of scaring voters to the polls, they have begun sounding sirens that Democrats will move quickly to impeach Mr. Trump.On Monday, Mr. Trump blasted Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, for bringing charges against two Republican House members ahead of the midterm elections, saying it put their re-election in jeopardy.\u201cTwo easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter.Democrats have been hesitant to loudly advertise the specifics of the potential investigative blitz, convinced that swing voters are more likely to back them based on kitchen-table economic issues like wages, health care and retirement benefits. Loyal Democratic voters do not need to be reminded that a Democratic House will check the power of the president, they argue.\u201cIf this is a referendum on Trump, the way I would want to frame it is not \u2018remove or retain\u2019 but \u2018contain or enable,\u2019\u201d said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, who has already introduced an article of impeachment against the president. \u201cThere are more votes for \u2018contain\u2019 than there are for \u2018remove.\u2019\u201dBut with Mr. Trump\u2019s longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, implicating the president directly in the payoffs to Stephanie Clifford and Karen McDougal, the conviction of Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman in federal court and a rash of indictments and other alleged wrongdoings swirling around House Republicans themselves, the Democrats are increasingly selling themselves as a much-needed antidote to a \u201cculture of corruption\u201d in the capital.Democrats believe the Republicans abused the power of the majority to hobble the Obama administration, deeply damage Hillary Clinton and protect Mr. Trump. That frustration, coupled with what most lawmakers expect to be a wave of Democratic anti-Trump outrage fueling midterm victories, could overwhelm the instincts of more moderate members of the party to chart a different, more bipartisan course than Republicans have.Democrats on the Oversight Committee, typically the House\u2019s most muscular investigative body, have more than 50 subpoena requests that have been denied by committee Republicans since Mr. Trump took office, from the administration of security clearances at the White House to chartered jet travel by cabinet officials to Justice Department documents related to its decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act in court.\u201cIt\u2019s not like we have to go dig them up. They are right there sitting on the desk,\u201d Mr. Cummings said.Party leaders could also choose to impanel a special committee to focus on the Russia matter, freeing the Intelligence Committee to more traditional oversight of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I.\u201cWe have to see more,\u201d Mr. Nadler said of impeachment. \u201cWe need more evidence. We need to see what Mueller comes up with. We may get there.\u201dLess marquee committees \u2014 including the Financial Services, Veterans Affairs, Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees \u2014 would probably carry out their own policy-oriented probes, digging out private communications behind divisive administration decisions and personnel, or even take a run at obtaining Mr. Trump\u2019s long-sought tax returns.Here are all the people connected to President Trump who have been charged with crimes or found to have violated federal ethics rules.Taken together, it would represent a sharp turn from the precipitous drop-off in congressional oversight since President Barack Obama left office. Republicans defend their record, arguing that they have called administration witnesses when appropriate and carried out a yearlong, politically unpopular investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s Russia ties.But in the last year, that effort has been almost entirely overtaken by an investigation of those investigating Mr. Trump at the F.B.I. and Department of Justice. Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the chairman of the Oversight Committee, has yet to issue a single subpoena.Even the most liberal members of the Democratic caucus, including those who have already filed articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, have shaded toward political pragmatism as the levers of power have come into reach. Mr. Sherman said he has set aside time in December to update his article of impeachment with new details about Mr. Cohen and other matters. But in an interview he talked as much about political probabilities as principles.Democrats are quick to reference the impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998 as reason for their caution. Republicans in the House lost seats in the run-up to the 1998 midterm elections, then successfully impeached Mr. Clinton largely along party lines. But they failed to come close to a conviction in the Senate and ultimately boosted Mr. Clinton\u2019s popularity. Democrats fear a similar outcome that could end up strengthening Mr. Trump\u2019s hand in the 2020 presidential election.\u201cWe need to attack the problem of corruption we see in the administration and do our oversight. But Democrats are mindful of the fact that if we want to stay in the majority, we have to show that we are responsibly governing,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in an interview.Sidelining impeachment for now could set the body on a more gradual path toward the same end, liberal Democrats open to impeachment say. With subpoenas and gavels, they say, they could begin to unearth impeachable offenses, and embarrassing public hearings could build a public case against Mr. Trump as they await Mr. Mueller.\u201cI think you need to build a case,\u201d said Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, who has also introduced impeachment articles. \u201cAnd then see where the politics are.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Questions About FIRE, Answered", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byReaders had lots of questions about our recent story about the FIRE movement (financial independence, retire early). Here are some answers. Some were dubious about the whole idea. Some expressed their own desires to exit the rat race. And many readers had practical questions about navigating the thornier issues of personal finance. Here, the story\u2019s subjects answer those questions.\u201cI had several thousand dollars in expenses, then my health insurance kicked in,\u201d she said. Now 73, she is on Medicare.Carl Jensen, a software engineer near Denver who \u201cfired\u201d last year, at first bought coverage from the Affordable Care Act exchange, paying around $700 per month for his family of four. \u201cSo, if you are truly retired with, say, a $1 million portfolio and choosing to live off $25,000 of annual dividends, that is your only taxable income, and you would qualify for very low health insurance premiums,\u201d Mr. Adeney said.For Mr. Jensen, Mr. Adeney and other FIRE parents, the answer involves rethinking modern ideas about higher education and parenting. \u201cI told my children that we\u2019ll find a way to get them to college, but we\u2019re not going to pay for the whole thing,\u201d said Mr. Jensen, who has two young daughters. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m obligated to do that.\u201dMr. Adeney\u2019s strategies for educating his young son include attending a lower-tuition in-state school, encouraging his son to work through high school to save money for education costs, living off-campus with roommates, \u201cand all the traditional college behaviors that allowed earlier generations to get through their education with a smaller loan balance.\u201dScott Rieckens, who moved his family from high-cost Southern California to Bend, Ore., after adopting the FIRE principles, said he and his wife prefer not to start a tax-advantaged 529 college savings plan for their 3-year-old daughter because it isn\u2019t sufficiently flexible. In 15 years, Mr. Rieckens said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what the state of the job force or higher education is going to look like, with automation, robotics and A.I. coming into play, online free courses.\u201dOne thing he does know: He wants his daughter to work during high school and college, as he and his wife did, to supplement whatever assistance they provide. \u201cFinancial literacy is the best gift we can give her toward her future,\u201d Mr. Rieckens said.\u201cThe safe withdrawal rate of 4 percent means that you should calculate 4 percent of your current portfolio amount. You can withdraw that amount every year. For instance, 4 percent of $1 million is $40,000. You are allowed to increase that $40,000 by inflation only. Suppose inflation was 3 percent for the year. Next year you can spend $40,000 + 3 percent of $40,000, or $41,200. Doesn\u2019t matter whether your portfolio went up to $1.2 million or down to $0.8 million.\u201dMr. Long adds: \u201cThere is some disagreement over how safe this is and how long the portfolio will last. We are on a 3 percent withdrawal rate. There is no historical precedent for that ever failing over any time, period.\u201dBut perhaps the best way to preserve a nest egg in retirement is to not spend a lot of money. Being frugal is the key to FIRE, then as now, Ms. Robin said: \u201cNo matter what my means \u2014 and when I was young I lived on just over $100 a month \u2014 even then I would come out ahead at the end of the year.\u201d\u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d Mr. Ditto said. \u201cThe emotional side is something nobody can prepare you for.\u201dThankfully, he had a paid-for house with low yearly property taxes ($1,500), and enough cash to cover 15 months of expenses if he tightened his belt (he did). The experience taught him two important lessons: Keep cash on hand and don\u2019t panic sell. \u201cI am religious about maintaining six months\u2019 expenses in a money market account \u2014 and I frequently have more. Often a year,\u201d he said.Mr. Ditto also defends full-service brokers more than your average low-fee-index-fund-investing FIRE follower. In 2008, his own broker talked him out of liquidating his entire portfolio. If or when the next economic crisis hits, Mr. Ditto said, one thing he won\u2019t do is stay glued to the TV, as he did back in 2008. \u201cBeing an early retiree gives you too much time to pay attention to the financial press when you shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201dWe posed this question to several FIRE adherents, and the short answer was, they didn\u2019t consider that option. Indeed, many were so burned out from their jobs by the time they quit, they still look back on the experience with something akin to post-traumatic stress. \u201cI would work if I could do it completely on my own terms,\u201d said Mr. Jensen, adding that he knows he is unlikely to find such a scenario. Now that he is free of one, a job is the least of his interests: \u201cI heard a quote the other day that only boring people are bored. There\u2019s so many things I want to do.\u201d For Ms. Shen, who works in information technology, changing jobs or cities wouldn\u2019t have solved the underlying instability she felt in her tech profession. \u201cI\u2019m always subjected to that risk of being outsourced,\u201d she said. Mr. Long said going back to work at some point is \u201ccertainly a possibility,\u201d though right now he has plans to volunteer as a running coach and as a teacher for an English as a second language program in his area. Besides, he currently doesn\u2019t need the money.\u201cOne of my favorite books is \u2018Walden\u2019 by Henry David Thoreau,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cNothing in \u2018Walden\u2019 involves the acquisition of material possessions.\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Censors Bad Economic News Amid Signs of Slower Growth", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China has long made it clear that reporting on politics, civil society and sensitive historical events is forbidden. Increasingly, it wants to keep negative news about the economy under control, too.A government directive sent to journalists in China on Friday named six economic topics to be \u201cmanaged,\u201d according to a copy of the order that was reviewed by The New York Times.The list of topics includes:\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the situation is more serious than previously thought or that they want to prevent a panic,\u201d said Zhang Ming, a retired political science professor from Renmin University in Beijing.Mr. Zhang said the effect of the expanded censorship strategy could more readily cause people to believe rumors about the economy. \u201cThey are worried about chaos,\u201d he added. \u201cBut in barring the media from reporting, things may get more chaotic.\u201dThe directive didn\u2019t appear to affect run-of-mill daily coverage of economic data, which could still be widely found online in China on Friday. Instead, the directive appeared to be aimed at easing the overall tone.Indeed, another notice sent on Friday instructed online news outlets to remove comments at the bottom of news articles that \u201cbad-mouth the Chinese economy.\u201dChina\u2019s propaganda department couldn\u2019t be reached late Friday for comment.Negative economic news could undermine the careful message Chinese officials have tried to transmit to the public in recent months. They have said that the country\u2019s vast and growing ranks of consumers, as well as China\u2019s increasing sophistication in technology and other areas, would help it weather any ill effects from rising American tariffs.The trade war could certainly worsen the economic climate if it lingers, leading to job losses and even weaker consumer sentiment. But China has more deep-seated economic problems.Officials are trying to clean up huge debts accumulated by local governments. Curbing debt could mean slower economic growth, as it deprives borrowers of the funds they would otherwise spend.Mark Williams, chief Asia economist of Capital Economics, said the firm expects the Chinese economy to slow down to 5 to 5.5 percent from 6.9 percent last year. Despite the lower forecast, he stressed that it was \u201cnot a weak number\u201d for the Chinese economy.\u201cOne of the problems is there\u2019s a lot of doubt about official Chinese data,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cAnd when they come out with these directives, it just raises more questions.\u201dIn the past year, domestic news media have had to write their stories on the economy with a gentler tone, said a journalist covering finance for a Chinese business newspaper, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.Censors have also erased online commentary that contained the phrases \u201cconsumption downgrade,\u201d taxes, debt and unemployment, according to the Journalism and Media Studies Center at the University of Hong Kong, which monitors censorship on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like social media service.One post that was removed by censors said: \u201cThe bad news in the market is exploding, pessimistic viewpoints are spreading, many retail investors are in despair.\u201dAnother read: \u201cWill the emergence of robots free up labor or cause unemployment and poverty?\u201dThe scrutiny over economic news adds to a broader pattern of the tightening of control over media since President Xi Jinping came into power in 2012. Particularly online, the Chinese government has centralized and beefed up regulatory agencies that monitor content. Recently, the agencies have come down harder on entertainment news and celebrity gossip, in addition to political and social issues.Two weeks earlier, NetEase, an online news portal, said it had to suspend updating its financial platform \u201cbecause of serious problems.\u201dSui-Lee Wee reported from Beijing, and Li Yuan from Hong KongAdvertisement"}

The site\u2019s home page is full of standard curiosity-gap clickbait in a celebrity finance flavor, with headlines like \u201cBillionaire Michael Jordan Has Zero Influence On Which Players Wear His Shoes, And The Reason Why Is Kind Of Strange \u2026\u201d and \u201cHow Much Money Did Colonel Sanders Make Off Kentucky Fried Chicken? Not As Much As You\u2019d Guess!\u201d But CNW\u2019s core product is the collection of pages it maintains for celebrities (of varying degrees of celebrity) with authoritatively phrased estimates as to how much money they have.These pages include single paragraphs of biographical info, but they\u2019re rendered practically unreadable by formatting. What readers are after is a single number, at the top of the page in big type: $20 million (Chris Pine), $40 million (Chris Pratt), $90 million (Chris Hemsworth).

{"Headline": "Guatemala\u2019s Democracy Is Under Threat \u2014 by Its Own President", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGUATEMALA CITY \u2014 The president of Guatemala pushed the nation toward a constitutional crisis on Monday, ignoring an explicit order by the country\u2019s top court while testing the bounds of the nation\u2019s fragile democracy.The court had ordered that the head of a United Nations-backed anti-corruption commission be allowed back into Guatemala, reversing orders from President Jimmy Morales.But the government stood its ground on Monday, saying it would not allow the head of the commission, Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, a Colombian citizen, to return. Instead the government said the United Nations, which appointed Mr. Vel\u00e1squez to oversee the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, should pick someone else to head the mission.The announcement not only defied the constitutional court\u2019s unanimous ruling late Sunday, but it was also a challenge to United Nations Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. In a rebuke to the Guatemalan government, Mr. Guterres had said at the beginning of the month that Mr. Vel\u00e1squez would remain at the head of the panel even though he was barred from the country.At the root of the crisis are a series of corruption investigations by the commission that have rocked the core of Guatemala\u2019s power structure, sending politicians, businessmen and even former presidents to jail.The commission\u2019s investigations were once helpful to Mr. Morales: They helped unearth wrongdoing by his predecessor and contributed to Mr. Morales\u2019s surprising victory in 2015. But when an inquiry into illegal campaign financing focused on Mr. Morales directly, he made Mr. Vel\u00e1squez persona non-grata and vowed to shut down the commission.The fracas on Monday was the culmination of more than a year of conflict between Mr. Velasquez and Mr. Morales. At first Mr. Morales, whose brother and son are both awaiting trial on corruption charges brought by the commission, tried to expel Mr. Vel\u00e1squez from the country. But the constitutional court, the nation\u2019s top judicial body, deemed the move illegal.For a while, the matter appeared to be resolved. But Mr. Morales said on August 31 that he would not renew the commission\u2019s mandate. Four days later, the government also barred Mr. V\u00e9lasquez, who has been the head of the commission since 2013, from returning to the country.To most legal experts, that violated the spirit of the earlier decision. And indeed, when the court took it up again on Sunday night, it unanimously ruled that any attempt to block the entry of the panel\u2019s commissioner into the country was illegal.But because the ruling did not mention Mr. Vel\u00e1squez by name, the government decided to impose its own interpretation. The Interior Minister, Enrique Degenhart, was categorical on Monday, declaring, \u201cIt is important to set the condition that the Colombian citizen Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez Gomez, will not enter\u201d Guatemala.Instead, Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel said Guatemala had asked Mr. Guterres to come up with a list of acceptable replacement candidates within 48 hours.Polls show that the commission enjoys widespread support among Guatemalans. As if to underscore the effectiveness of the panel, which works alongside Guatemala\u2019s attorney general to build corruption cases, the commission announced arrests in two corruption cases last week, including one involving a former mayor of Quetzaltenango, one of the country\u2019s largest cities.The government\u2019s campaign against Mr. Velasquez \u2014 to the extent of defying the court \u2014 has set off alarms.\u201cIf they resist obeying the court then we are talking about a technical coup,\u201d said Karin Slowing, an independent analyst and columnist for the newspaper Prensa Libre. \u201cWe are talking about a rupture that can take us in any direction.\u201dIf congress, which is largely hostile to the commission, supports the government\u2019s defiance of the court, \u201cthe country\u2019s institutions will break,\u201d Ms. Slowing said.The last time a president openly defied the constitutional court was in the 1990s, and the conflict was only resolved when the army stepped in on behalf of the judiciary to enforce its decree.It is unclear what will happen this time. Mr. Morales is supported by a powerful cadre of former military officers, but the United States\u2019 support for the commission, which was unqualified last year, has waned in recent months.At the same time, public pressure has been a deciding factor on this issue within Guatemala. In 2015, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets to decry corruption, and the president at the time, Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, was forced to step down and face charges brought by Mr. Vel\u00e1squez.Mr. Morales appears determined to avoid his predecessor\u2019s fate, and he has shown a willingness to push the nation to the brink to do so.Last week, protests against Mr. Morales swelled in the countryside, but were more modest in the capital, where the government deployed police officers and soldiers to control the crowds.Ms. Slowing said that one reason for the more muted response in the capital was because the private sector, which ultimately supported the protests in 2015, has largely backed the government against the commission this time.Azam Ahmed reported from Guatemala City, and Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Britons Pay Hundreds for H.I.V. Drugs. Why Do Americans Pay Thousands? ", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesLast week, the High Court of England and Wales announced a momentous decision: It invalidated the pharmaceutical company Gilead\u2019s patent on Truvada, opening the way to generic competition.Truvada, a combination of two drugs, is one of the world\u2019s most-used H.I.V. medicines. For treating H.I.V., it\u2019s used along with a third drug. But many H.I.V.-negative people also take Truvada daily as a preventive. That\u2019s called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.In the United States, Truvada is available only as a brand-name drug. It costs $20,000 a year.Here\u2019s how it will work in Britain\u2019s National Health Service, according to Dr. Andrew Hill, a senior research fellow at Liverpool University who studies the cost of medicines. \u201cThe N.H.S. will say to a group of generic companies: \u2018We need PrEP for 20,000 people. Give us your best price.\u2019\u201d The cost of making PrEP is $55 per year, Dr. Hill said. He believes that the generic will sell for between $100 and $200.All over the world, more and more people are taking H.I.V. drugs. These medicines are very good at their job \u2014 keeping people healthy and noncontagious \u2014 so most patients will take them until they die of something that isn\u2019t H.I.V. Patients are also starting earlier on antiretroviral therapy; the new recommendation is to start immediately upon diagnosis. And now with PrEP, a potentially enormous new group of patients has arisen: H.I.V.-negative people who are at risk for catching the virus.The National Health Service has to treat this soaring population for the same amount or less money each year. England\u2019s region of the health service spends about half a billion dollars per year on H.I.V. drugs. There are no increases for inflation, and lots of pressures for further cuts.It\u2019s lucky, then, that Truvada will have generic competition. It should allow the health service to greatly lower costs and offer PrEP to anyone who needs it.The health service does an admirable job with H.I.V. Around the world, countries measure the percentage of people living with H.I.V. who have no virus detectable in their blood. In the United States, only 49 percent have achieved this. In Britain, the number is 78 percent.While the National Health Service has a lot of problems, it has some huge advantages over the American system that allow it to provide high-quality H.I.V. care in a cost-efficient manner.So it\u2019s worth looking at what the British health service does right, because some of those strategies could work in America, even though the two systems are structured very differently.Even when brand-name drugs have no generic equivalents, the medicines in the British system cost a small fraction of what they cost in America. Most brand-name triple therapies cost about $6,500, said Dr. Laura Waters, an H.I.V. physician who is a member of the health service\u2019s H.I.V. Clinical Reference Group, which sets policy. She said that a combination pill that includes some generics would cost between $2,600 and $4,000. Full generics usually cost 70 to 80 percent less than comparable brand names. One completely generic H.I.V. regimen costs $400 per year.The National Health Service has long relied on generics to treat most diseases. But that wasn\u2019t the case with H.I.V. Once effective drugs were developed, the field moved so fast that by the time a drug went off patent, it was no longer commonly prescribed.But that\u2019s not true anymore.The first H.I.V. therapies, in 1995, were lifesaving \u2014 and toxic, with horrible side effects. Some of them required patients to take 20 pills a day.Now patients around the world take one or two pills a day. All the regimens do well at controlling the virus. They all have some side effects for some people, but patients can switch to find a regimen they can tolerate well. What used to be a big leap forward with each new drug is now a tiny step \u2014 or an advance for only a subset of patients. So older drugs are still in use. Truvada is one example.Three years ago, the National Health Service\u2019s push for generics started to cover H.I.V. drugs. Dr. Waters estimated that at the time, fewer than 5 percent of H.I.V. patients were taking a generic. Now, she said, the number is more like 30 percent.The clinical reference group recommended several specific switches, for example, moving patients off Atripla and onto Truvada plus generic efavirenz \u2014 the exact ingredients of Atripla. The only change is an extra pill each day. In other cases, similar (but not identical) drugs that were cheaper were substituted. Dr. Waters said that a switch always had to be clinically appropriate, and the result of a discussion between doctor and patient. Patients who have clinical reasons to take expensive meds can still do so, she said.For example, a patient with a history of depression or someone who works a night shift won\u2019t be started on efavirenz, which has been associated with an increase in suicidal thoughts and with sleep problems.An even larger source of cost saving is that the health service does not rush to a newer drug when it is approved, as the American system does. Take efavirenz \u2014 a first-line drug for 15 years. Many people still take it successfully.It\u2019s worth repeating that the problem with efavirenz isn\u2019t effectiveness. It\u2019s as good as, or better than, dolutegravir at controlling H.I.V. It even works pretty well when people miss doses.He said that patients are monitored closely. \u201cYou only have to say you\u2019re not sleeping well, and you should be switched,\u201d he said.Dr. Hill said that for every person who starts on efavirenz instead of dolutegravir, the National Health Service saves $5,227 each year.The health service does pressure doctors to prescribe generics. Dr. Hill said doctors are expected to meet targets. \u201cYou should be using at least a certain percentage of generics,\u201d he said, and doctors might have to justify their choices. \u201cIf you use a more expensive drug, you have to explain why you\u2019re doing it,\u201d he said.There\u2019s also modest pressure on the patient to use a cheaper regimen. For many patients, that means taking an extra pill each day.\u201cFor most people whose lives are pretty well organized, if they\u2019re together enough to take one pill a day, they\u2019re together enough to take two \u2014 as long as they can take them at the same time,\u201d said Mr. Collins. \u201cThey\u2019re taking two pills to save the N.H.S. 500 pounds a month. The inconvenience is so minimal that most people say, \u2018I can deal with that.\u2019\u201d\u201cAs long as it\u2019s discussed and explained well, the patient population is incredibly amenable to doing things to help the N.H.S.,\u201d Dr. Waters said, adding that patients who want to stick to a single tablet are allowed to do so. \u201cBut as we go forward, the N.H.S. is going to be less accepting of a \u2018no,\u2019 and put more restrictions on the single tablet.\u201dH.I.V. treatment is about much more than drugs. It also requires lab tests, doctor visits and help from social workers, nutritionists and peer counselors. Unfortunately, any money saved on drugs goes back into the health service\u2019s general kitty \u2014 not to other fronts in the fight against H.I.V.If America were to use more generics, much of the savings would stay with insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers. That doesn\u2019t help people with H.I.V. \u201cThe resources saved can and should finance a more aggressive effort to fight AIDS in America,\u201d said Anil Soni, head of global infectious diseases for Mylan.Could it happen with Medicare or Medicaid? Just a few states \u2014 New York, Georgia, Florida, California and Maryland \u2014 are responsible for a large share of Medicaid\u2019s spending on H.I.V. drugs. They could lead a drive toward using more generic drugs. These drugs are already available, but doctors don\u2019t prescribe them. Like the National Health Service, Medicaid would have to find ways to encourage (or cajole, entice or force) doctors to prescribe generics. If the generics were more widely used, that would encourage competition that could further drop the price.\u201cIf the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and a few state Medicaid directors committed to make this happen, and if they worked with the H.I.V. community to use the savings to finance an aggressive push to end AIDS in America, then it\u2019s possible,\u201d Mr. Soni said.Every day, America pays for H.I.V. drugs at higher and higher prices, for more and more people. There is no choice but to reform an unsustainable system.\u201cI just don\u2019t understand why American payers don\u2019t look up reference prices,\u201d Dr. Hill said. \u201cIt\u2019s $150 in England, so why are they spending $10,000? Surely they don\u2019t have unlimited budgets in the U.S. But they behave as if they do.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Colombia\u2019s Coca Acreage for Cocaine Production at All-Time High", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEDELL\u00cdN, Colombia \u2014 Colombia has more land producing the plant used to make cocaine than ever in its history, according to new figures from the United Nations\u2019 crime watchdog.That\u2019s a 17 percent increase from the year before, and part of a longer trend: Each year since 2013, land used to produce coca leaf has gone up, on average, about 45 percent, the report said. The crops now are also a third more productive than they were in 2012, the agency said.The figures caused \u201cdeep worry,\u201d said Colombia\u2019s defense minister, Guillermo Botero.\u201cIt\u2019s a curve that\u2019s permanently going up and hasn\u2019t reached its inflection point,\u201d he told reporters.The findings are also a blow to the perception that Colombia turned a corner on its twin battles against drugs and the armed groups that traffic them.The coca production figures show the government never gained control over the vast territory occupied by the rebels with whom it signed a peace deal in 2016, experts say. And so long as coca production is rising, the criminal groups that manage the trade have easy financing to challenge the state.The increase came even as significant progress was made combating drug traffickers in Colombia.More than twenty-five years have passed since the kingpin Pablo Escobar was killed on a Medell\u00edn rooftop with the help of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. And in 2016, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the leftist rebel group, signed a peace deal with the government and said it was giving up drug trafficking.Adam Isacson, who studies security trends at the Washington Office on Latin America, said that while Colombia had delivered blows to drug trafficking organizations, it had still failed to make the investment needed to wean the many thousands of poor Colombians who rely on the lucrative coca crop.\u201cPlan Colombia was too focused on short-term solutions,\u201d he said. Among them: spraying coca crops from planes and capturing the heads of cartels and extraditing them.Mr. Duque, a conservative who took office in August, is now under redoubled pressure to stem the coca explosion, particularly from the U.S.President Trump will be visiting the country in December, during his first visit to Latin America as president. In August, Mr. Trump sent Nikki R. Haley, his United Nations ambassador, to meet with Mr. Duque during his inauguration. She arrived with the message that the administration\u2019s principal concern was that Colombia curb drug production.Mr. Duque said that in the coming days, he would present a new plan to combat drugs that would \u201cstrengthen our air, sea and land interception capacity\u201d and \u201cdismantle completely the supply chain, both precursors and product.\u201dSo far, he has provided no details. But many are closely watching whether Mr. Duque will increase the use of aerial fumigation to destroy coca crops, a technique that was suspended for a time by his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos, over concerns that the chemical used, glyphosate, was a potential carcinogen. (Under United States pressure, Mr. Santos said he would allow spraying to resume shortly before he left office in August.)Many officials, particularly in the United States, note that the surge in coca leaf production coincided with Mr. Santos\u2019 decision to stop spraying. They argue that it is a vital tool to curb coca production.But Jeremy McDermott, co-director of InSight Crime, a foundation which monitors criminal activity, said that resuming spraying might lower production in the short term but ultimately backfire. He said it could drive farmers back into alliances with dissident rebel groups who have returned to trafficking drugs after the peace deal.\u201cIf they want to recruit and solidify their territorial bases again, there will be no greater recruitment tool than the aerial fumigation of crops,\u201d he said.The rebel groups that have taken up arms again have been emboldened in recent days. On Thursday, dissident fighters killed three employees of the Canadian gold mining company, Continental Gold, the government said.Mr. McDermott also said it would be hard to reduce coca production in Colombia because shrubs planted in previous years are now reaching their maturity.\u201cThe yield per hectare is going through the roof,\u201d he said.Experts also say that a promised crop substitution program \u2014 part of the peace deal with the rebels \u2014 has produced unintended consequences.As farmers who grew other crops saw subsidies for coca farmers take shape, many switched into the coca business simply to be bought out by the government. When the government failed to make good on the subsidies, many continued to plant.\u201cOne of the reasons that this grew so much starting in 2013 was certainly the peace process,\u201d said Hernando Zuleta, an economics professor at the University of the Andes, in Bogot\u00e1, the capital.And as the state attempts to reclaim lands ceded by the rebels under the peace deal, it is often finding those challenging it over the crops aren\u2019t drug trafficking organizations at all, but farmers\u2019 unions and civil society groups.At times the conflicts between the two have turned deadly.This was the case last October, when farmers blocked the military from entering coca farms outside the southern city of Tumaco and officials opened fire, killing a number of civilians. And some say it could get worse if there is any attempt to speed up coca eradication in the countryside.\u201cThere will be many violent incidents,\u201d says Mr. Isacson, the analyst in Washington.Susan Abad contributed reporting from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.Advertisement"}

With less money coming in and more going toward interest, political leaders will find it harder to address pressing needs like fixing crumbling roads and bridges or to make emergency moves like pulling the economy out of future recessions.Within a decade, more than $900 billion in interest payments will be due annually, easily outpacing spending on myriad other programs. Already the fastest-growing major government expense, the cost of interest is on track to hit $390 billion next year, nearly 50 percent more than in 2017, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\u201cIt\u2019s very much something to worry about,\u201d said C.

That countercyclical policy has been a part of the standard Keynesian toolbox to combat downturns since the Great Depression.The deficit is soaring now as the economy booms, meaning the stimulus is pro-cyclical. The risk is that the government would have less room to maneuver if the economy slows.Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product tends to increase during recessions and fall during recoveries.

But Mr. Frankel warns that when the economy weakens, the government will find it more difficult to cut taxes or increase spending.Lawmakers might, in fact, feel compelled to cut spending as tax revenue falls, further depressing the economy. \u201cThere will eventually be another recession, and this increases the chances we will have to slam on the brakes when the car is already going too slowly,\u201d Mr. Frankel said.Interest payments will make up 13 percent of the federal budget a decade from now, surpassing spending on Medicaid and defense.Expenditures as a share of overall budget15%Net interest13.0%Defense10Medicaid6.6%50\u201917\u201918\u201919\u201920\u201921\u201922\u201923\u201924\u201925\u201926\u201927\u201928Expenditures as a share of overall budget15%Net interest13.0%Defense10Medicaid6.6%50\u201917\u201918\u201919\u201920\u201921\u201922\u201923\u201924\u201925\u201926\u201927\u201928By The New York Times | Source: Congressional Budget OfficeFinding the money to pay investors who hold government debt will crimp other parts of the budget. In a decade, interest on the debt will eat up 13 percent of government spending, up from 6.6 percent in 2017.\u201cBy 2020, we will spend more on interest than we do on kids, including education, food stamps and aid to families,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a research and advocacy organization. Interest costs already dwarf spending on many popular programs. For example, grants to students from low-income families for college total roughly $30 billion \u2014 about one-tenth of what the government will pay in interest this year. Interest payments will overtake Medicaid in 2020 and the Department of Defense budget in 2023.What\u2019s more, the heavy burden of interest payments could make it harder for the government to repair aging infrastructure or take on other big new projects. Mr. Trump has called for spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, but Congress has not taken up that idea.Until recently, ultralow interest rates, set by the Federal Reserve to support the economy, allowed lawmakers to borrow without fretting too much about the cost of that debt. But as the economy has strengthened, the Fed has gradually raised rates, starting in December 2015. The central bank is expected to push rates up again on Wednesday, and more increases are in store.\u201cWhen rates went down to record lows, it allowed the government to take on more debt without paying more interest,\u201d Mr. Goldwein said. \u201cThat party is ending.\u201dAfter bottoming out below 2 percent, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has climbed to over 3 percent recently.Yield on 10-year Treasury note8%MONTHLYRECESSIONS6420\u201998\u201900\u201902\u201904\u201906\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201916\u201918Yield on 10-year Treasury note8%MONTHLYRECESSIONS6420\u201998\u201902\u201906\u201910\u201914\u201918By The New York Times | Source: ReutersThere\u2019s no guarantee that these forecasts will prove accurate.

As a result, the United States still has plenty of borrowing capacity left because the Fed can print money with fewer consequences than other central banks. And interest rates plunged over the last decade, even as the government turned to the market for trillions each year after the recession. That\u2019s because Treasury bonds are still the favored port of international investors in any economic storm. But that privileged position has allowed politicians in both parties to avoid politically painful steps like cutting spending or raising taxes.That doesn\u2019t mean rapidly rising interest costs and a bigger deficit won\u2019t eventually catch up with us. Charles Schultze, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Carter administration, once summed up the danger of deficits with a metaphor. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of the wolf at the door, but termites in the woodwork.\u201d Rather than simply splitting along party lines, lawmakers\u2019 attitudes toward the deficit also depend on which party is in power. Republicans pilloried the Obama administration for proposing a large stimulus in the depths of the recession in 2009 and complained about the deficit for years.In 2013, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called the debt and deficit \u201cthe transcendent issue of our era.\u201d By 2017, as Senate majority leader, he quickly shepherded the tax cut through Congress.Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican who warned of the deficit\u2019s dangers in the past, nevertheless played down that threat on the Senate floor as the tax billed neared passage. \u201cI understand it\u2019s a risk, but I think it\u2019s an appropriate risk to be able to say let\u2019s allow Americans to keep more of their own money to invest in this economy,\u201d he said.He also claimed the tax cuts would pay for themselves even as the Congressional Budget Office estimated that they would add $250 billion to the deficit on average from 2019 to 2024. In an interview, Mr. Lankford insisted that the jury was still out on whether the tax cuts would generate additional revenue, citing the strong economic growth recently.While the Republican about-face has been much more striking, Democrats have adjusted their position, too.Mr. Warner, the Virginia Democrat, called last year\u2019s tax bill \u201cthe worst piece of legislation we have passed since I arrived in the Senate.\u201d In 2009, however, when Congress passed an $800 billion stimulus bill backed by the Obama administration, he called it \u201ca responsible mix of tax cuts and investments that will create jobs.\u201dThe difference, Mr. Warner said, was that the economy was near the precipice then.\u201cThere was virtual unanimity among economists that we needed a stimulus,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a $2 trillion tax cut at the end of a business cycle with borrowed money won\u2019t end well.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But the legacy of hyperinflation is insidious and pervasive, and it too will leave scars.I am a finance scholar and still struggle with planning for retirement. The point is people in countries that have experienced bouts of hyperinflation take a long time to learn to deal properly with money.Hyperinflation commonly leads to two shortsighted types of behavior: short-termism and ultra-conservativeness.When prices are rising more than 10 percent every month, either you spend the money in your pocket or you lose it. While today I am happy to find a crumpled bank note in a forgotten pair of trousers, I would have cursed my stupidity for failing to spend it.I still spend most of what I earn immediately. My brothers went in the opposite direction. They started saving immediately upon getting their first paycheck, much more than they should; they were traumatized from the uncertainty brought by volatile income and prices, and from having to move constantly as rent prices fluctuated wildly.It was only after I started writing about it that I realized that hyperinflation was also a major contributor to my unhealthy eating habits. We were never food insecure in the strict sense. At our worst, we were lower-middle class, so there was never any lack of food.But the good stuff? I grew up knowing that it would arrive infrequently. So when I was lucky enough to get high-quality, expensive food, I gorged on it. And I still do. Today, given my economic status, I may find that I\u2019m gorging on food in a fancy restaurant, but also on simpler pleasures like salmon and Camembert. To this day I eat all salmon in front of me.The tragedy in Venezuela is costing thousands of lives and the toll is rising. In the end, the Venezuelan humanitarian crisis will last much longer than President Maduro\u2019s regime and its hyperinflation.Hyperinflation can be reined in, as the experiences of Israel and Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s show. The boogeyman of rising prices will eventually be shooed away, but having to dance with the beast will leave scars on the financial behavior of Venezuelans for generations. Even those who should know better.An earlier version of a biographical note with this article misspelled the name of the business school where the author is a visiting professor.

{"Headline": "Michael Cohen Has Spoken Repeatedly About Trump With Mueller\u2019s Prosecutors", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Michael D. Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, has been interviewed repeatedly in the past month by prosecutors in the special counsel investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russian operatives, according to two people with knowledge of the sessions.ABC News reported that Mr. Cohen was questioned about Mr. Trump\u2019s business dealings in Russia, possible connections between his campaign and Russian intermediaries, and whether the president or anyone speaking on his behalf discussed the possibility of a pardon with Mr. Cohen.It is unclear what information Mr. Cohen might hold that could prove useful to Mr. Mueller. But he knows about many aspects of Mr. Trump\u2019s business empire.In late 2015, for instance, he had a series of email exchanges with Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman and business associate of Mr. Trump\u2019s, about efforts to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow. In an email to Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater boasted that the tower would help Mr. Trump\u2019s political fortunes.\u201cI will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,\u201d he wrote, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Cohen later emailed a Russian government official hoping to jump-start the project, which never materialized.In January 2017, after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Cohen met with a Russian oligarch, Viktor Vekselberg, at Trump Tower in Manhattan and at an inauguration event in Washington. A company connected to Mr. Vekselberg, who has close ties to the Kremlin, awarded Mr. Cohen a $1 million consulting contract, funneling the money to a shell company of Mr. Cohen\u2019s.Lanny Davis, a lawyer acting as an adviser to Mr. Cohen, declined to comment about Mr. Cohen\u2019s interviews with special counsel prosecutors. He said \u201cno inference\u201d should be drawn from his lack of comment.Under the sentencing guidelines cited in the plea agreement, Mr. Cohen faces a maximum of between five and six years in prison for income tax evasion, false statements to a financial institution and campaign finance violations. His sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 12.Mr. Mueller\u2019s office originally referred his case to federal prosecutors in New York, apparently because the allegations against the president\u2019s longtime fixer fell outside the special counsel\u2019s mandate. But if Mr. Cohen provides substantial assistance to the Russia investigation or any criminal inquiry, prosecutors might agree to tell the sentencing judge that he deserves a lighter punishment.Mr. Cohen admitted in court that during the campaign, Mr. Trump directed him to arrange payments to an adult film actress and a former Playboy model to keep them from speaking publicly about their affairs with him. The payments violated campaign finance laws that govern corporate and personal contributions.One payment was to Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress better known as Stormy Daniels, who was given $130,000 in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors said that to reimburse Mr. Cohen for the payment, executives from the Trump Organization allowed him to file false invoices that listed it as a legal expense.The arrangements for the other payment, to Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model, were more complex, and involved a tabloid buying the rights to her story and then killing it.Mr. Cohen turned against the president only after months of pressure from federal authorities, who were investigating Mr. Cohen\u2019s businesses and his financial dealings with banks and tax authorities. His guilty plea infuriated Mr. Trump, who said giving information to prosecutors in return for lesser charges \u201calmost ought to be outlawed.\u201dThey also asked to schedule the sentencing of Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, for late this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steeper Versus Deeper (Wonkish)", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDid finance cause the Great Recession, redux.Opinion ColumnistMy starting point in thinking about the Great Recession and aftermath is that we clearly had a very large housing bubble. Here\u2019s the ratio of housing prices to owner\u2019s equivalent rent, the sort of housing equivalent of the P/E ratio for stocks:Housing prices went extremely high relative to rental rates (and consumer prices more generally), then suffered a long and protracted fall. This decline started well before the period of severe financial distress, which was a fairly short episode from September 2008 to around June 2009. And prices were still way down years later, which suggests that while the credit crisis surely accelerated the pace of decline, prices were going to come down and stay down regardless of what happened to the financial system.Given a housing price slump of this magnitude, you had to expect large macroeconomic impacts: a big decline in residential investment spending, a fall in consumer spending because of the wealth effect, and a decline in nonresidential investment because of the slump in demand brought on by the first two effects.In other words, something very much like the Great Recession seems like an inevitable consequence of the bursting of the housing bubble. And the magnitude of the shocks \u2014 around 4 percent of GDP for housing investment, perhaps around 2 percent for the wealth effects of the decline in home equity \u2014 looks well within the range needed to explain the whole thing.What Bernanke offers is, as I read it, mainly evidence that the pace of decline accelerated a lot during 2008-2009. Indeed it did \u2014 and no reasonable person would deny that the combination of financial disruption and sheer fear that gripped the world after September 2008 brought the slump forward and made the decline steeper than it would otherwise have been.But did it make the decline deeper as well as steeper? The unemployment rate averaged 9.6 percent in 2010 and 8.9 percent in 2011. How much did the financial crisis contribute to these extremely high levels of economic slack, long after the disruption had ended? I still don\u2019t see how to make it the main story.Now, does this mean that rescuing the financial system was pointless? Here Dean Baker and I disagree, I think. Dean says yes, because finance didn\u2019t cause the slump. I think that the slump we had didn\u2019t have much to do with finance \u2014 but the slump we would have had if the financial system had been allowed to implode might have been much worse. On precautionary grounds, bailouts were in my view the right thing to do, although the terms were too sweet for the bankers.On the other hand, the fact that we suffered such a deep, prolonged slump despite rescuing banks shows the limits of a finance-centered view.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Goldman\u2019s Leadership Is Firmly With Its Bankers Now", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor two decades, bankers and traders generally traded the reins of Goldman Sachs back and forth.Perhaps alone among Wall Street firms, Goldman has tended to switch the top job from a banker to a trader.

Corzine (trader)\u2022 Mr. Corzine (trader)\u2022 Stephen Friedman (banker)\u2022 Mr. Friedman (banker) and Robert Rubin (trader)The moves tended to reflect the shifting balance of power between the two businesses that long dominated Goldman\u2019s operations. Mr. Paulson, for instance, ascended to the top spot in the late 1990s at a time when revenue from merger and acquisitions and initial public offerings was rising. When Mr. Blankfein took the reins, Goldman\u2019s top line was ballooning thanks to trading.From 2009 through last year, however, Goldman was led by Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Cohn, a sign of the strength of the firm\u2019s then-vaunted trading unit. Its last two chief financial officers, Harvey M. Schwartz and then R. Martin Chavez, also came from the trading desk.But in recent years, Goldman\u2019s trading business had stumbled and lagged behind its Wall Street rivals.Mr. Solomon\u2019s elevation of John E. Waldron as president and Stephen M. Scherr as chief financial officer \u2014 both of whom began their careers in investment banking \u2014 signals the ascendancy of Goldman\u2019s banking arm within the firm.With Goldman trying to shed risk by further emphasizing its mergers advice and consumer banking operations, it\u2019s understandable that those businesses would take front and center in the firm\u2019s management as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Netherlands, a Tax Avoidance Center, Tries to Mend Its Ways", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE HAGUE \u2014 The Netherlands wants you to know that it is not a tax haven. But Menno Snel, the country\u2019s No. 2 finance official, grudgingly acknowledges that the Dutch have become experts at something else: aggressive tax planning.That\u2019s backed up by the amount of money pouring across its borders. For tax avoidance purposes, the Netherlands offers the status of a European country, while allowing big multinationals, like Google and Ikea, to move global profits through Dutch subsidiaries, drastically lowering their tax payments.The atrium of the Dutch Finance Ministry, where Mr. Snel works, is even adorned with full-grown potted palms that give it a whiff of a tropical tax haven. The suggestion of any parallel is probably unintentional.In any case, the Dutch position as a tax avoidance center could be about to change. In a major reversal, the Finance Ministry this week submitted proposals to Parliament that would shut down the benefits that made the Netherlands a magnet for international corporations \u2014 especially American ones, like Netflix, Nike and Uber. Debate on the measures is expected to continue through December.Under the proposals, the Netherlands plans to impose levies on profits being transferred to tax havens and to block companies from exploiting inconsistent national laws to take the same deduction twice. Whether those proposals will get past the array of accountants, lawyers and consultants who help foreign companies reduce their tax payments, and who have voiced opposition to the changes, is not yet clear.Mr. Snel, whose formal title is state secretary of finance, said in an interview, \u201cWe must be fair in recognizing that some companies are misusing the open tax system that the Netherlands has.\u201dAmid a popular backlash against what many see as multinationals gaming the system, tax change has been a hot political issue in the Netherlands this year. In addition, legislators must close loopholes to avoid breaching new European Union rules that take effect in 2019.Tax cuts in the United States also affect the appeal of the Dutch system. At the same time, new rules passed in Washington make it harder for companies to stash profits overseas.As a relatively affluent member of the eurozone, the Netherlands offers a reliable court system and lack of official corruption not always present in island tax havens. It also boasts a comprehensive network of tax treaties with almost every nation, and little or no tax on money passing through the country. It is easy to move money in, and easy to move it out.The Netherlands has been especially popular with American corporations. Google and IBM have big presences in the country, as do such service providers as the law firm Baker McKenzie and the accounting company Deloitte. Fiat Chrysler is technically a Dutch company. Nike has its European headquarters in Hilversum, just south of Amsterdam.The sports apparel maker used a common, legal method of shifting profits to a tax haven, according to the consortium\u2019s research. First, it allocated ownership of its \u201cswoosh\u201d trademark and other intellectual property to a subsidiary in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. Then, its subsidiary in Hilversum paid royalties for the use of the trademarks to the Bermuda unit. The royalties counted as business expenses and in that way avoided taxation in the Netherlands.\u201cNike fully complies with tax regulations, and we rigorously ensure our tax filings are fully aligned with how we run our business,\u201d the company said in a statement to The Times.At least until recently, the Dutch Finance Ministry was a willing enabler for such arrangements. Corporate accountants and lawyers could call at the ministry for preapproval of their strategies. The Netherlands long justified its laws by arguing that they encouraged multinational companies to establish their headquarters in the country, creating jobs and investment.More recently, however, legal thinking and public opinion have turned.In national elections last year, almost all the major political parties promised change. And the public anger has provided political impetus for the government.Mr. Snel, a member of the Democrats 66 party, a socially liberal partner in the governing coalition, is credited by many activists for pursuing the task with more zeal than his predecessors.\u201cMenno Snel is being more proactive and more constructive in addressing tax avoidance,\u201d said Francis Weyzig, a tax policy expert in The Hague for the charity Oxfam, which argues that island havens steal revenue from developing countries. \u201cDefinitely, there has been a change.\u201dFor example, Mr. Snel has proposed measures to prevent companies from exploiting inconsistencies in national rules that allow profits to fall through the cracks, avoiding taxation.Other provisions he has proposed oblige lawyers and accountants to disclose information about questionable arrangements. The Netherlands will also limit the size of deductions that companies take for interest payments, a measure aimed at another popular method for shifting profits to tax havens. In that arrangement, firms take out loans in low-tax countries but allocate the interest to the Netherlands, where it is deductible as an operating expense.But tax is a big business for the Netherlands, leaving open the possibility that vigorous objections from multinationals could weaken efforts to retool the system.\u201cThe Netherlands is not serious about ending its tax haven status,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament who is the Green Party\u2019s spokesman on tax policy. He noted that the Netherlands had resisted attempts to prevent European countries from competing to have the lowest corporate rate.\u201cCompanies that want to come to the Netherlands and set up a genuine business \u2014 the question is whether you would scare them off by being too strict,\u201d said Bartjan Zoetmulder, a tax partner at Loyens & Loeff, a big Dutch law firm.So far, there are no signs of mass unemployment among the thousands of Dutch lawyers, accountants and notaries who specialize in working with foreign corporations. Many young people still regard tax advising as a lucrative career with a future, a sign they do not expect the changes to undercut the appeal of the Netherlands.Enrollment in courses for budding tax consultants \u201chas never been so high,\u201d said Jan van de Streek, a professor at the University of Amsterdam who teaches tax policy, with a hint of chagrin.And lately there has been public outrage over an exemption for shareholder dividends that is seen as benefiting Shell and Unilever, two of the Netherlands\u2019 biggest corporations, at the expense of ordinary citizens.Mr. Snel said that Dutch officials would continue to consult with businesses, but would apply stricter standards that were either in place or would go into force in coming years. And the secrecy is over. The Netherlands has already begun sharing information with other countries.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be seen as tax evaders,\u201d Mr. Snel said. \u201cWe pay our taxes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Climate Change No Longer in the Future, Adaptation Speeds Up", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn New York, designs are underway for a $203 million flip-up wall to protect Lower Manhattan from intensifying storm surges.In China, companies building coal-fired power plants amid more frequent periods of drought are shifting to a more expensive technology that cools the plants\u2019 equipment with less water.In Bangladesh, rice farmers facing rising seawater are changing what they grow, some to more salt-tolerant varieties of the crop and others away from rice altogether, to shrimp.All these shifts, experts familiar with them say, are in response to climate change.Not long ago, climate change was seen as a threat for the future. Increasingly, it\u2019s a reality of the present, a new normal spurring billions of dollars in annual spending as governments, companies and citizens scramble to adapt.Intensifying storms, like Hurricane Florence, which walloped the Carolinas this month; worsening drought, which fueled the fires that have swept through California this year; and rising seas that have put coastal cities on edge around the globe are all linked at least in part, scientists say, to a human-induced rise in global temperatures, and they are prompting all manner of defensive measures.The United Nations estimates that adapting to climate change could cost $500 billion yearly by 2050 \u2014 a price tag that would be borne by everyone, including governments, the private sector and citizens. But whether even that sum would succeed in shoring up people and infrastructure is anyone\u2019s guess. The shift in focus from trying just to prevent climate change to trying to live with it is forcing some sobering trade-offs, and they are likely, experts say, to get more painful.For decades, a philosophical debate has raged about how to respond to climate change. One side \u2014 essentially the climate purists \u2014 has argued for a strategy known as mitigation: remaking energy, agriculture and other sectors to curb carbon emissions and prevent temperatures from rising. The other side \u2014 the climate pragmatists \u2014 has called for adaptation: accepting that climate change is happening and taking steps to adjust.Initially, many environmental activists rejected adaptation as a sellout, a \u201ckind of laziness, an arrogant faith in our ability to react in time to save our skins,\u201d as Al Gore, then Bill Clinton\u2019s running mate, put it in his 1992 book, \u201cEarth in the Balance,\u201d a call to slash emissions. But emissions have continued to rise. In 2017, energy-related carbon output hit an all-time high, the International Energy Agency says. So climate hawks have come to view adaptation as crucial.The work is going slowly. In 2009, developed countries agreed to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help developing countries both mitigate and adapt to climate change.No comprehensive accounting exists of how much is being spent on adaptation, United Nations officials say. What\u2019s clear is that the sums, distributed across a variety of pools, are relatively small.Another example is financing by six large multilateral development banks for adaptation efforts in emerging and developing countries, which totaled $7.4 billion in 2017, according to the World Bank. The Bangkok talks failed to achieve agreement on more adaptation money; diplomats are expected take up the issue again in December, at a climate conference in Katowice, Poland.Lack of money isn\u2019t the only problem in adapting to climate change. So are the unintended consequences. Some moves to adapt to climate change actually are worsening carbon emissions.One example is the use of air-conditioning which, particularly in developing countries, is soaring, both because of rising heat and humidity linked to climate change and because of economic growth, said Caroline Lee, an analyst at the International Energy Agency who focuses on adaptation.Here is a look at how three places are experiencing climate change and trying to adapt.The city of 64,000 residents has, for about a decade, been studying its vulnerability to climate change and planning how to adapt. It uses wildfire maps, and models that project sea-level rise through 2030, 2050 and 2100, to map areas by their vulnerability to climate change. Then the city overlays demographic data onto those maps, including residents\u2019 age and income, which allows it to identify particularly vulnerable neighborhoods.That\u2019s raising an uncomfortable question: Should the city pay to fortify the cliff below the road, protecting it and those houses but potentially intensifying erosion of nearby beaches? Or should it, in planning parlance, \u201crecede\u201d \u2014 essentially abandoning the cliff to Mother Nature? If the city chooses to keep shoring it up the cliff, it will face yet another quandary, noted Tiffany Wise-West, the city\u2019s sustainability and climate action manager: \u201c\u2018Who pays?\u2019 is a big question. Do we all pay as taxpayers? Do we require private residents to pay?\u201dBangladesh, a low-lying country of about 167 million people on India\u2019s eastern flank, borders the Bay of Bengal and is crisscrossed by rivers including the storied Ganges and the Brahmaputra. The bay and rivers long have defined Bangladesh\u2019s economy; now, so is a changing climate.Over the past decade, Bangladesh has spent about $500 million in government money on planning and projects to adapt to climate change, said Saleemul Huq, director of the country\u2019s International Center for Climate Change and Development and one of the authors of Bangladesh\u2019s response plan.Along the coast, rice farmers are shifting to new varieties of the crop bred with the help of government money to grow in saltier water. But that is only a temporary fix, because eventually the salinity of the water will exceed the tolerance of the specially engineered rice. \u201cWe\u2019re always playing catch-up,\u201d Mr. Huq said. \u201cWhen we can\u2019t grow rice anymore, we switch to raising shrimp.\u201d Yet even shrimp isn\u2019t a panacea. It\u2019s lucrative for those who farm it, but, unlike rice, it\u2019s not a dietary staple.Mr. Huq compares climate adaptation in Bangladesh to an effort to fend off an invasion by space aliens. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the initial scout ships of the alien invasion have landed on earth, and one of them has landed in Bangladesh,\u201d he said. \u201cThe mother ship\u2019s on its way. When it comes, it\u2019s going to land in New York, London, Paris\u201d and other major global cities.\u201cYou guys are not ready for it yet. But you\u2019re going to have to learn from us how to deal with it. Because we are learning.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Boies Pleads Not Guilty", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "The superlawyer in such cases as Bush v. Gore and the fight for gay marriage rights makes no apologies for representing Harvey Weinstein and Theranos with zeal.Supported byWhen I arrived on a late July afternoon for an interview with David Boies at his mansion in Westchester County, displaced furniture filled the foyer and workmen occupied much of the famed litigator\u2019s home. Water from an unchecked bathtub had cascaded through the house, reaching all the way to his cellar and his vast collection of rare wines. Mr. Boies, dressed in a dark-blue Lands\u2019 End suit, guided me down into the mess.The last 12 months have been an unprecedented public relations disaster for the most prominent lawyer in America. In October, his longtime client Harvey Weinstein was branded a sexual predator. Another high-profile client, Theranos, on whose board Mr. Boies served, has been exposed as a fraud. The Times publicly fired Mr. Boies\u2019s firm, which had been representing the newspaper, after learning that he had been personally involved in an undercover operation to smear Mr. Weinstein\u2019s victims and deceive Times reporters. The Manhattan district attorney is looking into the matter and Mr. Boies\u2019s role.In May, \u201cBad Blood,\u201d the best-selling Theranos expos\u00e9 by the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, laid out in gripping detail the aggressive efforts by Mr. Boies and his firm to intimidate \u2014 and, in some cases, terrify \u2014 company whistle-blowers. Mr. Carreyrou compared the tactics to those of \u201cthugs.\u201dOf all the humiliation, scolding and criticism Mr. Boies has endured, it was this comment that seemed to eat at him as we talked in his study in July \u2014 his first extended interview since the furor peaked.\u201cOver all, his reporting on Theranos was excellent,\u201d Mr. Boies said of Mr. Carreyrou, between sips of 20-year-old Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, which he had rescued from the cellar. \u201cAnd overwriting aside, even his personal comments about me were within the realm of fairness. But calling me a \u2018thug\u2019 on his book tour was over the top.\u201dMr. Boies, 77, seemed more puzzled than hurt that editors of The Times, The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg had recently spurned his letters to the editor. \u201cI was disappointed,\u201d he allowed, in the same judicious and unflappable manner that has made him a favorite of federal judges. Mr. Boies suggested that exonerating facts about his work for Mr. Weinstein and Theranos had been omitted from media coverage. \u201cWhat are letters for,\u201d he asked, \u201cif not to air an opposing view?\u201dMost of all, Mr. Boies said, he felt misunderstood. While he concedes he made mistakes, he maintains he was simply defending his clients\u2019 interests to the best of his abilities, including protecting them from damaging headlines.\u201cYou don\u2019t know all the facts when you take on a client,\u201d he said, \u201cbut once you do, you have a duty of loyalty. You can\u2019t represent them halfway. If, as a lawyer, you start to value how you are going to look to the media, as opposed to how your client will look, then you should find a new profession.\u201dA bedrock of lawful society is that every defendant, no matter how repugnant, has the right to a zealous attorney. But \u2014 as he himself has put it \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean the right to David Boies. He can afford to be selective about whom he represents, and he told me that he accepts as clients fewer than 20 percent of the people who approach him.Throughout his half-century of practice, Mr. Boies has shown an almost unerring instinct for picking clients who burnish his reputation. It has made him one of the highest-paid lawyers in the country, with an hourly rate of $1,850. And it has baffled legal observers that, in what could have been his gilded years, Mr. Boies ended up representing both Mr. Weinstein and Theranos, led by Elizabeth Holmes, in ways that arguably helped prolong their misdeeds. For the first time in his career, the most vaunted advocate in the United States has been a defendant in the court of public opinion.One afternoon in August, Mr. Boies occupied a prime corner table at the newly reopened Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan. It was his third meal there in 36 hours. With tousled dark-blond hair and a rather slight build, he looked tanned and relaxed and was looking forward to a safari in Kenya. He was drinking a glass of cabernet from the vineyard he owns in Northern California, visibly relieved that he could again indulge his craving for the Four Seasons version of pigs in blankets.From his vantage, any clouds over his reputation had dissipated. His firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, was thriving, and he was in demand. In just the first six months of this year, he had generated $35 million in billings. A lawyer for Leslie Moonves, who in early September was forced out as CBS\u2019s chief executive after allegations of sexually aggressive behavior, recently approached Mr. Boies to see if he\u2019d consider representing Mr. Moonves. Mr. Boies demurred, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be good for Les, and I don\u2019t think that would be good for me.\u201dAlthough he\u2019s a Democrat, Mr. Boies said he\u2019d be more than happy to represent President Trump in the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. \u201cWhether you agree with him or not, he needs to have effective representation,\u201d Mr. Boies said of the president. \u201cThis long, drawn-out morality play isn\u2019t in the country\u2019s best interests. It needs to be resolved. Of course, he\u2019d have to agree to do what I told him.\u201dWithin the legal establishment, Mr. Boies\u2019s reputation seems undimmed. \u201cWhen you are a superstar like David Boies, there will always be some people who are jealous and want to take you down,\u201d said Jed S. Rakoff, a senior United States District Court judge in New York. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that everything he has ever done is beyond reproach, but he has been in my court numerous times and has always performed at the very highest level, both in terms of skill and in terms of professionalism. I think he continues to be very highly regarded by the judges of the Southern District.\u201d\u201cIf you represent people who did bad things, the public is going to lash out at you,\u201d said Theodore B. Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who was Mr. Boies\u2019s adversary in Bush v. Gore and his co-counsel in the gay marriage case. \u201cDavid may push hard, but that\u2019s what\u2019s required sometimes.\u201dEvery judge and lawyer I interviewed noted that few laymen fully appreciated their ethical duties. \u201cI often have to explain to journalists that there\u2019s a divergence between legal ethics and the ethics of ordinary people,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law and an expert on legal ethics. \u201cRepresenting a bad person doesn\u2019t make you a bad person.\u201dAmong the general public, however, Mr. Boies\u2019s \u201creputation has absolutely been damaged,\u201d Professor Gillers said. \u201cHe may be a stellar lawyer. But in representing a Harvey Weinstein or Elizabeth Holmes, he\u2019s not seeking to vindicate an overarching legal principle as he did in Bush v. Gore or gay marriage.\u201cCriminal defense lawyers who represent vicious criminals may lead perfectly ethical and admirable lives, but their clients can harm their reputation in the larger community,\u201d he continued. \u201cDavid Boies can\u2019t represent the Harvey Weinsteins and Elizabeth Holmeses of the world the way he did and still expect the public to see him as a golden boy.\u201dThat\u2019s where Mr. Boies finds himself today: still revered by the bar, but fallen in the eyes of the media and liberal constituencies, and undergoing a reappraisal of his career and tactics.\u201cAnyone who\u2019s been on the other side of his maneuvers knows that he and his firm are incredibly aggressive advocates who push the envelope for their clients,\u201d Mr. Carreyrou said. \u201cThat was obscured for decades by the fact that he was on the right side of history again and again.\u201dWhile Mr. Boies projects a sanguine sense of his future, one thing nags at him: who will play him in the film version of Mr. Carreyrou\u2019s book. (Jennifer Lawrence is taking on the role of Ms. Holmes.) He has been portrayed on stage and screen before, always with a mix of brilliant affability \u2014 by Ed Begley Jr. in the HBO movie \u201cRecount,\u201d and by Morgan Freeman and George Clooney in productions of the marriage-equality play \u201c8.\u201d Whoever gets the part in \u201cBad Blood\u201d may be considerably less appealing.Mr. Boies got his start at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the paradigm of the institutional corporate law firm. (We were briefly colleagues there, but never worked on a case together.) Within its staid ranks, Mr. Boies was something of a maverick. Usually a little disheveled, he wore off-the-rack Sears or Lands\u2019 End navy suits and a plastic watch strapped over his shirt cuff. He found time for gambling excursions to Las Vegas and cross-country driving trips with his four sons. (He has been married three times and also has two daughters, one deceased.)Liberated, Mr. Boies and his firm took on all kinds of clients and embraced fee arrangements, like contingency fees and stock compensation, that weren\u2019t allowed at Cravath. The firm flourished; this year, it had 340 lawyers and average profits per partner of $3.2 million, among the highest in the country.\u201cI spend a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Boies told me: on his Westchester estate and a car and driver; his rare-wine collection; his vineyard; a racing sailboat; a Manhattan co-op in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.Four years after he started the firm, in 2001, the editor Tina Brown introduced Mr. Boies to Mr. Weinstein \u2014 her partner in a multimedia venture \u2014 to discuss a legal memoir. Mr. Weinstein hired him, and almost immediately, Mr. Boies had to confront the producer\u2019s ugly behavior with women. In 2002, he talked The New Yorker out of publishing allegations of sexual harassment. At the time, none of the victims would go on the record, and Mr. Boies argued that the encounters were consensual. Mr. Boies knew there had been settlements with some of the accusers: He had shown Ken Auletta, the reporter on the story, copies of the canceled checks from Mr. Weinstein\u2019s personal account.Afterward, Mr. Auletta asked Mr. Boies how he could represent someone like Mr. Weinstein. \u201cI\u2019m loyal,\u201d Mr. Boies replied.He stayed loyal, even as he became aware of the settlements that Mr. Weinstein had reached with women alleging inappropriate sexual behavior. \u201cI knew of two or three over the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. Boies told me. \u201cHarvey had a reputation as a philanderer. But there was never any evidence or indication of assault, rape or threat of force. He was emphatic that he\u2019d never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex with him.\u201d Mr. Boies also helped negotiate a 2015 settlement with a Weinstein employee, Lauren O\u2019Connor, that required Mr. Weinstein to seek anger management therapy. (In June, Mr. Weinstein pleaded not guilty to assault and rape charges.)For his part, Mr. Weinstein showered Mr. Boies with invitations for opening-night parties and celebrity-studded charity events. The Weinstein Company put one of Mr. Boies\u2019s daughters in the hit 2012 film \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d and also distributed a movie she produced, \u201cJane Got a Gun.\u201d Along with the son of one of his law partners, Mr. Boies formed a film production company, which invested $5 million each in two Weinstein films, \u201cGold\u201d and \u201cThe Upside,\u201d both flops.These entanglements may have colored Mr. Boies\u2019s objectivity and judgment about Mr. Weinstein. But they weren\u2019t, in the legal sense, a conflict of interest. They more closely aligned Mr. Boies\u2019s interest with his client\u2019s, which as far as the bar is concerned is a good thing.Mr. Boies met Elizabeth Holmes in 2011, after an early Theranos investor asked him to represent her. At the time, her claim that Theranos technology could render an accurate blood test from a finger prick was being hailed across Silicon Valley as a revolutionary breakthrough with enormous profit potential.\u201cShe showed us the lab,\u201d Mr. Boies said. \u201cShe was very well prepared, committed and intelligent. She made a terrific impression.\u201d A committee of prominent doctors and scientists served on an advisory board.So impressed was Mr. Boies that he took half his and his firm\u2019s fees in Theranos stock, which eventually amounted to 400,000 shares, or roughly $7 million at the company\u2019s apex. Had the company thrived, it could have been worth many times that.Like his business and social dealings with Mr. Weinstein, a financial stake in a client risks coloring a lawyer\u2019s independent judgment. For that reason, firms like Cravath and Gibson Dunn prohibit it. But they are exceptions. It\u2019s a common and lucrative practice, especially among Silicon Valley and San Francisco firms with large venture capital divisions. Defenders of the arrangement note that scores of start-ups might not have succeeded without the expensive legal advice they were able to finance with stock, rather than cash.The American Bar Association \u201chas wrestled with the wisdom of the practice for over 20 years,\u201d Professor Gillers said. \u201cThe answer that has emerged,\u201d he added, \u201cis that it\u2019s not categorically forbidden, but it has to be monitored closely to protect the client.\u201d To guard against this, clients typically consent to the arrangement in writing, as Theranos did.Mr. Boies insists that his friendship with Mr. Weinstein, his personal admiration for Ms. Holmes and his firm\u2019s financial interest in Theranos had no impact on his professional judgment, and he seemed somewhat puzzled that anyone would think otherwise. \u201cAnything that gives you an incentive to put the client\u2019s interest first is good for the client,\u201d he said.During the summer of 2015, at the behest of Jim Mattis, a Theranos board member who is now the secretary of defense, Mr. Boies also agreed to join the Theranos board. The Wall Street Journal was investigating Theranos, and Mr. Mattis told him that he anticipated \u201ca difficult period where both Theranos and Ms. Holmes would need the advice of a seasoned lawyer,\u201d Mr. Boies recalled.That added another level of ethical complexity. As a board member, Mr. Boies assumed a fiduciary duty to shareholders. Now he was obliged to act in the best interest of two different parties: investors and company management. What if one \u2014 i.e. Ms. Holmes \u2014 acted in a way that harmed the other? Precisely because the arrangement could create an impossible dilemma, some firms prohibit such board memberships. Yet it is not explicitly forbidden by the bar\u2019s ethics rules.As The Journal\u2019s Mr. Carreyrou stepped up his reporting on Theranos that summer, Mr. Boies used all the tools at his disposal to defend Ms. Holmes and muzzle the journalist\u2019s sources. His partners sent letters threatening suspected talkers with litigation if they disclosed trade secrets or confidential information. (One whistle-blower, a man in his 20s, incurred several hundred thousand dollars in legal fees.) And he wrote a 23-page letter to The Journal warning it about publishing Mr. Carreyrou\u2019s article.Mr. Boies told me that he maintains a longstanding policy: He won\u2019t sue media organizations, or even threaten to do so. \u201cThere may be valid defamation actions, but I don\u2019t want to be the lawyer doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing all the way back to CBS and Westmoreland, my experience has been that most reporters try to get it right.\u201d He also has long positioned himself as a friend to reporters and a champion of the First Amendment. He\u2019s a donor to the Committee to Protect Journalists and has served as its annual dinner chairman.Mr. Carreyrou insists that the letter did \u201cexplicitly threaten\u201d a lawsuit. Mr. Boies denies that, but he seems to be splitting hairs. The letter demands that Mr. Carreyrou and The Journal save all their notes and records, which \u201cwould doubtless be highly relevant in any lawsuit\u201d \u2014 and then cites two cases as precedent. Mr. Boies either violated his own policy regarding media lawsuits, or came precariously close to doing so.When I pressed Mr. Boies on this, the litigator in him wouldn\u2019t give an inch. \u201cYou don\u2019t write a 20-plus-page letter to threaten someone,\u201d he said. \u201cI could do that in one paragraph. You write that kind of letter to persuade. You may point out things that you believe are inaccurate or reckless and that could support a lawsuit. But it\u2019s not a threat to sue.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe question is, can you make the story better, more accurate, more favorable to your client? If so, you\u2019re being an effective advocate.\u201dFrom Mr. Boies\u2019s point of view, his approach worked. Among the facts that Mr. Carreyrou had uncovered, and that didn\u2019t appear in the article, was Ms. Holmes\u2019s long-running romantic relationship with Ramesh Balwani, Theranos\u2019s president.The article didn\u2019t shake his confidence in Ms. Holmes, however. She agreed, at his suggestion, to an independent verification of Theranos\u2019s technology in order to rebut the Journal article and reassure investors and regulators.In early March, she was a guest at Mr. Boies\u2019s 75th birthday bash at Las Vegas\u2019s Wynn Resort. But by the end of that month, there were still no results. Ms. Holmes began relying on other outside lawyers, and she fired the company\u2019s general counsel, a former Boies Schiller partner, who returned to the firm.\u201cI\u2019d say that by summer, I wasn\u2019t exactly persona non grata, but I was pretty close,\u201d Mr. Boies said. He tried to resign from the board, but other directors dissuaded him. His own outside lawyer advised that as a director, he couldn\u2019t resign in a way that might damage shareholders.The final straw came in August, when Ms. Holmes made an overly optimistic presentation to shareholders without consulting Mr. Boies. As he put it in an email to Ms. Holmes, he could not continue being her lawyer if she did not heed his advice: \u201cIf we are going to risk being at the scene of a serious accident, we want to have the steering wheel in our hands.\u201d He continued, \u201cBecause of the very public role we have taken in defense of the company, the firm\u2019s own credibility is at stake.\u201dWithin 72 hours of sending the email, Mr. Boies stopped representing the company. He remained a director until Theranos could find a replacement, which took until February. The next month, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ms. Holmes orchestrated a \u201cmassive fraud\u201d that cost investors more than $700 million while putting the health of its testing subjects at risk.Mr. Boies\u2019s work for both Mr. Weinstein and Theranos might well have gone largely unnoticed, and his reputation might have remained unblemished, had that been the end of the story. But Mr. Boies himself became the subject of further investigative reporting.Mr. Weinstein approached Mr. Boies in the spring of 2017, after he learned that Times reporters, as well as Ronan Farrow, then a reporter for NBC News and later for The New Yorker, were unearthing allegations of sexual assault. Mr. Weinstein asked Mr. Boies to write letters to the publications threatening legal action.Mr. Boies said he told Mr. Weinstein that he\u2019d be \u201ccrazy\u201d to sue, and reminded him about his personal rule against media lawsuits. But, he said, he agreed to give Mr. Weinstein legal advice and act on his behalf as a \u201cfriend,\u201d and would not charge him for any of his work.In his hybrid role as lawyer and friend, Mr. Boies approached The Times. He knew many of its reporters and editors, and his firm represented the paper in a libel suit. When The Times retained one of Mr. Boies\u2019s partners for the libel case, the company signed an explicit waiver of any conflict, which even gave his firm the right to sue The Times on behalf of another client.Mr. Boies had numerous exchanges with its executive editor, Dean Baquet, maneuvering to get reporters to interview Mr. Weinstein on background. Mr. Baquet rebuffed him; The Times\u2019s policy is not to talk to subjects of investigative reports on such a basis.The Times obviously knew that Mr. Boies was advocating Mr. Weinstein\u2019s point of view, even as his firm continued to represent The Times. What it didn\u2019t know \u2014 and what Mr. Boies never told the paper \u2014 was that he had also negotiated and signed an agreement with Black Cube, a secretive investigative agency that used undercover operatives.The company\u2019s goal was to dig up \u201cintelligence which will help the client\u2019s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY Newspaper,\u201d as a contract Mr. Boies signed put it.Mr. Boies told me that he didn\u2019t view any of this as a conflict of interest with his work for The Times. \u201cReporters don\u2019t have a monopoly on investigating facts,\u201d he said. To the extent that Mr. Weinstein was innocent, he said, it was in both his and The Times\u2019s interest to know that. And even if it was a conflict, he noted, there was the waiver The Times had signed.\u201cI think even people who knew Harvey well were shocked,\u201d he added. He called the articles, which won the Pulitzer Prize for public service, \u201cfairly reported, which is what I\u2019d expect from The New York Times and The New Yorker.\u201d At the same time, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not popular to say this, but Harvey is still presumed innocent until proven guilty.\u201dConfronted with the Black Cube revelation and the attempt to undermine its own reporters, The Times promptly fired Mr. Boies. \u201cWe never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters,\u201d The Times said in a statement at the time. \u201cSuch an operation is reprehensible.\u201d\u201cThere was really no debate,\u201d Mr. Baquet told me recently. \u201cWe were outraged. A guy who was working for us was essentially trying to hurt us. It\u2019s not like he was just representing Harvey Weinstein. He was hiring private detectives to deceive journalists. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be ashamed of that.\u201dMr. Boies said he had no idea that Black Cube\u2019s work would include targeting Times reporters working on the story, but he acknowledged it was a mistake to have hired a firm that he didn\u2019t select and over which he had no oversight or control. \u201cAt the time, it seemed a reasonable accommodation for a client, but it was not thought through, and that was my mistake,\u201d he said.Mr. Boies found it difficult to extricate himself from Mr. Weinstein. \u201cI\u2019m probably too reluctant to fire clients,\u201d he said. \u201cA lawyer has a lot of leeway in deciding to take a client. But to abandon a client, especially a client in trouble, is a much higher hurdle.\u201d But in November, he said, he and Mr. Weinstein \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to part company. Mr. Boies said ethical constraints prevented him from saying any more.Mr. Boies said the #MeToo movement represented a \u201crevolution that\u2019s long overdue,\u201d even though \u201cevery revolution causes collateral damage, and to some extent, I\u2019m part of the collateral damage.\u201dAt 77, he is aware that his legacy is at stake. \u201cI guess if it\u2019s a long obituary, this is going to be in there,\u201d he said at lunch at the Four Seasons, referring to the Weinstein and Theranos controversies. \u201cIn the context of 50 years of a high-profile law practice, there are going to be things that make people unhappy. Any time you go through something like this, you reflect on what you might have done differently.\u201dBut he added: \u201cFor 99 percent of the people I deal with, this doesn\u2019t affect them. For some people, mostly in the media, it does affect them. I get that.\u201dOf course, I\u2019m in the media, writing for his former client The Times, but this time he\u2019s not advocating on behalf a client. He\u2019s defending himself. I asked him what that felt like.\u201cSteve Jobs told Walter Isaacson\u201d \u2014 his biographer \u2014 \u201cthat he wanted his children to understand him,\u201d Mr. Boies said. \u201cI get that. When you\u2019re talking about yourself, you tend to be less of an overt advocate. If you want people to understand you, you have to be accurate and complete, blemishes and all.\u201dI asked him to assume I\u2019m the judge and readers the jury. What\u2019s his closing argument? He seemed to relish the challenge.\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a lawyer and to serve the justice system,\u201d he began. \u201cThat\u2019s essential to everything we care about: liberty, equality, inclusiveness, the pursuit of happiness. The justice system protects the weak and limits the strong.\u201cIn America, this is an adversarial process,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn many countries it\u2019s not. History shows that no system does more to protect individual rights and liberties than a system that provides people with a lawyer with complete dedication to the client.\u201cA lawyer can choose what clients to represent. A lawyer does not have the choice of how to represent a client. A lawyer is duty- and honor-bound to represent a client effectively and aggressively, within the bounds of the system itself. And once a lawyer takes on a client, you do not have the right to abandon that client under fire, except in extraordinary circumstances.\u201dBy now he had hit his stride. \u201cIf we decide any class of accused is not deserving of aggressive representation simply because of what they\u2019re accused of, then we undermine the protections that are essential for all of us.\u201dThis was Boies the legendary litigator, spontaneously generating fully formed paragraphs. Evidently, though, Mr. Boies felt he had not made himself fully understood, and a few days later, on a Sunday afternoon, he wrote me an email of more than 1,000 words.\u201cLike I often do following a particularly good discussion (or movie or play), I keep thinking afterward about what we covered,\u201d he began. Doing so seemed to trigger, for the first time in our interactions, an element of wistfulness.Without naming names, but obviously referring to Theranos and Mr. Weinstein, he conceded that \u201cgreater due diligence would have led me to decline the representation\u201d of one. Of the other, \u201cI think I have to acknowledge that I have let loyalty to a client often outweigh revelations that, had I known them earlier, would have led me not to accept the representation initially.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know whether any of this adds anything to what you have,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut it has helped me think through how I feel about these issues.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified one of the news organizations to which Mr. Boies wrote letters to the editor. It was Bloomberg, not The New Yorker.Advertisement"}

The group has endorsed 33 candidates running this year \u2014 14 Republicans and 19 Democrats.Even as he has become the richest person in the world \u2014 and, along the way, a target of politicians \u2014 Mr. Bezos has largely avoided taking ideological sides. Mr. Trump has attacked him on Twitter over his ownership of The Washington Post. Mr. Sanders, the liberal independent from Vermont, has criticized the wages that Amazon pays its warehouse workers.Since the With Honor Fund was established last year, Mr. Bezos\u2019 parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, have given it about $2 million, according to campaign finance filings. Jeff Wilke, who oversees Amazon\u2019s retail business, donated $50,000 to the group, and Tom Alberg, a venture capitalist who is a member of the Amazon board, contributed $5,000, the filings show. The group had collected about $7 million as of late August.The With Honor Fund did not respond to requests for comment.The Bezoses do not appear to have made major donations to veteran-related causes before. Their largest known donation, made this year, was $33 million to finance scholarships for undocumented immigrants who graduated from high schools in the United States.Follow Karen Weise on Twitter: @kyweiseAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democratic Insurgents Topple 6 New York Senate Incumbents", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYears of anger at a group of Democratic state senators who had collaborated with Republicans boiled over on Thursday, as primary voters ousted nearly all of them in favor of challengers who had called them traitors and sham progressives.The losses were not only a resounding upset for the members of the Independent Democratic Conference, who outspent their challengers several times over, but also a sign that the progressive fervor sweeping national politics had hobbled New York\u2019s once-mighty Democratic machine, at least on a local level.\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t prove that political currency is people over money, I do not know what does,\u201d Ms. Biaggi, who spent one-tenth as much as Mr. Klein, said at her victory party. \u201cWe have now cut the head of the I.D.C. snake.\u201dMr. Klein did not appear at his watch party.Also defeated were five other former I.D.C. members: Senators Tony Avella and Jose Peralta in Queens; Senator Jesse Hamilton in Brooklyn; Senator Marisol Alc\u00e1ntara in Manhattan; and Senator David Valesky in Syracuse. They fell to John Liu, Jessica Ramos, Zellnor Myrie, Robert Jackson and Rachel May, respectively.The only former I.D.C. members to survive the primary were Senator Diane Savino, of Staten Island, and Senator David Carlucci, of Rockland County.\u201cThis is a victory for workers,\u201d Ms. Salazar told supporters at a party in Bushwick.In reality, the challengers\u2019 victories alone will have little effect on the fate of progressive legislation in Albany. The true test of that will come in November\u2019s general election, when Democrats seek to flip several Republican-held Senate seats.But the challengers\u2019 wins sent a resounding symbolic message: The restless, impatient mood that has swelled within the national Democratic Party this year had come for local incumbents, too.Ms. Salazar in particular drew comparisons to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned vigorously for Ms. Salazar, dispatching her own volunteers to Brooklyn to canvass for her and promoting her to her large Twitter following.\u201cI think young women are a very visual, but also functional, embodiment of a rebuke of basically New York\u2019s old-boy network,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview at Ms. Biaggi\u2019s party. \u201cAnd voters get that.\u201dThe I.D.C. challengers also allied themselves with Ms. Nixon\u2019s opposition to Mr. Cuomo, and to Zephyr Teachout\u2019s attorney general bid. The Working Families Party, a progressive minor party and frequent antagonist of the governor, endorsed all the challengers and provided training and staff for their campaigns.Bill Lipton, the state director of the W.F.P., cast the I.D.C. losses as a major triumph, even in the face of Ms. Nixon\u2019s defeat.\u201cThe center of gravity has shifted, and Andrew Cuomo will face a radically different Albany,\u201d he said.Still, the divergent fates of the challengers, compared to Ms. Nixon and Ms. Teachout, suggested that the I.D.C. upsets spoke more to the strength of anti-Republican antipathy across the Democratic Party, than of anti-establishment sentiment in its far-left flank.At a polling site in the Bronx, several voters who said they had chosen Ms. Biaggi also picked Mr. Cuomo over Ms. Nixon, citing the governor\u2019s experience.That was also true of many of the establishment figures who endorsed the challengers yet backed Mr. Cuomo, such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Representative Carolyn Maloney and the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson.Indeed, for allies of the insurgent slate that had challenged the Democratic Party machine, the anti-I.D.C. candidates emerged as the only electoral victors of the night.The I.D.C. members had faced primary challenges before, and they had long been a target for Democratic activists. But that anger, for years restricted to only the most politically attuned New Yorkers, crested over the past few months, in tandem with the surge of progressive energy nationwide after the 2016 presidential election.Activists began calling the I.D.C. members \u201cTrump Democrats\u201d and sought to educate voters who knew nothing about their senators\u2019 so-called betrayal.\u201cWe didn\u2019t exist a few months ago, and now we\u2019ve raised over $250,000,\u201d said Jim Casteleiro, the campaign manager of No I.D.C. NY, a volunteer group.Nearly all the voters at the Bronx poll site who backed Ms. Biaggi cited Mr. Klein\u2019s role in the I.D.C. as a motivating factor.\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time for ushering in another Republican majority,\u201d Peter McHugh, 59, said of Mr. Klein.The challengers\u2019 victories boosted the emerging progressive narrative that the old political model \u2014 buying expensive television ads, cozying up to real estate, corralling union support \u2014 had been displaced by vigorous grass-roots organizing.Each challenger outspent his or her opponent on Facebook advertisements, sometimes by a huge margin. Ms. Biaggi and her allies spent between $14,500 and $93,800 on Facebook ads since May, while Mr. Klein and his supporters spent between $2,400 and $14,796.Ms. Salazar adopted similar tactics against Mr. Dilan, who although he was not a member of the I.D.C. was successfully portrayed as another out-of-touch corporate Democrat. The Democratic Socialists of America, of which Ms. Salazar is a member, deployed its full organizing power for her in Brooklyn.A string of negative headlines about Ms. Salazar in the final weeks of the campaign \u2014 suggesting that she had misled reporters and voters about her immigration status, religious background and socioeconomic status \u2014 seemed to have little impact.Still, Lina Newton, a political-science professor at Hunter College, noted the geographic limitations to the grass-roots organizing that has propelled the insurgent candidates to victory. Ms. Nixon, after all, deployed similar tactics in a statewide race to no avail.\u201cPersonal outreach is much more important on a local level,\u201d Professor Newton said.And on that local level on Thursday, it was potent. Ms. Biaggi, in an interview, gestured to the sneakers on her feet, calling the previous hours \u201cthe most exhausting day in my life.\u201dFor Mr. Klein, she had a simple message: \u201cIt was a tough fight. And, I should also say, we should thank him for his service,\u201d she said. \u201cBut his time is up.\u201dMariana Alfaro, Nate Schweber and Angela Macropoulos contributed reportingAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Does Originalism Matter Anymore?", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo the \u2018originalists\u2019 on the Supreme Court, apparently not.Mr. Segall teaches constitutional law at Georgia State University.Much has been made over whether Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an originalist.But does it really matter? Not much, if you look at the recent rulings of other Supreme Court justices who have said they interpret the Constitution by reading its provisions as they were understood at the time they were written. For the record, Judge Kavanaugh was asked at his confirmation hearing Wednesday whether he was an originalist. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered, \u201coriginal public meaning, as informed by precedent.\u201d But will Judge Kavanaugh actually be a justice who will follow that approach? A look at the two justices who have professed fidelity to the doctrine is instructive.The problem with these appeals to originalism, and the impartiality they connote, is that they have not held true in practice. Which is why to critics, and I\u2019m one of them, the label of originalist strikes us as a cover for imposing conservative value judgments. Justice Gorsuch has only been on the court for a term and a half, but he has already joined with Justice Thomas (and the other conservatives) several times to strike down state laws without relying on originalist sources. In the union and political apparel cases, Justices Thomas and Gorsuch joined majority opinions written by Justices Samuel Alito and John Roberts that did not rely on original meaning. In the union case, for example, Justice Alito wrote that we \u201ccan safely say that, at the time of the adoption of the First Amendment, no one gave any thought to whether public sector unions could charge nonmembers agency fees.\u201d One prominent originalist, Michael Ramsey, a law professor at the University of San Diego, and a former clerk to Justice Scalia, said about this case, \u201cI do not see the originalist argument for the challengers in this case.\u201d The reality is that, as the law professors Will Baude of the University of Chicago and Eugene Volokh of U.C.L.A. argued in an amicus brief, neither free speech principles nor prior case law supported the justices\u2019 decision to overrule the policy judgments of almost half the states on how to regulate public sector unions.All of which is to say that, for these originalists, originalism didn\u2019t figure very importantly, if at all, in how they cast their votes on some of the court\u2019s most consequential recent cases. Instead, they used, for their own ends, the same type of values-based living constitutionalism that they and other conservative jurists and politicians typically decry.Advertisement"}
