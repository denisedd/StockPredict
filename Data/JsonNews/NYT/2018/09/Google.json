Whether the timing was simply a coincidence with the recent problems plaguing the company or not, investors and employees are not going to look at this development positively.

While the firm\u2019s elite enjoy high salaries and perks, the rank-and-file fare worse:Analysts and associates, who spoke to Fox Business on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, say Goldman has cut back on benefits for the average worker more than any other bank on Wall Street. They base their assessment on both personal experience, as well as anecdotal evidence gleaned from employees at other big banks.But investors may be growing wary of all this ambition.

The companies that control this market are among the most powerful and valuable the world has ever seen. We cannot expect them to regulate themselves.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s China Fight Puts U.S. Tech in the Cross Hairs", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says his trade war with China will protect America\u2019s dominance and derail Beijing\u2019s plan for technological and economic supremacy.Mr. Trump\u2019s next round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods goes into effect on Monday, hitting thousands of consumer products from handbags to refrigerators to bicycles. The tariffs will also hit the tech and telecom companies that provide much of the gear that powers the internet, mobile networks, data storage and other technology. United States customs will begin collecting a tax on circuit boards, semiconductors, cell tower radios, modems and other products made and assembled in China and exported into America.Those tariffs, Intel warned in a letter last month, are \u201ca game changer for the American consumer.\u201d The tariffs begin at a rate of 10 percent and increase to 25 percent next January.Like American automakers and other manufacturers, the tech sector has increasingly outsourced production to China, where manufacturing and assembly of products is cheaper than in the United States. In recent decades, Intel, Dell, and Apple began shifting manufacturing overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and align operations closer to customers in emerging markets.Intel, for instance, designs and manufactures most semiconductors in the United States but relies on Chinese facilities for assembly of their chips, which will now be taxed. Moving those manufacturing and assembly operations outside of China is unrealistic, the company has warned, saying \u201cit is too expensive to relocate established and integrated supply chains.\u201dGoogle, Dell, IBM and others say the tariffs will increase costs for companies and consumers, hindering America\u2019s ability to dominate the next generation of technology, like 5G wireless networks. Rising prices, the industries say, will slow business growth, increase costs for consumers and put other nations, like China, in a more competitive position to dominate tech.\u201cThe tariffs affect the heart of the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank financed by tech companies including Microsoft, Google and Intel. \u201cIf we are going to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, we should impose them on items that hurt the Chinese, not us.\u201dMr. Trump does not share that view, seeing the tariffs as a weapon to force China to change trade practices that the administration \u2014 and many companies, including tech firms \u2014 say are unfair.\u201cChina is engaged in numerous unfair policies and practices relating to United States technology and intellectual property \u2014 such as forcing United States companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement last week.Tech companies agree that China has long pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business in China or engaged in outright theft of intellectual property. But they argue that using tariffs as a retaliatory measure will hurt American companies while doing little to change China\u2019s ways.Tech and telecommunications products are among the fastest growing imports from China. In 2014, electronics accounted for 40 percent of all Chinese imports, according to the United States International Trade Commission. While the total value of telecommunications parts affected by the latest round of tariffs is unclear, the Telecommunications Industry Association estimates \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in extra costs for companies.The impact on the industry is amplified by the timing, as the United States and China race one another to dominate the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks, known as 5G. The faster networks will fuel the use of artificial intelligence in driverless cars and robotics and other technologies used by military. Companies have warned that the administration\u2019s tariffs will undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s stated plan to lead in those areas.\u201cThese latest duties threaten to raise the cost of 5G infrastructure in the U.S. by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Nokia officials told the F.C.C., according to public filings.\u201cOf course, this is related to some of the product that we import into the U.S. that is manufactured in China, and we are very much focused on mitigating that manufacturing,\u201d Micron\u2019s chief executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in an interview on CNBC.Other companies are weighing legal options. A leading trade group, the Consumer Technology Association, which represents 2,000 tech companies, said the administration is overstepping its authority on trade policy and is considering legal action against the administration.\u201cWe are exploring all options,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the association\u2019s president, said when asked if his group would sue the administration. \u201cThe tariffs will stifle our global leadership in 5G, create and internet tax on business and cause uncertainty for companies.\u201dThe inclusion of tech products only increased tension between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Silicon Valley has sparred with Mr. Trump on immigration. Mr. Trump accused tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google of political bias against conservatives and Amazon of avoiding tax payments. The companies have refuted the president\u2019s claims.Some companies have been partially spared. After intense lobbying by Apple and Fitbit, the Trump administration removed several consumer electronics products from the latest round of tariffs. Left off the list are technologies that affect Apple\u2019s Watch and other fitness trackers, AirPod earbuds and wireless speakers. The administration spared a total of 300 products from an earlier proposal drafted in July.On Friday, a senior administration official who has been engaged in trade negotiations defended the decision to offer relief to Apple\u2019s products. In a briefing with reporters at the White House, the official rejected the notion that winners and losers were being determined based on lobbying power.\u201cThis has been talked about a lot as an Apple issue, Apple has been very vocal about it, but the tariff lines that have been exempted, they applied to a whole range of companies in addition to Apple,\u201d the official said, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the trade battle with China would be resolved.When asked about the exemptions of Apple\u2019s products, Mr. Cook said that while the iPhone is assembled in China, many parts are made and developed in the United States. The tariffs would cost a company like Apple when it imports devices assembled in China.\u201cI think they looked at this and said that it\u2019s not really great for the United States to put a tariff on those type of products,\u201d Mr. Cook said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Nokia\u2019s headquarters. It is Finland, not Sweden.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "One Face of Immigration in America Is a Family Tree Rooted in Asia", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 The young engineer arrived in America when he was 23 with a good education and little else. He landed a job at a nuclear test site, and built a home in Nevada. Between the 1970s and the mid-1980s, he brought his wife, mother, five sisters and a brother over from India, his native land.In later years, his siblings sponsored family members of their own, and their clan now stretches from Nevada to Florida, New Jersey to Texas \u2014 more than 90 Americans nurtured on the strength of one ambitious engineer, Jagdish Patel, 72.In late June, four generations of Patels assembled for a reunion in Las Vegas, a gathering that included a venture capitalist, a network engineer, physicians, dentists and students.\u201cI am so glad that I came to America,\u201d Mr. Patel said recently, sitting in the custom-designed house he built in Las Vegas, complete with a home theater where he hosts Super Bowl parties and a marble-lined Hindu temple room. \u201cI brought everyone here,\u201d he said, \u201cand we have provided valuable service to this country.\u201dSince the Patels began flocking to America in the 1970s, millions of other Indians have arrived to work as programmers and engineers in Silicon Valley, doctors in underserved rural areas and researchers at universities. The majority were sponsored by relatives who came before them. Others arrived on work visas and were later sponsored for legal residency, or green cards, by their employers.The Trump administration has framed immigration as a threat to the nation\u2019s security and to American workers, a drastic departure from the longtime consensus that immigration was a net positive for the country. The president\u2019s public priorities have often focused on fortifying the southwest border, but his administration is also working to scale back decades of legal migration that have led to Asians, not Latin Americans, becoming the largest group of new foreign-born residents since 2010.Already, the administration has quietly begun taking steps to cut back legal immigration, under the banner of \u201cBuy American and Hire American,\u201d which the president framed in an executive order last year. Some experts predict that the number of immigrants granted permanent legal residency in the 2018 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, will show a rare decline.Without passing new legislation, the administration has pursued a number of policies that are slowing legal immigration. It has reduced refugee admissions; narrowed who is eligible for asylum; made it more difficult to qualify for permanent residency or citizenship; and tightened scrutiny of applicants for high-skilled worker visas, known as H-1Bs.A recent analysis of government data by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, found that the denial rate for H-1B visa petitions had jumped by 41 percent in the last three months of the 2017 fiscal year, compared with the previous quarter. Government requests for additional information on applications doubled in the same period.Green-card applicants sponsored by an employer now must undergo in-person interviews, a step that previously was taken only in cases that raised concerns.The Trump administration is pushing policies supposedly intended to favor immigrants who have valuable skills at a time when newcomers already are, on average, at their most educated. Nearly half of all foreign-born people who have arrived since 2010 have college degrees, compared with about 30 percent of native-born residents.\u201cWe are having this debate about getting our system to be merit-based, but it really in effect already is one,\u201d said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C. \u201cThe least-known fact about legal immigration to the U.S. is that it\u2019s much more educated than the general U.S. population.\u201dOf the 1.1 million green cards granted in 2017, about two-thirds went to people sponsored by relatives, compared to just 12 percent who were sponsored through employment.Immigration has taken center stage in many Republican election campaigns this year. Representative Ron DeSantis, the party\u2019s candidate for governor of Florida, released a video in which he tells his daughter to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d as she plays with blocks. Brian Kemp, the Republican nominee for governor of Georgia, ran an ad saying he would \u201cround up criminal illegals\u201d in his pickup truck.\u201cThe big story here is just the massive misperception about the nature of immigration in the U.S.,\u201d said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who specializes in immigration policy. \u201cThe lion\u2019s share of public attention is focused on what is now a very small number of people coming here illegally and showing up at the border seeking asylum.\u201cThe reality is that a growing percentage of immigrants coming to the U.S. are highly educated, and are exactly the sort of people we want to be attracting.\u201dSupporters of Mr. Trump\u2019s position say that this trend is an incidental result of a policy that does not guarantee such an outcome.\u201cWe need to construct a system that discourages endless chains of relatives coming in,\u201d said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports curbs on immigration. \u201cWe have an immigration system that rewards people who have relatives in the United States, rather than people who have skills and education.\u201dMichael Bars, a spokesman for United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency which is focusing most of the new scrutiny on legal immigration, said the government\u2019s aim is not to close the borders but to protect against fraud, human trafficking and gang activity, \u201cdefending our system from those seeking to exploit it at the expense of U.S. workers, lawful-abiding applicants and petitioners.\u201dThere are still an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, and that represents a major political issue.\u201cEleven million people is not a small number,\u201d said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the Pew Research Center \u201cBut it is certainly the case that unauthorized immigration from Mexico is getting a lot more attention than the numbers seem to warrant.\u201d Mr. Passel said fewer Mexicans were caught at the border in fiscal 2017, which ended on Sept. 30, than in any year since the late 1960s.Under the Trump administration\u2019s plan, the number of family-based green cards issued would be reduced from the 804,793 granted in 2016 to about 487,000 a year, according to an analysis by Julia Gelatt and Sarah Pierce of the Migration Policy Institute \u2014 a 40 percent reduction in family-tied green cards and a 27 percent reduction overall.\u201cTrump is the first of any modern president to advocate for reducing legal immigration,\u201d Ms. Pierce said.Currently, American citizens like Mr. Patel can sponsor minor children, unmarried and married adult children, and spouses, parents and brothers and sisters. Green-card holders are limited to sponsoring minor children and unmarried adult children.Under the new proposal, Americans would lose the right to petition for their parents, adult or married children, or siblings; they could sponsor only spouses and minor children. Green-card holders would be limited further, to sponsoring minor children only, not adult children.The current system dates to 1965, when Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act, which wiped away the old system of country quotas established in the 1920s that many considered racist. The idea was to treat people from all countries equally, and the law\u2019s central pillar was to give American citizens the ability to invite family members who were still abroad. It also allowed for some immigration based on skills.Some experts argue that the real implications of the 1965 law are only now dawning on the wider population, as the face of the country changes \u2014 and that realization is what has been driving much of the emotion in politics.\u201cThe 1965 act really changed the look and feel of the country in a fundamental way, but it took 50 years for the country to come to terms with that,\u201d said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the New York office of the Migration Policy Institute.Madeline Hsu, a professor of Asian-American studies at the University of Austin, Texas, said there were only about 12,000 Indian immigrants in the United States in 1960. The foreign-born Indian population last year stood at about 2.6 million, according to the Brookings Institution, and it had risen by almost half since 2010.The 1965 law opened up the United States to people from India like Jagdish Patel.He recalls that at his engineering college back in the Indian state of Gujarat, \u201cwhen America started to allow people from different countries to come, we all decided to get ready to go.\u201dMr. Patel immigrated in 1968 and enrolled at Youngstown State University in Ohio, where he earned a master\u2019s degree in structural engineering. He returned in 1971 to marry, and because he had a green card, he was able to sponsor his wife, Amita.In 1977, he became a United States citizen, and sponsored his brother Jay and Jay\u2019s wife for green cards. By 1985, he had also sponsored his mother, five sisters and their husbands and children, most of whom settled in the New York-New Jersey area.And he had American-born children of his own. His son, Satya, is now a venture capitalist in San Francisco, after working as an executive at Google and at Twitter; his daughter, Sita Montgomery, is an interior designer in Salt Lake City with 140,000 followers on Instagram.Now retired, Mr. Patel savors time to play golf and to travel \u2014 so far, he has visited 50 countries. He devoted a year to planning the Patel reunion in June.The eldest Patel to attend the event, which included bowling, banquet dinners and a talent show, was 88; the youngest was nine months old. Mr. Patel gave each attendee a royal-blue booklet, its cover emblazoned with a crown and the words \u201cRoyal Patel Family Reunion.\u201d Its pages depict the sprawling Patel family tree, starting in India.\u201cAll this Twitter and campaign stuff is mostly just talk,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump knows in his mind that immigration works.

{"Headline": "Edward Whelan, Conservative Strategist, Takes Leave of Absence After Kavanaugh Tweets", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe leader of a prominent conservative research organization who suggested that Christine Blasey Ford mistakenly accused Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her while in high school, and who built a case against one of his classmates, will take a leave of absence from the organization, its board announced on Sunday.Mr. Whelan could not be reached for comment by phone or email on Sunday night.Dr. Blasey, a California professor, has said that in high school, the future Judge Kavanaugh pushed her onto a bed, where he jumped on top of her, groped her and tried to remove her clothing \u2014 at one point, placing his hand over her mouth to stop calls for help. Judge Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nominee, has denied the accusation, which has put his confirmation in jeopardy.On Thursday, Mr. Whelan \u2014 a well-connected member of Washington\u2019s conservative legal establishment \u2014 posted the string of tweets, for which he was swiftly condemned. In the tweets, he posited a theory that Dr. Blasey\u2019s account could alternatively describe a student at Georgetown Prep, where Judge Kavanaugh went to high school, whom Mr. Whelan identified as a friend and football teammate. Using photographs from Georgetown Prep\u2019s yearbook, Google Maps and floor plans of a home that he identifies as the classmate\u2019s, Mr. Whelan built an argument that details of Dr. Blasey\u2019s account fit the classmate\u2019s home.Mr. Whelan proceeded to post recent and high school photos of the classmate and Judge Kavanaugh, suggesting that their similar appearance could easily confuse someone.Although he apologized Friday for what he called \u201can appalling and inexcusable mistake of judgment,\u201d he has not publicly apologized to Dr. Blasey or for his broader theory of mistaken identity, and in several other posts he has sought to cast doubt on her claims.In a statement through her lawyers, Dr. Blasey has flatly rejected the possibility that she had confused Judge Kavanaugh with the classmate identified by Mr. Whelan.The man identified in the Twitter thread has not replied to phone messages seeking comment, and The New York Times is not naming him.Advertisement"}

Why isn\u2019t anyone trying to fix them?Supported byAnd now, it emerged, someone was trying to infiltrate the election system itself. The Illinois intruders had quietly breached the network in June and spent weeks conducting reconnaissance. After alighting on the state\u2019s voter-registration database, they downloaded information on hundreds of thousands of voters. Then something went wrong, and the attackers crashed a server, alerting officials to their presence.It soon became clear that this would not be the last attack. In early August, Jenkins learned of another breach, this one on an Arizona state website, and it appeared to come from one of the same I.P. addresses that had been used to attack Illinois. This time, the intruders installed malware, as if setting the stage for further assault. Then reports from other states began to pour in, saying that the same I.P. addresses appeared to be probing their voter-registration networks. Against that backdrop, the D.N.C. hack was looking less like an isolated incident.\u201cWe started to ask: Are these things related?\u201d Jenkins recalled. \u201cAre they the same actors? Is this some kind of concerted effort?\u201d He and his team realized that if Russian hackers were trying to disrupt the coming elections, D.H.S. needed to quickly get in touch with the state and local officials who ran them. But whom do you call when there are more than 10,000 election jurisdictions in the United States?Jenkins at first assumed that each state had a chief information officer who oversaw election security \u2014 but this turned out to be wrong. A staff member suggested that the Federal Election Commission must be the governing body over elections \u2014 but the F.E.C., they quickly realized, was focused on campaign finance, not election systems. Then a colleague did a Google search on election administration and came across the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, the federal body created by Congress in 2002 to serve as a federal liaison with state election officials. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed to admit I didn\u2019t know that the E.A.C. existed,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI would say that I\u2019m not the only person working in the federal government that this was true for. This topic is not something that was really on anybody\u2019s big radar.\u201dJenkins planned a call for mid-August for his boss, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, to discuss the problem with members of the E.A.C. and the National Association of Secretaries of State. But Jenkins\u2019s knowledge of election hacking was limited to a conference panel he was on six months earlier about the security of internet voting. Although most American voters cast ballots in person or by mail, 31 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of internet voting to military personnel and citizens living overseas. Jenkins, concerned that Russian hackers might interfere with those ballots, intended to offer election officials a simple plan: \u201cWe were going to tell them that internet voting wasn\u2019t safe, and it was a risk factor and you need to not do it.\u201dBut when Jenkins met E.A.C. officials and the executive director of the National Association of Secretaries of State for a brief discussion before the scheduled call, what was supposed to be a half-hour meeting bled into four hours, as he and his staff got a crash course in election administration. Internet voting, they learned, was the least of their concerns; the real problems were the machines used to cast and tally votes and the voter-registration databases the Russians had already shown interest in hacking. The entire system \u2014 a Rube Goldberg mix of poorly designed machinery, from websites and databases that registered and tracked voters, to electronic poll books that verified their eligibility, to the various black-box systems that recorded, tallied and reported results \u2014 was vulnerable.In August 2016, though, there was no time to address systemic problems. Many states would begin early voting in five to six weeks, and the machines themselves had to be programmed and locked down well in advance of Election Day. The Department of Homeland Security had to settle for doing Band-Aid security before the election, and even then only with states that requested help \u2014 mostly this involved remote-scanning internet-facing servers for known software vulnerabilities that could be patched, and providing a list of security best practices, like making sure vote-tabulation machines were not connected to the internet. Jenkins said the problems the agency couldn\u2019t address were \u201ctroubling\u201d but beyond its control. \u201cYou could spend years working on connectivity between voting machines and ballot-creating devices and try to get those things fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re trying to do something quickly with a group of people who are resource-constrained as severely as election officials are, you kind of have to focus where you can focus.\u201dTwo years later, as the 2018 elections approach, the American intelligence community is issuing increasingly dire warnings about potential interference from Russia and other countries, but the voting infrastructure remains largely unchanged. D.H.S. has now conducted remote-scanning and on-site assessments of state and county election systems, but these are still largely Band-Aid measures applied to internet-facing servers. They don\u2019t address core vulnerabilities in voting machines or the systems used to program them. And they ignore the fact that many voting machines that elections officials insist are disconnected from the internet \u2014 and therefore beyond the reach of hackers \u2014 are in fact accessible by way of the modems they use to transmit vote totals on election night. Add to this the fact that states don\u2019t conduct robust postelection audits \u2014 a manual comparison of paper ballots to digital tallies is the best method we have to detect when something has gone wrong in an election \u2014 and there\u2019s a good chance we simply won\u2019t know if someone has altered the digital votes in the next election.The ballot box is the foundation of any democracy. It\u2019s not too grand to say that if there\u2019s a failure in the ballot box, then democracy fails. If the people don\u2019t have confidence in the outcome of an election, then it becomes difficult for them to accept the policies and actions that pour forth from it. And in the United States, it\u2019s safe to say, though few may utter it publicly, that the ballot box has failed many times and is poised to fail again.With optical-scan machines, voters fill out paper ballots and feed them into a scanner, which stores a digital image of the ballot and records the votes on a removable memory card. The paper ballot, in theory, provides an audit trail that can be used to verify digital tallies. But not all states perform audits, and many that do simply run the paper ballots through a scanner a second time. Fewer than half the states do manual audits, and they typically examine ballots from randomly chosen precincts in a county, instead of a percentage of ballots from all precincts. If the randomly chosen precincts aren\u2019t ones where hacking occurred or where machines failed to accurately record votes, an audit won\u2019t reveal anything \u2014 nor will it always catch problems with early-voting, overseas or absentee ballots, all of which are often scanned in county election offices, not in precincts.Direct-recording electronic machines, or D.R.E.s, present even more auditing problems. Voters use touch screens or other input devices to make selections on digital-only ballots, and votes are stored electronically. Many D.R.E.s have printers that produce what\u2019s known as a voter-verifiable paper audit trail \u2014 a scroll of paper, behind a window, that voters can review before casting their ballots. But the paper trail doesn\u2019t provide the same integrity as full-size ballots and optical-scan machines, because a hacker could conceivably rig the machine to print a voter\u2019s selections correctly on the paper while recording something else on the memory card. About 80 percent of voters today cast ballots either on D.R.E.s that produce a paper trail or on scanned paper ballots. But five states still use paperless D.R.E.s exclusively, and an additional 10 states use paperless D.R.E.s in some jurisdictions.The voting-machine industry \u2014 an estimated $300-million-a-year business \u2014 has long been as troubling as the machines it makes, known for its secrecy, close political ties (overwhelmingly to the Republican Party) and a revolving door between vendors and election offices. More than a dozen companies currently sell voting equipment, but a majority of machines used today come from just four \u2014 Diebold Election Systems, Election Systems & Software (ES&S), Hart InterCivic and Sequoia Voting Systems. Diebold (later renamed Premier) and Sequoia are now out of business. Diebold\u2019s machines and customer contracts were sold to ES&S and a Canadian company called Dominion, and Dominion also acquired Sequoia. This means that more than 80 percent of the machines in use today are under the purview of three companies \u2014 Dominion, ES&S and Hart InterCivic.Many of the products they make have documented vulnerabilities and can be subverted in multiple ways. Hackers can access voting machines via the cellular modems used to transmit unofficial results at the end of an election, or subvert back-end election-management systems \u2014 used to program the voting machines and tally votes \u2014 and spread malicious code to voting machines through them. Attackers could design their code to bypass pre-election testing and kick in only at the end of an election or under specific conditions \u2014 say, when a certain candidate appears to be losing \u2014 and erase itself afterward to avoid detection. And they could make it produce election results with wide margins to avoid triggering automatic manual recounts in states that require them when results are close.Hackers could also target voting-machine vendors and use this trusted channel to distribute their code. Last year a security researcher stumbled across an unsecured ES&S server that left passwords exposed for its employee accounts. Although the passwords were encrypted, a nation-state with sufficient resources would most likely be able to crack them, the researcher noted. Since ES&S creates ballot-definition files before each election for some customers \u2014 the critical programming files that tell machines how to apportion votes based on a voter\u2019s screen touch or marks on a paper ballot \u2014 a malicious actor able to get into ES&S\u2019s network could conceivably corrupt these files so machines misinterpret a vote for Donald Trump, say, as one for his opponent, or vice versa.Did anything like that happen in 2016? The Department of Homeland Security, the intelligence community and election officials have all insisted that there is no evidence that Russian hackers altered votes in 2016. But the truth is that no one has really looked for evidence. Intelligence assessments are based on signals intelligence \u2014 spying on Russian communications and computers for chatter or activity indicating that they altered votes \u2014 not on a forensic examination of voting machines and election networks. \u201cWe should always be careful to point out that there hasn\u2019t been any evidence that votes were changed in any election in this way, and that\u2019s a true fact,\u201d said Matt Blaze, a computer-science professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a voting-machine-security expert. \u201cIt\u2019s just less comforting than it might sound at first glance, because we haven\u2019t looked very hard.\u201d Even if experts were to look, it\u2019s not clear what they would find, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to do a pretty good job of erasing all the forensic evidence.\u201dAnd targeting voting machines is just one way to subvert elections. A hacker (or inside operator) could target voters themselves by deleting their names from the voter roll and electronic poll book \u2014 the device used at polling places to verify a voter\u2019s eligibility. Or change their precinct assignments to send them to the wrong location, creating chaos and frustration that causes them to leave without voting. Bad actors could also undermine election results by altering tallies as they are transmitted to county offices on election night or posted to public websites. Although these are unofficial results, any discrepancy between these and official tallies compiled days after an election would sow distrust in the outcome, particularly if the winner of a race changes.The stakes are high when it comes to election security, and the concerns about Russian hackers are warranted. But the focus on Russia, or any would-be election manipulators, ignores the underlying issue \u2014 the myriad vulnerabilities that riddle the system and the ill-considered decisions that got us here. The mad history of election security in the United States is a history of how misguided politicians and na\u00efve election officials allowed an unregulated industry to seize control of America\u2019s democratic infrastructure.[Read about Amendment 4, the ballot that could enfranchise more people at once than any single initiative since women\u2019s suffrage, but could also change the Florida electorate.] Deborah Tannenbaum had a front-row seat for what occurred that night. A Democratic Party field director in Florida, she refreshed her web browser frequently as returns came in from around the county. At 10 p.m., Al Gore was ahead in Volusia, with 83,000 votes to George W. Bush\u2019s 62,000. Things were going well for Gore across the state, and exit polls projected a six-point lead for him. But then something changed. \u201cI had stepped out, and one of the assistants came, and he\u2019s just like, \u2018I need you to come here and verify the numbers,\u2019\u2009\u201d Tannenbaum recalled. When she looked at the county\u2019s website, Gore\u2019s total had dropped 16,000 votes. Tannenbaum called the county election office, alarmed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on down there, but you can\u2019t take away votes!\u201d she said.Unfortunately for Gore, reporters were focused on overall state returns and didn\u2019t notice the funny numbers. At 7:52 p.m., Voter News Service \u2014 a consortium of media outlets reporting election results \u2014 projected Gore the Florida winner based on exit polls. But when the Volusia County numbers changed at 10 p.m., and Brevard County subsequently posted results inadvertently missing 4,000 votes for Gore, Bush shot into the lead; news outlets retracted their call for Gore and called the state for Bush. Gore was on his way to make a concession speech at 3 a.m. when he learned the numbers were wrong.Volusia officials blamed the mishap on a faulty memory card. The county used optical-scan machines made by Global Election Systems (a Canadian company later acquired by Diebold and renamed Diebold Election Systems), which the county had used since 1996. When the election ended, poll workers were supposed to transmit results to the county election office via modem; but the transmission failed, so a worker drove the memory card in, where officials inserted it directly into the election-management system to tally results. Logs for that computer, however, showed two memory cards for Precinct 216 inserted, an hour apart. The vote totals went haywire after the second card was loaded.Beyond the mystery of the two cards, there was another problem with this explanation. A faulty memory card should produce an onscreen error message or cause a computer to lock up, not alter votes in one race while leaving others untouched. And what kind of faulty card deleted votes only for Gore, while adding votes to other candidates?Ultimately, the phantom card was forgotten in the battle that ensued over dangling chads in other counties. Gore\u2019s team requested manual recounts in four counties, including Volusia, but a Supreme Court ruling on Dec. 12 halted them, though not before Volusia completed its recount. The manual tally of optical-scan ballots in Precinct 216 gave Gore 193 votes, Bush 22 and Harris 0. Bush won Florida, and by extension the presidency, by just 537 votes.To this day, questions about the Volusia card remain unanswered. Internal emails from Global Election Systems later leaked to Bev Harris, an election-integrity activist, show that the manufacturer itself remained unsure about what happened. When a Volusia County elections worker named Lana Hires requested an explanation from Global, the response was vague. Talbot Iredale, a Global developer, responded that a corrupt memory card remained \u201cthe most likely explanation for the problem but since I know nothing about the \u2018second\u2019 memory card I have no ability to confirm the probability of this.\u201d He then suggested a more ominous explanation. \u201cThere is always the possibility that the \u2018second memory card\u2019 or \u2018second upload\u2019 came from an unauthorized source.\u201d To which a Global colleague replied: \u201cHeh. Second shooter theory. All we need now is a grassy knoll.\u201dThe memory card in Volusia vividly demonstrated the kind of problems that could occur if states expanded their use of electronic voting machines without proper safeguards. But even as security experts showed how malicious insiders and outsiders could subvert the machines, the warnings went ignored.Computers had been used in elections ever since the 1960s, when punch cards and computerized card readers and tabulators were introduced. And experts had been warning for just as long about the danger of placing too much trust in them. A 1969 front-page article in The Los Angeles Times described a \u201cwar games\u201d exercise to determine if Los Angeles County\u2019s new computerized punch-card readers and tabulators could be rigged without detection. Three computer scientists on the offensive team faced off against three computer scientists on defense. \u201cIn each test, the offensive team won,\u201d the paper reported; the team\u2019s \u201chighly sophisticated techniques\u201d were neither detected nor prevented. The importance of paper ballots to back up and verify digital vote tallies was also underscored by numerous election mishaps over the years. In Rock Island County, Ill., in 1984, for every one vote cast for a particular candidate, a computer tabulator gave him two; it also failed to count \u201cno\u201d votes on a referendum. In Moline, Ill., in 1985, a punch-card reader elected the wrong candidate for City Council by failing to properly count some votes; a recount flipped the race.Hoyer insists that the subject of security and paper trails didn\u2019t come up when lawmakers were developing HAVA. But Rebecca Mercuri disputes this. A computer scientist at Bryn Mawr at the time, she told the House science committee \u2014 in a hearing that was meant to inform the lawmakers writing HAVA \u2014 that \u201cany programmer can write code that displays one thing on the screen, records something else and prints out something else as an entirely different result. I have freshmen, by the way, who can do this. There is no known way to ensure that this is not happening inside of a voting system.\u201dThe experts also recognized even then that voting machines wouldn\u2019t be secure if there weren\u2019t adequate standards for testing and certifying them. Douglas W. Jones, a computer-science professor at the University of Iowa and the chairman of a board that tested and approved machines used in his state, testified to the science committee that the voting machines available to replace punch-card and lever machines weren\u2019t secure, largely because the standards didn\u2019t require them to be. The standards were created in the 1980s, when security was a nascent field and touch-screen D.R.E.s didn\u2019t exist. He advised lawmakers against issuing large-scale funding for new machines until better standards and machines were available.But few in Congress took the critics seriously. Although lawmakers did include a provision in HAVA mandating the creation of new standards \u2014 with the aim that machines bought with HAVA funds would meet them \u2014 the purchasing deadlines they included in the bill forced states to buy their machines before the new standards could be completed in 2005 (they took effect in 2007). In October 2002, the bill passed with broad bipartisan support, and the clock began ticking down to the November 2004 deadline to replace punch-card machines.And with that, the gold rush was on, as a small group of vendors with little security expertise began lining up to win billions of dollars of federal money. Most of that money ended up going to buy D.R.E.s. In 2000, just 9 percent of American voting precincts were using D.R.E.s. After HAVA passed, the proportion ballooned to 67 percent. The basic technology was not new; the first direct-recording electronic voting machines went on sale in 1974, and touch-screen versions were introduced in the mid-90s. But before HAVA, election officials who wanted electronic machines generally chose optical-scan systems. Each machine was more expensive, but you needed fewer per polling place, because voters could fill out the ballots in simple booths and then quickly scan them.The new D.R.E. machines did offer real advantages. With direct recording, counties no longer had to print hundreds of thousands of paper ballots or store them for 22 months after a federal election, as federal law required. And the machines could be adapted to voter needs, by displaying digital ballots in multiple languages and font sizes. They also satisfied the accessibility requirement in HAVA, offering Braille keyboards, audio instruction and other aids for physically impaired voters.Under HAVA, states had to purchase only one accessible machine per precinct and could provide optical-scan systems for other voters. But some counties bought D.R.E.s exclusively, swayed in part by the National Federation of the Blind, which insisted that HAVA, in calling for \u201cuniform and nondiscriminatory election technology,\u201d required states to provide identical equipment for all voters. This interpretation benefited vendors, of course, who were more than happy to sell counties their most expensive systems.In November 2002, just days after Bush signed HAVA into law, Georgia underwent the nation\u2019s first major test of D.R.E.s. The state had signed a $54 million contract with Diebold to use its paperless D.R.E.s exclusively statewide. As the November midterm elections approached, the company scrambled to get the machines in place for one of the closest races for governor that Georgia had seen \u2014 between Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, and his Republican challenger, Sonny Perdue. Perdue won with just 51 percent of votes in a major upset. It was the first time in more than 130 years that a Republican became governor of Georgia. This wasn\u2019t the only upset. Senator Max Cleland, a popular Democrat, went into Election Day leading his Republican opponent, Saxby Chambliss, by three points; he lost by seven.Over the next several years, reports commissioned by officials in California, Maryland and Ohio found more problems with Diebold machines and similar issues with machines from other manufacturers. Problems with voting machines in elections were also making headlines. In 2002 in North Carolina, for example, D.R.E.s made by ES&S failed to record 436 entire ballots during early voting in Wake County, a failure the company attributed to a software bug. Two years later, in Jacksonville, N.C., a D.R.E. made by UniLect lost more than 4,500 ballots when its memory became full and stopped recording; it continued to let voters cast ballots, however, instead of locking up. The incidents that made headlines were disturbing enough, but the real concerns were the ones that weren\u2019t being caught.The troublesome 2004 presidential election in Ohio, in which Kerry was denied access to the voting software, provided a strong case for why paper and audits were necessary. A lot of Ohio counties still used punch cards, but some had adopted D.R.E.s and optical-scan systems. For one precinct of Franklin County, which used D.R.E.s made by a company called Danaher Control, the election-management system tallied 4,258 votes for Bush, though only 638 voters cast ballots. When officials pulled votes stored in the D.R.E., Bush\u2019s total was 365. In Mahoning County, voters using 25 D.R.E.s made by ES&S found that when they touched the screens to vote for John Kerry, the machines interpreted it as a vote for Bush, not an uncommon problem when touch screens are poorly calibrated. \u201cUndervoting\u201d \u2014 when a ballot shows no vote in a particular race \u2014 was also exceptionally high in the state. Democratic precincts across Ohio had 75 percent more undervotes than predominantly Republican ones. In two precincts in Montgomery County that used punch-card machines, the computer tabulators indicated that 6,000 ballots had no vote for president \u2014 an undervote rate of 25 percent, while 2 percent is normal. A congressional inquiry found \u201cnumerous serious election irregularities\u201d in Ohio but ultimately couldn\u2019t conclude whether fraud had occurred.The incidents in Ohio demonstrated that American elections still had integrity problems, but there was little constituency for change. In 2005, Holt introduced a variation of his 2003 reform bill, and once again it quickly died, in part because voting-machine vendors launched a formidable lobbying effort to quash the requirement of paper trails. Some state election officials joined the effort, arguing that adding printers to D.R.E.s would create problems for elderly poll workers if the printers jammed or ran out of paper. The American Association of People With Disabilities was also remarkably effective in lobbying against paper trails, arguing that they discriminated against blind voters, even though the same audio that assisted blind voters to mark their digital ballot could read the paper trail to them. The association persuaded the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union, two politically powerful groups, to oppose paper trails as well.The companies also expanded their reach into other parts of the elections process. Some states built their HAVA-mandated voter-registration databases in-house, but some outsourced this to Diebold and ES&S, the companies that made their voting machines, as well as to other firms. And once these centralized databases were in place, the vendors saw an opportunity for another revenue stream: They persuaded states to replace paper poll books \u2014 the lists poll workers use to verify that voters are registered \u2014 with electronic poll books that could sync with the statewide databases. The software on these devices didn\u2019t have to undergo testing and certification the way voting machines do, and there were inevitable problems \u2014 in 2006 in Denver, Sequoia electronic poll books crashed extensively, creating long lines for an estimated 20,000 people who left without voting. In 2008 in Georgia, Diebold electronic poll books caused delays lasting more than two hours.Over the years, as election officials became more comfortable with their voting equipment, many jurisdictions who gave control to vendors gradually took it back, but there are still districts where vendors and contractors are involved in every phase of elections, from writing the software that registers voters and determines their eligibility to cast ballots, to programming machines and counting the votes. And it\u2019s not clear to what degree, if any, they\u2019re subject to oversight.Legislators have introduced several bills that propose to bolster security, in part by mandating paper trails and manual audits. But only one of them, the Secure Elections Act, has advanced, and in the process it has been significantly watered down. In August, Republican lawmakers weakened the bill by allowing officials performing audits to rely on the digital images of paper ballots stored in optical-scan machines \u2014 images that can be manipulated by hackers and others, security experts say.This year, Congress appropriated $380 million to states to pay for security upgrades and replace some of the machines that were bought with HAVA funds more than a decade ago, in the belief that this will make elections more secure. But the new machines have the same problems as the ones they will replace \u2014 all machines on the market today were tested and certified to the standards HAVA put into effect in 2007, and technology has evolved considerably in the last decade. The Election Assistance Commission and its technical-guidelines committee are completing new standards, but it will be at least another two years before any machines will be tested and certified to them.Even those standards will almost certainly be inadequate. They will, for instance, most likely continue to exempt commercial off-the-shelf components from testing. (If a vendor uses the Windows operating system or a commercial modem in its machines and asserts that it hasn\u2019t altered them, the labs don\u2019t look at those components.) And they probably won\u2019t require labs to do \u201cpenetration testing\u201d to see if they can hack voting systems \u2014 one of the most effective ways to measure the security of a system. \u201cThese companies have seized a central role in our democracy,\u201d said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is one of a small group of lawmakers who have shown a willingness to demand more transparency from the vendors. \u201cBut rather than recognizing that cybersecurity needs to be their top priority, they treat it as a public-relations problem that can be dismissed with spin.\u201dThe valuable work of testing system security has been taken up voluntarily by security researchers like the Finnish computer programmer Harri Hursti, J. Alex Halderman of the University of Michigan and the participants at the recent Def Con Voting Machine Hacking Village. But the researchers face hostility and sometimes even legal threats from vendors, who want to prevent them from finding and exposing problems with the machines. Before the Def Con event this year, which received unprecedented support and interest from election officials, ES&S and other vendors sent comments to the United States Copyright Office expressing opposition to a proposed exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that would expand the rights of researchers to reverse-engineer election software.Even now, when the country is desperate to prevent Russian hackers from interfering with future elections, the company is more focused on asserting proprietary control over its systems than on working with communities of researchers who want to secure them. In addition to the comments it sent the Copyright Office, it also sent a vaguely threatening letter to its own customers, warning them against helping researchers by providing them with voting-machine software to examine. In that letter, ES&S reminded election officials of an essential fact: The American people don\u2019t own the software that now sits at the heart of their democracy; they just lease it.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to an area in Ohio where 638 voters cast ballots in the presidential election of 2004. It was in one precinct in Franklin County, not the county as a whole.Kim Zetter has covered cybersecurity for more than a decade.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Doesn\u2019t Like Trump. It Can Still Work With the Government.", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAlex Karp grew up in a liberal household and considers himself a progressive. He voted for Hillary Clinton, and he lives and works in Silicon Valley.Yet Mr. Karp, the chief executive of Palantir, has found himself increasingly at odds with his peers in the technology industry as it publicly distances itself from the government, particularly the Department of Defense, under President Trump.Mr. Karp readily admits he would prefer that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t occupy the Oval Office. But he believes that Silicon Valley \u2014 already facing something of a crisis of user confidence over issues including privacy and foreign influence \u2014 is setting itself up for a fall.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very significant problem for the Valley,\u201d Mr. Karp, who rarely speaks publicly, said in an interview in his Manhattan office.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you stand up and talk to a Marine or a special operator and explain to them how you have a piece of software that will allow them to come home \u2014 or more likely allow them to come home \u2014 and you\u2019re not going to allow them to use it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a nearly impossible argument to make outside the Valley without people being legitimately pretty upset.\u201dAll of this has set off a quiet \u2014 but growing \u2014 debate across corporate America in the age of Trump: What does it mean to be a patriotic company when you vehemently disagree with your nation\u2019s leader?In truth, the ethical arguments are a diversion. This is political.And there is a real danger in letting politics undermine the storied relationship between the government and Silicon Valley \u2014 Hewlett-Packard built sonar, radar and aviation equipment for the government during World War II, for example \u2014 that has led to much of the innovation we enjoy today.Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School and a member of the Defense Innovation Board, an independent federal advisory committee set up under President Barack Obama, said he believed that the partisanship that was contributing to the debate would ultimately stifle innovation.\u201cI worry that it will stall progress,\u201d he said. \u201cInnovation has been fueled for decades by private-public partnerships. It smacks of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Even if you\u2019re not a fan of the president, you can still serve your country.\u201dMr. Karp, whose parents met at a civil rights demonstration, said he believed that American companies, including those in Silicon Valley, had a moral obligation to support the country and its military, no matter who was living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201cWe\u2019re proud that we\u2019re working with the U.S. government,\u201d he said.Of course, Mr. Karp certainly has an interest in maintaining relationships between the government and the technology sector. Palantir, which uses technology to analyze vast troves of data, was founded with the help of $2 million from the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s venture capital arm, and much of its business model was to use data to help the government in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. But that makes his willingness to be so forthright about his view of the president refreshing when his peers who may have similar views stay quiet.\u201cI obviously am very biased,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a problem if I go to a cocktail party in Silicon Valley because they want to know, \u2018Is it true that your product is used to target terrorists?\u2019 Yes. And some people don\u2019t agree with that. That\u2019s fine, by the way. I don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with that.\u201dHis outspokenness is even more surprising given that a co-founder of Palantir is Peter Thiel, a serial entrepreneur who has publicly supported Mr. Trump.\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the same people,\u201d Mr. Karp said without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to vote for the same people.\u201dStill, even if it is political allegiances that have prompted tech workers to push back, the ethical issues around artificial intelligence are not insignificant. Everyone from Elon Musk to Stephen Hawking has raised questions about technological warfare in the future. But we are still most likely decades away from those extreme kinds of worries being realized.Reid Hoffman, who founded LinkedIn and sold it to Microsoft, where he now sits on the board, said there were real worries about how the government would use powerful technologies like artificial intelligence.\u201cI think that the majority of Silicon Valley people have a strong worry/reflex against weapons,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who is a member of the Defense Innovation Board with Mr. Grant. The Trump administration, he said, has \u201camplified\u201d concerns over \u201cpossible bad government action.\u201dBut Mr. Karp said claims that a president could steer us toward an authoritarian world powered by artificial intelligence were too extreme.\u201cAmerica is a complicated modern democracy with numerous checks and balances so that no one person has the ability to do insane things,\u201d Mr. Karp said. With government work, he added, \u201cyou\u2019re buying into the inherent fabric and structure of the country.\u201dLost in the conversation in Silicon Valley is its own history. The internet itself was originally funded by an arm of the Defense Department that is now called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. As recently as the Obama administration, Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest technology giants embraced roles advising the government.But there is a difference between today\u2019s tech giants like Google and Facebook and those who turned the Santa Clara Valley into Silicon Valley. A bond with the government \u201cwas clearly not part of the founding of the consumer internet in any relevant way,\u201d Mr. Karp said.It is a connection that should be better understood by the employees now pushing for it to be severed. Those bright minds are able to have this debate in part because of the work done by their predecessors.And given the very real questions that have emerged about the benefits \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that the biggest tech companies truly offer society, those workers might want to rethink their position.As Mr. Karp pointed out when we talked about the big technology companies, \u201cIf actually the narrative was \u2018We are helping also with our defense,\u2019 then people would understand the value of these other things\u201d they do.There could come a time when Silicon Valley wishes it was waving that flag.Advertisement"}

He urges fans to investigate what he calls \u201cfalse flags,\u201d supposed events staged by powerful institutions as a pretext for curbing individual freedoms. His jingoistic calls to action sound like patriotism but can play out like vigilantism. Mr. Jones was adamant that we not reveal the location of his business. En route, the cabdriver, a former U.P.S. deliveryman, guessed the destination and shared a story about how odd it was to bring packages to Infowars, where staff didn\u2019t acknowledge the name of the business on the phone and he had to go through a serpentine process to make a drop.He jabbed his finger at me. \u201cYou have a responsibility. You wrote the blueprint article everybody else picked up where they said, \u2018Alex Jones is the scum of the earth . . . People need to go after Alex Jones, people need to bankrupt Alex Jones, people need to kill Alex Jones,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201c\u2018because he sends people to these parents\u2019 houses and he won\u2019t stop doing it.\u2019\u201dAfter a public outcry, Mr. Jones\u2019s lawyer altered his demand, saying in a hearing in the Pozner case that week that he\u2019d now accept \u201ca dollar\u201d in court costs. Mr. Jones claimed, wrongly, that I hadn\u2019t reported that gesture, \u201csomething that my lawyers have never seen before.\u201d (In court filings before a separate defamation hearing last month, Mr. Jones sought more than $200,000 in court costs from Neil Heslin, another Sandy Hook parent.)Mr. Jones asked whether I\u2019d seen his \u201cFather\u2019s Day message\u201d to the Sandy Hook families, broadcast in 2017. He complained that his on-camera acknowledgment of long-accepted facts got little attention because he\u2019s the target of a mainstream media plot. \u201cI said I thought that the children died and I was sorry for their loss. And I said that I wanted to reach out to them and try to heal things,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that\u2019d be pretty newsworthy, but no newspapers reported it. Pretty amazing discipline to, all in unison, do that.\u201dMr. Jones was wearing a starched, white, too-snug monogrammed shirt and one of his Rolex watches (more on that later). \u201cHumanity will be obsolete by 2050. This is the consensus at Google and Facebook and Twitter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to merge with machines and become gods, but first we\u2019ve got to reduce the world population 90 percent.\u201d I wondered aloud what the Jones family dinner table conversation must be like.Mr. Jones seemed rattled. He stammered and rushed around a cluttered conference room on whose whiteboard was a list of stunts \u2014 \u201cmoving in to Starbucks,\u201d \u201csetting up a safe space\u201d \u2014 that the Infowars team could perform to trigger liberals.Throughout the interview, he\u2019d shake his fist, pause, sigh dramatically, and do imitations, including of my \u201csaucer eyes\u201d as I listened to his repetitive, bigoted and mind-bending claims. I asked Mr. Jones about an excerpt from his show that his lawyer had played during a court hearing in the Pozner family\u2019s defamation case that week: \u201cYou said people can\u2019t go to the Eiffel Tower at night because of the Muslims attacking them.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely. It\u2019s cut back tourism massively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Muslims are as a group attacking people because under the Quran there is the house of Islam, and outside of it there\u2019s the house of war.\u201d Mr. Jones advances plotlines using would-be spy lingo like \u201cintel,\u201d going \u201coperational,\u201d and \u201cC.I.A. mis-info.\u201d He calls employees on his show \u201creporters.\u201d The survival of his business now depends on whether he can successfully claim First Amendment protection for theories that real reporting would swiftly debunk. I asked Mr. Jones whether he, as a father, accepted responsibility for what the Sandy Hook families have endured. He got angry.\u201cThe media \u2014 mainstream media \u2014 has 10,000 times the responsibility I do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re the main people talking about it.\u201dA couple weeks after the interview, Emily and I read court testimony dated Dec. 18, 2014, a few days after the second anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting. Mr. Jones was in divorce proceedings, and lawyers for his ex-wife were asking him to account for spending more than $317,000 over the previous several months. He\u2019d bought four Rolexes at once, bought jewelry for his girlfriend, spent thousands on restaurant dinners and parties in his rented Austin penthouse. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to restart my life.\u201d During our reporting, Mr. Jones maligned Emily and me by name on his broadcasts, making misogynist comments and false claims about our work, including that we were stalking him and threatening his associates. He left weird voice mail messages, texts and photos on my cellphone. In a discussion of his accusations against me among Mr. Jones\u2019s fans on a non-Infowars Facebook page, a commenter named \u201cScott\u201d suggested that I be mutilated, raped and set on fire.

{"Headline": "Saving Hummingbirds Is One Small Step in Saving the Planet", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "High in the Andes Mountains in Colombia, a reforestation project led by SavingSpecies works to protect one of the world\u2019s most renowned bio hot spots.Supported byWESTERN ANDES CLOUD FOREST, Colombia \u2014 Just before sunrise on a crisp summer morning high in a rain forest in Colombia\u2019s Western Andes, the renowned ecologist Stuart Pimm gathered his research team over breakfast and made final plans for that morning\u2019s journey to install motion-sensor cameras to monitor hummingbirds.In just a few hours, the installations would be done by Andrea Kolarova, 20, who was here with other students from Duke University, where Dr. Pimm holds the Doris Duke Chair of Conservation. She was getting some advice from him and from Luis Mazariegos, founder of the Hummingbird Conservancy of Colombia.My daughter, Alexandra, 11, a student at Saxe Middle School in New Canaan, Conn., had also been invited to participate in the Colombia project, which is how I found myself for two weeks this summer living in a cabin in this remote mountainous territory. Although not far from the town of Jardin, which is about two and a half hours from Medellin, it takes a slightly harrowing hourlong ride in an ATV along a dirt switchback road to get here.Dr. Pimm is also determined to help educate the next generation of conservationists, which is why he has included students on his teams. Alex, who shot video for the project, is fascinated by ecology. I had reached out to Dr. Pimm for some mentoring when she was 8 and he agreed.The organization operates in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, India and Sumatra, but protecting the Western Andes that we were now immersed in is especially crucial. It is described as a bio hot spot, one of the most biologically diverse regions in the world. But one that is also endangered.But the biodiversity of the entire region is in extreme peril, he said, having lost almost 75 percent of its forest.Later that day, as Dr. Pimm stood on land being reforested by SavingSpecies, he explained the relationship between global warming and the loss of species like hummingbirds.\u201cThe challenge that global warming poses to biodiversity is that species are going to move up slope as the climate warms. But they often can\u2019t cross unsuitable habitats,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is a valley that\u2019s mostly devoted to grazing and so as the climate warms species need to move from lowland forest to upland forest,\u201d he said, sweeping his hand along the landscape. \u201cBut they often can\u2019t cross a habitat that\u2019s unsuitable \u2014 like these pastures. So one of the things that we do is to try and acquire these properties and reforest them.\u201dSince SavingSpecies made its first land purchase in Brazil in 2007, it has worked with local organizations to create species corridors.Hundreds of thousands of acres of isolated patches of land have been reforested and reconnected, allowing species to migrate. More than 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide has been sequestered, and landslides that threaten valley residents are mitigated, according to the organization.Reforesting not only protects the habitats of endangered species, it helps the planet soak up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and prevents erosion from heavy rains on steep slopes in places like the Andes.SavingSpecies has been in partnership with the Hummingbird Conservancy since 2011. Ms. Kolarova and the SavingSpecies team work out of the conservancy\u2019s research station, where we were staying. The station is adjacent to land surrounded by reforested trees planted seven years ago. On one side of the station is a patchwork of family farms, each raising small herds of cattle. Down the road is a concrete K-12 school with an enrollment of 12 students. On the other side of the station is a field that narrows into a stream bed leading up into the dense rain forest.Having been instructed on the best camera placement procedures by Dr. Pimm and Dr. Mazariegos, Ms. Kolarova set out on this particular morning into the rain forest with a local conservancy guide as Alex and I tagged along.Conservation is hard work. As we climbed in the rain through the field, up the stream bed and into the rain forest, the last of civilization slipped away. Hummingbirds darted about, insects buzzed everywhere, the vegetation was nearly impenetrable and a thick mist settled in the trees.Ms. Kolarova searched for hummingbird food sources that would indicate where the birds would likely be present.Once she spotted them, she strapped a motion sensor camera to a tree overlooking hummingbird-favored flowers, inserted an SD memory card, and recorded the GPS coordinates of the camera. Looking for varied terrain, she waded through thigh-high mud and climbed up slick embankments to find the perfect location. The journey of roughly 1,000 feet took four hours.The wildlife cameras she was installing are just one of several technologies SavingSpecies employs in its work.After her installations were finished, Ms. Kolarova climbed a steep hillside alongside Dr. Pimm, who carried a GigaPan camera. The GigaPan technology, developed for NASA\u2019s Mars mission, combines dozens of digital images to create high resolution panoramas.High resolution provides the ability to zoom in and identify vegetation growth and migration. The panoramic view captures reforestation efforts. Meantime another SavingSpecies team took to the air with high-definition drones.Before they were invented it was impossible to explore large sections of rain forest in detail. To access the canopy, scientists used binoculars to observe and digital cameras to record their findings. To analyze large sections of rain forest SavingSpecies relied only on Google Earth, where images were updated every one to three years.Now, SavingSpecies and its partners can capture real-time images. High definition technology is detailed enough to record hummingbird habitats and drones can fly over 100 acres in 30 minutes. SavingSpecies uses the drones to help evaluate land that might be purchased and to map reforestation progress.Funding for operations and land purchases come from many sources. In Ms. Kolarova\u2019s case, grant money was used to support research, often from donors who are motivated by the desire to save endangered species. Others, including corporations, contribute to reforestation as a way to reverse their carbon footprint.At the end of Ms. Kolarova\u2019s three-month fellowship she will have traveled 6,000 miles to remote locations in two countries, climbed thousands of feet and switched out 250 SD cards. The cameras will stay so the Hummingbird Conservancy can continue her research.\u201cEven though my research is narrow in scope I take great pride knowing that my efforts will lead to assisting animals at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cLike Dr. Pimm, I am passionate to dedicate my life to improving our planet for the next generation.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Try these tips to streamline your day, relax a little or just have some fun.If you\u2019re an Amazon Echo or Google Home owner, you may only ask your device for the weather or to play music. That\u2019s O.K., but these devices can do so much more \u2014 and they can offer more than a few useful tricks to make you feel as if you\u2019re living in the future.Both the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa offer a \u201croutines\u201d skill, which automates certain tasks based on a single command. For example, you can ask your Amazon Echo or Google Home to tell you the weather and what\u2019s on your calendar for the day, after saying \u201cAlexa, start my day\u201d or \u201cHey Google, good morning.\u201d With this particular routine, there are nine actions the Google Home can perform, including reading the day\u2019s top stories or local news, and then transition into six other actions like playing your favorite music or a preferred podcast to finish up your \u201cmorning.\u201d On the Echo, there are four basic options, but you can add eight more to lengthen the routine.The Google Home has six ready-to-go routines that you can customize in the Google Home app, and the Amazon Echo has one. You can also create completely custom routines on both devices.Parents, this one might be a lifesaver \u2014 for your voice: Both products let you broadcast an announcement across other devices in your home. So, if you have an Echo in the kitchen, living room and a child\u2019s bedroom, you can say, \u201cAlexa, announce that dinner is ready,\u201d and Alexa will repeat the message on each device in your voice \u2014 no skill necessary. With the Google Home and Google Home Mini, you can do a similar command: \u201cHey Google, tell everyone it\u2019s time to go.\u201d If you\u2019re an iOS user and want to do this but you\u2019re away from home, you\u2019ll have to separately download the Google Assistant app (Android users already have the Assistant enabled if they have the latest version of the operating system).You might\u2019ve heard of this but were dubious whether hands-free calling was actually possible, or easy. The good news: It is. The so-so news: There are a few steps you need to take before your hands-free calling dreams come true.For now, both devices don\u2019t support calling emergency services, so no \u201cAlexa, call 911\u201d for you. Hands-free calling with Alexa works only in the United States, Canada and Mexico and only in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. for the Google Home.You may already know you can add items to a shopping list with both the Amazon Echo and the Google Home, then pull it up to review when you go shopping later. What you may not know is you can shop directly from both devices. They work with takeout restaurants like Pizza Hut and Dominos and traditional retailers like Target and Walmart.On the Amazon Echo, predictably you can shop only at Amazon. Also, while anyone with an Amazon account can shop by voice and add items to the Amazon cart, Amazon Prime Members get a special benefit. They can ask the smart assistant, \u201cAlexa, what are your deals?\u201d to hear exclusive deals just for them \u2014 and deals that are available only through voice shopping year-round.If you\u2019re learning a new language, or just encounter a word you\u2019d love to translate into another language, both devices can help.Both devices can also help you calm down with commands like \u201cO.K. Google, help me relax,\u201d and sounds like rain falling will play \u2014 or white noise if you\u2019re using it to go to sleep. The Echo is similar, but you can pick and choose what types of sounds you want to hear from the skills store. Google can also play \u201csleep sounds,\u201d which are really lullabies meant for children, while the Echo offers white or ambient noise. Just say \u201cAlexa, help me sleep\u201d for options.Sure, these devices can play music and add items to your cart, but it\u2019s a little annoying to start every single request with \u201cAlexa\u201d or \u201cO.K. Google.\u201d Thankfully, Amazon and Google realized this. On the Google Home, the \u201cContinued Conversation\u201d feature allows you to ask your device a question, and the microphone stays on for eight additional seconds to see if you\u2019ll ask a follow-up. (You do need to enable this in the settings of the Google Home app, as the feature is turned off by default.) The Amazon Echo also has the feature, except Amazon calls it \u201cFollow-up mode\u201d and you also have to turn it on in the app before using it.Once it\u2019s on, you can ask questions like \u201cWho sang \u2018In My Feelings?,\u2019\u201d and once your device responds with \u201cDrake,\u201d you can ask \u201cHow old is he?\u201d and the device will not only know who \u201che\u201d refers to but also answer without missing a beat. (Spoiler: Drake is 31.)This feature has also paved the way to ask the device to do multiple things in one command. For example, with \u201cmultiple actions\u201d on Google Home devices, you can say something like \u201cHey Google, turn up the thermostat and tell me the weather.\u201d On the Echo, you can\u2019t do it in a single sentence, but with follow-up mode you can just ask the two different commands one after the other.Google\u2019s later start in the smart home arena wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. The extra time allowed it to come up with some truly useful exclusive features. For example, if you download and use the Google Assistant app in addition to Google Home, you can ask Google to remind you to do something at a certain location. So, if you need to buy milk at the grocery store, you can say \u201cHey Google, remind me to buy milk at the grocery store,\u201d and as soon as you\u2019re near your preferred store (which Google will ask you to specify), your phone will let you know what you need.And if you\u2019re in the mood for a nice story at the end of a long workday, just say \u201cHey Google, tell me something good,\u201d and Google Assistant will read some \u201cfeel-good\u201d stories.With these new commands, you and your home should be on the way to becoming smarter \u2014 and more useful. Sure, these devices can play music and set timers, but these tips can help you get even more of your money\u2019s worth.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s How to Save on an Upgrade.", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt\u2019s the time of year when smartphone makers introduce their newest wares to tempt you to spend your hard-earned dollars on the latest, priciest devices.And this Wednesday, Apple is set to introduce three new iPhones, including some models with bigger screens and higher starting prices.According to a person briefed on Apple\u2019s new products, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential, the changes will include:\u2022 A new entry-level phone to replace the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, with a larger display, at 6.1 inches.\u2022 The introduction of a big-screen premium phone with a 6.5-inch display, Apple\u2019s biggest ever.In what has become an ever-clearer trend, the prices of some of these new iPhones are also expected to go up. The new entry-level iPhone may start at $749, with the 5.8-inch iPhone X coming in at $949 and $1,049 for the giant 6.5-inch-screen model, analysts estimated. In contrast, just a few years ago Apple\u2019s iPhones started at $649 for the smaller model and $749 for the larger one.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the prices of the new phones.The increasing number of higher-priced, bigger-screen smartphones has become a well-worn strategy by the phone makers. Given that many people around the world \u2014 especially in developed countries \u2014 already own a phone and upgrade at a slower pace than they used to, phone vendors industrywide are focused on wringing more dollars out of each device by having them get larger and more expensive.So where does that leave us? If you want to upgrade to some of the latest devices without breaking the bank, I have a few tips on how to achieve that.The easiest way to save some money on your next phone is to trade in your current cellphone. In the last few years, wireless carriers and retailers have expanded their trade-in programs to be seamless and more inclusive.Here\u2019s an overview of how some of them work.After trading in your phone, you can use the credit in a couple of ways.Let\u2019s say, for example, you are trading in an iPhone 7 to Verizon Wireless. The Verizon webpage offers $185 in credit for that phone, and you accept it.Now let\u2019s imagine that the next new iPhone costs $1,049. If you buy the device outright from Verizon, you could shave $185 off the $1,049, bringing the total to $864.Or you could opt to pay for the new iPhone with an installment plan and spread the cost of the phone into monthly payments. If Verizon hypothetically requires a $300 down payment for the new iPhone, your $185 in credit would reduce the amount you pay up front to $115. From there, you\u2019d pay $31.20 a month for 24 months to cover the remaining $749.You could sell your old device directly to another consumer for a chance to get more cash than through a trade-in program. This is similar to how selling a used car in a private sale usually yields more money than trading it in at a dealership.But there are trade-offs: Some buyers can be a nuisance and bombard you with lots of questions or take a long time to send payment.You could also ask your friends and family whether they want to buy your used phone. Just don\u2019t offer it to the hagglers among them.Taking care of your gadgets takes time. But with the rising costs of phones, the benefits are greater now that you will save even more by sticking with the tried and true.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Today: A Bailout for the Power Company?", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The legislative session is over for this year. But the shouting about at least one piece of legislation may not be.Consumer advocates are calling it a bailout.\u201cThe worst thing about it is when they\u2019re negligent, when they have violated the rules, the ratepayers pay, not the shareholders,\u201d said Mark Toney, executive director of the Utility Reform Network, which advocates for consumers before the California Public Utilities Commission.The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, determined that power lines and poles and other equipment owned by Pacific Gas and Electric had been responsible for a dozen fires in Northern California last October that ravaged the wine country.Under the legislation passed last week, if the Public Utilities Commission determines that it is reasonable to do so, the costs arising from the utility\u2019s liability \u2014 estimated at $17 billion for the 2017 fires, more than eight times its profit that year \u2014 could be borne by its customers. Without such protection, some said it could potentially face bankruptcy.For its part, Pacific Gas and Electric, the state\u2019s largest utility, said the bill helped respond to \u201cthe growing threat of climate-driven wildfires.\u201d\u201cSenate Bill 901 is a common-sense solution that puts the needs of wildfire victims first, better equips California to prevent and respond to wildfires, protects electric customers and preserves progress toward California\u2019s clean-energy goals,\u201d the utility stated.The bill provides $1 billion over five years for clearing brush around power lines and other fire-prevention efforts. It also imposes tougher penalties on utilities for violations.\u201cFrom the start of this year, my highest priority was and remains responding to past wildfires and preventing future tragedies,\u201d said Senator Bill Dodd, the legislation\u2019s sponsor, a Democrat whose district includes the Napa Valley. \u201cMy goals were simple: to stand up for constituents and ensure they recovered all they are entitled to for the damage they suffered, protect Californians from new wildfires and destruction, hold electric utilities accountable and protect the long-term interests of ratepayers.\u201dLawmakers voted 29 to 4 in the Senate and 45 to 10 in the Assembly to approve the bill, which Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to sign.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)At the Hollywood Roosevelt you can get a very special kind of mojito.

{"Headline": "Amazon Dominates as a Merchant and Platform. Europe Sees Reason to Worry.", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many independent merchants who sell their goods on Amazon, there has long been deep concern that if the e-commerce giant saw a particular product selling well, the company would duplicate it, but at a lower price.The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief said on Wednesday that there may be reason for worry.Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s competition commissioner, announced the start of an investigation into whether Amazon is unfairly using data collected about third-party sellers to make its own decisions about products to sell \u2014 information that would give it a potentially anticompetitive edge.Ms. Vestager, the world\u2019s most aggressive regulator of American technology giants, said that Amazon\u2019s dual position as host of the largest online platform for third-party sellers and as a retailer of goods deserved a closer look from European investigators. Her office has sent a number of questionnaires to market participants to learn more about Amazon\u2019s practices.\u201cThe question here is about the data,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at a news conference on Wednesday. She said that she wanted to know whether Amazon used data collected from merchants to make its own calculation about \u201cwhat is the new big thing, what it is that people want, what kind of offers do they like to receive, what makes them buy things?\u201dShe called the investigation \u201cpreliminary,\u201d and noted that a formal inquiry had not been started. European antitrust investigations can take years to complete.\u201cIt is very early days in this antitrust investigation into Amazon\u2019s business practices,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Amazon had no immediate comment.Most of the products sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers who use the platform to find customers. The practice has been mutually beneficial: Merchants get access to Amazon customers they would not otherwise be able to reach, while Amazon is able to offer a wider range of products and to collect a fee from any goods that are sold. Just over half of the company\u2019s unit sales globally come from third-party sellers.Amazon, she added, can use sales data about other merchants to improve its offerings.This is not the first time Amazon has been in Ms. Vestager\u2019s sights. Last year, her office ordered Luxembourg to collect 250 million euros, or about $290 million at current exchange rates, in back taxes from the online retail giant.An earlier version of this article, using information from an Amazon spokesman, referred incorrectly to the proportion of Amazon\u2019s sales that come from third-party sellers. It is just over half of unit sales globally, not revenue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Staying Plugged In (for Hundreds of Miles) on the Campaign Trail", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Sydney Ember, a politics reporter for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.You now cover politics after writing about media for years. What tech do you use to follow politics, and what tech do you take with you on the campaign trail?Covering politics is totally different from covering the media. I no longer get to talk to other journalists all the time. But on the upside, I\u2019ve gotten to leave my media bubble. And I get to travel a lot more.When I\u2019m out on the trail reporting, I'm actually pretty low-tech. I use a backpack so I can keep my hands free. I carry around a lot of reporting notebooks and pens. I have a small Olympus recorder that I got years ago. It has a USB that connects to my computer, but it\u2019s so old that my computer can no longer play the recordings I transfer over. It seems to have something to do with the format of the recordings, but it\u2019s still something of a mystery to me even after copious Googling. I also record a lot of videos on my phone so I can remember what the atmosphere was like at a campaign event, for example, or how candidates looked interacting with voters.Drives on the trail can get long. I recently drove from Kansas City to Wichita, Kan., and back, then went on to St. Louis, a journey of roughly 700 miles over three days. Most cars these days seem to have a USB port, so I make sure to plug in my phone as soon as I start driving.I rely on the Google Maps app for directions and would never be able to find my way to the right place without it. That\u2019s all to say I spend a majority of my time on the road thinking about how to make sure my phone stays charged. I have a pink Mophie external battery in case the situation gets dire.How has tech changed the way politicians are campaigning for the midterms? The goal of this direct-to-voter messaging seems twofold: They can more easily shape their narratives and appear more human while also bypassing difficult questions from the media.What\u2019s the deal with those pesky robo texts?If you haven\u2019t received any of these robo texts yet, count yourself lucky.Does switching beats change how you use technology to report?When I covered the media, I spent every waking hour on Twitter. (That\u2019s at least how my husband felt.) If media news broke, I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t miss it. Now, I try not to spend all day looking at Twitter \u2014 it seems less necessary \u2014 and check in only every few hours. This sometimes feels more like an aspiration. But I\u2019m trying.I actually feel it\u2019s easier to get people to talk on the politics beat than it was when I covered the media. Believe it or not, it\u2019s hard trying to get other journalists to say things on the record! On both beats, though, I find that picking up the phone and calling people is often the best way to get them talking.You\u2019ve covered the rise and fall of many print media empires in the digital age. For the ones that are succeeding, what do you think they are doing well? Companies that are doing well have figured out a good pay wall to make up for losses in digital advertising and print subscriptions. The cost has to be low enough that readers can justify it, but high enough that it helps support the journalism the companies want to offer.In the end, though, the companies that are succeeding are consistently producing great, unique stories that can\u2019t be found anywhere else. Readers will pay for good journalism.Outside your work, what tech product do you use a ton? In a weird way, it gives me some freedom from my phone. Before I had it, I\u2019d pick up my phone for every email, text or alert, then get sucked into the vortex of social media. I could lose hours this way. Now, because I can look at my watch to see what\u2019s going on, I can leave my phone alone, sometimes even in another room, knowing I still won\u2019t miss anything important.I also really like that I can read and send text messages from it. When I\u2019m stuck on long drives on the trail, I can glance at my wrist to see a text, then respond simply by saying something out loud. It doesn\u2019t transcribe perfectly, but it works when I can\u2019t look at my phone.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China Sees Hints of a Past Threat: Inflation", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 Pork is up. Vegetables are up. Gasoline is up. Even the official numbers, usually tame, are up.Prices are rising in China \u2014 and that could complicate Beijing\u2019s efforts to prop up a slowing economy and navigate President Trump\u2019s trade war.Chinese officials said Monday that an index of consumer prices rose in August for the third consecutive month. The increases are not particularly sharp, and Chinese economists point to a number of temporary factors pushing up prices, like floods that have damaged crops and a swine flu epidemic that led farmers to cull pigs.Still, investors and the Chinese public alike are casting a wary eye on prices.Angus Tong, a 37-year-old Beijing resident, said his landlord wanted to nearly double the rent for his family\u2019s $1,200-a-month apartment. Rent already absorbs a third of his income and his wife\u2019s, while the family\u2019s monthly food bills have risen.To save money, \u201cwe try to cook every meal at home,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI think most middle-income people feel the pressure from rising costs.\u201dHigher prices could cause problems for Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s leader. They would mean China\u2019s leaders would have to be careful as they sought ways to bolster slowing growth, lest their efforts drive up prices still further. The trade war with the United States could also lead to higher prices for Chinese consumers and companies with tariffs raising the cost of imported goods.\u201cDuring the coffee breaks and the conversations, the topic of inflation is coming up,\u201d said Tai Hui, the chief Asia markets strategist for J. P. Morgan Funds. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to hear a lot more from investors. It\u2019s just a question of the severity.\u201dFor now, Chinese economists generally say there is little cause for alarm. \u201cDisasters like the swine flu and disasters like the flood are not a very big impact on China as a whole, and are not a turning point,\u201d said Li Xuesong, the deputy director of the National Academy of Economic Strategy in Beijing.China has also invested heavily in education, so the productivity of workers has risen quickly along with their wages. As a result, labor costs for getting jobs done have changed fairly little, as higher-paid yet more-skilled workers complete tasks more quickly than lower-paid but less-skilled workers a decade ago.Wigram Capital Advisors, an economic research group, has long calculated an alternative price index for China by taking government data on specific consumer goods and services and assigning them weightings based on actual household spending patterns in big Chinese cities. It shows that the annual rate of inflation jumped to 3.7 percent in August, from under 2 percent most of last year.Check the Chinese term for \u201crising prices\u201d on Baidu, a Google-like online search engine, and the mentions quintupled in the second half of August. But the use of a more intellectual term for \u201cinflation\u201d has changed little in recent months \u2014 a possible sign that most of the complaints about rising prices may be from less-affluent Chinese citizens who are more affected by higher costs for basics.Officially, consumer prices were up 2.3 percent in August from a year before, the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. Although marginally higher than economists\u2019 expectations of 2.2 percent, that is still modest. But it represented a gradual acceleration from recent months.Some of the factors behind China\u2019s recent price increases look temporary. Wholesale prices for pork, the main meat in the Chinese diet, have climbed 17 percent since just mid-July, after an outbreak of swine flu, according to Agriculture Ministry data. Vegetable prices have climbed 21 percent since mid-July as flooding and a typhoon have damaged crops.Goldman Sachs said last week that because much of the increase in pork and vegetable prices did not occur until late August, these increases would show up only partly in that month\u2019s data, and then drive inflation higher in September.Other price increases may linger longer. World oil prices have climbed sharply in the past year, and China is the world\u2019s largest oil importer. China\u2019s currency has slid in value against the dollar this year, and that drives up the price of oil further for Chinese consumers because petroleum deals are done in dollars.Housing costs are also rising, for new homes and for rents. Rents were up an average of 17 percent in July from a year earlier in 50 large cities nationwide. While most Chinese people live in their own homes, renting had been a refuge for young people who could not afford high prices for new apartments.China has also continued to pump more money into its financial system to support growth, adding to potential inflationary pressure.Then there are the American tariffs, which could have a mixed impact. They raise prices for imported goods. But any economic slowdown in China that results from reduced exports to the United States could slow Chinese inflation, said Louis Kuijs, a China specialist at Oxford Economics.The big counterweight to a broader rise in prices is that the Chinese economy is gradually slowing. Despite stepped-up government spending on infrastructure, a tax cut that is about to take effect and further monetary stimulus, that may continue. A broad rise in prices is less likely as long as the economy is weak, said Brad Setser, a Council on Foreign Relations economist.If prices do rise more, however, then China may need to curb its local governments, which have shown an insatiable appetite for borrowing money to build ever more roads, bridges and industrial parks.\u201cReining that in,\u201d Mr. Setser said, \u201cprovides an obvious way of countering inflationary pressures.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the chief Asia markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds. He is Tai Hui, not Hue.Ailin Tang contributed research from Shanghai, and Elsie Chen and Karoline Kan from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pudge Will Keep Us Together", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveThey were headed for a painful breakup. Then a stray dog wandered in.\u201cI saw your car,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201dAs I pulled my clothes back on, grumbling, I tried to give my boyfriend the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he wanted to make a nice gesture, like buying me a cup of coffee.Instead, I found him waiting on the sidewalk next to a knee-high, tan-colored dog. The dog trotted up to me, panting in the humidity, his jowly mouth smiling. I let out the involuntary sound I make whenever I see a new dog, something between an adult cooing at a baby and a child crying over a Christmas present.He was stocky with fine fur and a square head like a pit bull. His small ears folded over into symmetrical triangles.\u201cWhose dog is this?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name? He\u2019s so sweet!\u201dJeff said he had seen Pudge from his car wandering about a mile away. Worried about the dog being lost in the heat, he followed him for a block. \u201cEventually, I got close enough to pull over and open my door,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Pudge jumped in.\u201d\u201cHow did you know his name is Pudge?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cI named him that. I know you have plans, but do you think you could help me find his family?\u201dThis was something I had always loved about Jeff: his knack for derailing my plans in the best way possible. I hadn\u2019t indulged his spontaneity lately, and with Pudge wagging his tail at me, I couldn\u2019t say no.Jeff and I had been a couple for two years back then, and we\u2019d been living together for a year and a half. When we first moved in to the three-bedroom house we shared with two friends, I wanted us to get a dog. This became a nightly topic of conversation, until it became an argument.Jeff had logical reasons against us becoming pet parents: We were trying to save money, our jobs had odd hours, and we both wanted to leave Kansas City, Mo., soon.I countered that he was simply avoiding the commitment of a dog. And by \u201cthe commitment of a dog,\u201d I meant a commitment to me. We didn\u2019t argue often, but when we did it was about this. I never doubted that Jeff loved me, but he was more comfortable living day by day than making plans for a future with me.In the weeks before we found Pudge, life had only gotten more complicated. Jeff\u2019s sister had learned, at 33, that she had brain cancer, and he decided he would return home to Minnesota to care for her. Around then, I decided I would attend graduate school in Spokane, Wash.We had one month left on our lease. Neither of us wanted to break up, but we knew it was right given the circumstances. With the same sad optimism, we agreed we would remain friends.Since Pudge didn\u2019t have tags or a microchip, we walked the neighborhood where Jeff found him for three hours. We crisscrossed streets, Pudge plodding along as we knocked on doors and asked passers-by if they recognized him.\u201cNo,\u201d we kept hearing. \u201cBut he sure is cute. You should keep him.\u201dJeff and I laughed \u2014 and avoided eye contact.After two days of long walks and numerous social media posts, we were no closer to finding Pudge\u2019s owners. The day before, we had a vet check him over and learned he had a serious ear infection.When we squirted the medication into his ears, he squeezed his eyes shut but didn\u2019t pull away or snap. He never even barked, only whined softly if Jeff or I left the room and wagged when we returned.We couldn\u2019t believe that such a well-mannered dog didn\u2019t have a real home. But despite Pudge\u2019s good behavior, our roommates were, understandably, ready for the furry interloper to leave.On the third day, Jeff made the call, and the officer showed up within an hour. Pudge pushed his way out the screen door and greeted the officer the way he greeted everyone, as if she were a long-lost friend.\u201cCan we say goodbye?\u201d I said. I tried to hold myself together, but as I crouched down to pet Pudge, I started sobbing. So did Jeff.The officer looked at us like we were crazy. \u201cI don\u2019t have to take him, you know. He can stay here.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d I said, choking out the words. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep him.\u201dAs the officer led Pudge away, Jeff and I hugged each other.\u201cDid I mess up?\u201d Jeff said.\u201cNo,\u201d I said. But we both cried even harder.About two hours later, when Jeff left to buy beer so we could drown our sorrows, I received a message on Facebook from a woman who recognized Pudge from one of my posts. She said his name was Buddy and gave me the name of the owners. I messaged them to say Buddy was waiting at the shelter.\u201cThat\u2019s probably for the best,\u201d the man wrote. \u201cWe already have three dogs. We were thinking about giving him away anyway.\u201dBy the time Jeff returned, I needed something stronger than alcohol.Knowing that Pudge\u2019s owners didn\u2019t want him back changed everything. We were still broke. Our relationship was still on the verge of ending. And it was true that if we were to leave Pudge at the shelter, he might find another home. Yet we couldn\u2019t let him go.We had two weeks left on our lease, but we had not talked about breaking up. We only talked about getting that damn dog back.So we made a plan. Since I had farther to move and a busier schedule as a student, we decided Jeff would be the one to take Pudge. We begged our roommates to put up with Pudge a little bit longer, and for Jeff\u2019s father to let a dog move into his house at the end of August, along with his adult son.Our friends and loved ones met these requests with more grace than we probably deserved. Perhaps they guessed, correctly, that Jeff and I were both about to fall apart.We brought Pudge home in mid-August and had a normal life together for one week. We took him on walks, bathed him in the backyard with the hose, scolded him for begging for food. Pudge would spread out on the kitchen floor anytime I cooked dinner. He took approximately 10 naps per day yet slept soundlessly through the night.Days before our move-out date, I looked around at our suitcases and half-packed boxes, and at Pudge napping in his bed.\u201cYou know,\u201d I said to Jeff, \u201cit bothers me that we never really talked about long distance as an option.\u201dBefore, I had tried to slowly disengage from Jeff to lessen the looming heartbreak. But having a dog connected us. Rather than going out separately, Jeff and I took Pudge to the park or to brunch. We debated brands of dog food instead of fixating on the end of our relationship.Most important, neither of us ever could have afforded to adopt a dog alone. Splitting the cost of vet bills, adoption fees and supplies was our saving grace; it revived the generosity we\u2019d once shown each other.That night, Jeff and I weighed the pros and cons of staying together long distance, then took a break. We talked about it again the next day, then changed the subject. Took Pudge for a walk, talked about it some more. Talked about it in bed, with Pudge sleeping on the floor.Despite the distance between us, the daunting costs of airfare and the uncertainty about our futures, we couldn\u2019t let each other go any more than we could let go of this dog.One year later, Jeff and I are still together, though living hundreds of miles apart. I wish I could say Pudge was still with us too. But in early December of last year, four months after I had moved away, our vet discovered that Pudge had cancer throughout his body. The day after New Year\u2019s, we had to put him down.Pudge isn\u2019t the only reason Jeff and I didn\u2019t break up, but he played a crucial role, uniting us when we needed it most. By giving an old dog a new home for what turned out to be his final months, we gave our love a new place to live too.Maura Lammers is a graduate student at Eastern Washington University.Advertisement"}

In some cases, his supporters have piled on with threats to boycott the companies\u2019 products or services. The stocks of those firms have come under pressure as investors worry that business will suffer.But a look back at months of critical presidential tweets, and their effect on stock prices, suggests that investors are shrugging off Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides. The stocks of targeted companies typically recover, and there is little, if any, discernible harm done to their business.Nike is the latest firm Mr. Trump has singled out. The sportswear company confirmed this week that it had entered into a new marketing deal with Colin Kaepernick, the former N.F.L. quarterback. Mr. Kaepernick made headlines in 2016 for kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, and has not played in the N.F.L. since the end of that season.Nike may yet suffer. The same people boycotting the N.F.L. because of player protests during the national anthem may shun its products. Companies selling a narrow range of items to consumers are most at risk to a buyers\u2019 strike. But Nike may also benefit. Mr. Trump\u2019s castigations, and Nike\u2019s support of Mr. Kaepernick, may generate higher sales.Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticisms can at times seem to affect the shares of the companies he targets.Even so, the company\u2019s shares have recently rallied and now trade at more or less the same price they did just before the announcement of its production shift.This suggests that investors may have adopted a simple rule: Keep an eye on what the government does, not what the president says.And even if the Trump administration were to threaten more actions against companies, it may not succeed in doing much harm to the firms, or it may simply fail to follow through.Investors may hope that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets amount to little more than noise, and that the rule of law and other constraints will prevent him from taking actions that could harm corporate profits.Any tweets from the president on this battle could move markets.Advertisement"}

For the first time in years, I was truly surprised.There\u2019s just one catch: I felt this way about Apple\u2019s new watch, not its smartphone. The phones were fine. Apple\u2019s going to sell a lot of them and make a lot of money, as it does every year. But it\u2019s the watch that might change the future most arrestingly.The big deal: The new Apple Watch packs a slew of sensors to make it a truly novel kind of wearable device \u2014 something like a \u201cStar Trek\u201d tricorder on your body. The new watch can administer a medically accurate electrocardiogram, a test of a person\u2019s heart rhythm that can help detect dangerous health conditions. It also detects and alerts rescue personnel to dangerous falls, a leading cause of injury, especially for older people.One detail was particularly compelling. Apple received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its device, meaning that when you take your watch\u2019s data to your doctor, there will be some basis for accepting its pronouncements.By themselves, these features won\u2019t change the world. But they may play a significant role in some people\u2019s lives, even saving some from an early death.It is significant that Apple is consulting with regulators as it does so. The prevailing ethos across much of the industry is to charge forward with new tech \u2014 to beg forgiveness from the world when things go wrong, instead of asking permission first. How refreshing it is, then, that Apple went through proper channels here. When it comes to health, moving fast and breaking things isn\u2019t an option.There was some other news in tech this week:And that\u2019s it, folks! See you next week.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Journalist Who Spread Conspiracy Theories Will Oversee Italy\u2019s State TV", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Marcello Foa has spread the claim that Hillary Clinton attended a satanic dinner. He broke the news on his blog of a full-scale American military mobilization that never happened. A fan of the Russian leader Vladimir V. Putin and a guest on Russia Today, he doubts the evidence that Moscow\u2019s operatives poisoned a former Soviet spy because it is \u201ctoo obvious.\u201dMr. Foa is also now the Italian government\u2019s most influential media figure.On Wednesday night, leaders of Italy\u2019s populist government cheered as a parliamentary committee approved Mr. Foa as chairman of Italy\u2019s state broadcaster RAI, which has millions of viewers, thousands of employees and is, in Mr. Foa\u2019s estimation, the most powerful cultural force in the country.Mr. Foa\u2019s appointment now has raised alarms about the state of the Italian media, never too healthy to begin with, and represents a victory of the populist parties over the establishment media that once discounted them.It is far from symbolic, though. Mr. Foa\u2019s appointment signals an opening gambit by Italy\u2019s populists to take their anti-establishment message, and ambition to reshape public perception, from social media to the televised media mainstream, where the vast majority of Italy still gets its information.On the eve of his appointment, Mr. Foa, 55 and affable, offered a glimpse of his new office with eight television screens in the wall, and shared passages of his book exploring the ways that politicians and spin doctors manipulate the truth and spread misinformation.Instead, he said, he would work to reverse what he claimed was a de facto veto at RAI of euro-skeptic politicians and government ministers, and to introduce voices to make the broadcaster \u201cmirror\u201d the current political reality.Italy\u2019s media have long warped standard journalistic practices like a fun-house mirror.The brother of Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate and former prime minister, nominally owned il Giornale, where Mr. Foa spent decades working as a reporter and editor.For years, Mr. Berlusconi flooded his private newspaper and channels and public airways with pro-Berlusconi propaganda, and it was Mr. Berlusconi who greenlighted Mr. Foa\u2019s nomination, in exchange for political concessions.All of that fueled polarization and national frustration over the media, which Italy\u2019s new populist leaders, Mr. Salvini and Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement, clobbered as they rose to power.The result is a largely impotent press that has failed to hold accountable populist leaders who reach enormous audiences directly with their social media accounts.Mr. Foa said this was only natural, because by suppressing alternative voices on the state broadcaster, \u201cYou push the success of Di Maio and Salvini\u2019s Facebook pages.\u201dAll the same, he said, attacking the news media was \u201cpart of the game\u201d and so it was wrong to blame the politicians. \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault, for me,\u201d he said.The Five Star Movement\u2019s hostility to the news media traces back to its co-founders \u2014 the comedian Beppe Grillo and the late Gianroberto Casaleggio, an internet entrepreneur.Mr. Grillo often featured his disdain for reporters on his wildly popular blog, calling them \u201cthe walking dead,\u201d among other things. Mr. Casaleggio was an admirer of Mr. Foa\u2019s right-wing blog and a futurist who envisioned a democratization of politics and media on the web.In July, the government\u2019s top spokesman, Rocco Casalino, an alumnus of the reality television show \u201cBig Brother\u201d and a Five Star power broker, made a thinly veiled threat to pull state funding from a newspaper, Il Foglio, which has been critical of the government.\u201cNow that Il Foglio will close, what will you do?\u201d Mr. Casalino said to a reporter from the paper. \u201cCan you tell me what purpose Il Foglio has? Why does is exist?\u201dThe outburst prompted the Order of Journalists in Lombardy, to which Mr. Casalino belongs, to open an investigation into whether he had violated professional guidelines. In turn, the Five Star Movement\u2019s blog advocated the abolishment of the organization.Instead, in the current government it is Mr. Salvini, a former radio disc jockey, who has begun the charm offensive, wrapping his extreme language in an earthy, endearing delivery.He has dominated Italian politics by dominating news cycles in Trumpian style \u2014 offering up some nugget, often over Twitter, that is outrageous and offensive to his haters, red meat to his supporters and simply irresistible to the Italian media. He has 3.2 million followers on Facebook and 880,400 on Twitter.Mr. Foa first met Mr. Bannon, the former executive chairman of the right-wing Breitbart News, at the Lugano house of the Swiss financier Tito Tettamanti. He said he later helped arrange a meeting between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Salvini.The mainstream press had a habit of \u201cportraying all these events in such a mysterious way,\u201d Mr. Foa said.Before the election, Mr. Morisi acknowledged that the official website \u201cWe\u2019re With Salvini\u201d shared the same Google codes as sites supportive of the Five Star Movement, as well as \u201cI\u2019m With Putin\u201d and other conspiracy sites.\u201cBut we have nothing to do with the pro-Putin or pro-Five Star sites,\u201d Mr. Morisi said at the time.Since becoming Italy\u2019s interior minister and vice premier, Mr. Salvini\u2019s constant social media posts, television appearances and campaign-style travel have raised the question of when he actually works. But that is perhaps an outdated conception of work in an age when the media message is the m\u00e9tier.Mr. Foa has had his own adventures on Twitter.A few days before the 2016 United States presidential election, he shared an Italian blog post claiming Mrs. Clinton had attended a \u201csatanic\u201d dinner with John Podesta.He said that the report seemed plausible to him because he recalled reading in some \u201cvery serious press\u201d about \u201cpedophilic\u201d art in the collection of Mr. Podesta. (John\u2019s brother, Tony Podesta, collects contemporary works.)\u201cI didn\u2019t go deep on this,\u201d he said in the interview this week in his defense, acknowledging that he \u201cmight be wrong,\u201d and that he sometimes succumbed to the temptation to publish the sensational to boost his audience on social media.\u201cIt\u2019s happened to me a couple of times,\u201d he said.In 2017, he falsely claimed the United States military was preparing to mobilize 150,000 reservists, possibly for a war against Syria or North Korea or Russia. He said a friend in American national security circles told him Mr. Trump had called up reservists and that he checked with an expert he knew in Italy who said it was true.\u201cSo I had two sources and I wrote just five lines on my blog, ten lines. And that\u2019s all,\u201d he said.Still, he thinks reporters could be more cautious, when, for instance, reporting that Russia was behind the March poisoning of a former Soviet Spy, Sergei V. Skripal.\u201cIt\u2019s too obvious for me,\u201d Mr. Foa said of the evidence in the case. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of saying, \u2018Oh, you see, Putin is the bad guy doing the bad thing.\u2019\u201dHis prime concern now, though, he said, is restoring the credibility of RAI, which he said had been destroyed by an establishment, anti-populist bias. Without that trust, he said, political parties, internet trolls and regular citizens would continue to use social media to misinform the public and erode democracy.\u201cWe\u2019re in a very dangerous territory,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the web team of Luca Morisi. The team has been compared to Casaleggio Associates, a company closely linked with the League\u2019s coalition partner, the Five Star Movement, but there is no evidence that alumni of Casaleggio Associates work in Mr. Morisi\u2019s team.Emma Johanningsmeier contributed reporting from Rome.Advertisement"}

The hearing will address questions of political bias, as well as Google\u2019s potential plans to re-enter the Chinese market, said Mr. McCarthy, the House majority leader.Mr. Pichai confirmed in a statement that he would testify in \u201cdue course.\u201dIn addition, he has agreed to participate in a discussion with other tech industry leaders and President Trump, said Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council.Google had declined to send Mr. Pichai to testify this month at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about foreign manipulation of social media. The absence upset many lawmakers, leading to his visit this week.Mr. McCarthy has been one of the most vocal critics of Google, raising accusations that the search engine purposely suppresses conservative views in its results. He has accused Twitter and Facebook of similar bias, joined by other Republican lawmakers who point to the liberal leanings of Silicon Valley as motivation to skew the discovery of information.The meeting on Friday with Mr. Pichai, which Mr. McCarthy and eight other Republican lawmakers attended, seemed to smooth over relations. But suspicions of political bias remained.\u201cI see a hearing right now looking at bias, looking at all the issues we talked about, from privacy to China,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said after the meeting. He does not expect the hearing to focus on antitrust concerns and whether Google should be broken up, he added.Mr. Pichai\u2019s no-show at the hearing this month \u2014 captured by images of an empty seat alongside executives from Facebook and Twitter \u2014 added to the rancor. Leaks of employee emails discussing ways to counter President Trump\u2019s immigration policy, and video of a companywide meeting that showed executives lamenting his election victory, have also fueled the allegations of bias.On Thursday and Friday, Mr. Pichai also had meetings with Democratic lawmakers, including one with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader.Mr. Pichai, in the statement, said the discussions over the two days \u201cwith a wide range of congressional leaders were constructive and informative.\u201dCecilia Kang reported from Washington, and Daisuke Wakabayashi from San Francisco.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "F.T.C. Hearings Add to Efforts That Threaten Tech Industry", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For years, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have fought regulators in Europe on privacy, antitrust and taxes. In the United States, the tech titans were on friendly terrain.But on Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission kicked off a series of hearings to discuss whether the agency\u2019s competition and consumer protection policies should change to better reflect new technologies and companies.Joseph J. Simons, the agency\u2019s chairman, expressed openness to a new approach.\u201cThe broad antitrust consensus that has existed within the antitrust community, in relatively stable form for the last 25 years, is being challenged,\u201d Mr. Simons said. \u201cI approach all these issues with a very open mind, very much willing to be influenced by what we see and hear at these hearings.\u201dThe F.T.C. hearings, the first of 15 to 20 over the next several months, are one of several efforts underway on the federal and state level that threaten to limit the expansion and power of tech companies. Later this month, Congress will bring executives from top tech companies to testify on proposals for privacy laws. The Justice Department has warned it may start investigations into whether Google and other social media sites are biased against conservative voices.The spotlight on the giants of Silicon Valley is a major shift for regulators in the United States. For years, they held up the growth of these firms as an emblem of American business leadership and ingenuity. But after a string of crises over privacy and misinformation on social media, a growing chorus of regulators from both political parties is casting a more skeptical eye on the industry.New regulations in the United States are unlikely to arrive anytime soon, and any new federal policies will probably be weaker than those in Europe and states like California. Tech companies have lobbied the Trump administration for voluntary rules and government officials have indicated their desire for light-touch regulation that would pre-empt some state laws.\u201cIt will be a slow-moving ship, faster on privacy than on antitrust, but it\u2019s an important moment,\u201d said Blair Levin, a senior adviser at the research firm New Street and a former chief of staff at the Federal Communications Commission.Reaching an agreement on changes to antitrust policy will be particularly difficult.The field of antitrust law has focused for 30 years on whether prices increase when there is limited competition. Some academics and consumer groups have called for regulators to rethink that gauge. Amazon and Google, they say, defy that metric of antitrust law because the companies are gaining power even as they offer cheap or free goods.\u201cThe issue about Amazon is not just that the wealthiest person on earth, Jeff Bezos, is paying workers unlivable wages. It\u2019s about the \u2018new economy\u2019 and the degradation of the human spirit \u2014 breaking down people, spitting them out and simply replacing them with new bodies,\u201d Mr. Sanders said last week in a Twitter post.Amazon has disputed Mr. Sanders\u2019s accusations, saying the company offers stable pay and benefits for its employees. It has also disputed concerns the company has violated antitrust laws, saying it does not have a dominant market share of the retail market.Some Republicans have also voiced concerns about the industry, and a growing number of economists are studying whether technology\u2019s leading companies are increasing wage inequality. The economists are focused on whether the concentration of workforces at companies like Amazon have a disproportionate effect on wages, inflation and growth.\u201cThese concerns raise a challenge to antitrust agency leadership, the courts and legislators,\u201d Mr. Simons said on Thursday.Companies have argued against broad changes. Google, for instance, says that it offers free search services and that consumers can easily switch to rival search engines online. Companies argue that the tech market is fast changing and regulations could quickly become outdated.The F.T.C. hearing, held at the Georgetown University School of Law, was filled with antitrust lawyers, some of whom had ties to the tech companies. Many warned that changes could make decisions on mergers and antitrust enforcement vulnerable to politics.Janet L. McDavid, a panelist at the F.T.C. hearing and a lawyer at Hogan Lovells, said simply going after companies because they were big was dangerous.The \u201camorphous\u201d concepts of big and fair in antitrust law could lend itself to political decisions, Ms. McDavid said.\u201cWhich we certainly should eschew, especially now in the current political environment,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Enforcement Officials Confront Tech Companies\u2019 Power", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Top Justice Department officials met with 14 state attorneys general on Tuesday to weigh whether they have the right tools to confront privacy and competition concerns surrounding Facebook, Google and other tech companies that have amassed extraordinary amounts of data about their consumers and advertising markets.Americans increasingly recognize that tech companies wield tremendous power and deserve greater scrutiny, the law enforcement officials said, and they discussed whether traditional approaches to antitrust issues were still suitable for modern disputes over privacy and the tech business model.Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, cautioned against comparisons to landmark antitrust cases. \u201cMost would agree, this is not Standard Oil, this is not even Microsoft,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201call of those situations inform you.\u201dThe Justice Department called the conversation productive, though no decisions were made or announced.

A few attorneys general expressed concern about Google\u2019s ability to track, in a granular way, the everyday routines of people.Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, was set to meet with lawmakers in Washington on Friday, including Republicans who plan to ask him about the company\u2019s competitive practices; its work with countries accused of human rights abuses, like China and Russia; and whether its workers and search engine magnify biases.\u201cGoogle has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,\u201d the House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, said in a statement.Technology companies mine consumer behavior online for data, which they then sell on an open marketplace much in the same way that a company might sell oil. A handful of large companies control and sell the vast majority of that data.The conversation was originally billed by the Justice Department as a way to address free speech issues, as well as competitive concerns. Before it was announced, Mr. Trump, whose Twitter account is perhaps his core communications platform, amplified claims that tech and social media companies try to suppress conservative voices and opinions.But the law enforcement officials touched only briefly on whether the companies were politically biased or suppressing the free flow of ideas.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Antitrust Antagonist Has a Breakthrough Idea", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "With a single scholarly article, Lina Khan, 29, has reframed decades of monopoly law.Supported by\u201cAntitrust Dilemma.\u201d \u201cThe Antitrust Impulse.\u201d \u201cAntitrust in an Expanding Economy.\u201d Shelf after shelf of volumes ignored for decades. There are a dozen fat tomes with transcripts of the congressional hearings on monopoly power in 1949, when the world was in ruins and the Soviets on the march. Lawmakers believed economic concentration would make America more vulnerable.At the end of the antitrust stacks is a table near the window. \u201cThis is my command post,\u201d said Lina Khan.It\u2019s nothing, really. A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon.If competitors tremble at Amazon\u2019s ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon\u2019s customers, it is safe to say, spend much time thinking they need to be protected from it.Amazon has more revenue than Facebook, Google and Twitter put together, but it has largely escaped sustained examination. That is beginning to change, and one significant reason is Ms. Khan.Ms. Khan disagreed. Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, she presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the economy.Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: \u201cThe thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon\u2019s rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.\u201dThe paper got 146,255 hits, a runaway best-seller in the world of legal treatises. That popularity has rocked the antitrust establishment, and is making an unlikely celebrity of Ms. Khan in the corridors of Washington.She has her own critics now: Several leading scholars have found fault with Ms. Khan\u2019s proposals to revive and expand antitrust, and some have tried to dismiss her paper with the mocking label \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201d Unwilling or perhaps unable to accept that a woman wrote a breakthrough legal text, they keep talking about bearded dudes.\u201cAs consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.\u201dAt the S.M.U. library in Dallas, Ms. Khan was finding that vocabulary. These dead books, many from an era that predated the price-based era of monopoly law, were an influence and an inspiration. She was planning to expand her essay into a book, she said in an interview here in June.Then her life shifted, and she abruptly went from an outsider proposing reform to an insider formulating policy. Rohit Chopra, a new Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, pulled her in as a temporary adviser in July, at a time when urgent questions about privacy, data, competition and antitrust were suddenly in the air. The F.T.C. is holding a series of hearings this fall, the first of their type since 1995, on whether a changing economy requires changing enforcement attitudes.\u201cIdeas and assumptions that it was heretical to question are now openly being contested,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it.\u201dGenuinely original voices are rare in Washington policy circles, and Mr. Chopra is pleased to have Ms. Khan in his camp. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to come across a legal prodigy like Lina Khan,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing about her career is typical. You don\u2019t see many law students publish groundbreaking legal research, or research that had such a deep impact so quickly.\u201d\u201cIt takes time to crush men who are pursuing legitimate trade. But one of Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s most impressive characteristics is patience. \u2026 He was like a general who, besieging a city surrounded by fortified hills, views from a balloon the whole great field, and sees how, this point taken, that must fall; this hill reached, that fort is commanded. And nothing was too small: the corner grocery in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipeline. Nothing, for little things grow.\u201dWhen Ms. Khan read that, she thought: Jeff Bezos.Her Yale Law Journal paper argued that monopoly regulators who focus on consumer prices are thinking too short-term. In Ms. Khan\u2019s view, a company like Amazon \u2014 one that sells things, competes against others selling things, and owns the platform where the deals are done \u2014 has an inherent advantage that undermines fair competition.\u201cThe long-term interests of consumers include product quality, variety and innovation \u2014 factors best promoted through both a robust competitive process and open markets,\u201d she wrote.The issue Ms. Khan\u2019s article really brought to the fore is this: Do we trust Amazon, or any large company, to create our future? In think tanks and universities, the battle has been joined.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that antitrust enforcement has gotten far too weak,\u201d said Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan scholar who doesn\u2019t agree with Ms. Khan but credits her with opening up a much-needed debate. \u201cIt\u2019s a bridge much further to say we should go back to the populist goal of leveling playing fields and checking \u2018bigness.\u2019 \u201dThe analogies with Amazon are explicit. Don\u2019t let the government pursue Amazon the way it pursued A.&P., Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein warned.\u201cAmazon has added hundreds of billions of dollars of value to the U.S. economy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is a brilliant innovator\u201d whose \u201cbreakthroughs have in turn helped launch new waves of innovation across retail and technology sectors, to the great benefit of consumers.\u201dAmazon itself could not have made the argument any better. Which isn\u2019t surprising, because in a footnote on the first page, the authors noted: \u201cWe approached Amazon Inc. for funding to tell the story\u201d of A.&P., \u201cand we gratefully acknowledge its support.\u201d They added at the end of footnote 85: \u201cThe authors have advised Amazon on a variety of antitrust issues.\u201dAmazon declined to say how much its support came to in dollars. It also declined to comment on Ms. Khan or her paper directly, but issued a statement.\u201cWe operate in a diverse range of businesses, from retail and entertainment to consumer electronics and technology services, and we have intense and well-established competition in each of these areas,\u201d the company said. \u201cRetail is our largest business today and we represent less than 1 percent of global retail.\u201dHer father was a management consultant; her mother an executive in information services. Ms. Khan went to Williams College, where she wrote a thesis on the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. She was the editor of the student paper but worked hard at everything.\u201cWe were routinely emailing each other on separate floors of the library as it was closing at 2 a.m.,\u201d said Amanda Korman, a classmate.Like many a wonkish youth, Ms. Khan headed to Washington after graduating in 2010, applying for a position at the left-leaning New America Foundation. Barry Lynn, who headed the organization\u2019s Open Markets antimonopoly initiative, seized on her application. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to teach public policy to people who already know how to write than teach writing to public policy experts,\u201d said Mr. Lynn, a former journalist.Ms. Khan wrote about industry consolidation and monopolistic practices for Washington publications that specialize in policy, went to Yale Law School, published her Amazon paper and then came back to Washington last year, just as interest was starting to swell in her work.\u201cPolls show huge concerns about concentrated power, corporate power, but if people are asked, \u2018Do we have a monopoly problem?\u2019 they answer, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Lynn. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the language for it.\u201d\u201cThe whole country has been struggling to understand why the economy is not operating in the right way,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said. \u201cWages have remained stagnant. Workers have less and less power. All we\u2019re trying to do is create a level playing field, and that\u2019s harder when you have megacompanies that make it virtually impossible for small competitors.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning of solutions to this.\u201dSomewhere in the midst of all this, Ms. Khan found the time to marry Shah Ali, a doctor now doing a cardiology fellowship in Dallas, which explains why she was camping out at the S.M.U. law library. The honeymoon was in Hawaii. Dr. Ali took Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPersuasion,\u201d because he hadn\u2019t reread it in a while. Ms. Khan brought a book on corporations and American democracy.The battle for intellectual supremacy takes place less these days in learned journals and more on social media, where tongues are sharp and branding is all. This is not Ms. Khan\u2019s strong suit. She is always polite, even on Twitter. One consequence is that she didn\u2019t give much thought about what to call the movement to reboot antitrust. Neither did anyone else.\u201cAntitrust Hipsterism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything old is cool again.\u201dMr. Medvedovsky, who calls Ms. Khan\u2019s article \u201cthe face of this movement,\u201d said the term was designed to be \u201cplayful rather than pejorative.\u201dAdmirers of Ms. Khan and her fellow reformers have sometimes called them the New Brandeis School or the New Brandeisians, after Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era foe of big business. As brands go, these are somewhat less catchy than \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201dThe Hipster issue was sponsored by Facebook, another sign that Big Tech is striving to shape the monopoly-law debate. The company declined to comment.Things are moving fast, so there is a lot to write papers about.Contemporary antitrust regulation, the commissioner wrote, is conducted in the courts, which makes it numbingly slow and dependent on high-paid expert witnesses. He called for the agency to use its authority to issue rules that would \u201cadvance clarity and certainty\u201d about what is, and what is not, an unfair method of competition.These rules would not be \u201csome inflexible prescription\u201d but standards, guidelines, pointers or presumptions, he wrote. Since everyone affected by a proposed rule would have the opportunity to weigh in on it, the process would be more democratic.There is more than an echo here of Ms. Khan\u2019s notion that the past can help rescue the future.\u201cThese are new technologies and new business models,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cThe remedy is new thinking that is informed by traditional principles.\u201dMs. Khan was not the first to criticize Amazon, and she said the company was not really her target anyway. \u201cAmazon is not the problem \u2014 the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon depicts that in an elegant way,\u201d she said.From Amazon\u2019s point of view, however, it is a problem indeed that Ms. Khan concludes in the Yale paper that regulating parts of the company like a utility \u201ccould make sense.\u201d She also said it \u201ccould make sense\u201d to treat Amazon\u2019s e-commerce operation like a bridge, highway, port, power grid or telephone network \u2014 all of which are required to allow access to their infrastructure on a nondiscriminatory basis.Ms. Khan put those ideas out there, which is how Rachel Tsuna found them.Last fall, the Barnard College senior was casting about for a subject for her senior thesis. \u201cWhat is really interesting to you?\u201d her adviser asked. Ms. Tsuna, now 22, had worked for a chewing gum start-up \u2014 yes, there are such things \u2014 that sold through Amazon, and knew firsthand the retailer\u2019s tight grip. \u201cAmazon is scary!\u201d she exclaimed.This impulsive declaration suggested a topic: Did the F.T.C. have the grounds to move against Amazon? Ms. Tsuna made little progress until she came across Ms. Khan\u2019s paper.\u201cI finally felt like I was pursuing something valid,\u201d Ms. Tsuna said. \u201cLina Khan gave me the confidence I needed.\u201d The thesis, which is quite fair to Amazon, got an A minus.That\u2019s the way movements begin. Little things grow.\u201cThis is a moment in time that invites a movement,\u201d said Ms. Khan. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than antitrust, bigger than Big Tech. It\u2019s about whether the laws serve democratic ends.\u201dIt was late at night in late July, and she was eating a burrata concoction at a popular restaurant near the Washington apartment she uses when not in Texas with her husband. After the death of Judge Reinhardt, her options opened up. She had the Columbia fellowship. Maybe she would also write the book. Or go back to the F.T.C. full time. Or somehow do it all.\u201cAmazon is a monopoly, and I worry that it monopolizes Lina,\u201d said her husband, Dr. Ali. \u201cI learn about what she is doing from looking at her Twitter feed.\u201d\u201cI throw myself into things,\u201d Ms. Khan agreed. \u201cMy life is spread out now.\u201dWith some cajoling, she revealed her Amazon account. There were just three purchases in 18 months. An altimeter for her father, who has taken up hiking, is the only one she will agree to have mentioned, although the other two are incredibly benign. One attribute Ms. Khan shares with Amazon is a strong desire to control the flow of information.Balancing the attention and the achievement, the expectations and the demands, is difficult, perhaps impossible.\u201cI don\u2019t think of my work in grandiose terms. I feel an urgency but I\u2019m also wary of hubris,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cNobody has been expecting this to succeed. I\u2019m awed by the challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Your Beliefs Here: A Look at Advocacy Advertising in The Times", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA recent print ad in support of Christine Blasey Ford is part of a long history of advertisements in the paper whose main purpose is to forward a cause.You may have noticed a bold advertisement in The New York Times on Wednesday: a full page with the names of 1,600 men, in a tiny font, surrounding a box in the center stating: \u201cWe believe Anita Hill. We also believe Christine Blasey Ford.\u201dMany observers have noted that Thursday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee hearings with Dr. Blasey and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, whom she has accused of sexual assault when both were teenagers, echoed the 1991 hearings for Anita Hill, who alleged that Judge Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her while he was her supervisor in the Education Department and at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.This ad in The Times, too, may have called up memories of those 1991 events \u2014 this time, on purpose. It was designed as homage to an ad that ran Nov. 17, 1991, a bit smaller but with the same layout: hundreds of tiny names, and the title \u201cAfrican American Women in Defense of Ourselves.\u201d That ad was organized by three black feminist scholars, Barbara Ransby, Deborah King and Elsa Barkley Brown, who spent weeks amassing signatures and donations to pay for the statement in support for Ms. Hill.Other notable examples have included an ad in 1922 by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to protest lynching; a 1966 ad from members of the academic community imploring Washington to terminate the American military presence in Vietnam; and an ad signed more than 20 companies, including Google, Unilever and Morgan Stanley, to encourage President Trump not to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement in 2017. \u201cWe routinely accept issue-related advocacy ads as long as the ad meets with our standards and requirements,\u201d said Eileen Murphy, the senior vice president for communications. \u201cWe require and publish details about the sponsor of any advocacy ad, plus a legitimate point of contact, for example a website, for that organization.\u201dAmong the signatories were prominent figures then and now, including the writers Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison and Tayari Jones, who posted a thread on Twitter last week about her experience being asked to add her name to the ad while she was a 20-year-old graduate student at the University of Iowa. She contributed $25, a donation that felt like a significant sacrifice. \u201cIt was the first time I\u2019d ever really put my money where my mouth was,\u201d Ms. Jones said this week. \u201cFor $25, I could have eaten dinner out three times.\u201dThough their methods were very different \u2014 social media callouts and a crowdfunding campaign through mightycause.com, as compared with the phone number, post-office box and piles of checks for Ms. Ransby and her fellow organizers \u2014 the result looked much the same: a prominent, attention-getting ad in The New York Times.\u201cI ride hard for print,\u201d Ms. Harris said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s permanent.\u201dResearch contributed by Jack Begg and Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re.Advertisement"}

When she told him she had broken up with a musician in London, he quickly brought up another musician, his friend Wade Michael, who had just moved to Brooklyn from his native Wisconsin after the breakup of his rock band, American Standard. Mr. Michael, he said, had previously lived in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and had come to New York a bit dazed and confused, hoping to give his music \u201cone last try.\u201dWhen he asked Ms. Jow if she wanted to join him and Mr. Michael for lunch, she politely declined. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in being set up,\u201d she said.She did, however, send Mr. Michael an email to apologize for turning down the invite. \u201cI just wanted to be courteous,\u201d she said.But when she noticed how \u201csurprisingly proper and charismatic\u201d Mr. Michael\u2019s email responses were, she became intrigued, so she reached out and they arranged to meet for coffee.\u201cShe was very striking with beautiful blonde hair,\u201d Mr. Michael said. \u201cJust the way she talked, and the things she talked about, like the world she was a part of in London, those were things that growing up in the Midwest I was very interested in, but never fully understood.\u201dThey began spending time together and became an item in March 2012, after a heart-to-heart talk at a Brooklyn bar where Ms. Jow discussed the emotional pain of her breakup in London.

It proved to be the most critically divisive movie of 1968 and for some the kickiest. The Daily News dismissed it as \u201ca grisly melodrama,\u201d while, jumping on the movie\u2019s bandwagon, Time magazine\u2019s critic saw \u201ca sly, jaundiced look at swinging youth and the pervasive American climate of violence.\u201dCovert antics become sinister once Dennis lose his job and decides to sabotage the factory that he believes is polluting the local river with colorful toxins. That\u2019s one meaning of the movie\u2019s title. The other refers to sprightly Sue Ann who, despite her infectious giggle, turns out to be far more pathological than her suitor. Before the movie ends Sue Ann\u2019s turquoise Sunbeam roadster will seem as menacing as the Creature from the Black Lagoon.\u201cPretty Poison\u201d also became an issue in the longstanding feud between New York\u2019s two most influential movie critics, Kael and Andrew Sarris. Newly installed at The New Yorker on the strength of her impassioned defense of \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d Kael fought to have \u201cPretty Poison\u201d rereleased and, according to Brian Kellow\u2019s biography, masterminded the movie\u2019s New York Critics Circle award. Sarris began his Village Voice review with a dig: \u201cA covey of high-flying, high-sounding critics have managed to save \u2018Pretty Poison\u2019 from a fate worse than death in the fleshpots of 42nd Street.\u201d Noting that the movie had reopened at the Eighth Street Playhouse, a showcase for European art films, he joked that \u201cunfortunately, \u2018Pretty Poison\u2019 turns out to be too pretentious for 42nd Street but not pretentious enough for Eighth Street.\u201dSarris viewed \u201cPretty Poison\u201d as an inflated B-movie, tricked out with \u201cnew wave\u201d shock cuts and imitation Alain Resnais flashbacks. Indeed, Mr. Black\u2019s movie benefited from the au courant notion that B-movies could be a form of Pop Art. Reviewers naturally bracketed \u201cPretty Poison\u201d with \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d \u2014 not least because Ms. Weld, who declined the role of Bonnie to spend time with her newborn, here showed what she might have brought to the part. More surprising in a review as knowledgeable as Sarris\u2019s was the lack of acknowledgment for the B-movie classic \u201cGun Crazy\u201d (1950), a film he had praised as superior to \u201cBonnie and Clyde\u201d in his 1968 history, \u201cThe American Cinema.\u201dThat, it would seem, was the movie\u2019s point. It\u2019s no surprise that \u201cGun Crazy,\u201d like \u201cPretty Poison,\u201d attained cult status in the late 1960s when it was said that violence was as American as cherry pie.Both \u201cPretty Poison\u201d and \u201cGun Crazy\u201d are available for streaming on multiple platforms, including Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play, Vudu and iTunes.

Jamie D. McCourt was hosting a party in celebration of a new special relationship: that of Google and fashion. The digital giant may be under fire from conservatives, but it is wooing style.Victoria Beckham was hobnobbing with Amber Valletta, Joseph Altuzarra with Pierre Hardy, Alexandre Arnault with Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior. Virgil Abloh, taking time off from preparations for his Off-White show the next day, was the D.J. Haim performed and Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid cheered.The digital sphere has become its own city-state, and everyone is declaring allegiance.60 PhotosOr most everyone. It has become so common to talk about shows as online content, conceived to catch the eyes of the generation that lives with a smartphone and all its filters as a bodily extension and blah blah blah, so on and so forth, that it is almost a shock to see a collection made with a three-dimensional woman and not a two-dimensional image in mind. But such was the case with Dries Van Noten, whose clothes managed to be both utterly grounded and a little fantastical at the same time.Using basic cotton workwear, he wrapped and draped, furled and unfurled it into shapes that gestured toward D.I.Y. Parisian evening gowns. Baggy overalls were rolled down to the waist to create peplums. A taffeta-like trench knotted to create a train. A plain white T-shirt tied with a big black bow around the bust, and paired with slouchy cargo pants. Iridescent nylon anoraks floated over shift dresses dangling plastic feathers. Beaded gold fringe poured down the shoulders of a simple white shirt.There were florals and stripes and checkerboard squares; cobalt blue and sunshine yellow, tangerine and watery emerald green.They had the clarity and balm of cool air blowing in an open window. Looking at them you could practically hear the birds chirping. Hello, reality! Forgot about you for a moment there.Perhaps it\u2019s because Mr. Van Noten shows what he sells, which is to say: not simply an idea of how someone might look, but the actual dresses, skirts and suits that express that idea and make it onto the shop floor. It\u2019s harder to combine the two effectively than you might think, especially in these social media-driven days, which is why designers often want showgoers to come back and see what\u2019s in their showrooms: the \u201cwearable\u201d derivations of the more extreme looks they put on the runway, in order to make a statement through a small screen.Although another solution is to pile everything up willy-nilly so it simply can\u2019t be missed. Witness Natacha Ramsay-Levi at Chlo\u00e9, who, calling her collection \u201chippie modernism,\u201d took a virtual van down to the beach at sunset on Ibiza (or Crete or Capri or Essaouira; take your pick), and then pulled an assortment of urban folklore out of her magic trunk.Paisley and flower power silk scarves sourced from flea markets were remade as bias-cut silk dresses and shorts with flowing pareo \u201cskirts\u201d at the back; sunset shade T-shirts had a shadow print of arms raised in a triangular feminist symbol; tapestry knits became coats; flared silk trousers were finished in silk fringe at the ankles; and pleated Grecian dresses were caught by leather harnesses.57 PhotosThere were big dangling earrings and upper-arm bands and toe rings; knotted rope belts and chunky clogs; a whole lot of bags and a bit of sleight of hand. Look closer, and the faded denim jeans and shirt were actually trompe l\u2019oeil silk; a pair of basket-woven pants, perforated leather; what seemed to be semiprecious stones on a vest, in fact, man-made simulacra.Crafty, in other words, in a whole variety of connected ways. And you didn\u2019t really have to search for them.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alex Jones Said Bans Would Strengthen Him. He Was Wrong.", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe more I\u2019m persecuted, the stronger I get,\u201d Mr. Jones said on his live internet broadcast three days later. \u201cIt backfired.\u201dYet a review of traffic on Infowars several weeks after the bans shows that the tech companies drastically reduced Mr. Jones\u2019s reach by cutting off his primary distribution channels: YouTube and Facebook.In the three weeks before the Aug. 6 bans, Infowars had a daily average of nearly 1.4 million visits to its website and views of videos posted by its main YouTube and Facebook pages, according to a New York Times analysis of data from the web data firms Tubular Labs and SimilarWeb. In the three weeks afterward, its audience fell by roughly half, to about 715,000 site visits and video views, according to the analysis.The analysis did not include traffic to the two-month-old Infowars app or views of videos that Mr. Jones posted on Twitter, where his accounts remain active. He also still shares posts inside private Facebook groups, and his followers repost his content from their social-media accounts. But data suggest that those sources of traffic are smaller than Mr. Jones\u2019s main Facebook and YouTube pages.That Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, muffled one of the internet\u2019s loudest voices so quickly illustrates the tremendous influence a few internet companies have over public discourse and the spread of information.Now that access to Infowars is mainly through its website or app, Mr. Jones\u2019s ability to reach new viewers is severely limited because they will no longer come across his videos while scrolling through Facebook or YouTube, said Monica Stephens, a geography professor at the University at Buffalo who has studied the spread of misinformation online.\u201cThis increases the likelihood Infowars is preaching to a filter bubble versus reaching new audiences,\u201d she said.In an email, he wrote, \u201cSocial justice warriors machinate to get speakers canceled, and social networks purge conservatives, for the same reason: no-platforming works.\u201dNeither Mr. Jones nor Infowars responded to requests for comment.The main Facebook pages for Mr. Jones and Infowars, meanwhile, had drawn 668 million views of their videos over the past three years, according to Tubular Labs.YouTube erased Mr. Jones\u2019s channel for flouting a penalty for a previous punishment for hate speech. YouTube also quietly deleted more than a dozen other channels associated with Infowars for trying to circumvent its rules.Since then, Mr. Jones has made the companies a central theme of his near-daily show. In recent shows broadcast on his website, he has falsely accused YouTube and Facebook of being controlled by the Chinese government and assisting in an elaborate global conspiracy to control the world\u2019s population.\u201cIt is a panopticonic, total internet-of-things-integration, global-social-score, complete command-and-control system,\u201d Mr. Jones said three days after the ban. \u201cIt is the virtual-reality, A.I. weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies blocking Trump\u2019s resistance of the program.\u201dHe added, \u201cI have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information.\u201dMr. Trump has since accelerated his criticism of Silicon Valley and how it surfaces information, alleging that Google doctored search results for his name. Google has denied the claim.For a brief period after the bans, Mr. Jones enjoyed a bump in publicity. Traffic to Infowars.com soared 67 percent to about 777,000 visits a day in the two weeks after the ban, compared with the previous two weeks, SimilarWeb said. Downloads of the Infowars app surged sixfold to 25,500 downloads a day over the same period, according to Apptopia, which tracks app data.But both figures have since fallen to nearly pre-ban levels. And the spike could not replace the lost traffic from the top three Facebook and YouTube channels for Infowars, which together averaged roughly 900,000 video views a day in the three weeks before the ban, according to Tubular Labs.Other outlets have not helped much. Even as Mr. Jones\u2019s account has remained on Twitter, his videos there attract 21,000 views on average, compared with 44,500 views per YouTube video, according to NeoReach, which helps brands market on social media. The Infowars accounts on other sites, such as Dailymotion, Amazon\u2019s Twitch and BitChute, a video site mostly for people barred from YouTube, garner views in the hundreds for videos \u2014 and often fewer.NeoReach said an analysis of Mr. Jones\u2019s followers on social media showed that most were white married men, with an average age of 28 and average annual income of $46,500. NeoReach said his Twitter account \u201chas a notable audience concentration in New York.\u201dDespite Mr. Jones\u2019s early pronouncements that the bans would make his Infowars operation stronger, there are signs he is concerned.On one recent show, he ranted without evidence that Silicon Valley companies gave liberals like the billionaire George Soros access to their users\u2019 personal data, including \u201cyour film roll, what you did with your wife, your kids, you know, in the bathtub, Grandma.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all theirs,\u201d he shouted. \u201cAnd everybody\u2019s lining up to kiss these monsters\u2019 disgusting satanic souls.\u201dSeconds later, the show went to a break, cutting to a recorded promotion in which Mr. Jones urged his followers to share Infowars\u2019 videos on social media and to sign up for its newsletter \u201cso there\u2019s no way the censors can get between us.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Dorsey \u2014 who sported a nose ring, a popped-collar shirt and a craggy Moses beard \u2014 looked more like a hipster version of a Civil War officer than a tech icon. Yet more striking than his look was his manner before skeptical lawmakers.Faced with tough questions, Mr. Dorsey did not mount an aggressive defense of his company and his technology, as an earlier generation of tech leader might have. Instead, he demurred, conceded mistakes and generally engaged in a nuanced and seemingly heartfelt colloquy on the difficulties of managing tech in a complex world. Even in response to Mr. Barton\u2019s comment about his look, Mr. Dorsey was solicitous. \u201cMy mom agrees with you,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony prompted questions about what we expect from tech leaders today \u2014 and how thoroughly what we expect has been upturned in the last few years. Since the 1980s, a common leadership archetype has loomed over the tech business: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Sometimes unconsciously and often deliberately, a generation of tech leaders attempted to ape the Apple and Microsoft founders\u2019 charisma, their quirks, their style and above all their irrepressible, hard-charging confidence, to say nothing of arrogance.That is, Mr. Dorsey sounded less like a quotable visionary who can see beyond the horizon and more like what he actually is and ought to be \u2014 a thoughtful, accessible, transparent and, despite the beard and nose ring, kind of boring manager of a serious company whose decisions have world-changing consequences.When it comes to tech C.E.O.s, boring is the new black. Under the glare of global scrutiny, the daring, win-at-all-costs ethos that defined so much of the tech industry in the last couple of decades has been undergoing a thorough metamorphosis.Google once played up the nerdy antics of its founders, but now the company\u2019s leaders are almost unidentifiable ciphers. Larry Page, who runs Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has become a recluse, and even Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s achingly pleasant chief, declined to appear at last week\u2019s hearings.Oh, and I almost forgot about Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O. In my defense, everyone forgets about Mr. Nadella.\u201cA start-up that has five million people using it \u2014 that\u2019s small for Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s a tremendous number of people, and so even they have a large amount of responsibility in the world,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.The tech press has also gotten tougher. Once, novelty alone would merit coverage, but in the social media age, even the tiniest misstep can be ruinous. It has become crucial to get a leader who doesn\u2019t speak out of turn.Mr. Musk\u2019s odd behavior underlines the tensions at play as understated style takes over tech. There is a reason that a big, Jobsian personality was once so prized. Tech companies are leaps of faith. In their early days they exist on the knife edge of oblivion, and it is often only through a founder\u2019s force of personality that investors, employees and the media take any notice. The most beloved founders possess an uncanny genius for selling the world on ideas that look useless, pointless or impossible before we all realize we can never live without them.Though he has made good on only some of those points \u2014 Tesla is now struggling to fulfill orders for the Model 3, the \u201ceven more affordable\u201d car in the plan \u2014 posting the plan was part of an impish ploy to generate publicity for what looked like an outlandish idea. That ploy worked; ever since, Mr. Musk has leveraged his growing celebrity as if it were a currency.Every few months, he makes new promises about this or that amazing thing coming soon. Each time, he reaps more attention and financing and, eventually, builds real cars that are sold to real people. In this way, Mr. Musk\u2019s personality became a key element of not just his companies\u2019 brands, but their business models.But it\u2019s a tricky, high-stakes gamble. For one thing, Mr. Musk has to deliver on his promises. More recently, another problem has eaten at this strategy: The future has been getting less obviously wonderful, so it\u2019s hard to take any tech chief\u2019s assurances that their new thing will indeed be as great for the world as they say.\u201cI tried to convince people to slow down A.I.,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cThis was futile. I tried for many years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.\u201dThus, the tension: On one hand, Mr. Musk wants us to believe that everything he\u2019s building is going to turn out wonderfully. On the other, he\u2019s telling us to be very scared. This sounds like a contradiction, but in its admission of doubt and complexity, it\u2019s actually a pretty good picture of the future.No wonder he sounds crazy. No wonder everyone else is going for boring.Advertisement"}

He is not alone in his quest.Supported byBENTON, N.H. \u2014 The hiker trudged up a logging road and into a valley, tracing a route that seemed unremarkable. There were no sweeping views of the mountains that towered nearby. There was no summit to scale. Yet he stopped suddenly, jubilant, after about four miles of walking. He had found exactly what he was searching for: quiet.\u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said the hiker, Dennis Follensbee, \u201chow we experience three minutes of silence.\u201dIn these loud times \u2014 with political foes yelling on television, trucks rumbling through streets, and smartphones chirping all around \u2014 who doesn\u2019t want a little peace and quiet? But some wilderness lovers have taken their aversion to the cacophony of the modern world a step further, traveling to some of the country\u2019s most remote areas in a quest for utter silence.Armed with Google Maps, bushwhacking tools and 16 years of experience hiking in the area, Mr. Follensbee, a programmer from Lebanon, N.H., is on an exhaustive search for the noiseless hollows and dells of New Hampshire\u2019s White Mountains.\u201cI know there must be places I can go to have peace,\u201d said Mr. Follensbee, 39, who has mapped 23 quiet places so far, though he has shared the exact locations only with family members and close friends. (If quiet places are widely known, he reasons, \u201cthey cease to be quiet.\u201d)Noise that humans create can be annoying but also dangerous to animals who rely on hearing to seek their prey and avoid predators. \u201cWe\u2019re really starting to understand the consequences of noise and the importance of natural sound,\u201d said Rachel Buxton, a conservation biologist at Colorado State University who worked on the study.\u201cWe need to defend quiet places that remain as well as clean up places that should be quiet,\u201d Mr. Hempton said.Efforts to regulate noise have never been as broad or well organized as some environmental causes, and they sometimes have lost steam or been met with opposition from industry groups. In the 1970s, the Environmental Protection Agency had an Office of Noise Abatement and Control, but it lost its funding during deregulation of the early 1980s.\u201cThe sound, it\u2019s thrilling when you\u2019re a motorcycle rider,\u201d said Peter Spinney, 75, a New Jersey resident who rode through the White Mountains last month. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the attraction.\u201dOn a recent Sunday afternoon, motorcycles thundered up the Mount Washington Auto Road, and cars lumbered around hairpin turns. At the top of the mountain, the wheels of a motor coach rumbled over the gravel, and the biodiesel engine of the Cog Railway, which carts visitors up and down the mountain whirred constantly.Richard Davy\u2019s journey up the mountain brought him to the summit, where the sound of a crying child could be heard over all else. He takes a semiannual pilgrimage here, and said he hoped his ashes would one day be scattered here. \u201cWith that crying kid, I don\u2019t know, I might reconsider,\u201d Mr. Davy, 69, said.Given the loud crowds, some hikers have taken to avoiding the tallest mountains, making lists instead of quieter getaways. For Dave Govatski, a naturalist who opposes a hotel proposed near the top of Mount Washington, it is Shoal Pond, several miles from the road. For Dave Smith, who volunteers as a White Mountain National Forest trail steward, it is Lonesome Lake, protected from road noise by ridges.But even in out of the way places, silence can be fleeting.For three minutes, a soft hum of insects, a rustle of leaves, the calls of birds was all there was. Then came the whine of a vehicle, its motor growing louder as it came over a ridge. It ruined everything.\u201cIt is a little disappointing,\u201d Mr. Follensbee said, shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019re so far out.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Conservative Pundit Points Finger at Another Man to Deflect From Kavanaugh", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The head of a prominent conservative research organization apologized on Friday for a bizarre string of tweets in which he suggested that the woman accusing Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh of sexual assault might be confusing the judge for one of his high school classmates, whom he posted pictures of and named.Edward Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a friend of Mr. Kavanaugh, faced swift condemnation from liberals and fellow conservatives Thursday night after he posted a theory purporting to offer an alternative explanation for the story of Christine Blasey Ford, the California professor who has put the confirmation of President Trump\u2019s second Supreme Court nominee in jeopardy.Mr. Whelan did not apologize to Dr. Blasey or for his broader theory of mistaken identity, and in several other posts this week he has sought to cast doubt on her claims and to defend Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s innocence.Mr. Whelan once clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, served as a counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee and worked with Judge Kavanaugh in the White House of President George W. Bush. He is a well-connected member of Washington\u2019s conservative legal establishment, an informal network that exercises considerable influence over the choice and confirmation fights of judicial nominees.Conservative operatives who have worked with Mr. Whelan raised doubts that he could have acted alone.Steve Schmidt, an outspoken critic of the president who worked for Republicans before leaving the party, said that Mr. Whelan had been the \u201csingularly most important and effective outside adviser involved in the confirmation effort\u201d of two earlier Republican court nominees whom Mr. Schmidt helped lead.\u201cHe is a brilliant, meticulous and serious lawyer,\u201d Mr. Schmidt wrote on Twitter on Friday. \u201cHe is not a conspiracy nut. It is inconceivable to me that Whelan published that email without discussions, debate and assistance from the WH and GOP Senators and staff.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt is not the isolated musings of one man but rather part of a broader discreditation strategy.\u201dIn a statement through her lawyers, Dr. Blasey flatly rejected the possibility that she had confused Judge Kavanaugh with the classmate identified by Mr. Whelan.\u201cI knew them both, and socialized with\u201d the classmate, Dr. Blasey said. She noted that she had once even visited the classmate in the hospital. \u201cThere is zero chance that I would confuse them.\u201dThe man identified in the Twitter thread did not reply to phone messages seeking comment, and The New York Times is not naming him.In a letter to Democratic lawmakers and an interview with The Washington Post, Dr. Blasey has accused Judge Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a small gathering of teens in suburban Washington when they were both in high school \u2014 an accusation that has threatened to derail his confirmation.Dr. Blasey has said that as a friend watched, the future Judge Kavanaugh pushed her onto a bed, where he jumped on top of her, groped her and tried to remove her clothing. At one point, he clapped his hand over her mouth to stop calls for help as the friend turned up the music. When the friend jumped on them, Dr. Blasey was able to dash out of the room.Adamant denials by Judge Kavanaugh \u2014 who says he does not even remember such a party taking place \u2014 and two other teenage males Dr. Blasey said were there have given rise in conservative circles to speculation that Dr. Blasey could have misidentified her assailant or, more than 30 years later, is misremembering the story.It was into that murky space that Mr. Whelan confidently stepped on Thursday.\u201cDr. Ford may well have been the victim of a severe sexual assault by someone 36 years ago,\u201d Mr. Whelan wrote in one post. \u201cHer allegations are so vague as to such basic matters as when and where that it is impossible for Judge Kavanaugh to *prove* his innocence.\u201dHe proceeded to lay out a theory that Dr. Blasey\u2019s account could alternatively describe a student at Georgetown Prep, where Judge Kavanaugh went to high school, whom Mr. Whelan identifies as a friend and football teammate. Using photographs from Georgetown Prep\u2019s yearbook, Google Maps and floor plans of a home that he identifies as that of the classmate, Mr. Whelan built a case that details of Dr. Blasey\u2019s account fit the classmate\u2019s home.\u201cIf you\u2019re at a gathering of \u2018four others\u2019 in someone\u2019s home, you\u2019d ordinarily think that the four others include the host who lives in the home,\u201d Mr. Whelan wrote. \u201cAnd that host would be the person least likely to act like a guest and most likely to use private areas in the house.\u201dMr. Whelan proceeded to post photos of the classmate and Judge Kavanaugh in high school and more recently, suggesting that their similar appearance could easily confuse someone. He offered no evidence that the house was where the party had taken place other than its proximity to a country club where Dr. Blasey said they had gathered before heading to the residence.At the end of the thread, Mr. Whelan then sought to distance himself from his own suggestion, insisting that it did not \u201cstate, imply or insinuate\u201d that the man or anyone else assaulted Dr. Blasey.\u201cIt is regrettable that private citizens are being drawn into this,\u201d he wrote, blaming the Judiciary Committee for not investigating the matter sooner.Elizabeth Dias contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Satellite Images and Shadow Analysis: How The Times Verifies Eyewitness Videos", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUnderstanding the timesVisual investigations based on social media posts require a mix of traditional journalistic diligence and cutting-edge internet skills.Was a video of a chemical attack really filmed in Syria? What time of day did an airstrike happen? Which military unit was involved in a shooting in Afghanistan? Is this dramatic image of glowing clouds really showing wildfires in California? These are some of the questions the video team at The New York Times has to answer when reviewing raw eyewitness videos, often posted to social media. It can be a highly challenging process, as misinformation shared through digital social networks is a serious problem for a modern-day newsroom. Visual information in the digital age is easy to manipulate, and even easier to spread. The following provides some insight into our video verification process. It is not a comprehensive overview, but highlights some of our most trusted techniques and tools. We review numerous videos on any given day. In addition to news agencies, we scour social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat for news-relevant content. We also access eyewitness videos through WhatsApp, either by directly interacting with witnesses on the ground or by joining relevant groups.All of this content needs careful vetting.Our verification process is divided into two general steps: First, we determine whether a video is really new. Second, we dissect every frame to draw conclusions about location, date and time, the actors involved and what exactly happened.A major challenge for journalists today is to avoid using \u201crecycled content.\u201d This challenge is exacerbated in breaking news situations. When the U.S. launched airstrikes against Syria the night of April 13, little footage was initially available on wires and social media. As our team closely monitored Twitter that Friday night, a video started to circulate that showed a series of explosions, reportedly in Damascus. What the video actually showed, however, was fighting in the Ukrainian city of Luhansk in February 2015. This did not stop major broadcasters from using it in their coverage.Whether it\u2019s about natural disasters, school shootings or armed conflicts, we see this sort of misattributed content all the time. The more dramatic the footage, the more careful we have to be. We strive to establish the provenance of each video \u2014 who filmed it and why \u2014 and ask for permission to use it. In the perfect scenario, this involves obtaining the original video file or finding the first version of the video shared online, vetting the uploader\u2019s digital footprint and contacting the person \u2014 if it\u2019s safe to do so.Once we believe a video is genuine, we extract as much detail as possible. Since situations of armed conflict and severe state repression often make it challenging to connect with sources, for logistical or security reasons, we\u2019ve developed skills and methodologies to independently confirm or corroborate what\u2019s visible in a video.When we receive footage from wires such as The Associated Press or directly from a source\u2019s cellphone, our job is easy: Such content comes with provided or intact metadata \u2014 embedded, detailed information about what camera or cellphone was used, date and time, sometimes even exact coordinates that reveal the place.The metadata of content from social media and messaging apps, on the other hand \u2014 while it might reveal if a video was downloaded from Facebook or Twitter (which could debunk false claims from people who say they filmed an event) \u2014 comes with altered or removed metadata. We thus have to look for visual clues regarding location and date in the video itself.It\u2019s important to pay attention to the audio as well, as local dialects might help corroborate the general location.Determining the exact date and time of an incident is more challenging. We can use historical weather data to detect inconsistencies in a video, but of course that does not provide an exact date.Several projects are keeping our team busy. We have gathered security footage that \u2014 combined with shoe-leather reporting \u2014 has allowed us to reconstruct how a brutal murder in the U.S. unfolded. We are working with our international team to analyze a deadly crackdown on protests in one country and cut through the fog of war to distinguish real from fake atrocities spread on social media in another.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Robots Run, Dance and Flip. But Are They a Business?", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "Supported byWALTHAM, Mass. \u2014 Moving like a large dog, knees bent and hips swaying, the robot walked across a parking lot and into a rain puddle.There, it danced a jig, splashing water across the asphalt. Then it turned and trotted toward a brick building, climbing over a curb and stopping within inches of a floor-length window. Pausing for several seconds, it seemed to eye its own reflection in the glass.The scene was mesmerizing \u2014 so mesmerizing, it was easy to forget that a woman was guiding the four-legged machine from across the parking lot, a joystick in her hands and a laptop computer strapped to her waist.Even now, it is not entirely clear what someone would do with one of these robots. That makes it hard to get past a question people have been asking about Boston Dynamics for years: Is this a business or a research lab?\u201cWe think the technology has reached a point where it can be deployed productively,\u201d Marc Raibert, the company\u2019s founder, said during a recent interview inside his robotics lab, about 10 miles from Boston. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know what the big application is.\u201dBut if driverless cars are still years away from everyday use, walking robots are even further. Though these machines are shockingly lifelike, they have limits. They can handle some tasks on their own, like spotting a curb and climbing over it. But when moving across unfamiliar spaces, like the parking lot outside the Boston Dynamics lab, they still need a human guide. In person, they stumble and fall more often than they do on YouTube. Walking through the Boston Dynamics lab, Mr. Raibert, 68, wore bluejeans and a Hawaiian shirt, as he does nearly every day. He wants to build robots that can do what humans and animals can do. That was his aim in the early 1980s, when he founded the Leg Lab at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. And it was his aim when he moved the lab to M.I.T.In 2013, Google acquired Boston Dynamics during a broad push toward driverless cars and other robotics. But just four years later, Google, known for its \u201cmoonshot\u201d bets on long-term tech projects, sold Boston Dynamics to SoftBank.Mr. Raibert declined to say how much Google or SoftBank had paid for the company. He said both owners had provided ample funding for its research, and their involvement shows the potential of his work.No machine comes closer to his vision than Atlas, a 165-pound anthropomorphic robot that can run, jump and even do back flips. Mr. Raibert would not let us shoot video of Atlas or other robots while inside the lab. But he did give a brief demonstration of the machine.Like the SpotMini, Atlas is controlled by a joystick, a laptop computer and a wireless radio. When Mr. Raibert signaled for the demo, an engineer touched the joystick and the 165-pound robot crashed to the floor. Atlas is so large and so lifelike, you feel bad for it.Mr. Raibert and his colleagues put the machine back on its feet and tried again. When the engineers touched the joystick, Atlas crashed to the floor a second time.Eventually, the engineers got Atlas up and running \u2014 and sprinting and jumping and crashing headlong into an orange pylon. The excitement was mixed with discomfort when an engineer shoved its chest with the end of a broom handle and it stayed on its robotic feet. \u201cWe subconsciously treat robots like living things \u2014 and I don\u2019t think that effect will go away as we get used to the technology,\u201d said Kate Darling, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab who specializes in the ethics of robotics. \u201cIn some ways, we are biologically hard-wired to respond in this way.\u201dWith its YouTube videos, Boston Dynamics plays with this phenomenon. The videos rarely reveal the human operators who guide the machines.SpotMini is smaller and cheaper and has better balance than Atlas. It can carry (small) items on its back, and it can open doors (provided the doors have the proper handles). This requires an extra limb that attaches between its shoulders.The sales plans for SpotMini seem vague. It will be priced like a car \u2014 cars, Mr. Raibert added, have a wide range of prices \u2014 and it will be sold to businesses like construction companies. He talked in general terms about the machine\u2019s lugging stuff across rough terrain or into places unsafe for humans.As the technology improves, it could be a delivery robot, walking packages down the street, up your front steps and onto your porch. Mr. Raibert showed how a SpotMini could serve as a kind of automated security guard. Boston Dynamics has created a three-dimensional map of its lab, and the SpotMini can use this map to navigate the lab on its own. It could, in theory, patrol after everyone else had gone home.When Google acquired Boston Dynamics, it ended the company\u2019s military contracts. Now that the company is owned by SoftBank, Mr. Raibert said, it could also return to military work. Boston Dynamics does seem to have an owner willing to wait until the business gets figured out. And with a $100 billion investment fund, a partnership with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, SoftBank is betting on technologies that require years of work. Before buying Boston Dynamics, it acquired a French robotics company, Aldebaran, which also is working on machines that are a long way from completion. At Boston Dynamics, Mr. Raibert wants to sell robots to businesses, governments and all sorts of other customers. He calls himself \u201ca lifer\u201d in his quest to build machines that can do everything animals and humans can do. And if that means finding a way to make money from his experiments along the way, so be it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Five Underrated Things to Pack for Every Trip", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravel TipsSkip the fancy travel gadgets. Here are five simple things that will save you stress, money and hassle so you just enjoy your much-deserved getaway. I\u2019ve spent the majority of the last five years as a digital nomad, living and working in over 40 countries. Because of this, I tend to travel fairly light. I\u2019ve also tried countless travel gadgets, and found most are a waste of money and space. Instead, here are five universally useful, perhaps unexpected, items I never leave without.Pens are one of those things that only seem to be around when you don\u2019t need them. When you do, you can\u2019t find one. For example, most countries require you to fill out an immigration card before you enter. Your airline will give you this in-flight, but not a pen to fill it out. Traveling with a phone that works everywhere is a game changer. Being able to post to social media and talk with friends and family at home is great, but having fast access to Google Maps and Translate will transform your travel experience. Being able to book a new flight or hotel if something happens could save a vacation. For example, I was on a tiny island in Fiji when the call came in that an oncoming cyclone had intensified overnight to a category 3, and we would all have to evacuate. I was able to use my phone to immediately book one of the last hotel rooms on the main island. Nearly everyone else had to wait in line at the resort\u2019s office for one of the few computers and slow internet. The key is having internet access at all, and ideally, fast access. If you get your phone \u201cunlocked\u201d by your cellular provider, you can buy a local SIM card in whatever country you\u2019re visiting. This lets your phone work just like you bought it new in that country, with high-speed data and free local calls, depending on the SIM you buy. These are usually around $20, and available at airport vending machines and kiosks, although a cellphone store in town might be cheaper. If you have T-Mobile or Sprint, your phone should work in most other countries, though it will be very slow, so a local SIM might still be worth it. Verizon and AT&T have very expensive international data plans that offer just a couple of days worth of internet for the same price as a local SIM that will work for your whole trip. If you\u2019re with one of them, definitely check if you can unlock your phone and that it will work outside the United States (Verizon\u2019s phones should already be unlocked). Google Fi has 4G international data included, no local SIM needed. I mentioned Google Maps and Translate, but making the most of them requires some preparation before you leave. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re going to Paris. Type \u201cParis\u201d into Google Maps. Make sure you see all the parts of the city you need (the arrondissement where your hotel is, for example) and the parts you want to explore, then hit \u201csave\u201d at the bottom of the screen. This does exactly that, saving everything on the visible map. Now you can walk around without internet and still see a map of your surroundings. This includes street names, Metro stops and so on. Google Translate has the same feature, letting you download language packs for use offline. This speeds up translations, including the futuristic camera feature that lets you point your phone at a sign to translate what you\u2019re seeing in real time. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Five Eyes\u2019 Nations Quietly Demand Government Access to Encrypted Data", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration and its closest intelligence partners have quietly warned technology firms that they will demand \u201clawful access\u201d to all encrypted emails, text messages and voice communications, threatening to compel compliance if the private companies refuse to voluntarily provide the information to the governments.\u201cShould governments continue to encounter impediments to lawful access to information necessary to aid the protection of the citizens of our countries,\u201d the joint statement said, \u201cwe may pursue technological, enforcement, legislative or other measures to achieve lawful access solutions.\u201dOn Wednesday, leaders from two major social media firms, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, will testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on curbing election interference by Russia and other powers. The social networks are also expected to answer Republican charges that their firms, and others, use their platforms to emphasize news media sources with liberal bias.But the new demands by the five nations threaten to rekindle a debate that seized Washington and Silicon Valley after Apple gradually began encrypting more data on its phones.At the core of the dispute is whether Apple, Facebook, Google and others should be compelled to provide a \u201cback door\u201d to their products that would allow government investigators to gain access to all communications, with a legal order.It is far from clear that Congress is ready to take on the technology companies on this issue, especially because more companies and citizens are turning to encryption to protect sensitive conversations and financial transfers.Ordinary Americans \u2014 including President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen \u2014 are also increasingly using encrypted apps to conduct delicate conversations to prevent monitoring by the government or others.On Tuesday, staff members of key congressional committees said they had received no briefings on the new accord from Australia, and questioned how they could construct rules that provided access to all encrypted communications.One Senate staff member said the memo was unenforceable in its current form.Facebook and Google were similarly surprised, and questioned what sort of measures would be put into place with companies that did not comply.\u201cCybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it\u2019s impossible to create any back door that couldn\u2019t be discovered \u2014 and exploited \u2014 by bad actors,\u201d Facebook said in the blog post. \u201cIt\u2019s why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.\u201dIn response, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, contended that once phones or messaging systems were designed to allow legal access, hackers from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere would use the breach to pry their way in, destroying technology devised to protect privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s our job to provide you with the tools to lock up your stuff,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview in 2015.He tried, unsuccessfully, to convince former President Barack Obama that there was no safe technological way to create back doors; Apple deliberately does not retain the keys to unlock those communications, so they can tell investigators, or the courts, that they are unable to comply with demands for access.But Mr. Obama left office without resolving the issue of the government\u2019s ability to compel access. Both Mr. Trump and his rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, sided with law enforcement authorities on giving access to the government.One Facebook official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said that the memo from Australia had no teeth, and was part of an escalating war between government officials and Silicon Valley over access to people\u2019s private data.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Strategies for Long-Distance Caregiving", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen a loved one in another state is ill, virtually attending appointments is only part of the solution.A few months ago, my biggest sources of anxiety were politics, my finances, and whether I\u2019d make my next work deadline. Then one afternoon my mother called to tell me she had leukemia.Suddenly, my fear went beyond the kind that\u2019s inevitable when you have aging parents, to a more urgent worry about her current state of health and well-being. To complicate matters, she lives in Cleveland and I live in Queens, so my next thought was how we were going to navigate the myriad medical decisions that come along with cancer treatment. My first instinct was to book flights and travel to Ohio immediately, which I did. But I quickly realized that jumping onto a plane every time I got anxious or her health status changed was going to be unsustainable and prohibitively expensive. Knowing that my father is with her in Cleveland and my sister regularly travels in from Cincinnati is a certainly a comfort, but ultimately, having a sick mother in another state is unsettling. After meeting her doctors, nurses and physicians assistants at the hospital and getting permission to call them for updates, I was able to stay connected with her treatment and progress. Sometimes, my mother would FaceTime me when certain doctors were in her hospital room so I could virtually be there to hear what they had to say and ask any questions. During my second trip to Cleveland, a researcher approached me at the beginning of one of my mother\u2019s oncology appointments, and asked if I\u2019d be interested in being part of a study on distance caregiving. It is a federally funded clinical trial by researchers at Case Western Reserve University using videoconferencing to allow family members living at a distance to \u201cattend\u201d oncology appointments with their loved ones. I couldn\u2019t sign the consent form fast enough. About half of distance caregivers put in about one day a week of time, between scheduling appointments, paying bills, making phone calls and other related duties, she notes. The majority of distance caregivers are employed, Dr. Douglas said, with up to half having to miss days of work or rearrange their schedules to be able to care for someone, and up to one-third either having to reduce their work schedules significantly or stop working in order to manage all the aspects of caregiving.\u201cDistance caregivers, compared to local caregivers, have higher stress, feel less support, have higher anxiety and more burden,\u201d Dr. Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a group that hasn\u2019t been well recognized. We haven\u2019t really done a really good job up until this point in terms of trying to provide services that in some way make being a distance caregiver less stressful and more meaningful.\u201dDr. Douglas and her colleagues hypothesize that the first group will report feeling the most emotionally supported and informed, and ultimately hope to make these services widely available. But even for distance caregivers who aren\u2019t in the study, there are strategies that can help you stay on top of things from afar.Don\u2019t neglect your own well-being.Although it can be difficult, and even guilt-inducing, to make time for yourself as a distance caregiver, Dr. Fried finds it helpful to reframe the importance of caring for oneself, in part, as a prerequisite to providing sustained, effective care for others and preventing burnout. Check in regularly.\u201cChecking in regularly, at a time when it is convenient for you, helps you stay in control of your schedule and time and provides the opportunity to prevent a crisis,\u201d she explains. Divide and conquer.If, like me, you are fortunate enough to have a sibling or other close family members, Ms. Whitehead suggests dividing the caregiving tasks. This could mean that one person focuses on finances while another handles the medical aspects. Stay connected.It\u2019s hard enough keeping track of our own schedules, let alone managing that of someone who requires regular medical attention and lives in another location. At the very least, this involves two people and two different schedules, but if others \u2014 like partners, siblings or close friends \u2014 also play roles in the caregiving, coordinating schedules is even more essential. This ensures that everyone attends the appointments they\u2019re supposed to, bills are paid on time, and everyone is picked up from the airport when necessary.Ask for help when you need it.Part of self-care is knowing when you\u2019ve taken on too much and should ask for help, Dr. Fried says. This can involve everything from logistical support, like asking a neighbor to check in on your loved one, to social support for yourself, he adds. Be realistic about your other responsibilities.Part of asking for help may also involve speaking with your employer about needing time off from work. If at all possible, be honest with your boss about why you need to adjust your schedule, and realistic about the amount of time you make need to take off. This is a situation where the ability to work remotely would be helpful, but even then, it can be difficult to keep up with conference calls and emails alongside doctors\u2019 appointments. Make sure you discuss clear expectations of any arrangement with your boss to ensure that you are both on the same page and nothing falls through the cracks. In addition to work, distance caregivers also often have families of their own, placing them in the \u201csandwich generation,\u201d with obligations to both their parents and children. For someone with responsibility for multiple family members in different locations, logistics can be difficult, especially when emergencies require schedules to be readjusted quickly. Keep it in perspective.According to Ms. Whitehead, caregiving isn\u2019t all about feeling overwhelmed and living with increased anxiety. \u201cWhen it is approached as a choice, rather than a duty or obligation, caring for a loved one long distance can increase positive emotions and offset stress,\u201d she explains. \u201cCaregivers can feel grateful and enjoy the increased connection with their loved one. This attitude can often offset the negative or stressful side of caregiving.\u201d  Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Dublin Block Tells the Story of the City", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLined with outsize Georgian buildings, Henrietta Street has been, over the years, home to both tenement squalor and aristocratic grandeur. The \u201cwild Irish\u201d Kingsborough daughters were \u201cunformed and not very pleasing,\u201d Wollstonecraft said in a letter home, but there was some mitigation in the house itself. \u201cI have much more convenient apartments here,\u201d she wrote. \u201cA fine schoolroom \u2014 the use of one of the drawing rooms where the harpsichord is \u2014 and a parlor to receive my male visitors in.\u201dTen years later, one of the girls ran off with her own uncle, and a furious Lord Kingsborough murdered him. Although Wollstonecraft had died by then, the influence of her radical feminist teachings was widely blamed. The scandal inflamed Ireland. Lord Kingsborough was acquitted.This is just one of the tales with which these cobblestones are scorched. A stubby, single-block dead end on the supposed wrong side of town, Henrietta Street is enormously wide, and the 18th-century brick houses that flank it are flat-fronted and vast: four stories high, with as many as five windows across each. The earliest Georgian street in Dublin \u2014 and the most intact collection of early-to-mid-Georgian houses in Ireland \u2014 it was built beginning in the 1720s for the Irish aristocracy. After the Acts of Union were passed in 1800, uniting the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, the country lost its own parliament, and the great and the good, who now spent most of their time in London, no longer had a need for Dublin grandeur. Over time, Henrietta Street became more deprived and more inhabited: In the tenement era, which began in the late 19th century and lasted until the 1970s, up to 19 families lived in each house.In photographs from the 1960s, many of these buildings appear as carcasses, huge smashed things left for dead. More recently, they were still derelict. No. 3, bought in November 2016 by the 63-year-old developer Patrick Wigglesworth, is in the process of being restored through a partnership with the 59-year-old architectural conservationist named Ian Lumley, who lives at No. 12. Plywood boards cover the ground floor; the rest is pristine. Yet an old photo on Google Maps shows you a wreck in its place, with broken windows and countless missing bricks.\u201c\u2009\u2018Gentrification,\u2019\u2009\u201d Lumley says, is a word that \u201cwould really be resented\u201d by the residents, nor is it particularly apt. There are no boutique hotels here yet, nor shops that sell expensive sneakers. Fergus Martin, a 63-year-old artist who has a studio inside No. 6, notes, with some pride, \u201cI think this is the Wild West.\u201d Technically, it\u2019s the wild North. There is, as in London, a waterway dividing the city, and it is the northern territory above Dublin\u2019s River Liffey that has traditionally been seen as the rougher side of town. Although the buildings on Henrietta Street are beautiful, with fine details and elegant proportions, they are also daunting; even now, on a gray day, they border on bleak. Unlike their genteel, smaller-scale equivalents on Fitzwilliam Square or Merrion Square on the south side of town, they\u2019re barely even domestic. In scale, and in their unfashionable context, they feel almost industrial. If those other houses are like friendly, scruffy dogs, the Henrietta Street homes are closer to wounded giants.\u201cFROM CHILDHOOD, I was drawn to old houses,\u201d says Lumley, sitting at the top of his house, in a room painted Venetian red. He grew up in Waterford, Ireland\u2019s oldest city, about 100 miles away, where he often saw \u201cmedieval walls not being appreciated, knocked through for car parks.\u201d Even as a school kid, he began a letter-writing campaign to save buildings; as a student in Dublin, he occupied them.Down on the ground floor, he adds, the back room \u201chasn\u2019t been painted for 200 years.\u201d Its plaster surface survived because it had been covered in wallpaper for more than a century; when he removed that, he found a mottled pinkish-brown, once red, which was beautifully weathered. There are patches of residue from other eras here and there, a dirty white and a faded green, as if the room has grown moss. It\u2019s virtually empty, apart from an upright piano and a few wooden chairs, along with a copy of an old master painting that looms above the mantel. To Lumley, the room represents \u201cthe last grand occupation of the house and the passage of time,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause that red would have been consistent and uniform. It would have been much darker.\u201dAt his Henrietta Street house, up the stairs and past a faux Roman statue of a naked man \u2014 Emperor Hadrian\u2019s young lover Antinous, who died under mysterious circumstances \u2014 Lumley has hung his clothes up to dry along a line tied to the banister in homage to Severs and his museum. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone the full Dennis hog,\u201d he says, because his house isn\u2019t open to the public, \u201cbut in terms of reflecting different periods, there\u2019s certainly an influence here.\u201dMuch later, in the 1970s, when the tenements were almost deserted, something happened in this house that no one involved with the museum cares to record. The incident has become so entrenched in local folklore as to become unverifiable, but one account involves a sick horse being brought to live on one of the upper floors, then falling through the floorboards. The horse\u2019s owner, locals say, was stabbed in the neck.In the late \u201960s, Uinseann and Margaret MacEoin founded a company in order to rescue Georgian houses in Dublin: They named it Luke Gardiner Ltd., after an 18th-century property developer who oversaw the completion of Henrietta Street. Over the years, the couple bought nine houses \u2014 three on Henrietta Street and six in Mountjoy Square, less than a mile to the north \u2014 and rented them to artists for negligible sums, as well as to other individuals and small businesses, which saved the houses from demolition and ensured their survival. When Uinseann died in 2007, his son Nuada became the landlord.O\u2019Neill remembers one occasion when she was behind with the rent. Uinseann came into her studio and said, \u201cI rather like that painting,\u201d pointing at one of her canvasses. \u201cAnd so he bought the painting for I don\u2019t know how many months\u2019 rent. He gave me the check \u2014 \u2018thank you very much\u2019 \u2014 and then I gave him back the check, for the rent. Nuada\u2019s the same, just doing anything they can to support you.\u201dWe end up spending all day on Henrietta Street, by which time I have taken in so much history I am exhausted. I\u2019m also concerned about O\u2019Neill, who has somewhere else to be, but she assures me that she is gripped by this impromptu tour behind facades she has stared at for years. We are traveling up the opposite side of the street from her old studio, seeing beyond the longstanding view outside her window. Though the stories we hear about these buildings are obviously related, each is also a world unto itself, and a manifestation, floor by floor, of Dublin\u2019s own speckled history.The last of our guides is Sean Aylward, the former under-treasurer and C.E.O. of the King\u2019s Inns and a great connoisseur of the different eras these buildings represent. Henrietta Street was built for the aristocracy, he assures us. \u201cBut it\u2019s not all about ascendancy and power. It\u2019s about rights and responsibilities.\u201d For years, this street appeared to have been forgotten. But now, in its new life, there\u2019s a purposeful remembrance \u2014 not merely an embrace of history but an awareness of its repetitions and risks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "First I Met My Children, Then My Girlfriend. They\u2019re Related.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveA former sperm donor, searching online, finds both offspring and love. Let me explain. Nearly 25 years ago, I returned from a year of teaching English abroad, moved in with my mother and, lacking prospects, began driving a cab. One day I saw a newspaper ad seeking healthy men, 18 to 35, to participate in a semen donation program.\u201cDonors\u201d is the standard industry word, yet virtually all of us are paid. Forty dollars a pop was what I received in 1994.I applied to sell my sperm and sold twice weekly for a year. At the time I was in a long-distance relationship, so this seemed like a good outlet. When I told my mother, she presciently wondered aloud if this was the only way she was going to have grandchildren.Today, sperm buyers view detailed profiles for potential vendors, whereas I wasn\u2019t asked to provide much beyond college major, hobbies and family health history. Jessica and her partner at the time chose me primarily because I was a writer and musician.After a year of selling my sperm, I went back to giving it away and largely forgot about the whole thing. Occasionally the subject of whether I had children would come up, and I\u2019d make a joke about probably having a bunch. I had signed a nondisclosure waiver and assumed there would never be a way for my progeny and me to find one another.Then the internet happened.In the early 2000s, I searched online for a way to find my offspring and discovered the Donor Sibling Registry but didn\u2019t see any leads there and never got around to checking back. (I had looked way too early: My progeny began to use the site to find each other when they became teenagers in the 2010s.)A couple of years ago I began seeing ads for 23andMe, a service that analyzes your saliva \u2014 you spit in a test tube and mail it off for analysis \u2014 and provides you with information about ancestry, health and DNA relatives. The opportunity was obvious, but I assumed the odds of finding my children were low. I procrastinated for months before curiosity and an urge to know them made me order a kit.I got my results back, and boom: I had a son, Bryce. His full name was unusual enough that I easily Googled him, and the picture resembled me enough that I felt confident this senior geography major was mine (mine?). Guessing he had been notified of my existence by 23andMe, I mulled in agitation for a week before finally putting fingers to keyboard.\u201cDear Bryce,\u201d I wrote. \u201cI recently joined 23andMe and found you listed as my \u2018son,\u2019 so I believe myself to be your biological father. I hope my existence isn\u2019t a shock and wonder whether you joined in hopes of connecting with me.\u201d My letter continued awkwardly from there, giving him a brief sketch of my life.Bryce replied almost instantly: \u201cDad, I cannot express how excited I am to be hearing from you. I did join 23andMe hoping that you would have already done so and was upset to see you hadn\u2019t. This is amazing though and I\u2019m so happy. I\u2019m one of six of your children that I\u2019m aware of and in contact with. I\u2019m 20 years old and live on Long Island but I\u2019m studying in upstate New York.\u201d\u201cDad?\u201d I was briefly concerned that Bryce might have some fatherly expectations of me and show up on my doorstep, but my worries were unfounded. It\u2019s a brave new world, and we\u2019re all struggling with the terminology.More important, six children? Yikes! I did some napkin math based on the number of samples I provided and the odds of conception and estimated that I may have as many as 67 children.Bryce connected me with Madalyn, 19. Upon viewing her Facebook page, I had my first parental thought ever: My daughter should put some more clothes on.I may be biased, but I found my children to be ridiculously attractive. I felt a sudden need to share their photos with all the ex-girlfriends who chose not to marry and procreate with me.A few months later a new DNA relative appeared on 23andMe: Alice, age 11. Her mother, Jessica, wrote me a note. She and her former partner had each given birth to one daughter conceived with my sperm. They broke up years ago but had been raising both girls together until recently, when the other mother moved away with the daughter she had given birth to.Jess and I began to chat online. She knew a lot about buying sperm and self-impregnating, which was fascinating for me to learn, and, it turns out, more difficult than my role: masturbating into a cup. She also no longer identified as lesbian and was dating a man who, incredibly, had my same first and middle names (Aaron David), with a similar, monosyllabic last name.Had there been a mix-up at the Bureau of Boyfriends? Was I the one who was supposed to be dating her?My children and I exchanged written biographies. Bryce\u2019s showed me how little I know of young adult culture and reminded me that one\u2019s 20s are a difficult decade. Madi\u2019s revealed a keen understanding of her upbringing and the parts of it she would like to break from. But it was Alice\u2019s, entitled \u201cA series of awkward events separated by snacks,\u201d that floored me.Hers was a hodgepodge of lists and memories written under duress (\u201cMom: Write or death!\u201d). Favorite color: \u201cBlack. Like my soul.\u201d Favorite holiday: \u201cHalloween (because candy and murder).\u201d She liked Alfred Hitchcock films. \u201cBasically,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI\u2019m an angsty teen in a child\u2019s body.\u201dThis kid\u2019s 11?A plan developed for Bryce and Madi to come to Seattle for a couple of weeks in the summer. Jess and Alice lived a few hours south and would drive up. I figured meeting my children was going to be the closest thing I\u2019d ever have to a wedding, so I decided to host a party. I had told my news to a few people, but most learned of it from the \u201cMeet My Kids Party\u201d Facebook invitation, featuring photos of Bryce, Madi and Alice. The shock value was high.Be it genetics, good luck or force of circumstance, I loved my children right away. They have an uncanny aura of me-ness. Bryce is shy but sharp and obsessed with memes in a way I might have been had I grown up Gen Z. Alice has little use for adults, as I still don\u2019t. Madi, especially, has my sense of humor and eyes: Locking gazes with her makes my brain explode, but then we laugh.At the party, we played a nature-versus-nurture question-and-answer game and discovered we were all quite liberal and that none of us believed in God. None of them, however, sleeps with a pillow between their knees, as I have long done.The first time Jess and I found ourselves alone we hugged at length in a way entirely inappropriate for people who had just met. Jess says I have mannerisms that remind her of both of her daughters and thus felt instantly comfortable with me.Whether we were pawns of fate or unwitting participants in a chromosomally arranged marriage, Jess and I quickly bonded. I deployed my Bureau of Boyfriends mix-up line to a grudging but sweet reception. During the vacation, she and I fell easily into the mom-and-dad role for Bryce, Madi and Alice. We soon had in-jokes and teased each other about our foibles, just like any family. I even gave Bryce and Madi a lecture about smoking.At the end of the visit, Bryce somehow managed to get Jess and Alice kicked out of the house they were renting by climbing onto the roof to retrieve a toy, so I invited them to stay with me while they figured things out. What Jess soon figured out was that she wanted to keep staying with me. Alice rolled her eyes as if she had been tricked into a traditional family arrangement.While 23andMe is not generally considered a dating site, Jess and I are grateful to the technology that has made our backward-formed relationship possible. We have a lot of questions about love and genetics and whether we would have felt this connection had we met in a more conventional way. Our bond has survived the \u201cHow cool is this?\u201d phase, though we still enjoy cybermonitoring my other progeny and speculating about how many more may emerge. (I\u2019m up to 10 now; I have had some contact with the new ones\u2019 mothers but haven\u2019t made plans to meet yet.)Madi liked the West Coast and us and recently moved into our place. We\u2019re hoping to lure Bryce back, too.In the end, the sci-fi trappings of our love story are irrelevant: Jess and I work as a couple because we like spending time together. I suppose it doesn\u2019t hurt that I happen to be the father of her child.Aaron Long is a writer in Seattle.Advertisement"}

Each also identified a female employee in a STEM field to be featured in the campaign, alongside women who work at Boeing and the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.The centerpiece of the campaign are videos in which the seven women discuss with girls (actresses with an interest in STEM subjects) what they do professionally and what the opportunities are. The professionals are also featured on the campaign\u2019s website, SheCanStem.com, and in individual profiles on Instagram and in more traditional media.The women featured in the campaign, or their employers, will post photos of them taken when they were girls, with a note that says, \u201cIf she can STEM, so can you.\u201d The Ad Council will also encourage women in all STEM fields to do the same.Girls will also be directed to @SheCanSTEM on Instagram, where they can find information on other women working in STEM fields and on resources from the campaign\u2019s corporate and nonprofit partners. The campaign\u2019s website also will contain information for parents and teachers.Others involved with the campaign include Karina Garcia, the YouTube star known as the Slime Queen; the Disney actress Olivia Rodrigo; Alyssa Carson, a space enthusiast and astronaut hopeful; and Mari Takahashi of the YouTube channel Smosh Games. Nonprofit partners include the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., Black Girls Code, ChickTech, Girls Who Code and the Society of Women Engineers.According to research by the Department of Commerce, women make up half of the college-educated work force in the United States but only 25 percent of the STEM work force. Studies by the Girl Scout Research Institute and National Center for Education Statistics show that many girls begin losing interest in STEM subjects when they are in middle school, a path that continues in high school and college.Linda Boff, chairwoman of the Ad Council and chief marketing officer of General Electric, said it was \u201cimportant to get the attention of young girls and inspire them through real STEM role models they can relate to.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about inspiration \u2014 it\u2019s about insight,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you show young girls women who have achieved in STEM, hopefully you\u2019re showing them the pathway.\u201dG.E. has been involved in numerous initiatives to encourage girls\u2019 interest in STEM, including a summer program for girls in the United States and other countries; educational programs in Boston, where its headquarters moved in 2016; and its \u201cUnseen Stars\u201d project, which projected the faces of 12 female scientists and engineers on the constellations painted on Grand Central Terminal\u2019s ceiling last September.The Ad Council\u2019s message to girls \u201ccould have a big effect,\u201d said Amy Fitzgerald, the outreach coordinator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Edgerton Center. The center, which is supported by G.E., provides educational resources for M.I.T. students, faculty and staff, as well as for students and teachers in kindergarten through grade 12.It is vital that the campaign features \u201cmechanical engineers, aviation engineers, women who get their hands dirty, not just in research-lab-coaty positions,\u201d Ms. Fitzgerald said. \u201cI want to see hard hats. Girls, especially, do not have an idea of the range of possibilities.\u201dThe Ad Council is not the only organization trying to raise the consciousness of young girls about STEM. In June, Mattel introduced a robotics engineer Barbie and joined forces with Tynker, a game-based platform that teaches kids how to code, to offer Barbie-inspired coding lessons.In addition, in the past few years, the Girl Scouts organization, which has offered STEM-related programming for over a century, has introduced new programs in space science and exploration, cybersecurity, mechanical engineering, robotics and computer science.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wind and Rain Begin Battering North Carolina", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLive BriefingNorth Carolina\u2019s coastal communities began feeling the wrath of Hurricane Florence on Thursday, a storm that could be the worst to hit the region in a generation. The assault of wind and rain is expected to last through the weekend and well into next week.Here are the latest developments:\u2022 The cloud coverage from the storm, an indication of its size, is as large as the Carolinas.Animated maps and satellite images show the effects of the storm.Brock Long, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Thursday that the federal government had staged resources and personnel in states along the Eastern Seaboard to help quickly after the storm.FEMA personnel were focused at the moment on helping state and local authorities prepare, he said. But as the storm pushes through, the agency will shift its focus to identifying infrastructure damage and work to restore services.\u201cThe infrastructure is going to break. The power is going to go out,\u201d Mr. Long said at a news conference. \u201cWe need people to get their mind-sets right that disasters are very frustrating and that it takes time to get the infrastructure back and running. We will move as quickly as we can to get back up.\u201dThough Florence has weakened to a Category 2 storm, Mr. Long said that storm surge and heavy rain still posed a significant danger. Residents still in their homes are running out of time to evacuate, he said.\u201cThe ocean will start rising along the coast and back bay areas,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cYour time to get out of the areas, out of the storm surge areas, is coming to a close.\u201dA repurposed Coast Guard tower 34 miles off the coast southeast of Wilmington, N.C., is providing a unique, on-the-sea look at Florence. (Click on image to play.)Our reporter Jack Healy is on the Outer Banks, where winds from Hurricane Florence gained force on Thursday, gusting to 51 miles an hour and giving these emptied-out islands a preview of the storm\u2019s power.The gusts were a precursor to what would be coming; Hurricane Florence is expected to pummel the coast with winds above 100 m.p.h.Hurricane Florence\u2019s unusually slow approach is proving a particular challenge for many of the small towns on North Carolina\u2019s coastal plain.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like, \u2018When it is going to start raining?\u2019\u201d said Paula Cognitore, a hydrologist at the National Weather Center, who has been tracking the forecast for region\u2019s rivers, many of which are at risk of major flooding in the next few days.When the deluge begins, it is expected to last longer than previous hurricanes. Forecasters say the storm will stall after moving inland, prolonging the rain.Even then, there will be more waiting to endure. Tarboro, N.C., which is surrounded on three sides by the Tar River, may not feel the full brunt of the storm until the middle of next week, the town manager, Troy Lewis, said.That is when the cumulative effect of what could be 20 inches of rain may raise the water-level in Tarboro beyond the river\u2019s banks, as it did during Hurricanes Floyd and Matthew.\u201cIt\u2019s like being stalked by a turtle,\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \u201cWe see it coming but there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201dTrying to learn from recent history, police officials in Kinston, N.C., which sits on the Neuse River, posted warning signs and knocked on the doors of houses that had flooded in earlier storms. Residents were asked to evacuate to a shelter.That status is better than the purple dot in Lumberton, a hundred miles southwest, which signifies that the flooding will be major, and, according to Ms. Cognitore, possibly record-breaking. But the forecast, Mr. Short said \u201ccould easily change.\u201dMs. Cognitore concurred. \u201cAs we go on in time, you\u2019re going to see more of the colors on this map start to turn red and purple,\u201d she said.Federal, state and local officials have already spent days trying to warn people in Florence\u2019s path of the potential severity of the storm.\u201cWe cannot underestimate this storm,\u201d Governor Cooper of North Carolina said. \u201cWind speeds may have dropped some from yesterday, but we traded that for a larger wind field that expands 200 miles with tropical-storm-force winds.\u201dHe pleaded with people to move to a safe place and listen to their local authorities if they are asked to move again to safer ground.North Carolina had opened 126 shelters for about 12,000 people, and is trying to open more.South Carolina officials said Thursday that about 4,358 people had moved into shelters, with space for 31,000 space still available..The mini golf courses and neon beachwear shops were closed in Myrtle Beach and the empty streets had a beach-town-in-winter feeling. But down on the sand itself, facing a low, gray sky, people surfed, swam, sat shirtless in low-slung beach chairs and tossed around balls like it was a hot Tuesday afternoon in July.\u201cWe\u2019re staying,\u201d said Rosetta Gaskins, a school cafeteria cook who had called her 18-year-old son down from his college upstate to spend the weekend with her at a sort of multiday house party at Paco and Kathi Longoria\u2019s place, a half mile in from the beach.There were 13 of them altogether, and there would be hot dogs and pancakes, games, a 1-year-old\u2019s birthday party and days of watching the angry weather from the porch. Everyone was pretty sanguine about things.Everyone except for Jennifer Bellamy.\u201cI was in panic mode and thinking I was with a bunch of crazy people and they were thinking I was the crazy one,\u201d she said.Though quite a few had left, most people around town who stayed were not that nervous, the group said. (\u201cThey weren\u2019t even nervous when it was a Category 4,\u201d said Ms. Bellamy, eyeing the horizon skeptically.)[Read more here about the hurricane holdouts who choose to ride out the storm at home]After packing up her home in Columbia, S.C., Lavette Pixley arrived at the evacuation center at Ridge View High School on Thursday with her 8-year-old son, Tayon, and enough clothes and supplies for a few days.During Hurricane Joaquin in 2015, Ms. Pixley and her son decided not to evacuate. Their ground-floor apartment flooded, and they had to be rescued by firefighters.\u201cWe thought it was a normal night and we woke up in water,\u201d she said.For this storm, she was not taking any chances. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have bad memories from last time.\u201dBy midafternoon, about 70 people had checked into the shelter. Most were from Richland County, which includes Columbia, but some had traveled from as far as Charleston, roughly 115 miles away.Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina said about 421,000 residents had evacuated their homes. The state had opened over 60 shelters by Thursday, with more than 4,000 people staying in them, according to figures from the Department of Social Services. More than 30,000 spaces were still available.Officials have also been enacting curfews to keep residents safe and roads clear for emergency response. Overnight curfews are in place in spots like Myrtle Beach, Mullins and Surfside Beach in South Carolina, and Scotland, Robeson and Carteret Counties in North Carolina.As the East Coast of the United States awaits Hurricane Florence, the Philippines is staring at a super typhoon packing winds of up to 150 miles an hour. Super Typhoon Mangkhut is on track to hit the northern Philippines with its strongest winds on Friday before striking Taiwan and then possibly veering south toward Hong Kong and mainland China.But, as always, many people offered cautions not to believe everything that you see on social media.Reporting was contributed by Jack Healy from Nags Head, N.C.; David Zucchino from Wilmington, N.C.; Richard Fausset from Washington, N.C.; Campbell Robertson from Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Tyler Pager from Columbia, S.C.; Sheri Fink from Boydton, Va.; Amy Harmon, Matthew Haag, John Schwartz and Mihir Zaveri from New York; and Daniel Victor from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rx for British Doctors: Use Plain English Instead of Latin", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Doctors have long been chided for their seemingly unintelligible handwriting. Now, they are being urged to drop the Latin.The project says with more than five million outpatient visits a month in England, outpatient clinic letters are \u201cthe most written letters\u201d in Britain\u2019s National Health Service.Currently, the letters are sent to the patient\u2019s general practitioner instead of the patient, meaning that doctors have to write about their patients instead of writing to them, which can cause barriers in communication.Dr. Hugh Rayner, a kidney specialist who is leading the initiative, said that while the change might seem small, it had already had an effect in the pilot phase of the project.\u201cWriting to patients rather than about them changes the relationship between doctor and patient,\u201d Dr. Rayner said in an email. \u201cIt involves them more in their care and leads to all sorts of benefits.\u201dIn its push for profits, the U.S. health care system has made it difficult for patients to get personal attention from doctors. But what if hands-on medicine actually saves money \u2014 and lives?He added that \u201cthis change could have a big impact.\u201dComplicated medical terminology is often misinterpreted by patients and can cause confusion and anxiety, the academy says. The guidelines offered state, for example:\u2022 Avoid using words that can cause confusion, such as \u201cchronic.\u201d While the term in medical circles means a longstanding condition, it is often taken by patients to mean \u201creally bad.\u201d\u2022 When describing diagnoses, for example, instead of \u201crenal,\u201d use \u201ckidney.\u201d\u2022 Instead of \u201cacute,\u201d use \u201csudden\u201d or \u201cshort-term.\u201d\u2022 Instead of \u201catrial fibrillation,\u201d use \u201cirregular pulse.\u201dThe guidance also applies when prescribing medicine: Doctors have been asked to use English such as \u201ctwice daily\u201d instead of the Latin abbreviation \u201cB.D.\u201d (bis in die).Beyond that, when including test results, the academy says, their significance should be explained and upsetting or unexpected results should be communicated by phone instead of by letter.And when doctors have to deliver sensitive information, they could \u201csoften the impact\u201d by using a more distant or noncommittal style such as \u201cduring the examination, the tremor and stiffness in your right arm suggest that you have Parkinson\u2019s disease.\u201dLauren Cohen, a dental hygienist in east London, recalled receiving results for a medical condition by letter, but when she tried to call her doctor for an explanation, his assistant said he was unavailable for two days.\u201cI Googled the blood test results and they were off the charts,\u201d she said by phone on Wednesday. \u201cI was in total panic and had to ask a doctor friend to help me interpret them, but even then I wasn\u2019t convinced as he wasn\u2019t a specialist.\u201dPatients who participated in the pilot project said they found the new style of letters more \u201cinformative, supportive and useful.\u201d\u201cI appreciate the letter addressed to me \u2014 the patient,\u201d one participant wrote. \u201cI can now understand the treatment I am having for my illness and I\u2019m happy to know that I am making some progress along the way.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jeff Bezos Cites a Big Number, but Few Details, in Plan for Low-Income Montessori Preschools", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Jeff Bezos announced last week that he and his wife, MacKenzie Bezos, would create and operate a national network of Montessori preschools, few were more surprised than Montessori organizations and leaders themselves.News of the initiative, called the Bezos Day One Fund, came with an eye-popping commitment: $2 billion, some of which will support organizations that help homeless families.Rebecca Pelton, president of the Montessori Accreditation Council for Teacher Education, said a key challenge would be recruiting and training enough quality teachers to staff the network\u2019s schools. She warned against online-only teacher-training programs, which have proliferated, but may not offer hands-on student teaching experience in Montessori classrooms.Still, Dr. Pelton said, \u201cI have faith that he\u2019s going to do the research and ask the right questions.\u201dMontessori\u2019s unique combination of freedom and rigidity \u2014 a famously \u201cchild-centered\u201d practice with a host of rules and restrictions \u2014 can make its classrooms look drastically different from traditional ones.Students span a three-year age range, say, between 3 and 5. Dressing up or talking about fairies or superheroes is not allowed. Instead of a play kitchen, there may be a real one, where students might pour their own juice into a glass cup, not a plastic one, so that they will learn the lesson that a glass can break if they are careless.And every day, students get three-hour blocks of unscheduled, uninterrupted \u201cwork\u201d time \u2014 the word \u201cplay\u201d is not used \u2014 in which they are free to choose their activities, whether finger-painting or sorting wooden pegs.It is unclear how many schools Mr. Bezos\u2019 network will consist of, where they will be located and whether they will cooperate or compete with existing Montessori programs that aim to serve children from low-income families. Those schools are typically funded through a mix of taxpayer dollars, philanthropic support and tuition from parents who can afford to pay.Of the 5,000 Montessori schools in the United States, only about 10 percent are public. Tuition at private Montessori preschools in urban centers can reach $30,000 per year. For schools, the start-up costs are significant, with a full set of Montessori materials costing between $25,000 and $50,000 per classroom.Mr. Bezos said his schools would be \u201cfull scholarship,\u201d implying, some observers thought, that the network would be fully private, with seats reserved for poor children, as opposed to a more common public-private partnership, with an integrated mix of students from different backgrounds.A model that forgoes government dollars and parent tuition would most likely serve fewer children than the hybrid approach. But it would also free Mr. Bezos from some of the bureaucratic burdens that public schools must contend with.An Amazon spokesman, Drew Herdener, declined to answer questions about plans for the preschools.Some Montessori advocates said that despite their mystification over the details, they were thrilled with news of the fund and its potential to inspire policymakers and other donors.\u201cThe first reaction is, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a ton of money,\u2019\u201d said Keith Whitescarver, executive director of the National Center for Montessori in the Public Sector. \u201cIt leads to changing the ecosystem.\u201dWith little else to parse, Montessori leaders pored over Mr. Bezos\u2019 brief statement, which described the planned schools as \u201cMontessori-inspired.\u201d The term \u201cMontessori\u201d is not copyrighted, and any school can choose to describe itself as such.But the movement has always faced challenges in appealing to parents who desire a more traditional education for their children. In a classic Montessori school, teachers generally do not lecture in front of the classroom and instead impart lessons on phonics or counting by engaging students individually or in small groups. They may invite children to participate in an activity, but do not require them to do so.That is counterintuitive for many traditionally trained educators. \u201cInstead of having one lesson plan, you have 24 different lesson plans, one for each child in the classroom,\u201d said Katie Kitchens, a Montessori specialist at a public school in Austin, Tex., and the vice president of Montessori for Social Justice, which seeks to expand the movement\u2019s reach. \u201cIt\u2019s a really humbling process. You\u2019re no longer the center of that conversation anymore, the keeper of all the information. It\u2019s this constant process of stepping back.\u201dThe first Americans to embrace Montessori were in fact affluent, white suburbanites. But by the 1960s, black and Latino parents were opening Montessori schools in many cities, attracted by the idea that a child-centered education could combat racism. Those programs often had trouble winning the philanthropic support they needed to survive, according to Mira Debs, executive director of the education studies program at Yale.Faybra Hemphill, director of racial equity, curriculum and training at City Garden Montessori School in St. Louis, said she was curious to see what the Bezoses have planned. On a small scale, City Garden is already doing the work Mr. Bezos said he aspired to; about 40 percent of the school\u2019s students come from low-income families and half are nonwhite.Ms. Hemphill said she had some advice.The Bezoses should come to the work, she said, with \u201cradical listening and radical humility. Go to the communities, talk to parents, talk to children, talk to teachers and administrators and ask them: \u2018What do you need? What are your hopes and dreams for education and for your children?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

You might ask why multiple issues should strike at the same time. The answer, in two words, is Hyman Minsky: after a long period of stable growth, lenders and investors get complacent, and the private sector overreaches. If that is what happens, we should expect another sluggish, jobless recovery like that after the 1990-1 and 2001 recessions, except probably worse.DealsPolitics and policyTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

He was a sweet kisser. For an hour we sat with his hand cupped behind my ear, kissing and talking.We had met on Tinder. I was nearly 30 and he was 24, but our age gap somehow seemed a lot larger than five years. Not because he acted especially young. It was more that when it came to sex and foreplay, he acted so differently from guys my age, asking for my consent about nearly everything.\u201cIs it O.K. if we go to the bedroom?\u201d he said.I smiled and led him there.He tugged at the hem of my sweater and said, \u201cIs it O.K. if I take this off?\u201dI nodded. Underneath I was wearing a thin tank top.\u201cCan I take this off, too?\u201d he said.I laughed. \u201cOf course!\u201dOff it went.He kissed my collarbone. I breathed into his neck and pulled off his shirt. He fingered the clasp of my bra.\u201cIs it O.K. if I take this off?\u201d he said.I think I snorted. \u201cWhen you asked about the sweater, that was my yes from the waist up.\u201dHe looked scared. Somewhere in our five-year age gap, a dramatic shift must have taken place in sexual training. I sensed this would be a different kind of hookup than I was used to, but I couldn\u2019t predict how.I lay down on my bed, and he lay beside me.\u201cIs this O.K.?\u201d he said.\u201cI invited a guy from Tinder to my empty apartment on a snow day,\u201d I said. \u201cLet\u2019s just assume you have blanket consent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with that.\u201dI looked at his earnest eyes, hair flopping into his face, stubble that was already reddening my skin (I had already decided I didn\u2019t mind). Hadn\u2019t I already said yes several times? Wasn\u2019t I lying there with him, my leg tossed over his, my whole body arcing toward him?Then he raised my arm above my head, put his lips to the soft skin of my inner arm, and licked me from armpit to elbow.I pulled my arm away.\u201cIs that O.K.?\u201d he said. \u201cAre you O.K.?\u201dI had been single and sexually active for more than a decade and considered myself to be sexually liberated, but I could not remember anyone having done that to me. \u201cIt\u2019s just really intimate,\u201d I said.Now he was the one who laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s intimate?\u201d he said.\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is.\u201dHe and I seemed to have such different understandings of which acts were assumed to be acceptable and which required voiced consent.At one point, he put his hand on my throat and asked if the pressure was O.K.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if I die,\u201d I joked.At the end of the night, he said, \u201cSee you soon,\u201d and took an Uber back to his apartment through the snow.Afterward I sat in bed, thinking about the encounter. I knew I had been a little dismissive of all of his asking, but in fact I had liked it as a form of caretaking. I just wasn\u2019t used to being taken care of in that way.Sex makes me feel unsafe, not because of the act itself but because my partners so often disappear afterward, whether I waited hours or months before the first time. So it\u2019s after sex when I feel truly vulnerable. Yet something else about his asking also made me uneasy. It seemed legalistic and self-protective, imported more from the courtroom than from a true sense of caretaking. And each time he asked, it was as if he assumed I lacked the agency to say no on my own \u2014 as if he expected me to say no, not believing that a woman would have the desire to keep saying yes.Still, I liked that he was trying to keep from hurting me unawares. He texted that night, reassuringly. I decided I would call his asking lovely. I decided I would try to learn.The second time he was in my bedroom, he paused with his hand at the zipper of my dress. \u201cIs this O.K.?\u201d he said.I looked him in the eye. I didn\u2019t laugh. I said, \u201cYes.\u201dHe was taken aback. \u201cI ask you that,\u201d he said.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the one who could make you do something you don\u2019t want to do,\u201d he said. \u201cNot vice versa.\u201dBut that wasn\u2019t what he was trying to do. He and I were enjoying a mutually desired sexual experience, and by making that distinction he was importing the language of coercion and assault into sex that was healthy.Given our wholly consensual interaction, did it matter who was stronger? Couldn\u2019t we treat each other as two equal human beings, each of whom had invited and agreed to intimate acts? Wasn\u2019t that the beautiful thing he was teaching me, that we could be fully human to each other, checking in, honoring yes and respecting no?My hand hovered above his belt. Finally he smiled and said yes, and the evening continued.If I could go back in time, I would have urged him in that moment to really think about why asking for consent even matters. Because the answer, I think, is basic: We want people we\u2019re intimate with to feel good, not bad.While he was waiting for his Uber to arrive, he said he would cook me dinner next time: steak with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and a fig-balsamic reduction.\u201cI mostly make scrambled eggs,\u201d I said.He laughed, kissed me and said, \u201cSee you soon.\u201dI did not see him soon. I texted him a few times in the days that followed, playfully at first, then more pressing. He ignored me.At first I couldn\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t answer, and then I was devastated. My roommates didn\u2019t understand why I was so much more hurt than usual.\u201cBecause he kissed the soft part of my arm,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd then he disappeared.\u201dThey looked at me blankly. \u201cBecause he asked for my consent, over and over. So sex felt like a sacred act, and then he disappeared.\u201d\u201cA sacred act?\u201d one roommate said, laughing. \u201cGirl, you sure don\u2019t treat it like one.\u201dBut I do. We perform sacred acts for, with and among strangers all the time. We give charitably to people we don\u2019t know. We pray in churches with people we don\u2019t know. \u201cWhich is fine,\u201d my roommate said.And she was right, in a way. Asking about my feelings during sex didn\u2019t extend to caring about them after sex. Consent is not a contract of continuation.But in the days and weeks after, I was left thinking that our culture\u2019s current approach to consent is too narrow. A culture of consent should be a culture of care for the other person, of seeing and honoring another\u2019s humanity and finding ways to engage in sex while keeping our humanity intact. It should be a culture of making each other feel good, not bad.And if that\u2019s the goal, then consent doesn\u2019t work if we relegate it exclusively to the sexual realm. Our bodies are only one part of the complex constellation of who we are. To base our culture of consent on the body alone is to expect that caretaking involves only the physical.I wish we could view consent as something that\u2019s less about caution and more about care for the other person, the entire person, both during an encounter and after, when we\u2019re often at our most vulnerable. Because I don\u2019t think many of us would say yes to the question \u201cIs it O.K. if I act like I care about you and then disappear?\u201dAdvertisement"}

Google Takeout, a tool for downloading your own Google data, debuted in 2011 and now enables you to export some sort of material from at least 50 different services, including Gmail, Search, chats and payments. The overwhelming volume of this information demonstrates just how deep, and inescapable, our relationships with the company have become. And it can be sneakily transformative. To see months of your own search history repeated back to you in list form is to suffer a strange mixture of your most mundane and anxious \u2014 and largely forgotten \u2014 moments.Takeout offers some straightforward utility: The ability to download your photos, for example, lets you upload them elsewhere. And it is genuinely good that Google doesn\u2019t hold your contacts hostage. Google also makes it possible for users to browse their recorded location history. This interface is very Google-ish in that it makes a huge amount of information feel approachable; it is less like Google in the way it makes the material feel useless and hardly worth investigating. In Takeout, however, location data can be exported in raw form. In my case, this produced a file containing hundreds of thousands of entries, each encoding time (down to the millisecond), latitude and longitude (with an estimate of their accuracy) and a guess at my activity (\u201cON_BICYCLE,\u201d for instance).Laid out in a vast spreadsheet and isolated from Google\u2019s own interfaces, this data becomes both conceptually clear, as quintessential surveillance, and literally incomprehensible. In 2014, a high school student named Theo Patt released a tool, Location History Visualizer, to give shape to this information, placing users\u2019 entire Google location histories on an intensely color-coded map, like something that might hang on the wall at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It became a minor sensation, and tens of thousands of visits to his site followed. It was a rare chance for Google users to see their own slice of the company\u2019s same old data, presented just outside the context in which it was gathered, rendering it utterly new.I first looked at my map zoomed all the way out and thought, That\u2019s it? A glowing red blast radius surrounded New York City, where I live; fainter orbs floated over towns where I visited family. That time in Nashville, for a conference. A failed reporting trip to Northern California. A few vacations, some layovers at airports, some weekend trips near the city. The full force of Google\u2019s apparatus had been summoned here, it seemed, to tell me to travel more. (According to Google, the company does not share users\u2019 location histories with advertisers, nor does it serve ads to users based on specific places in their location histories.)Then I zoomed in. Trips to see family were rendered in cold detail. They showed a town where I spent most of the first 18 years of my life reduced to the skeletal routine of a repeat outside visitor. The purple haze over the airport resolved, on a closer look, into dots at Gates C18 and C25, where I\u2019ve arrived or departed, and from or to which I walked to use a bathroom near Gate C9, just before Christmas in 2017. Another faint trail led to my mother\u2019s home, which glowed red; a few jogs around the neighborhood ringed the house in blue. I could pick out the restaurants in town that we went to together and the bar downtown where I met an old friend. I followed a mysterious series of faint dots down the highway, remembering halfway that they would lead to the regional fast-food place I loved as a kid. I zoomed in on a dot just north of the house and found myself at church, for the yearly family Christmas service. I scrolled in further and saw my annual stations: the parking lot, the chapel, the pews just left of the lectern and finally the columbarium to visit my dad\u2019s remains.I came to resent this data in a number of ways: that a cache of coordinates from Google could trigger grief or joy \u2014 that was such a nice morning, up in the park, with all those dogs \u2014 or that it, rather than a friend or a co-worker or a missed stop on the train, would be what triggers a familiar guilty reminder that the city I live in is so much bigger than the routine I\u2019ve created within it.There were also moments, deep in this incidental personal data diary, when I almost wished for more \u2014 when I thought about how nice it would be to be able to zoom in even further, to get back into a room and look around. These moments were brief. An intensely personal diary is the sort of thing you could only be happy to discover in your own attic, in your own handwriting, not on the servers of a multibillion-dollar advertising corporation.People use it to keep track of travel to bill their companies; some users want to reconstruct trips or create visual maps as travel keepsakes. But regarding their own location data, and the data of others, users\u2019 imaginations seem to have darkened over time. There are still plenty of worried partners \u2014 sales double around Valentine\u2019s Day, Patt says \u2014 but suspicious bosses, too, who have wanted to track employees\u2019 whereabouts during the day. Inevitably, law enforcement took an interest. Patt is somewhat less candid about this, citing agreements with clients. \u201cThere ended up being some pretty big international customers \u2014 government arms and police agencies.\u201d Patt is 18 now and working on a new start-up. He starts at Stanford this month. But he\u2019s still accepting new clients.After using Visualizer, I\u2019d seen enough. This level of biographical data is alarming enough when collected and used by a company I trust, at least in practice; moved just slightly out of context, it becomes an open-ended accumulation of exposures in a world where assurances of data privacy are being made more frequently and insistently \u2014 and to users\u2019 ears, less credibly \u2014 by the day. I turned my location history off, or at least as \u201coff\u201d as Google would allow. I took this step knowing full well that plenty of other location-aware apps on my phone \u2014 social apps, local guide apps, even lowly weather apps \u2014 could be compiling nearly identical data. (Never mind wireless providers or credit-card companies.) But not to take the step would have felt like giving up.Patt leaves his on. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the story of my entire teenage years,\u201d he said. Where I saw a surveillance file, he saw a biography. Google was the author of both, but for now at least it was interested in neither.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Takeover of Shazam Is Cleared by European Regulators", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 European authorities on Thursday cleared Apple\u2019s acquisition of the popular song-recognition app Shazam, after months of study into whether the deal would give the iPhone maker an unfair advantage over rival streaming music services like Spotify.Apple said in December that it had agreed to buy Shazam, prompting European regulators to scrutinize the proposed takeover as part of a broader effort to examine the value of data when evaluating mergers.In the case of Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam, regulators questioned whether the app held important information on Apple competitors. The focus on data transfer is a departure from typical antitrust enforcement, which tends to zero in on how a deal may affect customers in terms of a product\u2019s cost.The Apple deal, Ms. Vestager said, would not impede competition.The case was a rare instance in which European antitrust authorities have passed on an opportunity to act against an American technology giant. The region has gained a reputation as the world\u2019s strictest overseer of the technology industry.When starting their investigation of the Apple-Shazam deal in February, regulators said they were concerned that Apple would block Shazam from referring customers to rival services, or that it would use the app to poach customers.On Thursday, the European Commission said that after a six-month review, it had concluded that the app did not give Apple an unfair advantage that merited government intervention.\u201cAccess to Shazam\u2019s data would not materially increase Apple\u2019s ability to target music enthusiasts and any conduct aimed at making customers switch would only have a negligible impact,\u201d the commission said in a statement.Spotify, a major rival to Apple\u2019s own music-streaming service, declined to comment.Shazam was an early hit in Apple\u2019s App Store thanks to its novel ability to quickly identify a track after using a smartphone\u2019s microphone to \u201clisten\u201d for only a few seconds. The two companies established closer ties in 2014, when Shazam was integrated into Apple\u2019s voice-powered digital assistant Siri, allowing users to ask, \u201cHey Siri, what song is playing?\u201dThe app mainly makes money by selling advertisements and collecting fees when it refers users to a music service like Apple and Spotify. Shazam is also a valuable source of data, giving music companies insight into what songs and artists are performing well, and in which regions.Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam has been seen as a possible test case for Ms. Vestager, who has said antitrust enforcement must evolve to consider the value of data.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers effectively pay with their data, and that they are not always getting a fair deal.Broadening the interpretation of antitrust law would have consequences for future acquisitions. But whether such an argument would hold up in a courtroom has not yet been well established, making it harder for authorities to step in.Working in Apple\u2019s favor was the fact the European Commission had previously approved acquisitions between several data-rich companies, including Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of LinkedIn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In the Balkans, Russia and the West Fight a Disinformation-Age Battle", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySKOPJE, Macedonia \u2014 As Macedonians prepare for the most important vote in their nation\u2019s history, scores of Facebook posts are urging voters to burn their ballots. Hundreds of new websites are calling for a boycott. And one news article, widely shared online, warns that Google may eliminate Macedonian from its list of recognized languages, depending on the vote.In a disinformation age, Macedonian and Western officials say the flurry of social media activity is just that \u2014 disinformation directed by Russian-backed groups trying to stoke fears and depress turnout in a vote that could put this Balkan nation on a path to join NATO.All have a simple message: It\u2019s now or never.On his way here on Monday, Mr. Mattis told reporters that Russia was financing \u201cinfluence campaigns\u201d to undermine the referendum. Appearing later with Mr. Zaev, Mr. Mattis did not mention Russia specifically, but spoke of the need to fight \u201cmalicious cyber activity that threatens our democracies.\u201dRussian officials have broadly denied that they are trying to affect the outcome of European elections. But Russian diplomats have made no secret of their opposition to further NATO expansion, arguing that it would destabilize the Balkans.\u201cOne of Russia\u2019s top foreign policy and security goals is to oppose NATO at every step,\u201d said James H. Mackey, who leads the Euro-Atlantic and global partnership office at NATO. \u201cAs long as they think they can make trouble, they will try to make trouble.\u201dCongress allocated money in January 2017 to fight Russian disinformation campaigns, including $8 million specifically for Macedonia. But the money did not arrive for more than a year, and it has yet to be effectively deployed, according to a Western official who agreed to speak about the subject only on the condition of anonymity. An additional $2 million, meant to promote the rule of law in Macedonia, which is still struggling with endemic corruption, had not arrived as of August, the official said.American officials also note that millions in security assistance flow to the country.NATO officials, for their part, say they provided information to help Macedonia counter the Russian campaign. \u201cWe see Russia is trying to meddle, to spread disinformation,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said in an interview. \u201cBut Russia is not winning.\u201dHe added that opinion polls continued to show majority support for the country\u2019s name change, despite the Russian campaign. The challenge, he said, was that Moscow \u201coperates on many different levels with many different tools.\u201dWhen he arrives in Skopje on Monday, Mr. Mattis will urge Macedonians to vote in the referendum. He will also emphasize the $5 million in annual security support the United States provides, Eric Pahon, a Pentagon spokesman, said.\u201cRussia seeks to convince the Macedonians that the West is going to abandon them, that Russia is the stable influence in the region,\u201d Mr. Pahon said. \u201cThat is just not true.\u201dChanging Macedonia\u2019s name and bringing the country into the alliance, Mr. Pahon said, would reduce Moscow\u2019s influence. \u201cMacedonian accession to NATO is one of Russia\u2019s worst nightmares,\u201d he added.In Macedonia, officials blame Russian-backed online groups for proliferating false articles and Facebook posts as a way to heighten social divisions, drive down participation and amplify public anger. This spring, football hooligans opposed to the name change clashed with police officers outside Parliament in Skopje \u2014 an episode quickly seized on by people who produced false stories claiming government brutality.\u201cThere is a famous Balkan singer, and they took an old picture of her beaten and bruised in a domestic violence incident, and tried to claim she was beaten by police at the protest,\u201d said Marko Troshanovski, who works for Societas Civilis, a research institute focused on promoting democracy. \u201cThe misinformation was later countered, but it was in the blood stream.\u201dAfter the clash, Mr. Zaev, the prime minister, blamed Moscow and expelled a Russian diplomat. In response, Oleg Shcherbak, the Russian ambassador to Macedonia, offered a stark warning.\u201cIf it came to a conflict between Russia and NATO,\u201d he warned ominously, \u201cyou will have the role of a legitimate target.\u201dAccording to Western officials, Moscow\u2019s primary goal is to depress turnout. If less than half of registered voters participate in the referendum, the issue is forced back to Parliament, undermining the popular mandate for a solution.To an outsider, the dispute can seem puzzling, but it has proved diplomatically explosive and intractable. Like so much in the Balkans, it is a conflict complicated by history and war.Western diplomats say that 40 new websites are popping up each day on Facebook to encourage people to boycott the referendum. These websites, originating outside the country, fit a pattern of Russian interference in other elections, diplomats say.In a country largely divided along ethnic lines, some websites deliberately stoke tensions with the country\u2019s ethnic Albanian minority, evoking memories of a yearlong armed conflict in 2001 between the government and a faction of Albanians.\u201cAre you going to let Albanians change your name?\u201d is a common theme.American intelligence officials say Russia has also co-opted local football fan clubs and motorcycle gangs opposed to the name change.\u201cThe Russians are pumping money into the opposition to the name agreement and supporting nationalistic politicians opposed to the deal,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, a former Obama administration official now at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement.Assuming Macedonian voters agree to the name change, and Macedonia\u2019s Constitution is amended to reflect it, the deal would then be subject to approval by the Greek Parliament. Greek officials have also accused Moscow of interference and have responded by expelling two diplomats.\u201cThey are spending money in Greece, trying to add to the resistance to the Macedonia name issue,\u201d said Ben Hodges, a former United States Army commander in Europe, who is now at the Center for European Policy Analysis. \u201cWherever there is a seam or a crack, that is what they will exploit.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Mattis\u2019s visit on Monday is meant to signal American resolve \u2014 even as some Republicans in Washington are increasingly resistant to expanding NATO. Montenegro\u2019s membership was opposed by the Republican senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee, and conservative publications have produced articles in recent weeks questioning the wisdom of further NATO expansion, specifically citing the case of Macedonia.\u201cThey may get aggressive, and, congratulations, you\u2019re in World War III,\u201d he said.Officials in Skopje nervously took note of Mr. Trump\u2019s comments but said that they believed the United States stood firmly behind their bid to join NATO.And the prime minister said his government had placed its \u201centire political capital to solve the dispute with Greece.\u201d\u201cThis is our big chance,\u201d Mr. Zaev said. \u201cCitizens know that the moment has to be seized. This is how they will shape their future and the future of our country.\u201dAn earlier version of this article gave an incorrect title for Jens Stoltenberg of NATO. He is the organization\u2019s secretary general, not its general secretary.Marc Santora reported from Skopje, Macedonia, and Julian E. Barnes from Washington. Alisa Dogramadzieva and Aleksandar Dimishkovski contributed reporting from Skopje.Advertisement"}

Nathaniel Popper, who covers cryptocurrencies and financial technology for The Times from San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.There are many cryptocurrencies and they often fluctuate in value. What tech products do you use to keep your finger on the pulse?Most conversations about cryptocurrencies tend to start with the price, and there are now countless services that track the ups and downs of the thousands of digital tokens out there.For communicating with sources, I have to use way too many messaging apps. In China, where cryptocurrencies are big, everyone is on WeChat. Most other sources outside the United States are on either WhatsApp or Telegram. In the United States, the anti-government folks \u2014 and the privacy advocates who are concerned about surveillance \u2014 only want to chat on Signal, which encrypts messages in both directions.You also cover financial tech. How has technology changed the way people do banking and what do you think of all the fintech start-ups?There have been several advances in online financial services that seem like real progress to me and I\u2019m always surprised that more people don\u2019t take advantage of them. At the most basic level, the advent of online check deposits has made it so that I don\u2019t need to go into a bank, which I\u2019ll be happy to never do again.Online banking has also made it easier to shop for better interest rates and benefits. Guided by sites like Bankrate and Nerdwallet, I\u2019ve moved my money around quite a bit as I look for the best deals. I currently have an account with Ally, which is giving me 1.8 percent on my cash \u2014 compared with the 0.1 percent that Wells Fargo is offering \u2014 and reimburses me for any fees I get charged when I use out-of-network ATMs.I do the same shopping for credit cards, often following the advice of The Points Guy to find the best perks and free miles. For people with good credit, there\u2019s little reason not to be getting back 2 percent on everything you purchase, and for people with worse credit, it is now much easier to find lower interest rates.Beyond these banking services, though, I\u2019ve been somewhat underwhelmed by the products being offered by the enormous crop of fintech start-ups that have popped up over the last decade. I\u2019ve tried lots of apps and tools to get my financial life in order, but few of them are sufficiently intuitive, or add much beyond what you can get from traditional providers like Vanguard and Mint \u2014 or a simple Excel spreadsheet.When I was house hunting last year, I did use Credit Karma to stay on top of my credit score. But beyond that, financial arrangements are incredibly personal, which seems to make it difficult to automate. It\u2019s also harder for people to experiment with financial apps than with other online services because it often requires entering lots of banking details that people don\u2019t want to share. At this point, the only financial apps I regularly use beyond my bank are Venmo and Square Cash, which have made it so much easier to send money to friends and family.You\u2019re not allowed to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for ethical reasons. But if you could, would you? I do make an exception for people who are genuinely interested in the novel qualities of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, like the ability to hold money on a shared ledger, rather than in a bank, and to send money without going through intermediaries. But even for these folks, the place to start is by buying a very small quantity \u2014 say $50 of Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 to try it out and see what it can do. If, at that point, you still think this is going to take over the world, then buy more \u2014 but only what you are willing to lose.Cryptocurrencies have tanked recently. Will the likes of Bitcoin, Ether and XRP ever be worth nothing?For most other coins, which have weathered many fewer attacks and unexpected hurdles, the chances are undoubtedly higher. There are still basic questions about whether the technology underlying virtual currencies can scale to take on more users and preserve the privacy of those users. There are also economic questions about how the prices will behave, and how users will respond to the changing prices if and when more people start using the coins.At this point, these are all still experiments in what happens when you put together a bunch of cutting-edge cryptography, legal theory and economics. But that is also what makes it so interesting.What tech products do you obsess over in your personal life? My love of music has me constantly searching for better streaming radio stations without ads or talk. I am also always trying to make better playlists on Spotify in the hopes that it will help Spotify better find new music for me. I am fascinated with why Spotify doesn\u2019t give me better suggestions and generally just offers up the most boring version of what I\u2019ve already listened to.Around the house, we use an Amazon Echo and a Google Home device to set timers and play music for my kids. But I also love testing all the ways that these \u201csmart\u201d devices are still terrible at answering the most basic questions and completing the most basic tasks. One of my favorites was when I asked Alexa to play a symphony by Beethoven and she said: \u201cI couldn\u2019t find any symphony songs by Beethoven.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Three other board members are investors.At a staff meeting Thursday morning, Dr. Thompson and others, including Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, the acting physician-in-chief who replaced Dr. Baselga, described the recent events as a disruption and acknowledged that the hospital was under a microscope, according to several people who attended. Doctors said they were concerned about a lack of communication from hospital leadership, and one said patients were nervous that their health data was being commercialized by the institution.Hospital pathologists have strongly objected to the Paige.AI deal, saying it is unfair that the founders received equity stakes in a company that relies on the pathologists\u2019 expertise and work amassed over 60 years. They also questioned the use of patients\u2019 data \u2014 even if it is anonymous \u2014 without their knowledge in a profit-driven venture.In addition, experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance have questioned whether Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation\u2019s leading cancer centers, complied with federal and state law governing nonprofits when it set up the deal. The experts pointed out that charitable institutions like Memorial Sloan Kettering must show that they didn\u2019t provide assets to insiders for less than the fair market value.Cancer center officials said that they acted properly in approving the deal with Paige.AI and that if successful, the venture could change the future of cancer diagnosis. \u201cThis is an incredibly expensive undertaking \u2014 it needs a lot of money,\u201d Dr. Gregory Raskin, the hospital\u2019s vice president of technology development, said in an interview. \u201cWe feel this is a really valuable and important technology to get developed.\u201dOfficials said that some board members invested only after early efforts to generate interest from outside companies and investors had failed. But they acknowledged that they did not seek an independent valuation of the tissue archive, nor did they put the proposal out for competitive bidding before licensing it to a single company. In exchange for sharing its voluminous database, Memorial Sloan Kettering received ownership shares amounting to about nine percent in the company.\u201cIt just seems awfully coincidental that the individuals involved happen to be people in control and influence of that asset, and they ended up with an exclusive use of it,\u201d said Marcus S. Owens, a Washington lawyer who ran the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt organizations. \u201cIt seems to create a cascading series of conflicts for the operation of Sloan Kettering.\u201dThe decision to license images of the patients\u2019 tissue slides to a for-profit company also highlights the broader debate over the use of personal medical data, ranging from genetic information to, in this case, images of a person\u2019s cells, for research and commercial purposes.After ProPublica and The Times began asking questions about the arrangement, one of the founders \u2014 Dr. David Klimstra, the chairman of the pathology department \u2014 said he would divest his ownership stake.The Paige.AI project finally took off after enlisting the help of Norman Selby, a member of the hospital board\u2019s executive committee and a longtime health care consultant, manager and investor. He is listed as a founder and executive chairman of Paige.AI and holds an equity stake.The three other hospital board members who became investors are Stanley Druckenmiller, Alexander T. Robertson and Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis, according to Richard Beattie, honorary chairman of the cancer center\u2019s board and a member of its executive committee. \u201cWe were desperate,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis is more risky than most transactions, and we couldn\u2019t find investors.\u201dThe board investors in Paige.AI, and Mr. Breyer, either declined to comment or did not return calls and emails. Mr. Selby has pledged to donate some of his profits to the hospital, Mr. Beattie said.Experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance questioned whether Memorial Sloan Kettering, which is a charity, acted properly in what is known as a related party transaction with the founders of Paige.AI.While federal law does not specifically require seeking bids from competitors or independent appraisals of the assets in such a transaction, nonprofit groups that make deals with companies associated with board members or employees must demonstrate that they have taken steps to ensure that insiders don\u2019t get preferential treatment. If nonprofits are found not to have complied, they or the individuals involved could face tax repercussions.Mr. Beattie said the hospital relied on some investors to set a value for licensing the slides, with guidance from hedge fund leaders on its board. A law firm, which he did not identify, evaluated the documents and said it was a good deal.Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors who has written books about corporate governance, said the center\u2019s process was \u201cinadequate.\u201d\u201cThey could be throwing a dart at the wall to figure out what the valuation is,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re accepting somebody\u2019s word for it and that\u2019s very, very risky.\u201dMr. Beattie said the cancer center would follow I.R.S. rules requiring it to list the transaction on financial forms, which won\u2019t be public until next year. He also said the hospital had set up plans to manage conflicts for the three company founders. All four members who are invested, including Mr. Selby, must recuse themselves from any board actions about the company, Mr. Beattie said. A review of the hospital\u2019s I.R.S. filings does not show any similar transactions in recent years.In two meetings this month, staff pathologists confronted hospital leaders over the cancer center\u2019s relationship with Paige.AI, some of them angered by the deal that would allow others to profit from their work.At a tense meeting Sept. 12, some pathologists said they only learned about the deal online after it was announced, two people in attendance said.As for how the deal came about, Dr. Klimstra told colleagues that Google had twice approached the hospital about securing access to the pathology slides and was turned down. Mr. Beattie said there were never serious conversations with Google. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.Doctors also expressed concerns about whether patients had consented to have images of their tissue used in this way.Dr. Klimstra told them the project had been approved by an institutional review board, which considers ethical issues involving patients. Patients who had not given their consent to having their readings shared would have all personal health information stripped from the images and notes, he said. Dr. Raskin said that between 30 to 40 percent of patients typically do not consent.And Paige.AI will not have exclusive access to slides that resulted from federally funded research, he added.It then says, \u201c(contemplate consulting fees, repeat with feeling.)\u201dIn an interview last week, Dr. Rosenblum said he wasn\u2019t seeking financial compensation, but felt \u201cthe leadership had not been particularly transparent with us about the founding of this company, and I feel that we were not sufficiently credited with what had been our intellectual input in this.\u201dKathryn Martin, the hospital\u2019s chief operating officer, said the cancer center did not anticipate the pathologists\u2019 objections. \u201cI think we could have done a better job communicating it,\u201d she said in an interview.Dr. Klimstra said in a statement that the project represented a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in the pathology field.\u201cOther than my family, there is nothing more important to me than running my department,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cI sincerely regret the fact that my equity ownership in Paige has served as a distraction to my primary leadership role at M.S.K.\u201dDr. Fuchs, the head of the computational pathology lab, defended his role in a separate statement. \u201cComputer scientists like myself very seldom get the chance to really help patients,\u201d he said.Details for distributing any profits or proceeds from Paige.AI have not been worked out, officials said. Ms. Martin suggested that if the deal is successful, some funds could be set aside for the pathology department to finance research projects.For now, much of the talk is theoretical \u2014 the company is years away from selling a finished product, with a staff of fewer than 20 employees.The roster of other key advisers also appears to be in flux. Until recently, Dr. Baselga was listed as the chairman of Paige\u2019s scientific advisory board. But his name disappeared from the company\u2019s website last week, the day after he resigned from Memorial Sloan Kettering. He also recently resigned from board positions at the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a radiation equipment manufacturer.Charles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.

{"Headline": "To Restore Civil Society, Start With the Library", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis crucial institution is being neglected just when we need it the most.Is the public library obsolete? A lot of powerful forces in society seem to think so. In recent years, declines in the circulation of bound books in some parts of the country have led prominent critics to argue that libraries are no longer serving their historical function. Countless elected officials insist that in the 21st century \u2014 when so many books are digitized, so much public culture exists online and so often people interact virtually \u2014 libraries no longer need the support they once commanded.Libraries are being disparaged and neglected at precisely the moment when they are most valued and necessary. Why the disconnect? In part it\u2019s because the founding principle of the public library \u2014 that all people deserve free, open access to our shared culture and heritage \u2014 is out of sync with the market logic that dominates our world. But it\u2019s also because so few influential people understand the expansive role that libraries play in modern communities. Libraries are an example of what I call \u201csocial infrastructure\u201d: the physical spaces and organizations that shape the way people interact. Libraries don\u2019t just provide free access to books and other cultural materials, they also offer things like companionship for older adults, de facto child care for busy parents, language instruction for immigrants and welcoming public spaces for the poor, the homeless and young people.I recently spent a year doing ethnographic research in libraries in New York City. Again and again, I was reminded how essential libraries are, not only for a neighborhood\u2019s vitality but also for helping to address all manner of personal problems.For older people, especially widows, widowers and those who live alone, libraries are places for culture and company, through book clubs, movie nights, sewing circles and classes in art, current events and computing. For many, the library is the main place they interact with people from other generations.For children and teenagers, libraries help instill an ethic of responsibility, to themselves and to their neighbors, by teaching them what it means to borrow and take care of something public, and to return it so others can have it too. For new parents, grandparents and caretakers who feel overwhelmed when watching an infant or a toddler by themselves, libraries are a godsend.In many neighborhoods, particularly those where young people aren\u2019t hyper-scheduled in formal after-school programs, libraries are highly popular among adolescents and teenagers who want to spend time with other people their age. One reason is that they\u2019re open, accessible and free. Another is that the library staff members welcome them; in many branches, they even assign areas for teenagers to be with one another.To appreciate why this matters, compare the social space of the library with the social space of commercial establishments like Starbucks or McDonald\u2019s. These are valuable parts of the social infrastructure, but not everyone can afford to frequent them, and not all paying customers are welcome to stay for long.This is not to say that libraries are always peaceful and serene. During the time I spent doing research, I witnessed a handful of heated disputes, physical altercations and other uncomfortable situations, sometimes involving people who appeared to be mentally ill or under the influence of drugs. But such problems are inevitable in a public institution that\u2019s dedicated to open access, especially when drug clinics, homeless shelters and food banks routinely turn away \u2014 and often refer to the library! \u2014 those who most need help. What\u2019s remarkable is how rarely these disruptions happen, how civilly they are managed and how quickly a library regains its rhythm afterward.The openness and diversity that flourish in neighborhood libraries were once a hallmark of urban culture. But that has changed. Though American cities are growing more ethnically, racially and culturally diverse, they too often remain divided and unequal, with some neighborhoods cutting themselves off from difference \u2014 sometimes intentionally, sometimes just by dint of rising costs \u2014 particularly when it comes to race and social class.Libraries are the kinds of places where people with different backgrounds, passions and interests can take part in a living democratic culture. They are the kinds of places where the public, private and philanthropic sectors can work together to reach for something higher than the bottom line. If we have any chance of rebuilding a better society, social infrastructure like the library is precisely what we need. Correction: September 11, 2018An earlier version of this essay included outdated information about a policy at the public libraries in San Jose, Calif. Patrons are prohibited from borrowing books and using computers once their overdue fees surpass $20, not $10.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Parts of a \u2018Virtual\u2019 Border Wall, Built With the Tech Behind Driverless Cars", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "In a rural Texas county, lidar sensor technology is being tested as a way to spot illegal intruders from Mexico. That use could divide workers in Silicon Valley.Supported byDEL RIO, Tex. \u2014 In this tiny town at the edge of South Texas brush country, a black steel fence runs along the Mexican border. About 15 feet high and topped by small metal spires that bend toward Mexico, it stretches west from a Border Patrol checkpoint for about a mile and a half. Then it stops.The sensor belongs to a Silicon Valley start-up called Quanergy, one of a number of companies trying to land business along the Mexican border. While President Trump still vows to build a physical border wall, these companies hope to help build a \u201cvirtual wall\u201d that some policymakers believe would be more effective than miles of concrete and metal. A virtual wall would not offer a physical deterrence, but some people believe it would be cheaper to build and maintain.\u201cThe only way to have operational control of the border is to look at all 2,000 miles of it at the same time,\u201d said Representative Will Hurd, a Republican who represents Val Verde County, west of San Antonio. \u201cAnd the only way to do that is through technology.\u201dFounded in 2012 and backed by more than $160 million in funding, Quanergy was one of the many lidar makers created amid a rush to develop driverless cars. Over the last year, that investment boom started to feel like a glut as autonomous vehicle technology improved more slowly than some had hoped. Border control is another potential market for lidar, which can spot objects and people in all sorts of conditions, day or night.Working with the Val Verde County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Quanergy has spent the last year testing its lidar sensors on the ranch in Del Rio, angling for a contract with United States Customs and Border Protection.Still, where some see a moral quandary, others see a business opportunity. More than 20 companies have worked on the Pentagon project that Google pulled out of.Mr. Luckey left Facebook two years later after it was revealed that he supported a political action group that spread anti-Hillary Clinton memes. Not long after, he started working on his new company. Trae Stephens, the investor who founded Anduril with Mr. Luckey, tried to distance the company from Mr. Luckey\u2019s history of political provocation when asked about it in an interview.\u201cIt is a national security company,\u201d he said.Quanergy\u2019s executives also hope to keep politics at arm\u2019s length. In a recent interview, Louay Eldada, a founder and the chief executive of Quanergy, said the company always planned to expand beyond driverless cars. Border control, he said, was an obvious candidate.Cogniac, another Silicon Valley start-up that offers technology for identifying people and objects in camera images, is exploring similar work.Mr. Hurd, the congressman, is advocating for a wider technological system. \u201cThe question is, how do you cut for sign in the digital age?\u201d he said. \u201cWe should get to a point where we see absolutely everything coming across our border.\u201dThat could include the kinds of sensors tested by Quanergy in Del Rio, which can capture activity across 360 degrees and a distance of about 100 meters. Using this three-dimensional view of an area, software can automatically pinpoint people moving past and alert border agents.If lined up in large numbers and paired with cameras that snap images when movement is detected, these sensors could provide a more detailed picture of border activity and help agents organize their response.But the devices are limited. If left unprotected, they are easily vandalized. And they require both electrical power and a network connection. Quanergy has tested its sensors with solar panels, which eliminate the need for power lines. Still, along most parts of the border, the authorities would have to install new fiber lines or cell towers.Joe Martinez, Val Verde County\u2019s sheriff, has helped test the Quanergy sensors. He said he believed they could be a big help along some parts of the border. But if these sensors were used in the vast, rocky, undulating spaces in the western part of his county, he said, border and other law enforcement agents would have difficulty responding to alerts within any reasonable amount of time.\u201cThe needs to the west are different,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cAnd the needs to the south are different.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, lidar sensors are expensive. Quanergy charges a few thousand dollars per unit. Old tires are considerably cheaper.Such sensors, Mr. Martinez and others said, are best used in tandem with a wide variety of other methods under development. \u201cThis is about a layering of technologies,\u201d said David Aguilar, a former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and a principal at Global Security and Innovative Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington. Current officials with the agency said it was testing many technologies with companies in Silicon Valley, with the goal of deploying new artificial intelligence techniques in the field.Some question whether these technologies will eat away at the privacy of residents. Much of the land at the border is private.Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University who specializes in border protection issues, said authorities should concentrate on border checkpoints, where a large portion of illegal crossings occur.\u201cNone of these things make sense to me,\u201d said Ms. Correa-Cabrera, who is also a fellow at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington. \u201cWhy would we continue to spend on technology that is not solving the problem?\u201dBut Mr. Aguilar said he believed that demands on the border for new sensors and new artificial intelligence would grow.\u201cWe started talking about this many years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the technology wasn\u2019t as mature as it is now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the university where Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera is currently a professor. It is George Mason University, not the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, where she was previously a member of the faculty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Big Tech, a Comeuppance We\u2019ve Seen Before: On Wall St.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When I moved to the Bay Area two years ago, it was with a sense of relief.Relief from New York winters and deteriorating subways, yes. But also relief after six years of covering Wall Street, an industry that had moved from one crisis to another after the financial crash of 2008, drawing the unending wrath of the public.In California I was joining a growing team of reporters covering Silicon Valley, which had quickly become the new engine of the economy. Just like Wall Street before it lost its luster, the tech industry had become the destination of choice for the top college graduates. I would be writing about a place where everyone was focused more on the future than on the past.Now, just two years after getting here, and a decade after the start of the financial crisis, I have a creeping sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I go about my job.Admiration of the tech world has, in the wake of a growing list of scandals, quickly soured into an intense suspicion that manages to cross partisan lines, similar to what Wall Street faced after 2008.As was true after the financial crisis, the backlash against tech rises out of a public awakening to the integral role that these huge companies occupy in our society \u2014 with Facebook, Uber and Twitter playing the part that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase did a decade ago.\u201cPeople talk about bankers being amoral,\u201d said Charlie Beckett, the director of the Truth, Trust and Technology Commission at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey are starting to talk about tech people in similar language. Where before they were kind of heroes \u2014 they were people who brought us these wonderful products \u2014 they are now starting to be blamed for the ills of the world.\u201dIt often feels as though these companies took on their pivotal positions so quickly that no one \u2014 not even their employees \u2014 had a chance to understand how they really worked or how much influence they had.Ana Bot\u00edn, a longtime executive at the giant Spanish bank Santander, recently wrote on LinkedIn that the tech companies were losing the same basic thing that banks lost in 2008: the public\u2019s trust.\u201cSome in big tech are beginning to accept what we in banking learned some years ago: We don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d Ms. Bot\u00edn told me last week.The storm that Ms. Bot\u00edn and other bank executives faced after 2008 and the one we are witnessing now are obviously different.The crisis precipitated by the banks was a financial one that caused markets to crash, and threatened to bring down the global economy.The crisis involving the internet giants is not hitting our pocketbooks \u2014 it is straining our confidence in what we know about the world. If Russian hackers can create and amplify fake news stories across the many sites we have come to rely on, where can we go for reliable information?In public surveys, like the Harris Poll Reputation Quotient, the tech giants are still polling well ahead of Goldman and Wells Fargo, and some, like Amazon and Apple, seem to be mostly flying above the fray.The exact ills that people assign to the industry tend to differ based on their politics. While people on the right, including President Trump, have expressed the most concern about political bias and censorship, the left has worried more about the way the companies opened the door to election interference and have exacerbated income inequality. But nearly everyone is voicing unease about the way our children have been turned into digital addicts.The broad shift in perception is inevitably piling more blame onto the shoulders of one industry than it should bear. Like the mortgage meltdown, our current crisis of confidence is the result of factors that go beyond any one player in the drama \u2014 from the polarization of the media landscape to the growing economic inequality that has led to distrust of elites of all sorts.Whatever the reality, political momentum is building behind some sort of broader regulatory response, similar to what came together in the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The current push has begun with talk of legislation that would protect our privacy \u2014 but much bolder steps are being considered.What I wonder now is whether any regulatory response will follow a similar path to what came after the financial crisis.A long list of new laws in the United States and Europe did seem to make the banks safer and another crisis less likely.But the regulations also appear to have cemented the status of the biggest banks in our economy. The largest financial institutions now control a bigger proportion of the industry\u2019s assets than they did before the crisis. These big banks are regulated as if they were more like utilities, but the high regulatory costs provide a kind of barrier against most competitors.It is easy to imagine something similar happening in the technology industry, and European authorities have already taken some steps in that direction.If tech companies are forced to be more responsible for the content on their platforms, they will most likely need to build a significant apparatus for compliance. That would cut into profitability. It would also make it very hard for upstarts to challenge them.\u201cThere\u2019s an increasingly loud call for the platforms to get involved in content moderation,\u201d said Cory Doctorow, a special adviser with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s well intentioned, but the outcome of that is very likely to be pretty disastrous.\u201dMr. Doctorow has been part of a growing chorus of people calling for antitrust actions to break up the biggest companies, rather than tweaking their operations.Whatever steps the government takes, they are unlikely to help recover the trust that has already been lost. As I know from those years of covering the banks, confidence, once gone, is not easily regained.As for me, the familiar problems have not allowed for the change of pace I was expecting. And in truth, the subways out here are no better. But the weather is still very nice.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Just Don\u2019t Call It Privacy", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisAmazon, Google and Twitter executives are heading to Congress. Should legislators give consumers control over the data companies have on them?Ms. Singer is a technology reporter at The New York Times.There\u2019s just one flaw with this setup.In a surveillance economy where companies track, analyze and capitalize on our clicks, the issue at hand isn\u2019t privacy. The problem is unfettered data exploitation and its potential deleterious consequences \u2014 among them, unequal consumer treatment, financial fraud, identity theft, manipulative marketing and discrimination.In other words, asking companies whose business models revolve around exploiting data-based consumer-influence techniques to explain their privacy policies seems about as useful as asking sharks to hold forth on veganism.The Senate Commerce hearing, however, doesn\u2019t seem designed to investigate commercial surveillance and influence practices that might merit government oversight.For one thing, only industry executives are currently set to testify. And most of them are lawyers and policy experts, not engineers versed in the mechanics of data-mining algorithms.That may be because Congress is under industry pressure.Frederick Hill, a spokesman for the Senate Commerce Committee, said the group planned future hearings that would include other voices, such as consumer groups. But \u201cfor the first hearing,\u201d Mr. Hill said, \u201cthe committee is bringing in companies most consumers recognize to make the discussion about privacy more relatable.\u201dMany consumers know that digital services and ad tech companies track and analyze their activities. And they accept, or are at least resigned to, data-mining in exchange for conveniences like customized newsfeeds and ads.And that leads to a larger question: Do we want a future in which companies can freely parse the photos we posted last year, or the location data from the fitness apps we used last week, to infer whether we are stressed or depressed or financially strapped or emotionally vulnerable \u2014 and take advantage of that?(Amazon said it does not use Alexa data for product recommendations or marketing.)It\u2019s tough to answer those questions right now when there are often gulfs between the innocuous ways companies explain their data practices to consumers and the details they divulge about their targeting techniques to advertisers.Here\u2019s what it means in practice: AT&T can find out which subscribers have indigestion \u2014 or at least which ones bought over-the-counter drugs to treat it.Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for AT&T, said the company\u2019s privacy policy was \u201ctransparent and precise, and describes in plain language how we use information and the choices we give customers.\u201dBut consumer advocates hope senators will press AT&T, Amazon and other companies this week to provide more details on their consumer-profiling practices. \u201cWe want an inside look on the analytics and how they\u2019re categorizing, ranking, rating and scoring us,\u201d Professor Citron said.Given the increased public scrutiny, some companies are tweaking their tactics.AT&T recently said it would stop sharing users\u2019 location details with data brokers. Facebook said it had stopped allowing advertisers to use sensitive categories, like race or religion, to exclude people from seeing ads. Google created a feature for users to download masses of their data, including a list of all the sites Google has tracked them on.Government officials in Europe are not waiting for companies to police themselves. In May, the European Union introduced a tough new data protection law that curbs some data-mining. It requires companies to obtain explicit permission from European users before collecting personal details on sensitive subjects like their religion, health or sex life. It gives European users the right to see all of the information companies hold about them \u2014 including any algorithmic scores or inferences. Advertisement"}

By partnering with programmers and data scientists, Ms. Angwin pioneered the work of studying big tech\u2019s algorithms \u2014 the secret codes that have an enormous impact on everyday American life. Her findings shed light on how companies like Facebook were creating tools that could be used to promote racial bias, fraudulent schemes and extremist content. Ms. Angwin compares tech to canned food, an innovation that took some time to be seen with more scrutiny.\u201cWhen canned food came out, it was amazing,\u201d said Ms. Angwin, who will be the site\u2019s editor in chief. \u201cYou could have peaches when they were out of season. There was a whole period of America where every recipe called for canned soup. People went crazy for canned food.

Mr. Newmark, who splits his time between San Francisco and New York, has for years kept a low profile. But he worries about what he sees as a lack of self-reflection among engineers. \u201cSometimes it takes an engineer a while to understand that we need help, then we get that help, and then we do a lot better,\u201d Mr. Newmark said. \u201cWe need the help that only investigative reporting with good data science can provide.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re in an information war now,\u201d Mr. Newmark said. For many years, the outrageous success of Silicon Valley companies \u2014 and the aggressive public relations teams who worked for them \u2014 kept many journalists at a remove. At ProPublica, Ms. Angwin and Mr. Larson subverted the traditional model of tech reporting altogether. They did not need access. With the right tools, they could study impact. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for more reporters to use statistics to uncover societal harms,\u201d said Mr. Larson, who has been doing data-driven journalism for a decade. \u201cAnd then Julia\u2019s gift is she takes data journalism and doesn\u2019t make it like an academic report.\u201dSome of Ms. Angwin and Mr. Larson\u2019s reporting tactics may violate tech platform terms of service agreements, which ban people from performing automated collection of public information and prohibit them from creating temporary research accounts. Ms. Angwin has been a strong defender of these practices and has argued that tech companies ought to allow reporters to be an exception to their rules.Mr. Larson, who will be The Markup\u2019s managing editor, said the result was just as much a surprise to readers as it was to those who had made the biased algorithm. \u201cIncreasingly, algorithms are used as shorthand for passing the buck,\u201d said Mr. Larson, 36. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough people to look at parole decisions, so we\u2019re going to pass it on to the computer and the computer is going to decide, and once they go into production, there\u2019s no oversight.\u201d\u201cThere are unintended consequences,\u201d Mr. Larson said. \u201cIn all three of those cases, it was a complete surprise to the people who made those algorithms as well.\u201dEngineers being surprised by the tools they have made is, to the Markup team, part of the problem.\u201cPart of the premise of The Markup is the level of understanding technology and its effects is very, very low, and we would all benefit from a broader understanding,\u201d Ms. Gardner said. \u201cAnd I would include people who work for the companies.\u201dMs. Angwin said part of her goal was to help readers understand what exactly they should be worried about when it comes to tech. \u201cWe\u2019re all a little uncertain,\u201d Ms. Angwin said. \u201cThe evidence isn\u2019t in. I want to be providing the evidence.\u201d She hopes the stories they take on will lead to better government and corporate policies.\u201cWe are a numbers-driven data society,\u201d Ms. Angwin said. \u201cThat\u2019s the price of entry these days for political change \u2014 a data set.\u201dAnd searching for that information, Ms. Angwin said she was not worried about getting Facebook or Google to return her phone calls.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Defied Trump on Climate Change. Now, It\u2019s Their Moment of Truth. ", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a striking move for a coalition of local leaders: Making a case to the rest of the world that they, and not the president, spoke for the nation on climate policy.The gathering in San Francisco, which is spearheaded by Governor Brown, will bring leaders and civil society groups from around the world to discuss ways that states, cities and businesses can work together to reduce their emissions.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing signs of increasing apathy worldwide,\u201d said Paul Bledsoe, a White House climate adviser under former President Bill Clinton. \u201cAnd a lot of people are hoping that what\u2019s happening in places like California could be the antidote.\u201dA big test of that antidote will be whether America\u2019s states, cities and companies put forward meaningful new steps to cut emissions \u2014 and whether that, in turn, helps to persuade local leaders in other countries to ratchet up their own efforts on climate change.\u201cThere\u2019s a real push to make sure that this We Are Still In movement becomes something more than just a symbolic exercise,\u201d said Gwynne Taraska, a senior fellow at Climate Advisers, a consulting firm. \u201cThis is an opportunity for them to cement their diplomatic relevance.\u201dUntil now, local action on climate change in the United States has largely been led by a handful of blue states like California, the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. Other states \u2014 like Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon and Washington \u2014 are racing to catch up.One big reason for that: While many states have found it relatively painless to clean up their electric grids, swapping out coal for cleaner and cheaper natural gas and renewables, power plants are responsible for only about one-third of America\u2019s emissions. \u201cThese are sectors that require huge technological and behavioral changes,\u201d said Kate Larsen, a co-author of the Rhodium Group report. \u201cIt\u2019s a much heavier lift.\u201dOnly 16 states and Puerto Rico have actually promised to uphold the Paris agreement. Most of those states are led by Democrats, and efforts to persuade Republican-led states like Ohio or Texas to join have been largely unsuccessful. \u201cThat has been one of the great struggles,\u201d said Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington and a co-chairman of the alliance. \u201cBut I can tell you that I am confident that the alliance will grow after this next election cycle.\u201d That assumes, though, that states like Florida, New Mexico or Maine will see a change in party control.Governor Brown stressed that the San Francisco conference was meant to be a global summit, and he is leading it with foreign representatives like Xie Zhenhua, China\u2019s chief climate negotiator, and Anand Mahindra, a prominent Indian industrialist.In effect, the leaders of We Are Still In are seeking to conduct their own version of foreign policy on climate change \u2014 forging partnerships with other local governments in countries like China to address global warming and urging leaders abroad to do more \u2014 at a time when the Trump administration has disengaged on the issue.\u201cIt\u2019s a new world,\u201d Governor Inslee said. \u201cWe have the ability to work with the United Kingdom, as we have, with British Columbia, with Mexico, which we do. We can share best practices, we can look for investment opportunities. We are just not hampered by the Trump administration at all.\u201d\u201cLook, we\u2019re at the base camp of Mt. Everest,\u201d Governor Brown said. \u201cThis summit is meant to put climate change on the agenda and keep pushing it higher and higher on the list until finally the whole world is fully engaged. And I\u2019ll tell you one thing, it\u2019s a hell of a lot better than doing nothing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Need to Find Me? Ask My Ham Man", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveCharcuterie, wine and all kinds of nourishment from a second family in Paris.When my grandmother died unexpectedly three years ago, I left Paris for the funeral without warning any of my local shopkeepers. This led my charcuterie salesman to believe that I myself was dead. Alarmed by my continued absence, and aware of my daily dining route, he hurried across the street to my wine guy to see if he had any news of me. I\u2019m the human equivalent of a stray dog who wanders from shop to shop in search of whoever will give me a snack.The ham shop is barely larger than a coffin and stacked floor to ceiling with pig parts. I come for the Snowballs, baseballs of sausage stuffed with black truffles and coated in Parmesan cheese. I stay for the company.The ham man is the biggest ham of all. He knows about every bad date I have. He even gave my phone number to a stranger he thought I would like. (I didn\u2019t.) Ours is not exactly the normal relationship between a shopkeeper and patron, but then again, not one of my food-based friendships is what you\u2019d call normal.I Snapchat with my cheesemonger. My barista lets me sneak in last night\u2019s open bottle of Champagne to wash down my morning doughnut. My chocolatier\u2019s daughter studying in New York has my sister\u2019s number in case of emergencies. I have cried into my wine guy\u2019s sweater more times than I can count, most recently when he moved away and I felt as if someone had cut off my limb. Where would I drink and weep now? At home, like a normal person?My cousin was shocked last fall when we walked into my other wine shop and my wine seller, Patty, who is also an astrologer and tarot reader, said that she had been debating whether to call me about something she had seen in my astrology chart.\u201cYour wine seller has your phone number?\u201d my cousin asked.Of course she has my number, I thought. How would I be able to confidently make terrible life choices if my wine-selling astrologer couldn\u2019t reach me?How have I made all of these food friends in Paris? I compulsively seek out people who are trapped behind counters and forced to listen to my tales of woe. I show up at the same places and overshare to people who are paid to be pleasant to me until they develop a form of Stockholm syndrome that makes us friends.It was startling to realize that my ham purveyor is a more consistent presence in my life than any friend, family member or romantic interest. Sometimes, I think I need to make some lifestyle changes so that the first person who would realize that I was missing or dead is not the man supporting my ham habit. Other days, when we\u2019ve had a good gossip and I\u2019m stuffed full of charcuterie and he has given me a pocket sausage for the road, I think I\u2019m doing it right after all.I used to be able to count on my mother to be the one to track me down in the event of my untimely murder; lord knows she has imagined plenty of gruesome ends for me. I can\u2019t tell you the number of times that public safety officers showed up on my doorstep in college because I hadn\u2019t returned her calls swiftly enough.Now, she doesn\u2019t know how to call my phone number in France. She struggles to put on her seatbelt. Her brain and body (and seatbelt) just don\u2019t click in the right way anymore.Two months after I moved to France, she learned she had Parkinson\u2019s disease, a degenerative brain disorder. My parents told us on Mother\u2019s Day. By us, I mean they told my two sisters in person and then, as a family, called me on Skype. Throughout that conversation, my mother\u2019s concern was not for herself or her future but for me, because they were together to process the news while I was alone.It\u2019s her greatest fear: one of her children, alone. A fear I have exacerbated by moving overseas. I didn\u2019t come here for a relationship; I came for a job. And when that job ended, I stayed, much to my mother\u2019s chagrin.To others, my life in Paris must seem fairly perfect, all croissants and long walks along the Seine. What people don\u2019t see: my chronically ill mother sobbing into my neck and begging me not to go. Me getting on that plane anyway, convinced I am some kind of monster.\u201cI only have a few more good years left,\u201d she says, and it\u2019s poignant because it\u2019s true. My friend Katie\u2019s father found out he had Parkinson\u2019s roughly seven years before my mother, so her family serves as a bellwether. Katie constantly reminds me to appreciate these moments because these are the good years, while the medication still works.Or mostly works. Last year, during three months of tonsillitis, I stayed with my parents in Massachusetts for medical care. I had a prescription nasal irrigator that required mineral water. When I requested that my mother purchase some, she proudly returned with a case of carbonated water. I had said \u201cmineral,\u201d hadn\u2019t I? She failed to see why sparkling mineral water was a problem.Yes, these are the good years, I had joked to myself as I waterboarded my sinuses with San Pellegrino so my mother wouldn\u2019t feel bad about her brain\u2019s inability to put all the pieces together.It\u2019s dangerous to define a person by disease. She is a person with Parkinson\u2019s, not Parkinson\u2019s itself. And by all evaluations, she\u2019s doing fairly well. She was able to dance at my younger sister\u2019s wedding last October. She got to be at the wedding in the first place. Not everyone is so lucky.And yet, the pain of watching a parent unravel, the grief, amorphous and real, of missing someone even as they stand beside you, takes its toll. I am losing my mother by inches. She\u2019s not here. She\u2019s still here.However hard it is for us to watch this new reality, it\u2019s even more difficult for her to experience it. Despite this, we have been able to maintain a gallows sense of humor in an attempt to productively deal with our pain. For the biennial Parkinson\u2019s Walk done in her honor, my sister named our team \u201cThe Movers and Shakers,\u201d because if you can\u2019t laugh at your mother\u2019s neurodegenerative disease, then what can you laugh at?When I was back in Boston recently, I stopped at her dry cleaner. Seeing that I was alone, the dry cleaner quietly asked if there was something wrong with my mother.\u201cShe\u2019s been coming here for the past 16 years and has always been so bubbly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now she asks me the same question over and over. She\u2019s slow and careful when she takes out her wallet to pay.\u201dI explained about Parkinson\u2019s and how there can be a dementia component for many people.She nodded. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about your mother here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will always take care of her and help her get home.\u201dHer offer was so kind, I later cried in my car. It\u2019s a constant concern of mine: Who will help her when I am not here? The same concern, I imagine, that she feels for me. Who will help me when she is not here?My ham man, I want to reassure her, although I doubt that charcuterie holds much solace. You don\u2019t need to worry about me, I want to whisper. I have created something from nothing here. I have willed a way of life into being. I have found kinship networks in France that nourish me.\u201cMy mother was my first country, the first place I ever lived,\u201d the poet Nayyirah Waheed once wrote. My mother will always be my first home. But I have learned a second language, a second culture. I have learned how to build a home for myself in the world, and I have learned to be at home within myself.It is not an easy choice to build a life apart from the people I love. The only explanation I can offer is that maybe this is what I have been doing all along, looking for the people who will help me find my way back home, wherever that may be.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Remember the Bees That Swarmed Times Square? We Tried to Find Out Where They Came From", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis is a man who last year hung from a 17th-story ledge at One Times Square to rescue 30,000 bees.He said the hot dog cart bees most likely came from a hive on a hotel rooftop; he said the same about those bees at One Times Square.The nearby New York Hilton Midtown and InterContinental New York Barclay hotels have rooftop hives. But the InterContinental Times Square\u2019s hives, at 44th Street and Eighth Avenue, were closer to the cart\u2019s location on Aug. 28, at 43rd Street and Broadway.It was a decent lead.Apis mellifera, or the western honeybee, goes into its mating season between April and June. That is when swarms are most frequent.When bees reproduce, their colony splits in half, said Jay Evans, research leader at the Agriculture Department\u2019s Bee Research Laboratory in Beltsville, Md. Half of the colony stays in the hive with a new queen, and the other half swarms with the older queen to a new home.\u201cTo be a beekeeper, you have to be certified,\u201d said Mr. Aubry, who now finds the work relaxing. \u201cThey teach you how to handle the bees, how to take care of them, what to look for. Making sure that the queen\u2019s not leaving. If the queen leaves, everyone\u2019s gone.\u201d I was not, of course, able to make an assessment one way or another on whether any were missing.Was tracking these bees to the source even possible?\u201cI would say that\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Seeley, a professor of neurobiology and behavior at Cornell University, and an authority on honeybees. \u201cThere are more colonies of bees other than the ones in those hives. Especially in that area, where you\u2019ve got really tall buildings, they could be way up and nobody would even notice them. They just need a crack in a wall.\u201d\u201cHe is right,\u201d Mr. Cot\u00e9 said when I relayed Dr. Seeley\u2019s assessment. But Mr. Cot\u00e9 added that the day before the swarm, the six hives at the Hilton and the seven hives at One Bryant Park were inspected and there were no signs of swarming.Mr. Cot\u00e9 said it makes sense that the bees came from a nearby apiary, most likely the InterContinental. So he went with a Health Department inspector to see The Stinger\u2019s sources of honey.\u201cI checked all four hives,\u201d he said, adding that he saw recent swarm cells in three of the hives.Of course, unless someone actively watched the bees swarm onto the hot dog cart\u2019s umbrella, there is no way to be 100 percent certain about where they came from.But \u201cI can say that they swarmed last week, and I can say a hive swarmed last week in close proximity to the hot dog cart, and I can say that other swarms weren\u2019t reported in the area,\u201d Mr. Cot\u00e9 said.\u201cI\u2019d bet the farm on it. And I\u2019ve actually got a bee farm, so I should know.\u201d\u201cMy four queens were in each hive,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only thing that each hive needed was water. The bees weren\u2019t from us. Not at all.\u201d\u201cIf you ask 10 beekeepers, you will get 11 opinions,\u201d Mr. Cot\u00e9 had said in one of our earlier conversations.The @NYPDBees Twitter account also posted a photo of their new home, which is fittingly under a miniature Sabrett hot dog umbrella.Advertisement"}

Of those 10, nine have been themeless puzzles \u2014 but only two of them, including today\u2019s, have been Fridays. It\u2019s funny, because I actually aim for most of my NYT themelesses to be Fridays.

Mr. Greenidge was then working in the office of the New York mayor as an assistant director for external affairs, and Ms. Davidson was a regional political director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.A mutual friend introduced them moments after another friend had finished telling Mr. Greenidge that he needed to open himself up to the possibility of meeting someone. \u201cShe left to have a drink and I turned around and Linara was there,\u201d he said.Ms. Davidson said that Mr. Greenidge made an immediate impression on her, too. \u201cTo be honest, when I saw him \u2014 and it\u2019s a wonky thing to say \u2014 the moment that I saw him, something said to me in my head, that is my husband right there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it.\u201d\u201cIt took me 35 years to meet him, but we\u2019ve been in the same room the whole time and didn\u2019t even know it,\u201d she said.The next day, Mr. Greenidge asked Ms. Davidson if she would have lunch with him two days later, when they were back in New York City, and they agreed to meet at his favorite Thai place, which was just around the corner from the Clinton campaign office in Brooklyn.She arrived at the date wearing Converse sneakers, he remembers, which were his personal favorite footwear. He saw it as another sign.\u201cIt just felt right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lunch wasn\u2019t a very good lunch. There were awkward pauses and we both didn\u2019t finish our food. But when we left, we shared a kiss. Just a peck on the lips but that\u2019s when I knew she felt the same way I did.\u201dCaroline Baumann and John Stewart Malcolmson met in 2011 on howaboutwe.com, a dating website that proposed two people get together for an activity rather than, strictly speaking, just a date. But the couple\u2019s connection was even more coincident than is usually the case with these things, as neither put more than a modicum of effort into their profile.In fact, Mr. Malcolmson stumbled onto the site because he was looking for an elegant user-interface design for a job he was working on. He signed up and went through the process of creating an account primarily so that he could assess the site\u2019s technical merits.Ms. Baumann had a similar lack of enthusiasm when the website popped up on her screen as a new offering.\u201cI thought, what the hell, I\u2019ve dated half of New York,\u201d Ms. Baumann said. \u201cI gave it no time at all, because I have no time, and then, voil\u00e0!

{"Headline": "Frank Gehry\u2019s Disney Hall Is Technodreaming", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Can a concert hall dream? The Los Angeles Philharmonic has a lot riding on the answer.Mr. Anadol, a bubbly and rather cherubic-looking 32-year-old who dresses entirely in black, likes to imagine the building, which was designed by Frank Gehry, as an enormous artificial intelligence, one that recalls the orchestra\u2019s past and slips into reverie about its future. A few weeks ago, armed with animations and storyboards, he showed up at the Philharmonic\u2019s administrative offices, in an elegant but understated building next to the concert hall, to detail his progress.The building\u2019s \u201cperformance,\u201d staged for patrons paying upward of $2,500 per person for the opening-night gala and free to all on the nine evenings after that, falls into three parts. First, \u201cCentennial Memories,\u201d when data from the Philharmonic\u2019s history \u2014 44.5 terabytes of it, Mr. Anadol reported \u2014 is projected onto the building\u2019s skin.Mr. Smith broke in: \u201c44.5? The last time we were together, it was seven terabytes.\u201dThat was a while ago, Mr. Anadol reminded him. The audio recordings alone \u2014 nearly 77,000 of them \u2014 now come to seven terabytes.\u201cThat\u2019s an average of two recordings a day,\u201d Mr. Smith observed, doing a quick calculation based on the 99 years the orchestra has been playing. (The actual centennial won\u2019t come until September 2019.) \u201cInteresting. O.K.\u201dNext comes \u201cConsciousness,\u201d when the building processes the billions of data points it has received to form a vast web of connections: every performance of every symphony, every trumpet, every oboe, every note the orchestra has ever played. And finally, \u201cDream,\u201d when the concert hall fuses all this together to generate a sort of combinatorial fantasia \u2014 to \u201challucinate,\u201d as Mr. Anadol put it.\u201cThis,\u201d he declared, \u201cwill be a very divine moment.\u201dAnd one long in coming. It took 16 years for the concert hall to be built after Lillian Disney, Walt\u2019s widow, donated $50 million for its construction, and it has taken another 15 years after its completion in 2003 to realize the architect\u2019s vision for its exterior.\u201cI have always had the dream that images and videos would be projected onto the Walt Disney Concert Hall,\u201d Mr. Gehry said in an email. \u201cDuring the design process, I selected the metal for the express purpose of taking projection. I\u2019m happy that the L.A. Phil is going to do it now for its anniversary.\u201dTechnically speaking, of course, the Walt Disney Concert Hall will no more be dreaming than the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d follows you with her eyes. But that\u2019s not the point.\u201cI thought it was time to take these beautiful memories and organize them into a story,\u201d Mr. Anadol said later as we sat in his studio, a former auto repair shop just down the street from the site of the Disney complex where Mickey Mouse was created in 1928.Where car mechanics once labored, a half-dozen designers in their 20s now work behind enormous computer screens. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a science fiction story,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have concern about the future because that\u2019s where we all live\u201d\u2014 so when the building \u201cdreams\u201d in his story, it\u2019s using information from the past to project itself into the future.But that, like his thesis project, involved the relatively simple idea of the concert hall\u2019s reacting to the sounds being made in it. For the building to \u201cdream,\u201d the computer code that controlled the display would need some understanding of what it was dreaming about. He needed to go deeper \u2014 which is where Google, and Inceptionism, came in.They laid out an ambitious agenda, including a $500 million fund-raising campaign, a street festival running the eight miles from the downtown concert hall to the Hollywood Bowl, and the commissioning of 50 new works for the coming season by such composers as John Adams, Philip Glass, Andrew Norman and Steve Reich. When the idea of fulfilling Mr. Gehry\u2019s long-expressed desire to use the outside of the concert hall as a canvas came up, Mr. Anadol was the obvious candidate to make it happen.With Google supplying machine-learning experts and cloud-computing resources, Mr. Anadol and his team set to work to make their computer system dream. They used different types of neural networks \u2014 the computing technology that underlies most artificial intelligence efforts today \u2014 to process pictures and text from the orchestra\u2019s archives and generate new imagery that\u2019s based on them, and to fashion a sound collage from decades of the orchestra\u2019s recordings. It\u2019s about \u201cthe idea of the machine as collaborator,\u201d Mr. Anadol explained.\u201cWDCH Dreams\u201d is a benign work, an unalloyed vision of artificial intelligence as partner rather than threat. The future it posits would not be out of place in Disneyland. Mr. Anadol is aware that there are less wholesome currents \u2014 that the same technology that processes millions of historical images from the Philharmonic\u2019s archives could be used, for instance, to monitor populations on a vast scale.And yet, \u201cI am very, very optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cI think these are incredible tools to have for creativity.\u201d So it\u2019s that aspect that will be on display on Sept. 27. As Mr. Anadol put it, \u201cFrank Gehry\u2019s building is now having its \u2018Inception\u2019 moment.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "JD.com Chairman Richard Liu Arrested in U.S. in Sexual Misconduct Case", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 The billionaire founder of JD.com, one of China\u2019s largest and most successful online retailers, was arrested Friday in Minnesota for alleged sexual misconduct before being released a day later, police records show.Police officials in Minneapolis said they were treating the case as an active investigation.The matter is an another unwelcome bit of publicity for a company that symbolizes the business potential of China\u2019s rising middle class. The accusation could also be a test of JD.com\u2019s stability, as well as the ability of a Chinese technology company to rebound from the problems of its leaders. China\u2019s most powerful technology companies are still tightly controlled by their founders, so the fortunes of businesses worth tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars are closely intertwined with the fates of a small number of executives.JD.com, whose shares trade in the United States, has prospered by catering to the increasing sophistication of Chinese shoppers. Big global brands such as Nike, Prada and Levi\u2019s use JD.com\u2019s sales platform to reach the country\u2019s burgeoning middle class, and the company is closely watched as an indicator of consumer confidence.A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department said Mr. Liu was released \u201cpending formal complaint.\u201d Spokesman John Elder said the police could have held Mr. Liu in custody through Tuesday, but did not feel that was necessary while they conducted their investigation.The police will, after the investigation, recommend to prosecutors whether Mr. Liu should be charged with a misdemeanor or felony or face no charges, at which point the case would be closed.The company said that Mr. Liu\u2019s trip would continue as planned, but a spokeswoman declined to comment further. When asked when Mr. Liu would return to China, the spokeswoman said she did not have that information. Mr. Liu did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Liu has not been charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing in that case. But he tried to get an Australian court to prevent the release of his name in connection with the case by citing potential damage to his marriage and business, court documents show. In July, a judge in Australia rejected his request for a suppression order.JD.com is a heavyweight in China\u2019s technology scene, and Mr. Liu, its chairman and chief executive since its 2004 founding, is one of its leading lights. Legal troubles for Mr. Liu could darken perceptions overall of JD.com, whose shares trade on the Nasdaq stock market in New York and have a market value of around $50 billion.The company competes with Alibaba, the country\u2019s largest e-commerce provider, for the attention of China\u2019s increasingly affluent middle class, and says it has more than 300 million customers. It specializes in electronics such as smartphones and appliances.Alibaba and JD.com are both trying to lure high-end global brands to open virtual stores on their sales platforms. Alibaba says it has more than 570 million customers across its Chinese marketplaces.Whereas Alibaba operates platforms on which outside merchants sell their wares to consumers, JD.com\u2019s business model is more like Amazon\u2019s. It typically buys products from manufacturers and stores them in its own warehouses. JD.com has also invested in its own logistics network, which the company says helps provide quicker, more reliable delivery than Alibaba can offer. The company\u2019s major shareholders include Google and the Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent.For many companies with shops on the platform, JD.com offers a way into an exciting market. China\u2019s dramatic economic rise has meant that hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers are no longer content with shoddily made goods, and are ready to pay more for quality.But as the economy has shown signs of a slowdown in recent months, JD.com has suffered too. Last month it reported disappointing financial results, citing increasing competition.China\u2019s technology scene is young \u2014 many of its most influential companies were founded only in the past two decades \u2014 and company founders like Mr. Liu tend to retain outsize influence on their businesses, even as they grow large and list on public stock exchanges. Founders control voting rights and have ultimate say in matters large and small. Their personalities seep into the corporate culture.Mr. Liu was born in a poor part of Jiangsu Province in eastern China in the 1970s. When he earned a place at the prestigious Renmin University in Beijing, other people in the village scraped together cash and boiled eggs to sustain him in the capital.In the past, Mr. Liu has spent one day a year wearing JD.com\u2019s red uniform, riding an electric bike and making home deliveries. He likes to say that as the son of a poor family, he wants to treat his employees with fairness and respect.Raymond Zhong reported from Beijing, and Li Yuan from Hong Kong.

But just give me the right grand Chinese opera house and I\u2019ll gladly suffer through \u201cMemory.\u201dEnter my pilgrimage to see those dancing and singing cats.\u201cCats\u201d (performed in English) has set up its feline junkyard for two weeks at the Guangzhou Opera House, Zaha Hadid\u2019s $200 million architectural masterpiece. A two-hour train ride from Hong Kong to the city of a mere 15 million was my newest weekend quest for culture. Tickets were easy to purchase on a comprehensive website with an English-language option. Simplicity goes a long way.I\u2019ve even tried to meld the worlds that collide here. I recently attended a student production of \u201cThe Threepenny Opera\u201d in Cantonese (with, mercifully, English subtitles). I never thought I\u2019d miss the nuance and subtlety of the German language. Then there was the time I tried Cantonese opera (without, mercilessly, English subtitles) and wondered what on earth I was thinking. A cultural experience is fine for about 15 minutes if you don\u2019t know the language. Then you start to feel like a monolingual loser.These journeys to English-language theater or the wordless comfort of symphony music and dance have helped devoid my cultural void. But more deeply, my nearly two years here have made me realize what culture means on a purely emotional level. It is a connection, if nothing else, to one\u2019s native language, even if you\u2019re reading subtitles in English but connecting to Italian (read: Latin) words from a language class from your youth. And many of us urban denizens \u2014 often single and far from our families \u2014 depend on the arts for a certain level of fulfillment. Loneliness and big-city disconnection melt away in the presence of great art.O.K., so I\u2019ll admit that I may be overstating what I can get out of seeing \u201cCats\u201d in China, but the Guangzhou Opera House and its opulent cousins give me that sense of wonder and excitement about the future of the arts across our planet.

But they\u2019re not as a clever as you are. At least not yet.My name is Cade Metz, and here at The New York Times I cover emerging technologies, which is a fancy term for cool stuff that is probably not as cool as you think it is. My stock example: driverless cars.Driverless cars are very cool. They\u2019re a little less cool when they\u2019re trying to make an unprotected left-hand turn against oncoming traffic and they just sit there because, unlike human drivers, they don\u2019t realize that there comes a time when you just have to go. Much the same applies to robots in general.At times, you can\u2019t help but think of these mechanical creations as living things. The company will start selling one of them, a doglike robot called SpotMini, in the coming year. But even Boston Dynamics is not quite sure what these robots are actually good for.Robots play tricks on the mind. We tend to think they are more advanced than they really are, perhaps because of science fiction movies or because our brains are wired to believe in bots. This is particularly true when it comes to the biomimetic machines inside a lab like Boston Dynamics.\u201cWhen we see a biped that looks like a person or a quadruped that looks like a dog, we project our previous experiences with people and dogs onto these machines. But, in fact, there is nothing inside,\u201d said Gill Pratt, who worked with Boston Dynamics as an official at Darpa, a research arm of the Defense Department, and is now exploring new forms of robotics as the chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute. \u201cIt is like a hollow doll.\u201dKeep that in mind as you think about any other robot.The week I visited Boston Dynamics, I spent time with about 25 other roboticists \u2014 which was not hard in the Boston area.

{"Headline": "Facebook Accused of Allowing Bias Against Women in Job Ads", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe job seekers, in collaboration with the Communications Workers of America and the American Civil Liberties Union, filed charges with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday against Facebook and nine employers.The employers appear to have used Facebook\u2019s targeting technology to exclude women from the users who received their advertisements, which highlighted openings for jobs like truck driver and window installer. The charges were filed on behalf of any women who searched for a job on Facebook during roughly the past year.Debra Katz, a Washington-based employment lawyer not involved in the case, said the advertising campaigns appeared to violate federal law, which forbids employers and employment agencies like recruiting firms to discriminate on the basis of gender, among other categories. Some state laws also forbid aiding and abetting discrimination.\u201cThat seems pretty egregious,\u201d said Ms. Katz, who specializes in bringing discrimination cases. She said Facebook\u2019s technology made it akin to an employment agency. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re using this tool to facilitate discrimination absolves neither the hiring business nor Facebook.\u201d\u201cThere is no place for discrimination on Facebook; it\u2019s strictly prohibited in our policies,\u201d said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe are reviewing the complaint and look forward to defending our practices.\u201dThe lawyers involved in the case said they discovered the targeting by supervising a group of workers who performed job searches through their Facebook accounts and clicked on a variety of employment ads. For each ad, the job seekers opened a standard Facebook disclosure explaining why they received it. The disclosure for the problematic ads said the users received them because they were men, often between a certain age and in a certain location.For example, the Facebook disclosure for an ad by Nebraska Furniture Mart of Texas seeking staff members to \u201cassemble and prepare merchandise for delivery\u201d said the company wanted to reach men 18 to 50 who lived in or were recently near Fort Worth. The lawyers and their team collected the ads between October 2017 and August 2018.The New York Times contacted three of the employers to inquire about the allegations. Two of them, Renewal by Andersen, which sells and installs windows and doors, and Defenders, which sells and installs home security systems, declined to comment. Nebraska Furniture Mart did not respond.In principle, the companies could have simultaneously aimed similar ads at women, but they do not appear to have done so, according to the lawyers involved. Some conceded that they had directed the ads only at men, and some promised to stop doing so, according to Peter Romer-Friedman, counsel at Outten & Golden, one of the lawyers in the case.LinkedIn and Google also generally allow advertisers to exclude men or women from receiving ads. LinkedIn said in a statement that it would take down job ads that exclude a gender; Google said it would remove ads that discriminated against a protected class but declined to say if it would take down ads like those in the Facebook case. Facebook said that it was still reviewing the ads but that it generally did not take down job ads that exclude a gender.In practice, Facebook, with its more than two billion monthly active users, can be the most important tool for reaching certain types of workers, such as hourly workers, who often do not use other platforms like LinkedIn and sometimes do not even have r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.Bobbi Spees, a 35-year-old mother of three from Smethport, Pa., who is one of those bringing the charges, said that she was a part-time job coach for special-education students and that she had sought a better-paying position.Ms. Spees spent several years in her 20s working at a container factory where, she said, the pay was roughly two to three times what she currently makes and her health coverage was impeccable. She said she would like to find a similar job and had used Facebook actively for her search but had difficulty finding leads.By contrast, Ms. Spees said, her husband saw numerous ads for high-paying manual jobs when he was searching online for a job two to three years ago.\u201cIt really came to my attention that I was seeing hardly any jobs offered other than home health and stuff like that,\u201d Ms. Spees said in an interview.In a sense, Ms. Spees was lucky to receive such intelligence from her husband. More often, said Galen Sherwin of the A.C.L.U., her lawyer, \u201cpeople don\u2019t know they\u2019re not seeing an ad.\u201dLawyers for the workers in the case argue that Facebook is an employment agency and therefore liable for the discriminatory targeting because it is an active participant in the recruiting campaign rather than a passive publisher of content like a traditional newspaper with a classified section.Pauline Kim, a professor of employment law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the question was more ambiguous, hinging on the extent to which Facebook uses its algorithms to match an ad with a particular subgroup.\u201cThe more it gets into the use of these algorithms to really start narrowing down the matching, the more it moves toward looking like an employment agency,\u201d Ms. Kim said. But she said that how far a platform like Facebook must move down that path before it is considered an employment agency remains \u201can open question.\u201dTo show culpability, the lawyers in the case point out that Facebook requires advertisers to indicate which gender they want their ads to reach, and that two of the three choices for this category \u2014 male only and female only \u2014 are illegal for employment ads. (Only the third choice, \u201call,\u201d would past muster under federal anti-discrimination law.)Even if Facebook argues successfully that it is not an employment agency, future plaintiffs could bring complaints under state laws, such as California\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act, that bar aiding and abetting employment discrimination \u2014 a more liberal standard.Traditionally, Facebook\u2019s strongest defense has been the Communications Decency Act, a federal law that includes a provision shielding internet companies from liability for content generated by third parties.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon Sets Its Sights on the $88 Billion Online Ad Market", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVerizon doesn\u2019t sell its mobile phones or wireless plans over Amazon. Nor does it offer Fios, its high-speed internet service. But Verizon does advertise on Amazon.On Black Friday last year, when millions of online shoppers took to Amazon in search of deals, a Verizon ad for a Google Pixel 2 phone \u2014 buy one and get a second one half off \u2014 could be seen blazing across Amazon\u2019s home page. And on July 16, what Amazon calls Prime Day, an event with special deals for its Prime customers, Verizon again ran a variety of ads and special offers for Amazon shoppers, like a mix-and-match unlimited service plan.Amazon, which has already reshaped and dominated the online retail landscape, is quickly gathering momentum in a new, highly profitable arena: online advertising, where it is rapidly emerging as a major competitor to Google and Facebook.The push by the giant online retailer means consumers \u2014 even Prime customers, who pay $119 a year for access to free shipping as well as streaming music, video and discounts \u2014 are likely to be confronted by ads in places where they didn\u2019t exist before.In late August, some gamers were angered when Twitch, a video game streaming service acquired by Amazon in 2014, said it would soon no longer be ad-free for Prime members unless consumers paid an additional $8.99 a month for a premium service called Twitch Turbo.Amazon derives the bulk of its annual revenue, forecast to be $235 billion this year, from its e-commerce business, selling everything from books to lawn furniture. Amazon is also a leader in the cloud computing business, with Amazon Web Services, which accounts for around 11 percent of its revenue but more than half of its operating income. But in the company\u2019s most recent financial results, it was a category labeled \u201cother\u201d that caught the attention of many analysts. It mostly consists of revenue from selling banner, display and keyword search-driven ads known as \u201csponsored products.\u201d That category surged by about 130 percent to $2.2 billion in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2017.Much of online advertising relies on imprecise algorithms that govern where marketing messages appear, and what impact they have on actual sales. Here, Amazon has a big advantage over its competitors. Thanks to its wealth of data and analytics on consumer shopping habits, it can put ads in front of people when they are more likely to be hunting for specific products and to welcome them as suggestions rather than see them as intrusions.\u201cGoogle and Facebook have been slow to create the standards that advertisers want to see,\u201d said Collin Colburn, an analyst at the research and advisory firm Forrester. \u201cThey are concerned about what sort of content their ads are going to be placed next to.\u201dHe added, \u201cAmazon is different because it has a much more controlled environment on its e-commerce site where the products are being sold, and Amazon\u2019s reach into the rest of the World Wide Web is pretty small.\u201dAmazon has sold some forms of advertising for years, including sponsored product listings tied to search keywords on its site, and ads on properties it owns like IMDb and Zappos. The company will also sell advertising spots on the Thursday-night National Football League games it live-streams to Prime customers this fall.But some analysts who follow the company closely say Amazon is now focusing more on advertising, rapidly hiring and building out its capabilities in a business with high profit margins for Google and Facebook.In turn, brands are increasingly recognizing Amazon\u2019s vast customer reach, particularly to its more than 100 million Prime subscribers. In a study conducted last summer by Catalyst, the search and social media marketing company, only 15 percent of the 250 brands marketers polled felt they were making the most out of advertising on Amazon\u2019s platform, and 63 percent of the companies already advertising there said they planned to increase their budget in the coming year.Many big brands that sell products on Amazon have increased their advertising on the site this year, including General Mills, Hershey and Unilever, according to an analysis of display ads by the research firm Gartner L2.But the bigger surprise is the increase in advertising on Amazon by companies, like Verizon, AT&T and the insurer Geico, that don\u2019t directly sell any product or service on the site. In the first half of 2018, Geico ran six times as many display ads as it did during the same period last year, according to Oweise Khazi, associate director of Amazon IQ research at Gartner L2. (Geico declined to comment.)Verizon said the reason for its increased advertising spending on Amazon was simple: It\u2019s where the shoppers are.\u201cThey have people who are in a shopping mind-set, so that\u2019s valuable for Verizon to be seen as a resource within that mind-set,\u201d said John Nitti, the chief media officer at Verizon.Thanks to the vast amount of data Amazon collects from its customers, it can target ads not only to basic demographics \u2014 say, women over the age of 35 \u2014 but to a more precise segment of customers who are likely to be shopping for cellphones or barbecue grills.Amazon is not just selling ads online. For Verizon, the opportunities to advertise over Amazon may increase as the e-commerce giant continues to build its internal media group and opens new advertising spots on various platforms or devices. Verizon, for instance, will soon be running a test: It will put Fios advertisements on Amazon packages being delivered to ZIP codes where Verizon offers the service.In many cases, the advertising dollars that are moving to Amazon are being diverted from other digital players.In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Levi\u2019s said the company had increased its marketing investment across all channels, including television, traditional digital and newer digital platforms, including Amazon.For some brands, the increased spending is most likely directly linked to increased competition on Amazon\u2019s platform from Amazon itself. As Amazon introduces more of its own private-label goods, many companies are expanding their advertising spending to raise the visibility of their products.On a recent afternoon, a consumer who typed \u201ccereal\u201d into the search bar of Amazon\u2019s browser would first see an ad for JoyBol, followed by similar ads for General Mills\u2019 Corn Chex and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. But just below those ads, in a box labeled \u201cTop Rated From Our Brands,\u201d a number of cereals from 365 Everyday Value were featured. That is the private label of the grocer Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in 2017.General Mills declined to comment.Kellogg Company, which faces much of the same competition, said it had been generally shifting advertising dollars toward digital platforms.\u201cWith Amazon\u2019s platform now being a leader in many elements of advertising \u2014 including, for many categories, search \u2014 it makes sense for part of those ad dollars to be allocated there,\u201d said Monica McGurk, Kellogg\u2019s chief revenue and e-commerce officer, in an emailed response to questions.But for Kellogg\u2019s, what sets advertising on Amazon\u2019s platform apart from others, like Google or Twitter, is the online retailer\u2019s data.\u201cWe can reach the right consumer at the right time using their wealth of data to target,\u201d Ms. McGurk said. \u201cOther traditional digital platforms do not have the level of purchase data that Amazon has on their customers.\u201dAnalysts say some brands, however, particularly those whose products now face competition from Amazon private-label goods, remain reluctant to advertise on the e-commerce giant\u2019s platform.\u201cI do hear some brands saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want to work with Amazon too much because they\u2019re going to get too much information from us,\u201d said Will Margaritis, a vice president for e-commerce at the ad agency 360i. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s overthinking it. Amazon has enough data to understand everything about any category it wants to be in.\u201dSapna Maheshwari contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That\u2019s Changing.", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySurfacingAt Defcon, one of the world\u2019s largest hacking conferences, new pressures are reshaping the community\u2019s attitudes toward privacy and anonymity.LAS VEGAS \u2014 Ask any hacker who\u2019s been around long enough, and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll hear an archetypal story, tinged with regret, about the first time his or her real identity was publicly disclosed.Dead Addict\u2019s version of the story involves an employer who pushed him to apply for a patent \u2014 for which he was required to provide his full legal name. \u201cThe people who later doxxed me,\u201d he said, using a term for publishing private information about someone, usually with malicious intent, \u201cpointed to that patent.\u201dNico Sell managed to stay \u201cungoogleable,\u201d she said, until around 2012, when, acting as chief executive of a secure-messaging company, Wickr, she felt she needed to become more of a public figure \u2014 if reluctantly. \u201cMy co-founders and I, we all drew straws,\u201d she said, \u201cand that was that.\u201dI met Grifter, whose real name is Neil Wyler; Dead Addict, who, citing privacy concerns, spoke with me on the condition that I not share his real name; Nico Sell, which, while undeniably the name she uses publicly, may or may not be her legal name; and dozens of other self-described hackers in August at Defcon, an annual hacking convention \u2014 one of the world\u2019s largest \u2014 held in Las Vegas.But new pressures, especially for those who attend Defcon, seem to be reshaping the community\u2019s attitudes toward privacy and anonymity. Many longtime hackers, like Ms. Sell and Mr. Wyler, have been drawn into the open by corporate demands, or have traded their anonymity for public roles as high-level cybersecurity experts. Others alluded to the ways in which a widespread professionalization and gamification of the hacking world \u2014 as evidenced by so-called bug bounty programs offered by companies like Facebook and Google, which pay (often handsomely) for hackers to hunt for and disclose cybersecurity gaps on their many platforms \u2014 have legitimized certain elements of the culture.\u201cThis is a profession for a lot of people now,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t fill out a W-9 with your hacker handle.\u201dMr. Moss, perhaps the epitome of a hacker who has jettisoned anonymity and entered the public sphere, has had an evolving relationship with aliases. Like many of his early online friends, he was interested in hacking and phone phreaking (the manipulation of telecommunications systems) \u2014 \u201cstuff that wasn\u2019t really legal,\u201d he said. Aliases provided cover for such activity. And every once in a while, he explained \u2014 if a friend let slip your name, or if you outgrew a juvenile, silly alias \u2014 you\u2019d have to burn your identity and come up with a new name.\u201cIn my case, I had a couple previous identities,\u201d he said, \u201cbut when I changed to The Dark Tangent, I was making a clear break from my past. I\u2019d learned how to manage identities; I\u2019d learned how the scene worked.\u201dHe also remembers when everything changed. During the dot-com boom, many hackers transitioned to \u201creal jobs,\u201d he said, \u201cand so they had to have real names, too.\u201d\u201cMy address book doubled in size,\u201d he said with a laugh. And in time, as Defcon\u2019s popularity ballooned, his list of formal appointments grew, too: membership at the Council on Foreign Relations, a seat on President Obama\u2019s Homeland Security Advisory Council.For Mr. Harewood, maintaining his alias is partly about creating a personal brand \u2014 a retro nod, in a sense, to the era when using a hacker handle was a more essential element of the trade. But it also has practical advantages. \u201cPeople want to reach out all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still not all that comfortable communicating with people on my Facebook profile, under my real name.\u201d\u201cIn a way,\u201d he said, \u201cit just helps me filter my communications.\u201d\u201cI came up with it a couple years ago, when I first got included in a news article,\u201d he said. \u201cI think an alias helps you get more recognition \u2014 sort of like how The Dark Tangent has his.\u201d\u201cP0wnyb0y is shorter and catchier than my name,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it just seems a lot cooler.\u201dEmmett said his involvement with Defcon \u2014 he has attended for several years, accompanied by his father \u2014 has left him skeptical about the degree to which his peers share things online. \u201cMy friends put everything up on the internet,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m more mindful.\u201d Still, he said he wasn\u2019t invested in keeping his real name separate from his alias. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as the end of the world\u201d if people can easily link the two, he said. \u201cBut some other people take that stuff more seriously.\u201dThat\u2019s not to say, though, that the younger generations of hackers are all comfortable operating so openly. Ms. Sell\u2019s daughter, who spoke with me on the condition that I refer to her by her hacking handle, CyFi, was especially guarded about her identity.\u201cWhen I was 9, I discovered a class of zero-day vulnerabilities,\u201d said CyFi, who is now 17, referring to software bugs that developers are unaware of. She ultimately disclosed the bugs, she added, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t want to risk being sued by all those companies \u2014 so hiding my identity was the best way to go.\u201dAs with Emmett, CyFi is wary of her generation\u2019s penchant for oversharing online. \u201cMy friends have definitely been frustrated with my lack of social media,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the less data there is about you out in the world, the less people can try to mess with you.\u201dOne of the most intriguing aspects of Defcon is the relationship between the hacker community and the attendees from the federal government, the complexities of which have ebbed and flowed over time. For many years, the tension resulted in a cat-and-mouse game called \u201cSpot the Fed.\u201d\u201cIn the early days, if a fed got spotted, it was pretty consequential,\u201d Mr. Moss said. \u201cLater on, they were outing each other,\u201d he said with a laugh \u2014 because they wanted the T-shirt granted to both the fed and the person who outed them.Mr. Wells said that governmental officials who attend Defcon fall into one of three categories. \u201cOne was the people who openly announced they were feds \u2014 either speakers who announced their affiliations, or there was a Meet the Fed panel,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were others who wouldn\u2019t deny it if you asked them, but who didn\u2019t go out of their way to advertise it. And then there were those who were either officially or unofficially undercover.\u201dThe relationship hasn\u2019t always been contentious, he added, noting that, in 2012, Keith Alexander, who was then director of the N.S.A., \u201ccame out here and spoke in a T-shirt and bluejeans.\u201d Less than a year later, though, after the Edward Snowden leak, things soured. \u201cFor the next couple years,\u201d Mr. Wells said, \u201cthe feds were \u2014 well, if not uninvited, then at least tacitly not particularly welcome.\u201d\u201cIt probably helped their agenda \u2014 by having these kids show up with fake names,\u201d said Mr. Grand, who sat for an interview at Defcon. \u201cIt probably made it that much more intriguing.\u201d\u201cBut using our handles,\u201d he added, \u201cwas our natural way of communicating. And having that protection, it felt good. We were putting ourselves out there as hackers communicating with the government \u2014 which, at the time, was not something you did.\u201dAs with many longtime hackers, Mr. Grand \u2014 who became widely known after appearing on a Discovery Channel show called \u201cPrototype This!\u201d \u2014 has grown more comfortable operating in the open. But he still appreciates the value of anonymity. \u201cHiding behind a fake name doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doing something malicious, and it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a bad person,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means you\u2019re trying to protect your privacy.\u201d\u201cAnd, in this day and age, you need to,\u201d he added,\u00a0\u201cbecause everywhere you look, your privacy is being stripped away.\u201d\u201cMore and more people who started hacking in the \u201990s are now becoming icons and thought leaders \u2014 and, most importantly, role models for the younger generations of hackers,\u201d she said.To help guide younger generations, elder hackers can often still use nicknames, she added. \u201cBut sometimes it makes it more powerful when they can speak up in their own voices.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy Loosens Vaccine Law Just as Children Return to School", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 For years, the anti-establishment Five Star Movement has spread confusion about vaccines.Its co-founder raised links between vaccines and autism. Its political leader campaigned against a law making vaccines obligatory. Its myriad websites drew traffic with posts by vaccine skeptics, and its party representatives blamed vaccines for tumors and allergies. For one senator, vaccine scars were \u201cbranding for beasts.\u201dOn Thursday, as school began this past week around Italy, the Five Star Movement and its coalition partner, the League, passed a measure that allows children to stay in school as long as their parents attest that they have been vaccinated, or will be by March. No doctor\u2019s note is required.Critics consider the decree a dangerous, and purely political, measure that creates chaos in the school system, increases the risk to classmates with autoimmune deficiencies and tempts a public health crisis.Only a year ago, the number of measles cases in Italy climbed to 5,006 in 2017, from 843 in 2016. Last year, Italy had Europe\u2019s third-highest per capita rate of measles after much-poorer Romania and Greece. Mexico has recommended that its citizens be vaccinated before traveling to Italy.Italy is perhaps the most acute case of a contagion of another kind spreading in Europe and the West \u2014 one in which populist politics, misinformation and psuedo-science on the internet have combined with an anti-establishment mood in which experts are not to be trusted.But now the populist forces that have fueled that trend hold power, and must deal with the consequences affecting the public health and security of citizens.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the anti-establishment drift,\u201d said Beatrice Lorenzin, the health minister in the previous, center-left government and the namesake of the 2017 law making vaccines obligatory. \u201cBecause everything is a caste, also science becomes a caste. But science is the last bastion, when you have minimized the authority of science, there is nothing else.\u201dFacing an increase in measles cases and a decade-long erosion of trust in vaccines, the prior Italian government required that children receive 10 vaccinations before enrolling in school. The law came into force this year.But this summer, Ms. Lorenzin\u2019s successor in the new populist government, Giulia Grillo of the Five Star Movement, sought to loosen the requirements, at one point offering something she called \u201cflexible obligation.\u201d Ms. Grillo, who declined to comment for this article, finally settled on the extension for students without proof of vaccination.\u201cNothing has changed; it\u2019s exactly like it was,\u201d Rocco Casalino, the spokesman for the Five Star Movement, said after the law was approved on Thursday \u2014 raising the question of why, then, it was passed at all.On Thursday, Five Star senators said they would next seek to undo the vaccine law altogether.\u201cUnfortunately, the state has diffused ambiguous information that can confuse the parents who are trying to decide whether or not to vaccinate their kids,\u201d said Roberto Burioni, a leading immunologist at Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele and a b\u00eate noire of the anti-vaccine movement. (One mother posted a Facebook message saying she hoped he\u2019d drowned on his summer vacation.)\u201cThe state should be clear, and be clearly on the part of science,\u201d Mr. Burioni said.The measles vaccine, which over the past 50 years has helped eliminate the disease in the United States, was introduced in Italy in 1976. The percentage of coverage climbed steadily to more than 90 percent in 2003. But the obligation was eased in 1999, Ms. Lorenzin said, because Italy had mistakenly believed it had ingrained the belief in science and vaccines into the culture.Instead, she said, the opposite happened. She attributed the surge of distrust in vaccines to the fact that the diseases had become so rare as to seem unreal, to the debacle of a since-rejected and retracted report in the scientific journal The Lancet linking vaccines to autism, and to what she called \u201cDoctor Google.\u201dBy 2015, coverage had declined to about 85 percent. Cases of measles, which can cause blindness, brain inflammation, pneumonia and in some cases death, have been rising.Italy\u2019s \u201cNo-Vax\u201d movement has risen, too. In Rimini, a hotbed of No-Vax activity and the site of a 2012 ruling by a local judge, later overturned, that linked autism to vaccines, anti-vaccination advocates attached streamers to planes that read, \u201cEveryone to School. Freedom of Choice.\u201dIn Veneto, the governor, Luca Zaia of the League, has promoted a \u201cpersonalized\u201d approach to evaluating vaccinations. Families have organized a secluded \u201cschool in the woods\u201d for unvaccinated children, while others have met in private homes.Ms. Lorenzin said that if she were still the health minister, she would send the police to break up the illegal schools. \u201cIt\u2019s a chemical bomb,\u201d she said.Mattia Marchi, a spokesman for the Veneto chapter of Corveleva, a No-Vax umbrella group, said parents skeptical of vaccines still had little choice but to vaccinate.\u201cNo one ever said that a vaccine causes autism,\u201d Mr. Marchi said. \u201cBut if a thousand people see a U.F.O., do we want to tell these people that they are crazy or do we want to find a solution?\u201dLast week, Federico Aliberti, an artisan, came from Livorno to Rome with his 3-year-old son to protest the required vaccination of all Italian nursery and school children.Mr. Aliberti, who voted for Five Star, said he resented the \u201carrogance\u201d of scientists who presumed to understand something as complicated as the human immune system. His Facebook feed, he said, had been filled with clips of Five Star politicians promising personal choice, as well as articles and videos about the pharmaceutical interests behind vaccines and the vaccines\u2019 supposed connections to cancers and autism.The government, he said, had given him hope but, even with the new measure, delivered only \u201ca stab in the back.\u201dIndeed, for years, the Five Star Movement, and more recently, the League, had given him something to believe in.Beppe Grillo, the co-founder of the Five Star Movement, has raised a link between vaccines and autism, suggested that vaccines weaken the immune systems of healthy children, and claimed that the pharmaceutical industry has pushed them for profit. Members of the party in the European Parliament have proposed eliminating some obligatory vaccinations for some public employees and professed a link between leukemia, tumors, allergies and autism to vaccinations.In another instance, they raised concerns that vaccines might be dangerous for possessing metals. The party\u2019s mayor in Livorno called the obligation to vaccinate \u201cintolerable,\u201d while others in Puglia invited people to a hearing by doctors who believed eating nuts was more effective than vaccines in preventing illnesses.Last February, Paola Taverna, a prominent Five Star senator, fondly recalled \u201cparading to her cousin\u2019s\u201d house to catch whatever disease was going around as a preferable option to vaccines, which she compared to \u201cbranding for beasts \u201d (This week, though, Ms. Taverna said she would have her own child vaccinated.)In July, a regional council member in the Five Star Movement from Lazio presented a proposal requiring students to go into quarantine for four to six weeks after receiving their vaccinations. The member, Davide Barillari, also called for an \u201cinformational\u201d stage about the \u201ccausal correlations\u201d between vaccines and pathologies for parents who sought vaccines in clinics. \u201cPolitics comes before science,\u201d he said.Davide Casaleggio, the powerful son of the party\u2019s other co-founder, who many believe controls the web platforms upon which the party functions, wrote on his blog that the Five Star Movement \u201ctotally distances itself\u201d from Mr. Barillari\u2019s statements.\u201cIt was to draw traffic and advertising, on the theme of health,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a lot of consensus around it, but when the party got bigger and it became uncomfortable, they distanced themselves.\u201dDuring the campaign, as the candidates raised questions about vaccines, the party\u2019s leaders made sure to always say they were not against vaccines. They did so again after passing Thursday\u2019s law.Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League, Five Star\u2019s coalition partner, apparently wanted to get in on the anti-vaccination action as he built his own populist movement.In March 2013, Mr. Salvini seemed unbothered about vaccines when he wrote on Twitter that his daughter Mirta had received her first vaccinations. \u201cShe laughed, mom was the most worried,\u201d he wrote.Two years later, in October 2015, when he was still closer to the political margins, he seemed to test the political power of the issue. \u201cObligatory vaccinations, sanctions on the doctors who advise against it. What do you think?\u201dTwo years after that, in April 2017, he asked, \u201cThe first Italian doctor who says NO to vaccines has been expelled. What do you think?\u201d Soon after he tweeted that he thought it was \u201cmad\u201d to impose so many vaccines. He insisted the choice should be left to parents.In subsequent Twitter posts he made it clear that he supported parents protesting in front of Rome\u2019s parliament building, that he was always on the side of \u201cfreedom of choice,\u201d and that he was suspicious of multinational corporations promoting vaccines.He also called for preventive pre-vaccine tests to ensure the vaccines would not harm the children.Such a test \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Ms. Lorenzin said. \u201cIt\u2019s misinformation.\u201dEmma Johanningsmeier contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Carmichael is an executive producer.\u201cI basically took everybody from \u2018The Carmichael Show\u2019 staff,\u201d Mr. Howery said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we just did a spinoff.\u201dLike \u201cThe Carmichael Show,\u201d \u201cRel\u201d takes inspiration from its eponymous creator\u2019s life and standup material. It is set on Chicago\u2019s West Side, where the comic, born Milton Howery, grew up, and will examine the challenges of long-distance parenting. (In the pilot, Rel is reeling from the discovery that his wife had an affair with his barber and has left town with their children.) \u201cRel\u201d isn\u2019t quite as heavy on the topical debates, however.\u201cWhile I may talk about social issues and politics in my stand up, Rel talks about his life and he tells a lot of stories,\u201d Mr. Carmichael said.In a phone interview, Mr. Howery and Mr. Carmichael discussed audience resistance to multicam sitcoms, debates around Louis C. K.\u2019s return to performing and casting Sinbad to play Rel\u2019s father. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.Did you have a specific audience in mind for \u201cRel\u201d?I think that\u2019s the audience we will attract, but it\u2019s so early; you don\u2019t know. One thing I love about him is that he was really able to articulate these specific experiences and people to a broad audience.Whenever I told people how good \u201cThe Carmichael Show\u201d was, so many of them were like, \u201cBut doesn\u2019t that have a laugh track?\u201d Two things. One: Everybody turns into a producer and just thinks it has a laugh track. They don\u2019t know what they are talking about. Two: We work hard for all of those laughs. If anything, I actually turned laughs down in the mix and I was always trying to control it so as not to disrupt the experience. It was filmed in front of an audience.Admittedly I had the same reservations, initially. It seemed regressive. But I wonder if certain types of black audiences are more open to that format than others.Critics couldn\u2019t see past the format for my show, initially. For \u201cCarmichael Show,\u201d ideally I would have held the pilot and sent them Episode 2 [in which the characters debate the merits of Black Lives Matter], but it\u2019s just the structure of how press works. By Episode 2 I think we really showed that it was, I think, one of the most current shows in any format. There are so many bad examples of multicam sitcoms and I get why people\u2019s image of it is a bit distorted or negative. Hopefully people realize you can make a thing good in any format.On \u201cThe Carmichael Show\u201d you took on Bill Cosby and many other highly topical subjects. Do you anticipate doing something similar on \u201cRel\u201d? Louis and Aziz are different, though \u2014 With Louis it seems like the question is, what has he done to atone for it? He admitted that he did what he was accused of, but when you think of the women \u2014 Yeah.Would you work with Louis in the future? One last question: How did Sinbad come into the picture?

{"Headline": "Twitter Bars Alex Jones and Infowars, Citing Harassing Messages", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Thursday, though, Twitter said it would permanently suspend Mr. Jones\u2019s account, as well as the account for Infowars. The social media company said Mr. Jones had posted messages within the previous 24 hours that violated its policies, which prohibit direct threats of violence and some forms of hate speech but allow deception or misinformation.\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold Jones to the same standard we hold to every account, not taking one-off actions to make us feel good in the short term, and adding fuel to new conspiracy theories,\u201d Mr. Dorsey tweeted in August.New followers are also crucial to Mr. Jones\u2019s business hawking nutritional supplements and survival gear, which help fund his Infowars operation. Without access to mainstream social-media sites, he will increasingly be speaking to his established audience that already goes directly to Infowars.com for his shows.Infowars did not respond to a request for comment. But Mr. Jones quickly found a way to make his anger about Twitter\u2019s decision known \u2014 on Twitter.Broadcasting on Thursday through the Periscope account of @WarRoomShow \u2014 which is the name of an online video show hosted by an Infowars colleague \u2014 Mr. Jones said: \u201cThey\u2019re scared of us. They\u2019re scared of the populist movement.\u201dHe added, \u201cThey know their bans of not just me but millions of other people have angered folks, so they\u2019re moving aggressively.\u201dPeriscope is Twitter\u2019s live-streaming video app. While Twitter\u2019s permanent ban affects the Periscope accounts for Infowars and Mr. Jones, the company temporarily suspended @WarRoomShow after Mr. Jones appeared on its broadcast. In a tweet, the company said it would take action \u201cif other accounts are utilized in an attempt to circumvent\u201d the ban of Mr. Jones and Infowars.\u201cThey are outright banning people, and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech,\u201d he said.The video of Mr. Jones\u2019s harassing behavior toward Mr. Darcy was among the material that Twitter considered before deciding on the bans, according to a person briefed on the situation, who was not authorized to speak publicly.In his Periscope broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Jones defended his behavior toward Mr. Darcy, saying the CNN reporter is a public figure and had bullied tech companies into barring Mr. Jones. He suggested, without evidence, that Twitter had barred him to protect CNN and Mr. Darcy because the news organization was part of a government conspiracy.\u201cCNN is part of this C.I.A. stay-behind network that I brought up, that Obama set up, that we\u2019re telling the president about,\u201d Mr. Jones said.Mr. Darcy referred requests for comment to a CNN spokeswoman, who declined to comment.Twitter said it had followed routine procedures in permanently suspending the accounts of Mr. Jones and Infowars. The company typically issues temporary suspensions, like the one Mr. Jones received last month, before enacting a ban.Mr. Jones is one of the most prominent alt-right figures to be barred from Twitter. In 2016, the company barred Milo Yiannopoulos, a former editor of Breitbart, for his involvement in an online harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Another former Breitbart writer, Chuck Johnson, was suspended for threats toward the civil rights activist DeRay Mckesson. Twitter also bars hate groups like the American Nazi Party and Golden Dawn, an ultranationalist organization based in Greece.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Germans Seek News, YouTube Delivers Far-Right Tirades", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe InterpreterThe man whose killing had set off the riots, they said, had died while trying to stop asylum seekers from molesting a local woman. And it wasn\u2019t just one local man who had been killed, but two. Could he comment?These sorts of accusations suddenly seemed to be everywhere. But none were true. They had come, Mr. Uhle and others suspected, from social media \u2014 particularly YouTube.The video, posted by an obscure fringe group, was rambling, and it appeared to be cheaply produced. Yet it had nearly half a million views \u2014 far more than any news video on the riots. How was that possible?Mr. Serrato scraped YouTube databases for information on every Chemnitz-related video published this year. He found that the platform\u2019s recommendation system consistently directed people toward extremist videos on the riots \u2014 then on to far-right videos on other subjects.Users searching for news on Chemnitz would be sent down a rabbit hole of misinformation and hate. And as interest in Chemnitz grew, it appears, YouTube funneled many Germans to extremist pages, whose view counts skyrocketed.Activists say this may have contributed to a flood of misinformation, helping extremists shape public perceptions even after they had been run off Chemnitz\u2019s streets.\u201cThis was new,\u201d Mr. Uhle said. \u201cIt\u2019s never happened to me before that mainstream media, big German newspapers and television channels, ask me about false news and propaganda that had clearly become so pervasive that people just bought it.\u201dResearchers who study YouTube say the episode, far from being isolated, reflects the platform\u2019s tendency to push everyday users toward politically extreme content \u2014 and, often, to keep them there.A YouTube spokeswoman declined to comment on the accusations, saying the recommendation system intended to \u201cgive people video suggestions that leave them satisfied.\u201d She said the company planned to work with news publishers to help \u201cbuild a better news experience on YouTube.\u201dThough YouTube has typically drawn less scrutiny than other social networks, that may be changing. Its parent company, Google, faced criticism from American lawmakers this week for declining to send its chief executive to congressional hearings attended by chief executives from Twitter and Facebook.YouTube\u2019s recommendation system is the core of its business strategy: Getting people to click on one more video means serving them more ads. The algorithm is sophisticated, constantly learning what keep users engaged. And it is powerful. A high ranking from the algorithm can mean huge audiences for a video.Mr. Serrato wondered if that explained how his family member had discovered the conspiracy video. He had read studies about users who blindly followed the recommendation system; inevitably, they seemed to end up watching long series of far-left or far-right videos.Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent social media researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has written that these findings suggest that YouTube could become \u201cone of the most powerful radicalizing instruments of the 21st century.\u201dBut, as Ms. Tufekci and other researchers stress, such experiments are anecdotal.Using YouTube\u2019s public developer interface, Mr. Serrato plugged in a dozen recent videos related to Chemnitz. For each, he scraped YouTube\u2019s recommendations for what to watch next. Then he did the same for those videos, and so on. Eventually, he identified a network of about 650 videos, nearly all from this year.The results, he said, were disturbing. The network showed a tight cluster of videos that Mr. Serrato identified as predominantly conspiracy theorist or far right.This was the first sign that YouTube\u2019s algorithm systemically directs users toward extremist content. A more neutral algorithm would most likely produce a few distinct clusters of videos \u2014 one of mainstream news coverage, another of conspiracy theories, another of extremist groups. Those who began in one cluster would tend to stay there.Instead, the YouTube recommendations bunched them all together, sending users through a vast, closed system composed heavily of misinformation and hate.Viewers who come to YouTube for down-the-middle news may quickly find themselves in a world of extremists, Mr. Serrato said.\u201cThat\u2019s what I found bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are they so close together, unless the aim is to trigger a reaction?\u201d Content that engages viewers\u2019 emotions or curiosity, he suspected, would hook them in.And it wasn\u2019t just that the platform directed people to unreliable videos about the subject they had sought out \u2014 in this case, Chemnitz.Many of the videos in Mr. Serrato\u2019s analysis were unrelated to Chemnitz. Some offered positive portrayals of white nationalism in general or of Alternative for Germany, a far-right political party. Others went further astray, detailing fringe conspiracies; one argues that President Trump is a pawn of the Rothschild banking family.Why would YouTube surface videos like these in a search for news stories?How many steps are there on YouTube\u2019s algorithm from news story to fever swamp? \u201cOnly two,\u201d Mr. Serrato said. \u201cBy the second, you\u2019re quite knee-deep in the alt-right.\u201dPerhaps most striking is what was absent. The algorithm rarely led back to mainstream news coverage, or to liberal or centrist videos on Chemnitz or any other topic. Once on the fringes, the algorithm tended to stay there, as if that had been the destination all along.Activists and residents in Chemnitz say far-right conspiracy theories seemed unusually common in the days before and after the demonstration.Mr. Flesch, who has 20,000 subscribers, operates in a political bubble. Yet his claims had filtered into the mainstream enough that journalists asked Mr. Uhle, the Chemnitz official, about them. How?And misinformation can travel in other ways. Some German officials said this week that a widely circulated video, appearing to show a far-right activist chasing a dark-skinned person during Chemnitz\u2019s riots, may have been faked.Thomas Hoffmann, who helps run a local refugee organization, was on a train from Hamburg when the riots broke out. So he searched YouTube for \u201cChemnitz\u201d and the date, hoping to follow the events.Instead, the platform returned obvious forgeries. One video of dark-skinned residents being attacked was edited to make them look like the aggressors. Others were interspersed with footage from previous rallies, to make this one look more peaceful than it was.\u201cIt was incredible how much blatantly doctored material there was,\u201d Mr. Hoffmann said. \u201cWhen you click on one video, whether you like it or not, another one is proposed that features content from far-right conspiracy theories.\u201dYouTube has been more cooperative with the German authorities about removing hate speech than other social media companies, said Flemming Ipsen, who tracks political extremism at Jugendschutz.net, a government-linked internet monitor.But some researchers consider YouTube to be unusually permissive about content that it does not consider overt hate speech, and its algorithm unusually aggressive in pushing users toward political fringes. YouTube also designates some content as borderline, neither blocking nor promoting it.YouTube says it does not code videos by political content, but rather by viewer interest. Critics say that leads the platform to surface fringe material that reliably wins more clicks.Mr. Serrato said that even while researching videos he found abhorrent, he was unable to resist.\u201cAs soon as I was on one of the videos, I thought, O.K., now I\u2019m going to watch the next one,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s YouTube\u2019s goal. I stay engaged, ads play. And it works.\u201dGuillaume Chaslot, a former engineer at YouTube\u2019s owner, Google, said that during and after high-profile political events like the demonstration in Chemnitz, extremism and misinformation often spike on the platform. But this reflects deeper tendencies in YouTube\u2019s algorithm, he said.\u201cThe example I like to cite is the flat-earth theory, because it\u2019s apolitical,\u201d Mr. Chaslot said. Videos claiming the earth is flat, he said, are \u201cstill going viral, still getting highly recommended by the YouTube algorithm, because it gets watch time.\u201dMr. Chaslot worked on YouTube\u2019s algorithm until 2013, when he was fired. Google has said he was fired for poor performance, Mr. Chaslot has cited disagreements over the company\u2019s direction.\u201cYouTube doesn\u2019t give you a straight representation of the world,\u201d Mr. Chaslot said. \u201cIt looks like reality, but it deforms reality, because it is biased toward watch time.\u201dEven in Germany, which has some of the toughest social media restrictions of any democracy, officials say they have little power to regulate the vast majority of social media content.\u201cLies, propaganda and manipulation are harmful for society, but on their own are not illegal \u2014 and so our hands are often tied,\u201d said Mr. Ipsen, of the government-linked internet monitor.German officials have urged social media companies to make their algorithms more transparent. American lawmakers have done the same, citing research linking social media to polarization, foreign meddling and hate speech.But the companies are refusing.\u201cThe algorithm is central to their business model,\u201d Mr. Ipsen said. \u201cAll we can do is remind them of their social responsibility.\u201dChristopher F.

{"Headline": "The Real Google Censorship Scandal ", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not about right-wing Americans. It\u2019s about China. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Breitbart News described the 2016 video as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d because it showed Sergey Brin, the Google co-founder, telling everyone how he felt about the new leader of the free world.Spoiler: Not good.\u201cMyself, as an immigrant, as a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do, too,\u201d he said in his flat, nasal voice. He was obviously rattled, as were the other top Google executives on stage with him. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values.\u201dConservatives who have been spreading the canard that social media companies oppress their views \u2014 a drum Mr. Trump has himself been banging on lately \u2014 seized on the video as proof of Google\u2019s bias. But it should not have shocked anyone to find that Mr. Brin, a Russian exile who built the quirkiest of companies on the planet, is no fan of the president.Responding to the attack on its motives, a Google spokeswoman said, \u201cNothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.\u201d Blah blah blah. I don\u2019t mean to be cavalier. But I am astonished by the focus on this ridiculous scandal when a much more important issue concerning Google and censorship has been largely ignored by the public and by Washington.I\u2019m talking about the fact that Google is considering re-entering the Chinese market after leaving it with a lot of righteous indignation less than a decade ago. Reports say it might once again offer a range of services, including a censored version of its flagship search engine. A Google spokeswoman told me that the controversial effort \u2014 code-named Dragonfly \u2014 is \u201cexploratory,\u201d and that Google is \u201cnot close to launching a search product in China.\u201d What\u2019s most interesting is that much of the outrage about the possibility seems to be coming from Google employees who have registered strong objections, rather than from outside.For those who don\u2019t know the history, Google began operating in China in 2000 and in 2005 the Microsoft tech leader Kai-Fu Lee was hired as the head of Google China. By 2009 Google controlled more than 36 percent of the market share and served hundreds of millions of mainland Chinese users.It offered a truncated version of a search product, which included this disclaimer at the bottom of the page: \u201cSome results have been withheld because of the government restrictions.\u201d Google\u2019s justification for being there was that bringing more information to the information-starved Chinese was a good thing.\u201cAt least Chinese users knew what they were missing,\u201d Nicole Wong, a former top Google lawyer, recently explained to me on my podcast.The hope was that more information could help loosen the government\u2019s stranglehold. That did not happen.By 2010, Google was fed up with increasing repression and intrusions into its systems by Chinese-government-backed hackers. After a prolonged debate, Google withdrew to Hong Kong with a noncensored offering and was effectively out of the larger Chinese market. \u201cOur objection is to those forces of totalitarianism,\u201d Mr. Brin said at the time. He also wrote on his Google Plus page that the \u201cprimary threat by far to internet freedom is government filtering of political dissent.\u201d This rejection of censorship was a bold stance, setting Google apart from other companies, like Apple, that had compromised with the Chinese government in order to do business there.Fast forward to today, when Google is being falsely accused of censoring speech in the United States, when what it is really doing is mulling a return to censorship in China.If this makes you pause, it should, and Washington politicians should take all their sanctimony and direct it at the China issue, which actually deserves some scrutiny. Perhaps that is the real reason Google avoided sending its current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, to the recent Senate hearings, so he could avoid explaining what it was thinking when it came China 2.0: Now With 100 Percent More Hypocrisy.Google seems to have no problem climbing down off its high horse to grab the thing it needs in China.Which is, simply put, more data.That is what Ms. Wong and Dr. Lee, whom I also did a podcast interview with this week, suggested to me was the key impetus for the move.Right now, he notes, with China\u2019s aggressive use of sensors and you-say-facial-recognition-I-say-surveillance, a population hooked on mobile in a much more significant way than here and consumers more willing to trade away their privacy for digital convenience, China\u2019s internet companies have access to 10 to 15 times more data than American ones. Dr. Lee and others have called it a \u201cdata gap\u201d that Google has to bridge, and soon, if it wants to remain competitive.Ms. Wong agrees, noting that doing otherwise might give China the advantage in the next computing era.It\u2019s certainly a far cry from what he wrote with great emotion back in 2012 about leaving China:\u201cRegardless of how you feel about digital ecosystems or about Google, please do not take the free and open internet for granted from government intervention. To the extent that free flow of information threatens the powerful, those in power will seek to suppress it.\u201dWell said, Mr. Brin. Say it again.Advertisement"}

In recent years, the firm has struggled to produce the same successes. After the dot-com bust, Kleiner missed the initial wave of social networking start-ups and focused on putting money into technologies that would help the environment, in what turned into a costly detour. Over time, other venture firms have risen and garnered more buzz.With the new firm, Ms. Meeker said, she and her partners plan to invest in mature technology start-ups, with the potential to seek more deals outside the United States.

{"Headline": "Facebook Security Breach Exposes Accounts of 50 Million Users", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Facebook, already facing scrutiny over how it handles the private information of its users, said on Friday that an attack on its computer network had exposed the personal information of nearly 50 million users.The breach, which was discovered this week, was the largest in the company\u2019s 14-year history. The attackers exploited a feature in Facebook\u2019s code to gain access to user accounts and potentially take control of them.Senior executives have testified several times this year in congressional hearings where some lawmakers suggested that the government will need to step in if the social network is unable to get tighter control of its service. On Friday, regulators and lawmakers quickly seized on the breach to renew calls for more oversight.In the conference call on Friday, Guy Rosen, a vice president of product management at Facebook, declined to say whether the attack could have been coordinated by hackers supported by a nation-state.Three software flaws in Facebook\u2019s systems allowed hackers to break into user accounts, including those of the top executives Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, according to two people familiar with the investigation but not allowed to discuss it publicly. Once in, the attackers could have gained access to apps like Spotify, Instagram and hundreds of others that give users a way to log into their systems through Facebook.The software bugs were particularly awkward for a company that takes pride in its engineering: The first two were introduced by an online tool meant to improve the privacy of users. The third was introduced in July 2017 by a tool meant to easily upload birthday videos.Facebook said it had fixed the vulnerabilities and notified law enforcement officials. Company officials do not know the identity or the origin of the attackers, nor have they fully assessed the scope of the attack or if particular users were targeted. The investigation is still in its beginning stages.\u201cWe\u2019re taking it really seriously,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cI\u2019m glad we found this, but it definitely is an issue that this happened in the first place.\u201dCritics say the attack is the latest sign that Facebook has yet to come to terms with its problems.\u201cBreaches don\u2019t just violate our privacy. They create enormous risks for our economy and national security,\u201d Rohit Chopra, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a statement. \u201cThe cost of inaction is growing, and we need answers.\u201dFacebook has been roundly criticized for being slow to acknowledge a vast disinformation campaign run by Russian operatives on its platform and other social media outlets before the 2016 presidential election.Ms. Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, testified in a Senate hearing that month about what the company was trying to do to prevent the same thing from happening in midterm elections in November.In April, Mr. Zuckerberg testified about revelations that Cambridge Analytica, the British analytics firm that worked with the Trump presidential campaign, siphoned personal information of millions of Facebook users.Outside the United States, the impact of disinformation appearing on Facebook and the popular messaging service it owns, WhatsApp, has been severe. In countries such as Myanmar and India, false rumors spread on social media are believed to have led to widespread killing.Facebook said the attackers had exploited two bugs in the site\u2019s \u201cView As\u201d feature, which allows users to check on what information other people can see about them. The feature was built to give users move control over their privacy.The company said those flaws were compounded by a bug in Facebook\u2019s video-uploading program for birthday celebrations, a software feature that was introduced in July 2017. The flaw allowed the attackers to steal so-called access tokens \u2014 digital keys that allow access to an account.It is not clear when the attack happened, but it appears to have occurred after the video-uploading program was introduced, Facebook said. The company forced more than 90 million users to log out early Friday, a common safety measure taken when accounts have been compromised.The hackers also tried to harvest people\u2019s private information, including name, sex and hometown, from Facebook\u2019s systems, Mr. Rosen said. The company could not determine the extent of the attackers\u2019 access to third-party accounts, he said.Part of that effort has been to gird Facebook against attacks on its network in preparation for the midterm elections. Facebook has spent months setting up new systems to pre-empt such attacks, and has already dealt with a number of incidents believed to be connected to elections in Mexico, Brazil and other countries.Still, the recently discovered breach was a reminder that it is exceptionally difficult to entirely secure a system that has more than 2.2 billion users all over the world and that connects with thousands of third-party services.\u201cThis has really shown us that because today\u2019s digital environment is so complex, a compromise on a single platform \u2014 especially one as popular and widely reaching as Facebook \u2014 can have consequences that are much more far-reaching than what we can tell in early days of the investigation,\u201d said April Doss, chairwoman of cybersecurity at the law firm Saul Ewing.As the news of Facebook\u2019s data breach spread quickly across Twitter, Google searches and other online sites, there was one place where it remained difficult to find some detailed reports: Facebook.Users who posted breaking stories about the breach from The Guardian, The Associated Press and other outlets were prompted with a notice that their posts had been taken down. So many people were posting the stories, they looked like suspicious activity to the systems that Facebook uses to block abuse of its network.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Twitter\u2019s Dorsey Avoids Taking Sides in Partisan House Hearing", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u2022 Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and Mr. Dorsey testified at the Senate hearing about their companies\u2019 response to foreign interference in elections and the moderation of online content.\u2022 Larry Page, the chief executive of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet, was also invited to the Senate hearing but the company declined to send him. Several senators noted that no one from Google was there.The House hearing kicked off with a more political tone than the morning Senate hearing with social media executives.Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive officer, was asked by Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, the Republican chairman of the committee, how algorithms could be suppressing conservative views on the service.It was a stark change from the morning hearing, when Senate Intelligence Committee members were more collegial and appeared to share similar concerns with Facebook and Twitter over disinformation and foreign influence on their site.The top Democrat in the House hearing, Representative Frank Pallone of New Jersey, accused his Republican counterparts on the committee of having political motives behind their accusations.\u201cPresident Trump and many Republicans have peddled conspiracy theories about Twitter and other social media platforms to whip up their base and fund-raise,\u201d Mr. Pallone said. \u201cI fear the Republicans are using this hearing for those purposes instead of addressing the serious issues raised by social media platforms that affect Americans\u2019 everyday lives.\u201dRepresentative Joe Barton, a Republican of Texas, said: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion if there wasn\u2019t a general agreement that your company had discriminated against conservatives.\u201dMr. Dorsey, who read opening remarks from a phone while live-tweeting, said the company has found no evidence of political bias.\u201cLooking at the data, we analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate, and found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a Republican, even after our ranking and filtering of tweets has been applied,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, accused Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, of sounding the alarm of anti-conservative bias for political gains.He described those accusations as a \u201cload of crap.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangAs House lawmakers threw political jabs in the hearing, Mr. Dorsey managed to steer clear of taking sides.Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, asked Mr. Dorsey if he felt manipulated by Republican politicians who have raised accusations of anti-conservative bias for fund-raising purposes.Mr. Dorsey demurred.\u201cI do believe there is growing concern around power companies like ours hold,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. \u201cPeople do see us as a digital public square and that comes with certain expectations.\u201dRepresentative Ben Luj\u00e1n, Democrat of New Mexico, asked Mr. Dorsey to compare the number of bot accounts Twitter took down that followed President Trump versus President Obama. Mr. Luj\u00e1n knew the answer to his own question. (Two million follower accounts for Obama were taken down versus 320,000 for Mr. Trump, a sign, Mr. Luj\u00e1n suggested, that Twitter was not biased against Republicans.)Mr. Dorsey, however, did not weigh in the issue.\u201cNot sure of those details,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said. \u201cBut it was a broad-based action across Twitter.\u201d\u2014 Cecilia KangRoughly 90 minutes into the afternoon hearing, right-wing activist Laura Loomer stood up from her seat in the back of the room and began yelling over committee members to \u201cstop the bias.\u201dHolding up her cellphone camera so that she could film her own interruption, Ms. Loomer accused tech companies of holding a bias against conservative voices. As committee members asked her to take her seat so that they could resume their discussions, one lawmaker decided to take matters into his own hands.Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri, imitated an auctioneer\u2019s patter, running a live auction as Ms. Loomer repeated her accusations in an ever-louder voice. Mr. Long owned an auction business for decades.Leaning close into his microphone and speaking in a steady, rapid-fire voice, Mr. Long called out, \u201cFifty cents, a dollar!\u201d as Ms. Loomer was escorted from the room.Mr. Long\u2019s performance drew laughs from lawmakers of both parties.\u2014 Sheera FrenkelLawmakers and Mr. Dorsey are using a lot of jargon in Wednesday afternoon\u2019s House hearing. Here are explanations of some of those terms.Conservative Twitter users have recently rallied around claims that Twitter shadow bans users based on their politics. In July, President Trump tweeted that he would look into the \u201cdiscriminatory and illegal practice.\u201d However, Twitter says it does not shadow ban users. Twitter\u2019s algorithmic timeline ranks tweets based on a number of factors, causing some tweets to appear higher in the timeline than others.\u2014 Kate CongerSenator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, asked the executives about their responsibilities to control harmful behavior on their platforms.He noted that the illegal sale of opioids on their platforms still exists. Mr. Manchin asked if the companies felt that they should bear some responsibility for deaths related to opioid sales on their platform.Neither Mr. Dorsey nor Ms. Sandberg answered that question directly, and they stressed the importance of laws that protect internet platforms from lawsuits.The executives said they could be open to further reforms to a law that provides a safe harbor from liability to internet companies, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law, passed in 1996, is considered the Holy Grail of internet policy, providing broad protections that are credited with the rapid growth of Silicon Valley.But they said that the protection also allows them greater freedom to police bad behavior without fear of legal actions.\u201cWe benefit from a lot of protections it gives,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.\u201cThe safe harbor of 230 has been very important in enabling companies like ours to do proactive enforcement without increasingly our liability,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said. \u201cSo we would like to work very closely on how this is enacted.\u201dLawmakers pressed the two executives on how their platforms notify users of foreign influence campaigns.Ms. Sandberg said Facebook is getting better at letting users know of fake accounts and ads. She raised the example of an event in Washington, D.C., that was promoted by an inauthentic account. When Facebook detected the account, the company took down the event and notified users who indicated their interest in attending.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, criticized Twitter for Russian activity that affected her account but that was only brought to her attention by researchers from Clemson University.Mr. Dorsey admitted that Twitter needed to improve its process of detecting fake accounts and notifying users, and said the company wants to work more with academics.\u201cWe do believe in transparency and a big part of where we need the most work,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said.\u2014 Cecilia KangRegulation is coming. Senators made that clear in their statements to Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey. But the precise form of that legislation is unclear.\u201cCongress is going to have to take action here,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia. \u201cThe era of the Wild West in social media is coming to an end.\u201dSeveral lawmakers indicated that they saw an opening for regulation related to election interference on social media platforms, because they considered it a threat to national security. Other senators appeared to favor a privacy approach, focusing on individual rights to control personal data.Data privacy, said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat from Oregon, would serve as the \u201cfoundation\u201d of legislation that he has previously discussed with Twitter and Facebook.Social media companies are resigned to the notion that regulation is on its way. Twitter and Facebook have endorsed the Honest Ads Act, a proposal that would require more transparency about who is paying for online ads, and have begun building so-called ad transparency centers on their platforms.But expect some resistance from the tech giants. In a white paper, Mr. Warner proposed 20 legislative possibilities. When pressed on one of the proposals, Ms. Sandberg replied, \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of whether regulation, we think it\u2019s a question of the right regulation.\u201d\u2014 Kate CongerMs. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey\u2019s opening statements before the Senate hearing displayed their obvious differences.Ms. Sandberg, who was born in Washington, and spent years living there during her time at the Treasury Department, appeared confident in her opening remarks. Speaking clearly and with practiced pacing, she complimented the committee\u2019s previous work on election interference.Mr. Dorsey stumbled during his opening, forgetting to turn on his microphone and reading from a cellphone he held in his hand. He added that he was also live-tweeting his opening remarks through his Twitter account.While Ms. Sandberg made consistent eye contact with the senators, Mr. Dorsey appeared to be reading from his phone between questions.\u2014 Cecilia Kang and Sheera FrenkelAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The New iPhones Look Fine. But My Old One Is Better Than Ever.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple\u2019s new offerings are so good that I\u2019m not buying a new iPhone.I expect to save hundreds of dollars this year and enjoy what I\u2019ve already got, because, thanks to Apple, my old iPhone 6 is performing better than ever.This is the result of two unusual moves by the trillion-dollar corporation. One was Apple\u2019s release this month of a new operating system that not only makes its new iPhones run well, but can also radically improve the performance of millions of old ones.Unless articles like this one spur millions of people to defer purchases, Apple may have found a business strategy that allows the company to have it both ways: Charge ever more money for fancy new phones, while enhancing its reputation by providing value-oriented consumers with reliable products that can last for years.What\u2019s the magic that has rejuvenated my iPhone and given it powers it didn\u2019t possess when I first bought it, nearly four years ago?The answer is mundane. My old iPhone started getting younger in February, when I took advantage of the Apple discount to replace the phone\u2019s aging battery for $29, down from the usual $79 out-of-warranty fee.Until last winter, I had never even thought of replacing an iPhone battery. I accepted that it would wear out every couple of years, and assumed that because of the way Apple had engineered the iPhone, the smart move was to replace the entire device with a new, improved model. My phone appeared to be on its last legs. It ran out of power in a few hours, and sometimes shut down inexplicably.While my new battery made my phone serviceable again, I still assumed I would have to replace it when Apple introduced the new models, and a new operating system, in September, as it does just about every year. New operating systems typically make old phones slow to a crawl.I downloaded the new software, and my phone works spectacularly now. Some people who installed iOS 12 have reported minor glitches, but that hasn\u2019t been my experience. My phone can\u2019t do everything the new iPhone Xs can do, but it seems fast enough to me.A lot of other things are possible with my iPhone now. Searching for photos of family members is now staggeringly easy. Most important, the phone\u2019s internal capacity seems to have been enlarged: I can read a book, switch to a magazine, start an audiobook app, return to The New York Times website, check my heartbeat and see how many miles I jogged this morning, all without crashing the phone.Moderating this kind of addictive overuse is easier, too, thanks to functions that make it simpler to turn off annoying messages for extended periods. It\u2019s like having a new, speedy phone, without having to buy one.What\u2019s the upside for Apple? By supporting my aging iPhone years after what might have been its sell-by date, the company has increased the odds that \u2014 when I do actually need a new phone \u2014 I will remain in the Apple universe, expensive as it may be to live there. My old phone, which cost $649 new, seems like a much better deal now, considering all the use I\u2019m getting out of it.Even before the latest changes, many people had been delaying buying a new phone. In Apple-speak, the iPhone replacement cycle has lengthened, and annual sales have not yet returned to the 2015 peak of 231 million units sold. As Toni Sacconaghi, senior analyst with Bernstein, points out, \u201cIf the iPhone replacement cycle continues to elongate meaningfully, that could undermine Apple\u2019s fundamental economics.\u201dBut for Apple, the saving grace is a surge in the average sales price from $671 for all of 2015 to well over $700 for the first three quarters of this year. In a mature smartphone market, pushing the average price higher \u2014 and it\u2019s rising at double-digit levels, the company says \u2014 is crucial to corporate growth.As the most valuable company in the world, Apple can surely afford to treat its customers well. By doing so, it may be able to keep millions of people paying for increasingly expensive products. And if some of us wait a year or two because we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve got, it won\u2019t be the end of Apple\u2019s prosperous world.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed\u2019s chief, said yesterday: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider political factors.\u201dThe sportswear company\u2019s decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.Another factor: Under Nike\u2019s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can\u2019t sell league-branded merchandise after 2020. That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process. Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.And:If companies\u2019 profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds. But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year. And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more. In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more. Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading! We\u2019ll see you tomorrow.Advertisement"}

No flashy jewelry, little makeup.She is a professor and psychologist with an impressive C.V.She is white, and blond, and pretty \u2014 but not too pretty \u2014 with an intact family, suburban home and children.She teared up in her testimony \u2014 her voice cracking \u2014 but she did not openly cry or break down.And she smiled! She pleaded for caffeine and joked about Google interns renting out her home.\u201cThese are all codes for \u2018she is displaying proper expectations of femininity,\u2019\u201d said Marianne Cooper, a sociologist at Stanford who studies gender inequality. \u201cWomen are walking a very fine line. Too much or too little of something can lead people to discredit them. That so many people found Dr. Blasey Ford credible suggests that she was able to get across that tight rope and not fall off.\u201dIn other words, Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who on Thursday told the Senate Judiciary Committee in excruciating detail that Brett M. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, was everything a victim is supposed to be.Whether or not Judge Kavanaugh ends up on the United States Supreme Court, the hearing was nothing short of a watershed moment.It was perhaps the most important one since 1991, when women gathered around water coolers and in airport lounges to watch Anita Hill testify about Clarence Thomas \u2014 effectively educating a generation about the definition of workplace sexual harassment.And if it provided a similar generational schooling on the nuances and lasting repercussions of teenage assault, it was also a stark reminder of the gender dynamics, and mental gymnastics, required of women who speak up (or speak at all).There was the offhand remark by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, about the \u201cfemale assistant\u201d who would question Dr. Blasey \u2014 actually a seasoned prosecutor of sex crimes, Rachel Mitchell.And, of course, the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee are all men.That is one thing that has not changed since 1991.But Dr. Blasey was not forced to reckon with the racial components of Professor Hill\u2019s hearing. Justice Thomas called the charges against him a \u201chigh-tech lynching\u201d while Professor Hill, as a black woman, faced a complicated interplay of racism and sexism.Unlike Professor Hill, who was accused of bringing \u201csleaze\u201d into the Senate, Dr. Blasey instantly won very public support, including from numerous senators who declared on Thursday: \u201cI believe you.\u201d\u201cIf he were a woman we\u2019d be questioning if she were unhinged,\u201d said Alicia Menendez, a correspondent for PBS, of Kavanaugh\u2019s opening statement.It was like years of academic research on display in real time, in which women who express anger will be dismissed as hysterical but men who express anger are perceived as \u201cpassionate\u201d about the job.In contrast, Dr. Blasey remained calm, speaking in a soft, girl-like tone about a thing that happened as a girl but has stayed with her for three decades.In searing detail, she described how the \u201cboys\u201d she knew in high school \u2014 just \u201cBrett\u201d and \u201cMark,\u201d not \u201cJudge Kavanaugh\u201d or \u201cMark Judge\u201d \u2014 pushed her into a room and pinned her down, then laughed uproariously, \u201chaving fun at my expense.\u201dThe Senate testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, the man she alleges assaulted her while they were in high school, revealed several details in their stories that do not match up.She also managed her own testimony with the precision of a scientist.When asked by Ms. Feinstein why she had kept the story to herself for so long, she replied that she had not: \u201cI brought it up in therapy, which seemed an appropriate place to deal with the sequelae of the assault.\u201d(Sequela \u2014 that\u2019s a noun referring to an \u201caftereffect of a disease, condition or injury,\u201d according to Merriam Webster.)On how she was \u201csure\u201d it was Judge Kavanaugh, and not another person, who attacked her on that night all those years ago, she replied that it was \u201cthe way that I\u2019m sure that I\u2019m talking to you right now \u2014 it\u2019s just basic memory functions,\u201d including \u201cthe level of norepinephrine and epinephrine\u201d that \u201ccodes memories into the hippocampus\u201d so that \u201ctrauma-related experience is locked there.\u201dShe was operating, as some pointed out, as both expert and witness \u2014 confirming her own perspective, each step of the way, before there was the chance for anyone to ask her to do it.And yet she also lamented how she\u2019d like to have been more \u201ccollaborative\u201d with the committee and would have happily hosted the chairman and his Republican colleagues in her California home (the home she has now had to vacate because of death threats).When asked what time she would like to take a break, she replied: \u201cDoes that work for you?\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m used to being collegial,\u201d she said, when Senator Grassley replied that it was up to her.)And yet, what choice did she have?\u201cIt\u2019s like the Anita Hill hearing didn\u2019t just teach us about sexual harassment, it also taught us that credible victimhood had to align with conventional gender expectations,\u201d said Rachel Simmons, the director of the Phoebe Reese Lewis Leadership Program at Smith College. \u201cBe smart, but not too smart. Tell us what happened, but don\u2019t yell. Smile and be nice above all.\u201dIn her prepared remarks, Dr. Blasey explained that the reason she had not spoken up earlier was that she believed \u201cmy voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters.\u201dDrowned out it was not.

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Google\u2019s Turn in Washington\u2019s Glare", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Google executives, after months of mostly avoiding the harsh spotlight put on their internet peers, are being grilled in Washington this week by lawmakers questioning if the Silicon Valley giant is living up to its promise to be a neutral arbiter of online information.On Friday, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, will meet with Representative Kevin McCarthy, of California, the Republican House majority leader and a vocal critic of Google, and more than two dozen Republicans to discuss complaints the company is trying to silence conservative voices.\u201cGoogle has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior, and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said in a statement.The Friday meeting will cap a week of tech-related sessions in Washington in which Google \u2014 in the cross hairs of Silicon Valley\u2019s conservative critics since late summer \u2014 has played a starring role.At a gathering of the heads of the Justice Department and a dozen state attorneys general on Tuesday, Google was mentioned more than any other company when it came to concerns about antitrust enforcement and privacy practices, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity.At a Senate hearing discussing online privacy on Wednesday, Google\u2019s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, received the toughest and broadest array of questions from lawmakers who wanted to know about the company\u2019s consideration of introducing search services in China. Google says it is not close to starting such a service.Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, also questioned Mr. Enright about claims of bias against conservatives in search results. \u201cI can tell you that millions of Texans believe Google is actively censoring the speech of conservatives,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.On Thursday, Harmeet Dhillon, a lawyer and Republican Party official, is set to testify in the House about anti-conservative bias in tech. Ms. Dhillon represents several former employees in a lawsuit filed last year against Google that claims the company discriminated against them based on their political beliefs.Google executives did not attend the Senate hearing, though they were invited. The company offered to send Kent Walker, a senior vice president for global affairs who is also the company\u2019s top lawyer. But urged on by Facebook officials, according to two people familiar with the matter, senators insisted on a more powerful executive. Google refused.It was the \u201cworst business decision of 2018,\u201d said Scott Galloway, a founder of the business research firm Gartner L2 and a professor of marketing at New York University Stern School of Business. \u201cIt feels like the tide has turned substantially,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. \u201cThey\u2019ve sort of poked the bear.\u201dA Google spokeswoman said officials from the company had testified before Congress 22 times since 2008. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to continue explaining our products and practices,\u201d Becca Rutkoff, the Google spokeswoman, said in a statement.For longtime Google critics and even some of its Silicon Valley peers, it is surprising that Google has avoided the spotlight for so long.It has 90 percent of the global search market \u2014 a share so high that it has for years had to sidestep concerns that it is a dominant monopoly that needs to be regulated. Competitors have long claimed that Google is using its search dominance to advantage its own services and should be controlled by antitrust laws.The Google-owned YouTube video service is also dominant, and has for several years faced questions about videos that show terrorist violence and disinformation, similar to issues that Facebook and Twitter have had to address in congressional hearings.Emails leaked last week showed lower-level Google employees discussing whether they could alter search results to counter President Trump\u2019s travel ban on people from predominantly Muslim countries. Google is adamant that no one in a position to make such a change seriously considered it.Employees are bracing for more embarrassing leaks. The company has long encouraged workers to speak their minds on internal message boards. That includes politics.The next day, the president posted a video that seemed to show that Google did not promote his State of the Union address on its home page as it had in the past for President Obama. He used the hashtag #StopTheBias. The video was incorrect. Google said that it didn\u2019t promote Mr. Obama\u2019s inaugural address, a joint statement to Congress but not technically a State of the Union address, in 2009 either.Shortly after, other Republicans were calling for regulations and greater scrutiny. Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, called for antitrust regulators to reopen an investigation into Google.Some Google officials wonder if competitors are organizing a campaign to prompt regulatory scrutiny.At the Senate hearing Google did not attend, lawmakers mentioned a report that had come out a day before from the Campaign for Accountability, a nonprofit watchdog group that often publishes research critical of Google. The group posed as Russian trolls to buy what it called politically divisive ads on Google\u2019s systems, which failed to stop them.Google called the report \u201ca stunt\u201d by its rivals and blamed the software maker Oracle for its release. Ken Glueck, a senior vice president at Oracle, said it had made a one-time financial contribution in 2016 to the Campaign for Accountability but denied that the company had any involvement in the report.Google has many business opponents in Washington, including telecommunication giants like AT&T and Comcast. Oracle and News Corp. have put significant resources into funding third-party coalitions and public relations firms to place ads and to lobby lawmakers on Google\u2019s dominance in search and on allegations it uses its power to unfairly harm publishers and other tech rivals.But few companies have been as tenacious as Yelp, a midsize internet outfit with far fewer resources. It has waged a seven-year battle to get regulatory agencies around the world to investigate Google. Until recently, its calls have been largely ignored in the United States. The company claims Google prioritized its own reviews over others, making it much harder for competing reviews sites like Yelp to be discovered.Early in September, a White House official received an email with an attachment from Luther Lowe, the senior vice president for policy for Yelp.\u201cCheck out the attachment,\u201d Mr. Lowe wrote in an email. \u201cTell me what you think.\u201dThe attachment was a document called, \u201cExecutive Draft Order to Protect American Competition and Small Businesses From Bias in Online Platforms.\u201d It was a draft presidential order instructing antitrust officials to recommend ways to protect competition and clamp down on content bias on internet search and social media sites.Mr. Lowe said in an email that he did not know the origins of the document and that it had been forwarded to him.While there is no evidence that administration officials are seriously considering such a move, the document\u2019s existence made clear that Google\u2019s problems could get worse.\u201cAlthough the White House is concerned about the conduct of online platforms and their impact on society, this document is not the result of an official White House policymaking process,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, the deputy White House press secretary.Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco and Cecilia Kang from Washington.

Our personalities are really similar, how we view the world and our artistry and our position as musicians.\u201dA monthlong tour together this November was an obvious move. But starting a band on top of that was just more fun. What began as a plan to record a collaborative promotional single to advertise the concerts bloomed into a six-song EP by the trio, who have dubbed themselves boygenius \u2014 an inside joke that evolved into an ethos.\u201cWe were just talking about boys and men we know who\u2019ve been told that they are geniuses since they could hear, basically,\u201d Ms. Dacus said, \u201cand what type of creative work comes out of that upbringing.\u201dMs. Baker called the process \u201cextremely democratic.\u201d Each artist brought ideas \u2014 \u201cLike all great enterprises, we have a group text,\u201d as well as a Google Drive, she said \u2014 and took the lead on two of the tracks.While writing, \u201cI tried to think about them and what we shared,\u201d Ms. Dacus said. Distance, emotional and physical, was an overarching theme best encapsulated on the final song, \u201cKetchum, ID,\u201d in which each woman sings a verse about the melancholy of life on the road.Ms. Bridgers conceived of the song as a Carter Family number, and its refrain was sung by all three around one microphone: \u201cI am never anywhere/anywhere I go/when I\u2019m home, I\u2019m never there/long enough to know.\u201dStill, the trio, similarly deliberate and measured in every action and utterance, cautioned that they did not want their camaraderie to be played as what Ms. Dacus referred to as a \u201cmarketing ploy.\u201dMs. Baker said: \u201cOn one level I want it to be unremarkable that there\u2019s no male to attribute control to.

The game, which lets children race cartoon cars with animal drivers, has been downloaded millions of times.Until last month, the app also shared users\u2019 data, sometimes including the precise location of devices, with more than a half-dozen advertising and online tracking companies. On Tuesday evening, New Mexico\u2019s attorney general filed a lawsuit claiming that the maker of Fun Kid Racing had violated a federal children\u2019s privacy law through dozens of Android apps that shared children\u2019s data.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right,\u201d said Ms. Slingerland, a mother of three in Alberta, Canada. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s any of their business, location or anything like that.\u201dThe suit accuses the app maker, Tiny Lab Productions, along with online ad businesses run by Google, Twitter and three other companies, of flouting a law intended to prevent the personal data of children under 13 from falling into the hands of predators, hackers and manipulative marketers. The suit also contends that Google misled consumers by including the apps in the family section of its store.An analysis by The New York Times found that children\u2019s apps by other developers were also collecting data. The review of 20 children\u2019s apps \u2014 10 each on Google Android and Apple iOS \u2014 found examples on both platforms that sent data to tracking companies, potentially violating children\u2019s privacy law; the iOS apps sent less data over all.But the New Mexico lawsuit and the analyses of children\u2019s apps suggest that some app developers, ad tech companies and app stores are falling short in protecting children\u2019s privacy.\u201cThese sophisticated tech companies are not policing themselves,\u201d the New Mexico attorney general, Hector Balderas, said. \u201cThe children of this country ultimately pay the price.\u201dJessica Rich, a former consumer protection director at the Federal Trade Commission, called the findings \u201csignificant and disturbing.\u201d They suggest, she said, \u201cthat the \u2018safe spaces\u2019 for kids in the apps stores aren\u2019t safe at all.\u201dA Google spokesman, Aaron Stein, said that developers are responsible for declaring whether their apps are primarily for children, and that apps in the store\u2019s family section \u201cmust comply with more stringent policies.\u201dA Twitter spokesman said that the company\u2019s ad platform, MoPub, does not allow its services to be used to collect information from children\u2019s apps for targeted advertising and that it suspended the maker of Fun Kid Racing in September of 2017 for violating its policies.Jonas Abromaitis, founder of the Lithuania-based Tiny Lab, said he believed he had followed the law and Google\u2019s requirements, because the app asked for users\u2019 ages and tracked those who identified as over 13. \u201cWe thought we were doing everything the right way,\u201d he said.Dozens of companies now track consumers on their phones to build behavioral profiles that help tailor the ads they see. Two of the largest are AdMob and MoPub.To make money, app developers generally have two options: publish free apps supported by ads, or charge users. But children don\u2019t have the money to make purchases, and under federal law they can\u2019t be tracked for ad targeting.By Anjali Singhvi and Rich Harris | Source: Mr. Collins said some top children\u2019s app makers had started charging parents for subscriptions or showing ads that didn\u2019t use tracking. But, he noted, small developers typically sell fewer subscriptions and don\u2019t always sell enough ads using only child-friendly ad networks. \u201cAs a result, there\u2019s still a huge amount of data being collected on kids,\u201d he said.Mr. Abromaitis, the Tiny Lab founder, created Fun Kid Racing in 2013, after searching unsuccessfully for a racing game to play with his 3-year-old nephew. Other Tiny Lab apps include simple games with titles such as Run Cute Little Pony.Still, Mr. Abromaitis said in an interview, the company\u2019s apps were directed at \u201cmixed audiences,\u201d with children under 13 forming only part of the market.The distinction is important: Under privacy law, apps aimed at younger children are prohibited from tracking any users for ads without parental consent, but those intended for a general audience can ask players their age and track older users.When Tiny Lab submitted apps to Google\u2019s store, it indicated they were for families, not just children, and Google accepted the apps.In The Times\u2019s tests of Fun Kid Racing in July, the app asked that players select their birth year from a list. But with the default set between 2000 and 2001, a young child eager to get to the next screen could simply tap through quickly and be counted as a teenager. In the tests, the app didn\u2019t collect location data if the player identified as under 13.In July, a Google manager responded that the company had investigated the Tiny Lab apps and had found they had not violated the privacy law. Google, he said, did not consider \u201cthese apps to be designed primarily for children, but for families in general.\u201dA month later, Google appeared to reverse course: The company told Mr. Abromaitis it had identified a Tiny Lab app that should be designated for children. Google gave Tiny Lab a week to change that app and any others like it. Tiny Lab labeled 10 of its apps for children and used ad networks in them designed for children\u2019s apps. Google approved the updates but flagged more apps at the end of August, Mr. Abromaitis said, so he made another round of changes.Then, this week, after inquiries from The Times, Google terminated Tiny Lab\u2019s account and removed all of its apps from the Play store, citing multiple policy violations.Asked about the earlier emails, Google said the statements were made in error and that it doesn\u2019t certify whether apps in the Play store comply with the children\u2019s privacy law.Mr. Abromaitis said he hoped to work with Google to get back into the store.The study this spring showed not only that more than half of children\u2019s apps on Android were sharing tracking ID numbers but also that 5 percent collected children\u2019s location or contact information without their parents\u2019 permission.To evaluate tracking on iOS as well as Android, The Times conducted a small study, looking at 10 apps on each platform. The Times chose a mix of the most popular children\u2019s apps and smaller apps that had been flagged in the academics\u2019 research for sharing data, to test whether the apps had problems on iOS and whether they had been fixed on Android.Although it is difficult to know whether companies are actually violating the federal rules, six of the Android apps shared data such as precise location, IP addresses and tracking IDs in ways that could be problematic. On iOS, five apps sent IDs to tracking companies in questionable ways.In addition to Fun Kid Racing, the tests showed one other Android app sending precise location data to other companies: Masha and the Bear: Free Animal Games for Kids, an animated game app with millions of downloads. The iOS version sent advertising ID codes to a company that generally prohibits children\u2019s apps from using its network.In an email, Indigo Kids, the Cyprus-based maker of the Masha app, said it was not responsible for harvesting children\u2019s information because third-party companies collected the data. \u201cWe, as a company, do not collect or store any data of our users,\u201d the company said.Other apps with data practices that could violate the children\u2019s privacy rules sent data to multiple tracking companies that don\u2019t allow children\u2019s apps, or sent the data with notes in the computer code incorrectly indicating that it hadn\u2019t come from children.Several apps reviewed by The Times also sent the advertising ID to other companies but said this was for specific purposes allowed under the law, such as preventing an ad from being shown too many times.Tom Neumayr, an Apple spokesman, said that children\u2019s privacy in apps \u201cis something we take very seriously\u201d and that developers must follow strict guidelines about tracking in children\u2019s apps.\u201cThe F.T.C. has made enforcement of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act a high priority,\u201d said Juliana Gruenwald, an agency spokeswoman.But the New Mexico lawsuit is different. The state is not just going after a single app maker or ad company; it\u2019s also implicating the ad platforms of Google and Twitter, and the vetting process of Google\u2019s app store.\u201cGoogle knows that Tiny Lab\u2019s apps track children unlawfully,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cGoogle\u2019s bad acts are compounded because it represents to parents\u201d that Tiny Lab\u2019s apps comply with the children\u2019s privacy law and are \u201csafe for children.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see any way that anything would change unless there are enforcement actions,\u201d said Serge Egelman, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped lead the study this spring.New Mexico\u2019s attorney general said he hoped the F.T.C. and others in Washington would follow his lead. \u201cThis is as much a black eye on the federal government as the tech space,\u201d Mr. Balderas said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get lawmakers at the federal level to wake up.\u201dAug. 26, 2018June 28, 2018May 19, 2018July 29, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook and Twitter Have a Message for Lawmakers: We\u2019re Trying", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 For months, Facebook, Twitter and Google have grappled with criticism over the misuse of their services by foreign operatives and the disproportionate influence their platforms have over people\u2019s thinking.\u201cWe were too slow to spot this and too slow to act. That\u2019s on us,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said in prepared testimony that was reviewed by The New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better at finding and combating our adversaries, from financially motivated troll farms to sophisticated military intelligence operations.\u201dThe two executives, who will be making their first appearances before Congress, are expected to face tough queries on Wednesday morning at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing about foreign manipulation of social media sites. Mr. Dorsey will then appear alone in the afternoon at a House Energy and Commerce committee hearing about content moderation on the sites.Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, had also invited Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, to testify on Wednesday. But the company declined to send Mr. Page and instead submitted written testimony from Kent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president for global affairs.In a blog post on Tuesday, Mr. Walker tried to distinguish Google from Facebook and Twitter as less problematic and vulnerable to foreign meddling.The appearances of Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey in Washington mark the third time in less than a year that top social media executives from Silicon Valley have come to Capitol Hill to defend their companies.Since then, Facebook, Google and Twitter have tried to demonstrate their efforts to fight misinformation and foreign influence by hiring thousands of content moderators, as well as developing tools with artificial intelligence and other technologies to more quickly identify and root out fake accounts and foreign-backed influence campaigns.\u201cWhen we find bad actors, we will block them,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said in her prepared testimony. \u201cWhen we find content that violates our policies, we will take it down. And when our attackers use new techniques, we\u2019ll share them to improve our collective defense.\u201dThe testimonies of Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey are expected to draw wide interest, just as Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s appearance before Congress was considered must-see TV by tech industry officials, regulators and others.Ms. Sandberg is a veteran of Washington politics. She was the chief of staff to the former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers during the Clinton administration, and now oversees policy for Facebook, among other things.Both executives have been preparing for the hearings for several weeks. They each have been coached by company lawyers and Facebook and Twitter\u2019s Washington policy staffs on what questions specific lawmakers may ask and which ones may use the hearings to level new accusations or threats of regulations, according to people involved in the preparations, who were not authorized to talk publicly. Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey have been advised to appear contrite, to be direct with their responses and to be patient if interrupted, the people said.Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey met with several lawmakers on Tuesday, ahead of the hearings. Both met with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, including Mr. Burr, as well as Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, according to committee aides.The Senate hearing wasn\u2019t expected to yield many new revelations on foreign interference, and some lawmakers were expected to veer into other topics. Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, would most likely raise concerns of content biases by social media sites that stifle conservative views, according to committee aides. And Mr. Wyden was expected to focus on online privacy and the potential need for regulations.In particular, lawmakers may press the executives on how vulnerable their sites are ahead of the midterms.The companies also plan to highlight a gap between themselves and law enforcement officials on battling foreign meddling.\u201cOur understanding of overall Russian activity in 2016 is limited because we do not have access to the information or investigative tools that the U.S. government and this Committee have,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said in her written remarks.Though Google won\u2019t have an executive present, lawmakers, including Mr. Warner, were expected to criticize the company for declining an invitation to testify.And Mr. Dorsey, in his marathon day of hearings, will seek to quash the growing accusations that his company suppresses conservative views.In recent months, Mr. Dorsey has met privately with Republican and Democratic politicians and pundits. Last month, before agreeing to testify in the House hearing, he had a call with the House majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California, and the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, to allay their fears of anti-conservative bias on the site.The lawmakers still threatened to subpoena Mr. Dorsey if he didn\u2019t agree to testify.Cecilia Kang and Sheera Frenkel reported from Washington.

{"Headline": "New Phone-Friendly Version of Financial Aid Form Is Coming Out", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserThe notoriously difficult-to-fill-out federal financial aid form known as Fafsa is going mobile. And, the federal Education Department says, it should be easier to use.The latest version of the document, formally called the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, will be available next month on a new phone app and on a revamped website that works well on mobile devices.The Fafsa has been available online for years. But students and their families generally needed a desktop computer to complete the form because it didn\u2019t work smoothly on mobile devices.\u201cIt was clunky to use on a phone,\u201d said Kim Cook, executive director of the National College Access Network, which promotes college for minority and low-income students.The form, which calculates how much students and their families are expected to pay for college, is the gateway for federal student aid, and is used by states and schools as well.Students who file a Fafsa are more likely to attend college, so anything that encourages them to submit the form is welcome, Ms. Cook said.The Education Department this summer introduced the mobile-friendly Fafsa.gov website, which automatically adjusts to fit on phones and tablets, as well as a test version of the myStudentAid app, which includes the Fafsa.The new app is getting good marks, including from groups recruited to try it by Ms. Cook\u2019s nonprofit group. It\u2019s especially helpful, student advocates say, that the form can be started on one device \u2014 say, a smartphone \u2014 and completed on another, perhaps a computer. That means students and their parents can work on the form separately, Ms. Cook said. They don\u2019t have to be sitting down in front of a computer at the same time.\u201cIt got good reviews,\u201d Ms. Cook said of the app.The app presents one question per screen, which makes the form less intimidating, said Mark Kantrowitz, a financial-aid expert.\u201cIt was actually fun to complete,\u201d Mr. Kantrowitz said. \u201cIt makes completing the Fafsa much easier.\u201dCrucially, the app doesn\u2019t yet allow automatic transfer of financial information from the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s online Data Retrieval Tool, which makes it easier to accurately fill in financial details. Currently, users must use Fafsa.gov to take advantage of the I.R.S. tool. (While the website is now mobile-friendly, the I.R.S. tool itself isn\u2019t \u201coptimized\u201d for mobile use, so that part of the process is still awkward, Ms. Cook said. Users must \u201cscroll and zoom\u201d to see all fields.)The updated app, which will be released next month, will offer the I.R.S. tool with \u201cfull functionality,\u201d according to an Education Department spokesman.Here are some questions and answers about the Fafsa:When can I use the new mobile Fafsa app?The revised app is scheduled to become available Oct. 1, when the new Fafsa for the 2019-20 school year is released. The myStudentAid app can be downloaded from Apple\u2019s App Store or from Google Play for Android devices.Do I need a federal student aid ID to use the app?Where can I learn more about the new mobile app?Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "2-Second Rule for Distracted Driving Can Mean Life or Death", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsThe large rubber strip that I was speeding toward on the Ventura Freeway near Los Angeles looked easy enough to avoid. I swerved, but not enough.That strip was actually metal, however, and it ripped through my right front tire, which went spinning across four lanes of the freeway. Moments later, I was driving 80 miles an hour with one bare metal wheel, sparks flying. I pulled onto a median to await a tow truck, worried for our safety as cars screamed past.I had been looking at my wife for about four seconds before glancing back at the road. Had I just become a victim of distracted driving? The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration would probably say yes.Drivers should never take their eyes off the road for more than two seconds at a time, the agency says. The Auto Alliance, a manufacturers\u2019 trade group, agrees. \u201cThe odds of a crash double if your eyes are off the road for more than two seconds,\u201d said Wade Newton, a spokesman.Just two seconds can be the life-or-death difference between hitting that metal strip, or a deer, and avoiding it. In 2016, more than 9 percent of United States traffic deaths \u2014 or 3,450 \u2014 were linked to distracted driving. With these facts in mind, the government, automakers and tech companies are dreaming up new ways to keep drivers\u2019 eyes on the road, at a time when there are more opportunities for distraction than ever.One thing that does not work is an appeal to common sense. Asking people to just say no to their gadgets and social media feeds cannot overcome the temptation to check on them, even while behind the wheel.Which is why many states now forbid the use of devices if they need to be held, unless they\u2019re connected through the vehicle\u2019s built-in screen or can be operated with voice commands. But even that may not be enough. \u201cLaws against distracted driving do not reduce crashes,\u201d said Jessica Cicchino, a vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.Instead, N.H.T.S.A. and the Auto Alliance have come up with a set of voluntary design guidelines to limit distractions and make driving safer.Under these guidelines, makers are encouraged to design screens that do not obstruct the driver\u2019s field of view, use internationally recognized icons and symbols, allow the driver to control the pace of input, and disable information not pertinent to driving when in motion.Given that they\u2019re suggestions, their use varies. Volkswagens lock out navigation input using the touch screen when the vehicle is in motion, while some Audis don\u2019t. A list of favorite radio stations disappears from the Alfa Romeo Stelvio\u2019s screen after a few seconds, before the driver may have had a chance to choose. And some vehicles position digital displays above the standard dashboard.\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing things that N.H.T.S.A. says not to use while driving, being used,\u201d said Jake Nelson, director of traffic safety advocacy and research at AAA, the auto association. \u201cAutomakers are making it really easy for drivers to do multiple things.\u201dMr. Nelson added, \u201cPeople are accessing Facebook while they\u2019re driving. We\u2019ve seen the biggest increase in fatal crashes in the last 50 years, with more pedestrian and cyclist deaths.\u201dRather than try to stop distracted driving behavior, manufacturers are offering technological solutions to hopefully lessen the distractions.They include features like head-up displays, which project speed and other information onto the windshield in front of the driver; and audio alerts when the vehicle drifts into another lane without signaling. Others include blind-spot detection, automatic braking when about to hit another vehicle or pedestrian, and cross-traffic warnings when a vehicle is about to pass behind the driver in a parking lot.These technologies work. According to Ms. Cicchino of the Insurance Institute, forward-collision warning systems with automatic braking cut rear-end crashes by 50 percent, and rear cross-traffic alerts reduce accidents by 33 percent.Distractions like eating or grooming have a long history for drivers, and now smartphones are adding to them. \u201cThere is evidence to suggest that distracted driving is getting worse,\u201d said Charlie Klauer, lead for the teen risk and injury prevention group at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute.But the severity is unclear. \u201cThere is no correlation between fatalities and the use of smartphones,\u201d said Ms. Cicchino of the Insurance Institute. \u201cDistraction caused by electronic devices is replacing that caused by eating, drinking and talking to passengers while driving.\u201dThe problem is especially acute for teenagers. \u201cThey\u2019re not judicious when they engage in distracted behaviors,\u201d Ms. Klauer said. \u201cThey\u2019re not good at detecting hazards.\u201dSmartphone makers are trying to help drivers focus, too.Apple CarPlay and Android Auto allow drivers to use some of their familiar smartphone apps on a vehicle\u2019s built-in display. A recent AAA study of five cars and trucks conducted with the University of Utah found that, on average, using voice commands with CarPlay or Android Auto reduced visual and mental distractions by 15 seconds, compared with the vehicles\u2019 own infotainment systems.In addition, visual and mental demands for both the Apple and Google systems were moderate, in contrast to a rating of \u201chigh\u201d for the built-in systems of test vehicles.It takes automakers longer than the smartphone companies to develop and adjust their products, so there is lag time in changes. But less-distracting infotainment systems are beginning to appear.Acura\u2019s 2019 RDX SUV puts its infotainment screen at eye level so a driver doesn\u2019t need to look down. Coupled with a head-up display, a driver can make selections without losing sight of the road.In addition, every selection on the screen matches the same absolute position on a touch pad near the armrest; if the user wants to select a radio preset that is in the upper right of the screen, a touch of the upper right corner of the pad changes to that channel, making a selection a logical move.Also, favorite SiriusXM stations, phone contacts, and map locations can be moved to the home screen to eliminate the need to dig through multiple layers of menus. And physical buttons are retained for simple actions, such as increasing the radio volume.Designers considered adding haptic feedback \u2014 the slight vibration one feels when making certain selections on a smartphone \u2014 but decided against it. \u201cIt added more distractions,\u201d said Ross Miller, the principal engineer for infotainment user interfaces at Honda, Acura\u2019s parent company.At Chrysler, KeySense technology enables a specific key for its Pacifica minivan to be programmed so that the user cannot raise the radio volume above a certain level, mutes the radio if the front seatbelts are not fastened, and gives the car a speed limit. (Pay attention, parents of teenage drivers.)KeySense also gives an early warning for low fuel, blocks certain satellite radio stations, and always turns on the headlights when the windshield wipers are on.Chrysler also prevents Bluetooth pairing while driving, and forbids inputting a destination into the navigation system using the onscreen keyboard.To further mitigate distracted driving, \u201cwe\u2019re investigating the use of a camera to detect driver eye movements and incorporating a head-up display,\u201d said Dominic Ronzello, Chrysler\u2019s senior manager of human-machine interface and ergonomics.These design elements are making the best of a bad situation; using one\u2019s hands to input information is bound to distract even the best driver.\u201cThe direction to go is voice recognition,\u201d said Dr. Matthias Erb, Volkswagen of America\u2019s chief engineering officer. \u201cAnd when we add a head-up display, this will improve safety significantly.\u201dDr. Erb said VWs would eventually be able to learn an individual driver\u2019s behavior, and move certain functions higher up on the vehicle\u2019s display to curb distraction.\u201cThe problem is software,\u201d Dr. Erb said. \u201cThe delay in vehicle software development means that currently we cannot compete with smartphones. But vehicle over-the-air software updates will eventually come.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was first reported on by the Intercept news site.Google\u2019s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified on Wednesday before a congressional committee about the company\u2019s approach to data protection. Executives from Apple, AT&T, Amazon, Twitter and Charter Communications also appeared at the hearing.Dr. Poulson said the Chinese project, called Dragonfly, had several \u201cdisturbing components.\u201d A prototype, he said, would allow a partner company in China to view a person\u2019s search history based on his or her phone number. He said the project also censored an extensive list of subjects that included information about air quality and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping.He also pointed lawmakers to commitments Google made as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. Google, among other requirements, must submit to regular privacy audits and follow a comprehensive privacy program under the settlement. The privacy program includes reviews of all Google products for privacy issues before they are released.Google\u2019s privacy reviewers are assigned to analyze Google code and make sure it does not violate user privacy. But after Dragonfly became public, several reviewers said they had signed off on sections of code for Dragonfly without fully understanding the project or its privacy implications, according to two people familiar with the process. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationships at the company.The reviewers, they said, felt that pertinent information about Dragonfly\u2019s code had been withheld from them, and raised questions about the review process that went unanswered.In his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Enright said Google was not close to releasing a search product in China.\u201cIf we were, in fact, to finalize a plan to launch a search product in China, my team would be actively engaged,\u201d he said. \u201cOur privacy and security controls would be followed, and any such project or product would follow and be consistent with our values in privacy and data protection.\u201d\u201cInnovative uses of data shouldn\u2019t be presumptively unlawful just because they are unprecedented, but organizations must account for and mitigate potential harms,\u201d the framework says. \u201cThis includes taking particular care with sensitive information that can pose a significant risk. To enable organizations to develop effective mitigations, regulators should be clear about what constitutes a harm.\u201dGoogle left China in 2010, denouncing government censorship. That year the company also said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company\u2019s corporate infrastructure.\u201cIt should be pretty obvious that they should be asked what changed between 2010 and today,\u201d said Cynthia Wong, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Prosecutors Admit They Wrongly Accused Russian of Offering Sex for Republican Access", "Date": "2018-09-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Federal prosecutors have admitted that they wrongly accused Maria Butina, a Russian citizen now in custody on charges of illegally acting as a foreign agent, of offering to trade sex for a job as part of a covert effort by Russian government officials to infiltrate Republican circles in the United States.In a court filing late Friday, prosecutors in the United States attorney\u2019s office in Washington acknowledged that they had been \u201cmistaken\u201d in interpreting what were apparently joking text messages between Ms. Butina and a friend who had helped her renew her car insurance.Ms. Butina was charged this summer with conspiracy and illegally acting as an agent of the Russian government in what prosecutors have claimed was a secret campaign to try to influence high-level Republican politicians, including Donald J. Trump, both as a candidate and after his election. Denied bail, she is now in custody in the detention center in Alexandria, Va.Defense lawyers for Ms. Butina are arguing that the prosecutors\u2019 error is emblematic of a flawed federal case that has wrongly landed their client in pretrial custody. A federal judge is scheduled to review Ms. Butina\u2019s request that she be released from jail, as well as whether to impose a gag order, on Monday.\u201cI\u2019m glad they walked it back, but in a lot of ways, the damage is already done,\u201d Robert N.

In court filings, he has argued that his client engaged in innocent political activity but has now been falsely portrayed as a villain in a sensationalized spy drama. \u201cA simple Google search using the phrase \u2018Maria Butina and sex\u2019 yields over 300,000 hits,\u201d he said.In their latest filing, prosecutors argued that even if they had wrongly interpreted Ms. Butina\u2019s text messages to a friend, she should not be released from custody, because she was likely to flee the country. Since her arrest, they said, it has become even clearer that she was not simply a foreign graduate student with an interest in American politics, but a Russian operative.They said that Russian government emissaries had visited her at least six times in jail, and that Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, had complained twice about her prosecution to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \u201cThe actions of the Russian Federation and its officials toward the defendant have confirmed her relationship with, and value to, her own government,\u201d they said.Follow Sharon LaFraniere on Twitter @SharonLNYTMichael LaForgia contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York\u2019s Forgotten Waterways", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "Some of New York\u2019s scenic byways are navigable only by canoe. But if you\u2019re willing to brave the ticks, poison ivy and potential teenage make-out spots, the vistas are something else. Supported byNew York likes to think of itself as a city of skyscrapers and mighty avenues, but at another level it\u2019s really just a sloshing ground for muskrats and local waterfowl. Nathan Kensinger discovered how watery the city is when he started photographing New York\u2019s hidden landscapes.He\u2019d head for an undeveloped sliver of land, start whacking his way through the bushes, and pretty soon he would find himself in front of a stream or creek that did not exist on Google Maps. Even the neighbors often did not know it was there, he said.For Mr. Kensinger, 39, the challenge was clear: to follow the water from its source to the end, camera in hand, documenting unknown habitats, homes to beavers, oysters, herons, ospreys, sunken boats and other New York specimens. Some streams he could follow on foot; others required a canoe. Many involved an effort just to reach them.\u201cA lot of them are part of the sewage system, so any time it rains they get a lot of raw sewage flowing in,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise they\u2019re very nice waterways.\u201dHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know which of these I would swim in, but certainly you can canoe through them. You can now canoe on about five miles of the Bronx River. That was a surprise.\u201dHe found homeless camps, fishing platforms and hidden teenage hangouts. He found mounds of industrial litter and sounds of encroaching development. In Hawtree Creek by Jamaica Bay, he found waters that flooded the streets at high tide during a full moon.Most heartening, he found community groups and public agencies working to reclaim the environments after decades of contamination and neglect.But as some waterways returned, others were disappearing because of rising sea levels, which are overtaking wetland areas, Mr. Kensinger said.\u201cAll have their own interesting, fascinating histories,\u201d he said. \u201cAll have a beginning, middle and end.\u201d\u201cMore people should know about this landscape,\u201d he added. \u201cIncreasingly, people are going to be forced to deal with them, especially as sea levels begin to rise. They run through residential neighborhoods. But people are not even aware of the waterway in their backyard.\u201dMr. Kensinger is doing his part to change that, one toxic cleanup site \u2014 in progress or not \u2014 at a time.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, China\u2019s Richest Man, to Retire From Company He Co-Founded", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Alibaba\u2019s co-founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, said he planned to step down from the Chinese e-commerce giant on Monday to pursue philanthropy in education, a changing of the guard for the $420 billion internet company.\u201cHe\u2019s a symbol of the health of China\u2019s private sector and how high they can fly whether he likes it or not,\u201d Duncan Clark, author of the book \u201cAlibaba: The House Jack Ma Built,\u201d said of Mr. Ma. \u201cHis retirement will be interpreted as frustration or concern whether he likes it or not.\u201dIn an interview, Mr. Ma said his retirement is not the end of an era but \u201cthe beginning of an era.\u201d He said he would be spending more of his time and fortune focused on education. \u201cI love education,\u201d he said.Mr. Ma will remain on Alibaba\u2019s board of directors and continue to mentor the company\u2019s management. Mr. Ma turns 54 on Monday, which is also a holiday in China known as Teacher\u2019s Day.The retirement makes Mr. Ma one of the first founders among a generation of prominent Chinese internet entrepreneurs to step down from their companies. Firms including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com have flourished in recent years, growing to nearly rival American internet behemoths like Amazon and Google in their size, scope and ambition. For Chinese tycoons to step aside in their 50s is rare; they usually remain at the top of their organizations for many years.Mr. Ma, a natural salesman and charismatic leader, co-founded Alibaba with 17 others \u2014 some of them his students \u2014 out of his apartment in Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province in 1999.Alibaba started as an online marketplace for businesses to sell their products to other businesses. But it did not take off until it began the Taobao marketplace in 2003, which merchants used to sell goods directly to consumers. Alibaba later rolled out Alipay, an online payment service, to facilitate transactions in a country where few people had credit cards. Alipay later became Ant Financial, the financial subsidiary that Mr. Ma also controls.Today, Alibaba\u2019s empire encompasses e-commerce, online banking, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment \u2014 and even a corporate messaging service similar to Slack. The company owns or holds stakes in some of China\u2019s most important media assets, including the Twitter-like social media site Weibo and the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper The South China Morning Post.Among China\u2019s biggest companies, Alibaba is viewed as one of the firms with the deepest ranks of management talent. Many of the co-founders are still around, and professionals who joined the company later are now in charge.While Alibaba has become dominant in China, it has faced a tougher time expanding internationally. The company has increased its presence outside of China by investing in e-commerce and online finance companies in India and Southeast Asia. But its efforts to muscle into the United States largely have not been successful.As Beijing has increased its involvement in the private sector, Mr. Ma has shifted what he has said about China\u2019s government. He used to say that businesses should be in love with the government but never get married to each other, indicating that an arms-length relationship was preferred.At a conference last November, Mr. Ma was more positive. \u201cThere\u2019s no country like China in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cWith political stability, social safety and 6 percent-plus economic growth, we have the best business environment.\u201dAs Alibaba has flourished, Mr. Ma has talked many times about how he did not want to spend his whole life at the company, saying he would retire one day and go back to teaching.In 2014, he created the Jack Ma Foundation, which has worked to improve education in rural China. Mr. Ma\u2019s Weibo social media handle is \u201cspokesman for village teachers \u2014 Jack Ma.\u201d Within Alibaba, he is known and referred to as \u201cTeacher Ma.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will the Real Stan Smith Please Stand Up?", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBefore he became sneaker famous, the retired tennis player won two Grand Slam championships and was ranked No. 1 in the world. John Lennon wore them. Jay-Z rapped about them. Naomi Campbell posed nude in them. Forty years after Adidas introduced Stan Smith sneakers, the simple white-and-green design has not only become a cultural icon, but also has overshadowed the man himself. We caught up with Mr. Smith, who is 71 and lives in Hilton Head, S.C., to talk about tennis, his sneaker collection and fame.When you Google \u201cStan Smith,\u201d the Adidas sneaker website comes up before your Wikipedia page. How does that make you feel? It\u2019s really the purpose of the book, in a way: to show how the shoe has grabbed people from all sorts of different backgrounds and cultures and interests and dress and countries. It\u2019s really interesting to see that the shoe has made a big impact.Are you surprised that your legacy is as much about fashion as tennis?If you had asked me back when I was 20 years old, that would have been a little bit of a joke, I think. Even being a great player at that time would have been a joke as well. But my career has been good. It\u2019s not a Roger Federer or a Rafael Nadal career, but I was No. 1 in the world at one time, so that\u2019s what I always thought my legacy would be: being a decent tennis player.In the book\u2019s introduction, Pharrell refers to the shoe as a \u201ccommon denominator.\u201d Why do you think that is?I think it\u2019s because it\u2019s very simple, and I\u2019m a fairly simple guy myself. It doesn\u2019t have a lot of bells and whistles, but it\u2019s clean. You\u2019ve got preppies in Connecticut that are wearing it, and you\u2019ve got the hip-hop music people in the city. You normally wouldn\u2019t see that. The other thing that\u2019s very funny is that you would never see a 13-year-old girl wearing something that her mother is wearing. Not only the mother, but the father, the grandfather, the babies. Do you consider yourself a fashion person? To be quite honest, I would say I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a fashion person. I think I\u2019ve become more aware of fashion, but that was certainly not something I set out to be when I was a young guy. How many Stan Smiths do you own?Upward of around 60-ish. I wish I\u2019d kept the ones early on that I wore in 1972. I never really thought the shoe would be around for another 46 years.Whose feet were you most excited to see your shoes on?Raf Simons, of course, was one of the collaborators. He said, at one time, he wore the shoes every day for 10 years. Usher once said that he got my shoes in every color. You see Harrison Ford, you\u2019ve seen John Lennon. Even now, we have the president\u2019s wife wearing the shoes. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s good or bad.At the end of the book, there\u2019s a portrait series by Juergen Teller. What was that like? He\u2019s a piece of work! Very controversial. I did some investigations, and people kept telling me, \u201cWell, just make sure you keep your clothes on!\u201d He was great. He had a beautiful studio that he had just created right in the middle of a neighborhood that fulfilled all of his needs. That was a fun day. He\u2019s a very creative guy, obviously, and great to work with.In his introductory essay, Gary Aspden, a creative consultant for Adidas, writes: \u201cWhen Raf Simons collaborated with Adidas on the Stan Smith it appears that he understood that good design isn\u2019t necessarily about what is added, but is often about what isn\u2019t added.\u201d Let\u2019s get meta here: Can that same philosophy be applied to tennis?I look at the greatest player maybe ever to play, and that\u2019s Roger Federer. He makes the game look easy. He\u2019s very efficient, very smooth. If you put music to Roger, you\u2019d have a bit of ballet. He keeps it simple, there\u2019s not a lot of extra movement. You kind of can relate that to the shoe idea: It\u2019s very simple, it\u2019s economic, it\u2019s not flashy. Has that philosophy informed your own life? It really has. I\u2019ve got four wonderful children, a great wife. I\u2019ve tried to really live by the basics of my faith, and teach my basics to my kids. And now we have 13 grandkids. To really understand the fundamentals of life, and how to treat people and how to act: It\u2019s all very basic stuff that\u2019s important to me and that\u2019s been important to my family.How have your children and grandchildren handled your sneaker fame? When my daughter was 14, she came home from school and said, \u201cDad, you\u2019re famous!\u201d I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She said, \u201cJay-Z has you in one of his songs!\u201d I said, \u201cWell, that\u2019s great. Who\u2019s Jay-Z?\u201d This interview has been edited and condensed. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Don\u2019t Force Google to Export Other Countries\u2019 Laws", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApplying national rules worldwide would change the internet beyond recognition.Ms. Keller is a lawyer at Stanford Law School\u2019s Center for Internet and Society. Unfortunately, the chances are pretty good that Google will lose \u2014 that the court will order the company to make certain information harder to find. For example, if you are in the United States and you use Google to search for a New York Times article that has been removed from European versions of the search engine, that article will no longer appear in your results.We should be equally worried, however, about the prospect of platforms like Google and Facebook, with their international reach and pervasive role in our lives, doing the bidding of governments around the world.For now, very few countries are asking online platforms to enforce their national laws elsewhere. And the courts that are considering worldwide removal orders mostly sit in democratic and rights-respecting countries. That should give us some hope for better outcomes in those cases. But it also means that their decisions will carry a lot of weight, and set expectations for other national courts and lawmakers about their own power to make platforms globally remove content.Governments around the world know that while online platforms have historically enabled the free flow of information, that needn\u2019t be the case forever. Technical intermediaries can just as easily become choke points, shutting down communication on prohibited topics. Governments of any country have at least some leverage to make this happen: National internet service providers can cut off access entirely. In 2016, for example, Malaysia blocked the entire Medium blogging platform for refusing to delete a London-based journalist\u2019s accounts of corruption in the Malaysian government.That kind of showdown is rare, though. As a matter of both law and international relations, few countries are willing to insist that the rest of the world be bound by their rules. Things should stay that way \u2014 particularly among countries whose laws meet international human rights standards, and vary only in interpreting things like the balance between privacy and speech rights.We would all suffer under a system in which any country could export its own rules through private online platforms. Let\u2019s hope that the European Court of Justice sees things that way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "5 Functional Smartwatches Chic Enough for Everyday Wear", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinding a smartwatch that balances form and function can be difficult, but these five options offer the features you need to track activity, play music and more \u2014 without weighing down your wrist.While many high-tech wearable devices have tried to embrace good looks and great features, many of today\u2019s smartwatches sacrifice form for function every time. They can be aggressively large (especially for small wrists) and don\u2019t retain any of the class or refined chic of a regular timepiece. So, if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s looking for a happy medium for your wrist (and your wallet), here are some stylish smartwatches that\u2019ll mix well with any outfit and track your steps at the same time. Keep in mind, however, some of these don\u2019t necessarily have all the features that bigger smartwatches do, so you may have to compromise.Some other great features of the watch include 4GB of storage, so you can store music and play it wirelessly through Bluetooth; the ability to track steps, sleep and calories burned; and a supposed 24-hour battery life. You can use Google Assistant by long pressing on the watch crown to reply to messages with your voice and do other tasks. Bonus: You can download the \u201cchoose your look\u201d app, answer a few questions like the color of your outfit and get a watch face for the day that complements your look.The watch isn\u2019t without downsides, however. It doesn\u2019t include a heart-rate monitor, GPS or near-field communication (NFC), which is used for mobile payments like Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. Also, iPhone owners, you\u2019re limited in what you can do with the watch compared with Android users. Still, if the Kate Spade style resonates with you, and those are the features you need, the Scallop Touchscreen smartwatch comes in three styles and retails between $275 and $325.Also, the bezel around the Gear S3\u2019s face can move and perform a variety of actions like adjust the volume or answer a phone call. It also has two side buttons: One opens apps while the other functions as a back button. The Gear S3 also comes with an always-on display, which is both a blessing and a curse (it can kill your battery much faster).Another downside is Samsung\u2019s insistence on making the consumer download apps from its app store to use the watch to its full capabilities. The watch starts at $269.99, with different prices for the cellular-enabled models depending on your wireless carrier.The Explorist is the bigger of the two and comes in six styles varying from a \u201csmoke stainless steel\u201d to one in navy leather. It also has three buttons, two of which are customizable: The middle button activates Google Assistant if you hold it down, and otherwise functions as a way to return to the default watch face (the Venture, on the other hand, has only this button). The Venture comes in 10 colors and styles. Both watches range in price from $179 to $193.Both watches lack GPS and heart-rate sensors, so they\u2019re not ideal for anyone looking for a smartwatch that\u2019s also a true fitness tracker (and, they have water resistance only up to one meter). Of course, if you buy the regular Apple Watch, you can customize it by buying additional bands you can change out to suit your style (or a particular look). In any case, you\u2019ll get a watch that is water-resistant up to 50 meters (about 160 feet), meaning you can go swimming with it. It also comes with 8GB of storage. While some of these watches don\u2019t include every single feature that some other models cram together, at the very least they won\u2019t take over your wrist or remind you \u2014 or everyone you meet \u2014 that you\u2019re wearing a mini computer at all times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Apple Thrived in a Season of Tech Scandals", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut this year, as it begins to roll out a new set of iPhones, the story line surrounding Apple has improbably shifted. In an era of growing skepticism about the tech industry\u2019s impact on society, Apple\u2019s business model is turning out to be its most lasting advantage.Because Apple makes money by selling phones rather than advertising, it has been able to hold itself up as a guardian against a variety of digital plagues: a defender of your privacy, an agitator against misinformation and propaganda, and even a plausible warrior against tech addiction, a problem enabled by the very irresistibility of its own devices.Though it is already more profitable than any of its rivals, Apple appears likely to emerge even stronger from tech\u2019s season of crisis. In the long run, its growing strength could profoundly alter the industry.For years, start-ups aiming for consumer audiences modeled themselves on Google and Facebook, offering innovations to the masses at rock-bottom prices, if not for free. But there are limits to the free-lunch model.If Apple\u2019s more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech\u2019s dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks.\u201cBecause of Apple\u2019s business model \u2014 because their money comes from their profitable hardware \u2014 it has been much easier for them to make certain choices and certain arguments about how to address problems in the industry,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, a technology research firm.The thrust of Apple\u2019s message is simple: Paying directly for technology is the best way to ensure your digital safety, and every fresh danger uncovered online is another reason to invest in the Apple way of life.These aren\u2019t new arguments for Apple. While Google and Facebook pursued globe-spanning scale by offering free or cheap services supported by ads, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, was warning of the risks of an internet advertising market run amok.Though their businesses keep chugging along, Facebook and Google, the world\u2019s biggest internet ad companies, now face global scrutiny for the spread of disinformation, propaganda and what critics say is their products\u2019 destabilizing effects on politics and society.Amazon is beloved by customers, but its rapid growth has spurred economywide anxieties about the future of jobs. All three behemoths are considered growing targets for antitrust prosecution in the United States and elsewhere.Apple\u2019s business model, by contrast, insulates it from most of the tech fears that have emerged in the last few years. Although it makes the vast majority of the profits in the global smartphone business, Apple\u2019s phones account for a minority of sales, blunting fears of monopoly.Apple\u2019s high prices also set up an expectation of safety, giving it a freer hand to police online properties like its app store, podcast directory and news app. A decade ago, when Mr. Jobs imposed rules on the iOS App Store banning scammy and pornographic apps, he was called a prude. Now his rules seem prescient.Its commitment to curating online experiences has also turned Apple into something like a moral arbiter for tech. When Apple decided to bar the right-wing conspiracist Alex Jones from its services this summer, it cut through much of the hand-wringing in the industry over Mr. Jones\u2019s antics. Many other tech companies immediately followed its move.Apple has not entirely escaped criticism in the Trump era. Its reliance on China, where it makes its products and expects to see much of its growth, and where its products abide by government censors, looks to be a rising liability.Even when Apple\u2019s products have been directly implicated in tech worries, its business model has helped it weather the storm. Consider the rising fears of \u201ctech addiction,\u201d the idea that kids and adults are spending too much mindless time in the digital world, egged on by tech companies\u2019 insatiable need for our eyeballs.In January, a pair of large Apple investors, Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, wrote an open letter to Apple urging the company to address the issue. Charles Penner, a partner at Jana, told me that the campaign had targeted Apple because the company had every reason to respond.\u201cThe biggest source of strength that Apple has is their ability to charge premium prices for their products,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir value depends on people feeling safe and supported within their ecosystem.\u201dAnd, in fact, Apple responded. The company told the investors that it believed the overuse of tech was a serious issue, and that it had been working on it. In the summer, it unveiled a series of widely praised features meant to allow adults to police their own and their kids\u2019 smartphone habits.Google, apparently spurred by the same campaign, offered similar features for its Android phones. Mr. Penner told me that he appreciated the companies\u2019 efforts, though he expects to keep pushing them to reduce their devices\u2019 addictiveness.Apple\u2019s safety-first business model may become only more important as technology becomes even more intimate. The company\u2019s latest phones can be unlocked with your face, while its watch includes sophisticated sensors to monitor your movements and your health. In pushing these and other advances, the company can reasonably argue that only its ad-free business can protect such sensitive information.But it is worth noting that Apple\u2019s model isn\u2019t available to everyone. In the spring, after Mr. Cook took a few swipes at Facebook\u2019s scandals, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, pointed out the inherent limits in Apple\u2019s model.Since then, Apple has raised the prices of its top-end phones, and as the smartphone market slows, the company\u2019s pristine haven from the dangers of online life might get only more expensive.Inequality is the story of our age, and it\u2019s no surprise that it could become the dominant story line of tech, too. As the digital world gets scarier, Apple\u2019s technology may come to resemble a high-priced oasis for the world\u2019s rich. Everyone else takes their chances on a free lunch.Advertisement"}

This is bad. The suffering of victims does not excuse or justify mob rule.

{"Headline": "What Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg Taught Congress and Vice Versa", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtWe are at a consequential juncture in the technology business and in society.A handful of tech giants have become the guardians of global speech, amplifying certain kinds of voices and limiting others according to their own bespoke, often opaque and shifting standards. Although these companies \u2014 Facebook, Google and Twitter above all \u2014 are now integral to just about every corner of our lives, they face little regulatory oversight in the United States. It was only after the last presidential election that lawmakers even began expressing interest in the companies\u2019 power.So when Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, took the hot seat in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, I worried we would spend the bulk of the time talking about conspiracy theories peddled by the provocateur Alex Jones. Surprisingly, that was not the case.A cynic might point out that the hearings arrived at few solutions to the thorny problems they raised. Yet in highlighting the complexities of their systems, Mr. Dorsey\u2019s and Ms. Sandberg\u2019s testimony helped underscore the difficulties lawmakers will face in figuring out ways to ensure that tech companies are guarding people\u2019s political freedoms and privacy while protecting their services from those who would spread misinformation and propaganda.Contrary to much of what is happening in Washington these days, Wednesday\u2019s tech hearings showed a political system earnestly wrestling with issues for which there are no easy answers. They also showed two companies, whether out of embarrassment or fear or brand management, seriously engaging with lawmakers\u2019 worries and guiding them though the thicket of issues involved.But what about the third company, Google? And what about the big question: Are these hearings leading toward anything like a workable tech-policy solution to regulating how tech companies operate?Let\u2019s try to answer them.Google is the world\u2019s largest digital advertising company, and it runs the world\u2019s largest search engine and video site, among lots of other things you use all the time. But it was represented in the Senate Intelligence Committee by an empty chair.The committee had asked for a top executive to testify \u2014 either Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder and the chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet, or Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google. Google instead offered its chief lawyer, Kent Walker, who it argued was better versed in the issues. That didn\u2019t fly with the committee, hence the spectacle of the empty chair.In a statement, Google said of offering up Mr. Walker: \u201cWe had informed the Senate Intelligence Committee of this in late July and had understood that he would be an appropriate witness for this hearing.\u201dOne worry among Twitter employees was that Mr. Dorsey would bow too far toward Republican lawmakers\u2019 trumped-up charges of bias against conservatives. He did not do that. What he did instead was more useful. In several answers, Mr. Dorsey explained the many ways in which Twitter had failed its users.My notes from the hearings are full of instances in which Mr. Dorsey admitted serious flaws. \u201cI believe if you were to go to our rules today and sit down with a cup of coffee, you would not be able to understand them,\u201d he said at one point.The candor seemed to work. Even some of the most skeptical lawmakers sounded impressed by Mr. Dorsey\u2019s willingness to engage. Representative Joe L. Barton, a Texas Republican who focused almost entirely on the theory that Twitter was limiting conservative voices, congratulated Mr. Dorsey on his appearance \u201cwithout subpoena, and sitting there all by yourself \u2014 that\u2019s refreshing.\u201dAt the heart of these hearings was a perplexing question, one that was rarely addressed: What power does Congress have to regulate how tech companies manage their services?Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the 1996 law that governs much of online conduct, tech firms enjoy broad immunity from liability stemming from what users post on their services. There\u2019s general agreement among people in tech that the law has been crucial to the internet\u2019s rise: Because they cannot be sued for defamation or libel for what people put online, companies like Facebook and YouTube were able to achieve planetary scale.Would it be a good idea, now that these companies are so big and powerful, to limit that kind of immunity? Should Congress try to wrest more control over how these companies manage their services \u2014 perhaps to gain transparency and maybe, in the way the Federal Communications Commission once did with television and radio, to ensure some kind of \u201cfairness\u201d in the way they affect political speech?A few lawmakers broached these ideas on Wednesday, but none wrestled with the central difficulties. Some of the thorniest involve the First Amendment, which prevents the government from dictating or censoring speech. Although tech companies, being private services, are free to limit any speech they want on their networks, it was unclear if Congress has any basis for requiring certain fairness or speech policies from them.\u201cI just don\u2019t think we\u2019ve begun to wrestle with the deep constitutional issues here,\u201d David Pozen, a constitutional law professor at Columbia Law School, said. He pointed out that tech companies themselves enjoyed a First Amendment right against the government\u2019s imposing rules on their services.\u201cThese are real, serious issues that some of us have been working on for a very long time, and they\u2019ve been stewing and ripening without resolution,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you can say, now that people are finally paying attention, that we are maybe stumbling toward some better understanding of what\u2019s involved.\u201dAdvertisement"}

On one wall, a half-dozen televisions will be tuned to CNN, MSNBC, Fox News and other major networks. A small paper sign with orange lettering taped to the glass door describes what\u2019s being built: \u201cWar Room.\u201dAlthough it is not much to look at now, as of next week the space will be Facebook\u2019s headquarters for safeguarding elections. More than 300 people across the company are working on the initiative, but the War Room will house a team of about 20 focused on rooting out disinformation, monitoring false news and deleting fake accounts that may be trying to influence voters before elections in the United States, Brazil and other countries.\u201cWe see this as probably the biggest companywide reorientation since our shift from desktops to mobile phones,\u201d said Samidh Chakrabarti, who leads Facebook\u2019s elections and civic engagement team. The company, he added, \u201chas mobilized to make this happen.\u201dAlready, foreign operatives have evolved their online influence campaigns to skirt the measures Facebook has put in place ahead of the midterms, said Priscilla Moriuchi, director of strategic threat development at the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.\u201cIf you look at the way that foreign influence operations have changed these last two years, their focus isn\u2019t really on propagating fake news anymore,\u201d Ms. Moriuchi said. \u201cIt\u2019s on augmenting stories already out there which speak to hyperpartisan audiences.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder for companies like Facebook and Twitter, from my perspective, to find them now.\u201dFacebook invited two New York Times reporters into the War Room before it opens next week to discuss the work of the elections team and some of the tools it has developed to try to prevent interference. The company limited the scope of what The Times could see and publish out of a concern about revealing too much to adversaries who may be looking for vulnerabilities. The company said the War Room was modeled after operations used by political campaigns, which are typically set up in the final weeks before Election Day.The War Room is a \u201cproactive\u201d way to build systems in anticipation of attacks, Greg Marra, a product manager working on Facebook\u2019s News Feed, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday.One of the tools the company is introducing is custom software that helps track information flowing across the social network in real time, said Mr. Chakrabarti, who joined Facebook about four years ago from Google.These dashboards resemble a set of line and bar graphs, with statistics that provide a view into how activity on the platform is changing. They allow employees to zero in on, say, a specific false news story in wide circulation or a spike in automated accounts being created in a particular geographic area.The dashboards were first tested before of the special United States Senate election in Alabama in December. Without specifying the dashboards, Mr. Zuckerberg has said a new tool helped Facebook identify political interference more quickly in that election.Since then, Facebook has tested and redesigned the software during multiple elections worldwide. This month, before Brazil\u2019s presidential election, the company will introduce the newest versions of the dashboards, Mr. Chakrabarti said.Facebook created what it calls its elections and civic engagement team in 2007 to work with governments and campaigns on how they could use the social network most effectively. For a long time, the team numbered just a few dozen people in Silicon Valley; it expanded in 2013 to include members in other offices outside the United States.Since then, the team has mushroomed to its current size, augmented by other people at the company whose jobs involve some aspect of stopping election interference. Facebook has said each of its units \u2014 including Instagram and WhatsApp \u2014 has been told to make election security a top priority when designing products.Mr. Chakrabarti meets several times a month with Facebook\u2019s top executives, engineers and product managers. The meetings often include Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer.Facebook decided this year to create a War Room so that a core group of engineers, data scientists, and executives could sit together in the same space before the midterms. They chose an empty conference room off the hallway that connects Building 20 and Building 21, a central point on Facebook\u2019s campus that is easy for employees to get to.Construction began a few months ago, and the room, with its whiteboard walls and clusters of long tables, is set to open for operations on Monday. It has been refitted with cables and internet boosters, and new wiring was installed for the monitors and other equipment.What happens in the War Room will be a \u201clast line of defense\u201d for Facebook engineers to quickly spot unforeseen problems on and near election days in different countries, Mr. Chakrabarti said. Many of the company\u2019s other measures are meant to stop disinformation and other problems long before they show up in the War Room.Once a problem reaches the War Room, the dashboards will be set to spot and track unusual activity, while data scientists and security experts take a closer look. Mr. Chakrabarti said the team was particularly on guard for posts that manifested \u201creal-world harm,\u201d and planned to remove posts that tried to disenfranchise voters by giving incorrect polling data or spreading hoaxes like encouraging people to vote by text message.\u201cThe best outcome for us is that nothing happens in the War Room,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything else we are doing is defenses we are putting down to stop this in the first place.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Crowded London Streets, Councils Fight a Flood of Phone Boxes", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The British telephone box is not dead yet. In parts of central London, a box stands sentinel every 100 feet \u2014 and if phone companies got their way, they\u2019d plant one every 50 feet.But these are not the red cast-iron cubicles that for generations were emblems of Britain. Instead, critics say, they are eyesores, covered in digital ad screens and capable of being turned into surveillance posts.Worst of all, perhaps, some are being imported from New York.The result is a battle over Britain\u2019s public space, waged between local city planners and telecommunications firms. The most contentious fight is in Westminster, in the heart of London, where new phone kiosks are being squished between construction barriers and bus stops on crowded streets.The classic red booths, with domed roofs and molded royal crowns, were rendered obsolete by the rise of mobile phones. Yet, phone companies never relinquished their rights to the sidewalk. Under British rules that have effectively been in place since before the iPhone existed, phone boxes are still considered vital infrastructure, and companies with proper licenses can keep building them so long as local councils cannot credibly object to the particular site or design.And so the phone companies set about to put up a new kind of booth: two-sided digital displays with internet connectivity and touch-screen maps that flash craft beer and credit card ads \u2014 and also have a phone attached.\u201cA lot of them are advertising totems with a telephone handset on it,\u201d said John Walker, the director of planning for Westminster City Council. \u201cThey\u2019re just a blot on the landscape.\u201dSome councils are being flooded with phone box proposals at numbers 900 percent higher than a few years ago, according to an association of councils in England and Wales. Companies have submitted proposals for 300 new and replacement kiosks in the last two years in Westminster alone, where the boxes already stand six to a block on a stretch of busy Edgware Road.The councils are lobbying the central government to change the law.Some of the proposals in Westminster are for traditional booths with a wall for advertising. Others, like the New York imports, called InLink kiosks, are sleek-looking internet-connected posts with touch-screen maps and electronic signs that flash at passers-by while also, privacy advocates say, harvesting data from their phones. They\u2019re a collaboration between BT, the descendant of British Telecom; Intersection, a smart cities firm with links to Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet; and an outdoor advertising giant.Planning documents say the InLink kiosks are expected to be able to \u201canonymously monitor\u201d things like \u201cpedestrian movement,\u201d raising concern that they can follow anyone whose phone passes within Wi-Fi range. The kiosks also come equipped with cameras, though BT says they have not yet been turned on.The new boxes would join or, in some cases, replace a hodgepodge of grimy 1990s-era phone boxes already on the street.And because each of London\u2019s 33 local authorities deals separately with planning, it falls to teams of local planners to sift through stacks of phone box proposals.Mr. Walker said they arrive at his Westminster office in paper stacks dozens at a time, sometimes just before the Christmas holiday. Then the clock starts ticking: 56 days until, in the absence of an objection from the council, the phone company has the right to start work.Establishing credible objections is a laborious process, forcing planners to solicit input from nearby businesses and traffic specialists. The phone companies often promise to remove two 1990s-era boxes for every new one they add, but Mr. Walker said Westminster did not want any, period.Matthew Carmona, a professor of planning and urban design at University College London, said the situation \u201chas, in a way, caught policymakers by surprise.\u201d After removing phone boxes that fell into disuse with the rise of mobile phones, he said, \u201cthe phone companies have realized they can make money from them in a different way, and in doing that they can bypass any regulations.\u201dSarah Gaventa, a former design adviser to the British government, said a public art project she was working on had required dozens of applications to seven different local authorities, a barrier that she said did not exist in other major European cities.London, on the other hand, has largely been left to watch as rival companies vie for space on the streets.By replacing old booths with internet-connected kiosks, the phone companies say they are decluttering streets and giving Britons and tourists alike modern tools for navigating the city, resulting in more calls and frequent use of the touch screens. Neil Scoresby, BT\u2019s general manager for pay phones and InLink, said the company complied with planning laws and, on occasion, agreed to remove a box a council didn\u2019t want.InLink said the company only stores unique identifiers for people\u2019s phones after they sign up for the service and does not currently track pedestrian movement.Westminster City Council has rejected around 175 applications for additional or replacement phone boxes over the past two years. But the phone companies can appeal to a government planning inspector to erect them anyway.Now, the Westminster council is seeking broader powers. It filed a claim in the High Court of Justice in August seeking to force the planning inspector to consider, beyond the site and appearance of new boxes, whether there was a need for them.Mr. Walker said the Westminster council has a better idea about what to add when old phone boxes get yanked out: \u201cWe\u2019d rather have a tree,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But Energy Data Is Relentless.", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech We\u2019re usingAlternative power sources have upended the electric grid. Ivan Penn, who covers the beat, discusses the changes and how he keeps track of them.How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ivan Penn, who covers alternative energy for The Times from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Q. A lot of alternative energy is basically technology. What are some of the most unusual ideas around alternative energy you've seen break out over the years?But storage isn\u2019t the only focus. Engineers continue to study other forms of energy, like capturing the power of ocean waves. And some countries are using the internet for peer-to-peer electricity trading of the solar power they generate.Battery technology is something that everyone wants to see improve. What are the challenges to broader deployment of batteries in the energy sector?The biggest issue has been cost. Batteries have been very expensive, but that\u2019s changing fairly quickly. Just as with the rapid drop in price in solar panels, batteries to store electricity have rapidly declined in cost, most likely making them more affordable within the next few years.California is also likely to be a major driver in the expansion of battery storage. The State Assembly recently passed a measure to provide about $1 billion to help homeowners purchase batteries for their homes. The state created a similar program for solar that led to one million solar roofs and helped make California by far the leader in residential solar installations.How has tech changed the power grid as a whole?Just in the last decade, the 100-year model of utilities producing electricity and selling power to consumers was turned on its head. Improvements in solar panel efficiency and lower product cost enabled consumers on a wide scale to produce their own power and sell it back to the electric grid.The grid was never designed to be a two-way street. So that has led to a reimagining of it. Utility companies must rethink the services they provide. No longer just power companies, utilities provide new services like vehicle charging stations for the growing number of electric cars.Along with producing their own power, people now benefit from improvements in energy efficiency, which has resulted in flat or reduced electricity use across the country \u2014 another adjustment for the power companies. Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, highly efficient appliances and smart technology have changed the way we use power.What kind of tech setup do you have for work? The alternative energy beat often is data driven, so tech is critical. Google Sheets and Excel help me manage data from the United States Energy Information Administration, the Solar Energy Industries Association and the California Solar and Storage Association.I also check some of the latest developments in alternative energy on Greentechmedia.com and Utility Dive. And I consult the Electric Power Research Institute.Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love? How do you use it?Our house is full of computers, mostly Apple \u2014 MacBooks, iPads and iPhones \u2014 though we use other tablets as well. The gadgets get their fair share of schoolwork activity, but they\u2019re also tools of social media, music, art, websites, programming, Hulu and Netflix.Entertainment is big. So there are several gaming systems, old and more recent, like various Nintendo systems as well as Xbox.But as if all of that weren\u2019t enough, my sons built their own computer with money they made during the summer at a fast food chicken restaurant so they could play and make video games they hope to sell. So far they\u2019re planning more than developing, but perhaps that might fall under the category of research.How has the tech industry swept into Los Angeles? And how has the city changed as a result?Without a doubt, energy technology is a staple of Southern California, given that the state is the leader in solar power. Residential solar is prolific.But technology is really changing transportation. Of course, there are Uber and Lyft, but electric vehicles have also given rise to new companies like Tesloop, which will take you from Los Angeles to San Diego in a Tesla for as little as $29 (snacks included). Prices go as high as about $84, and all users have to do is register and request a ride online. My daughter sometimes uses the service to get to and from the University of California, San Diego, where she goes to school, or uses ride shares through social media.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Plot to Subvert an Election: Unraveling the Russia Story So Far", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "Police never identified who had hung the banners, but there were clues. The earliest promoters of the images on Twitter were American-sounding accounts, including @LeroyLovesUSA, later exposed as Russian fakes operated from St. Petersburg to influence American voters.The Kremlin, it appeared, had reached onto United States soil in New York and Washington. The banners may well have been intended as visual victory laps for the most effective foreign interference in an American election in history.For many Americans, the Trump-Russia story as it has been voluminously reported over the past two years is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics. What Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in charge of the investigation, may know or may yet discover is still uncertain. President Trump\u2019s Twitter outbursts that it is all a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary, have taken a toll on public comprehension.But to travel back to 2016 and trace the major plotlines of the Russian attack is to underscore what we now know with certainty: The Russians carried out a landmark intervention that will be examined for decades to come. Acting on the personal animus of Mr. Putin, public and private instruments of Russian power moved with daring and skill to harness the currents of American politics. Well-connected Russians worked aggressively to recruit or influence people inside the Trump campaign.To many Americans, the intervention seemed to be a surprise attack, a stealth cyberage Pearl Harbor, carried out by an inexplicably sinister Russia. For Mr. Putin, however, it was long-overdue payback, a justified response to years of \u201cprovocations\u201d from the United States.And there is a plausible case that Mr. Putin succeeded in delivering the presidency to his admirer, Mr. Trump, though it cannot be proved or disproved. In an election with an extraordinarily close margin, the repeated disruption of the Clinton campaign by emails published on WikiLeaks and the anti-Clinton, pro-Trump messages shared with millions of voters by Russia could have made the difference, a possibility Mr. Trump flatly rejects.As Mr. Trump emerged in spring 2016 as the improbable favorite for the Republican nomination, the Russian operation accelerated on three fronts \u2014 the hacking and leaking of Democratic documents; massive fraud on Facebook and Twitter; and outreach to Trump campaign associates.Consider 10 days in March. On March 15 of that year, Mr. Trump won five primaries, closing in on his party\u2019s nomination, and crowed that he had become \u201cthe biggest political story anywhere in the world.\u201d That same day in Moscow, a veteran hacker named Ivan Yermakov, a Russian military intelligence officer working for a secret outfit called Unit 26165, began probing the computer network of the Democratic National Committee. In St. Petersburg, shift workers posted on Facebook and Twitter at a feverish pace, posing as Americans and following instructions to attack Mrs. Clinton.On March 21 in Washington, Mr. Trump announced his foreign policy team, a group of fringe figures whose advocacy of warmer relations with Russia ran counter to Republican orthodoxy. Meanwhile, Unit 26165 was poring over the bounty from a separate attack it had just carried out: 50,000 emails stolen from the Clinton campaign\u2019s chairman.On March 24, one of the members of the Trump foreign policy team, George Papadopoulos, sat in the cafe of an upscale London hotel with a Russian woman who introduced herself as Mr. Putin\u2019s niece and offered to help set up a meeting between the Russian president and Mr. Trump. The woman and the adviser exchanged frequent messages in the weeks that followed. Today, Mr. Padadopoulos is unsure that those messages came from the person he met in the cafe.The Russian intervention was essentially a hijacking \u2014 of American companies like Facebook and Twitter; of American citizens\u2019 feelings about immigration and race; of American journalists eager for scoops, however modest; of the na\u00efve, or perhaps not so na\u00efve, ambitions of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. The Russian trolls, hackers and agents totaled barely 100, and their task was to steer millions of American voters. They knew it would take a village to sabotage an election.Russians or suspected Russian agents \u2014 including oligarchs, diplomats, former military officers and shadowy intermediaries \u2014 had dozens of contacts during the campaign with Mr. Trump\u2019s associates. They reached out through email, Facebook and Twitter. They sought introductions through trusted business connections of Mr. Trump\u2019s, obscure academic institutions, veterans groups and the National Rifle Association.They met Trump campaign aides in Moscow, London, New York and Louisville, Ky. One claimed the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton; another Russian, the Trump campaign was told, would deliver it. In May and June alone, the Trump campaign fielded at least four invitations to meet with Russian intermediaries or officials.In nearly every case, the Trump aides and associates seemed enthusiastic about their exchanges with the Russians. Over months of such probing, it seems that no one alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the foreign overtures.Whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates conspired with the Russians is a central question of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, who has already charged 26 Russians and won convictions or guilty pleas from the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; the former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and his deputy, Rick Gates; and from Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has pleaded guilty in a separate case.But none of the convictions to date involve conspiracy. There remains an alternative explanation to the collusion theory: that the Trump aides, far from certain their candidate would win, were happy to meet the Russians because they thought it might lead to moneymaking deals after the election. \u201cBlack Caviar,\u201d read the subject line of an email Mr. Manafort got in July 2016 from his associate in Kiev, Ukraine, hinting at the possibility of new largess from a Russian oligarch with whom they had done business.Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School and the great-granddaughter of the Soviet premier Nikita S. Khrushchev, said that what Russia pulled off, through creativity and sheer luck, would have been the envy of Mr. Putin\u2019s predecessors: puncturing the American sense of superiority and insisting on Russia\u2019s power and place in the world.\u201cThis operation was to show the Americans \u2014 that you bastards are just as screwed up as the rest of us,\u201d Professor Khrushcheva said. \u201cPutin fulfilled the dream of every Soviet leader \u2014 to stick it to the United States. I think this will be studied by the K.G.B.\u2019s successors for a very long time.\u201dDirect contactswith Russians byTrump officialsJUNE 16, 2015Trump announcescandidacyTime2016Russian socialmedia fraudRussianhackingDenials ofwrongdoing byTrump and associatesMAY 26, 2016Trump clinchesnominationNOV. 8, 2016Trump winselectionFederalinvestigation ofRussian meddlingJAN. 20, 2017InaugurationJANUARY2018SEPTEMBER2018Continuing\u2026JUNE 2015TrumpannouncescandidacyDirect contactswith RussiansTimeRussiansocial mediafraud2016RussianhackingMAY 2016Trump clinchesnominationELECTIONFederalinvestigationINAUGURATIONDenials ofwrongdoing byTrump and associatesJANUARY2018SEPTEMBER2018By The New York TimesSee the full timeline of events.The Russian leader thought the United States, and Hillary Clinton, had sought to undermine his presidency.The first Russian advance party was tiny: two women on a whirlwind American tour. Hitting nine states in three weeks in summer 2014, Anna Bogacheva and Aleksandra Krylova were supposed to \u201cgather intelligence\u201d to help them mimic Americans on Facebook and Twitter. They snapped photos and chatted up strangers from California to New York, on a sort of Russian \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d road trip for the era of social media.Even then, federal prosecutors would later say, the Russian government was thinking about the next United States presidential election \u2014 perhaps ahead of most Americans. Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova had been dispatched by their employer, an online propaganda factory in St. Petersburg, to prepare to influence American voters.But why did Mr. Putin care about the election, then more than two years away? He was seething. The United States, in his view, had bullied and interfered with Russia for long enough. It was high time to fight back.His motives were rooted in Russia\u2019s ambivalence toward the West, captured in the history of St. Petersburg, Russia\u2019s spectacular northern city and Mr. Putin\u2019s hometown. Peter the Great, the brutal but westward-looking 18th-century czar, had brought in the best Italian architects to construct Russia\u2019s \u201cwindow on Europe\u201d in a swamp.Czar Peter\u2019s portrait replaced Vladimir Lenin\u2019s in Mr. Putin\u2019s office when he took a job working for the city\u2019s mayor in the early 1990s. Twenty-five years later, the internet offered a different kind of window on the West \u2014 a portal that could be used for a virtual invasion.Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, had described the breakup of the Soviet Union as the \u201cgreatest geopolitical catastrophe\u201d of the 20th century, a remarkable statement from a man whose country experienced revolution, civil war, bloody purges and the deaths of 27 million people in World War II. Like many of his fellow citizens, Mr. Putin was nostalgic for Russia\u2019s lost superpower status. And he resented what he saw as American arrogance.With little evidence, Mr. Putin believed this American meddling helped produce street demonstrations in Moscow and other cities in 2011, with crowds complaining of a rigged parliamentary election and chanting, \u201cPutin\u2019s a thief!\u201dRequired fields are marked with an asterisk.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.And Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, cheered the protesters on. Russians, she said, \u201cdeserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted, and that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.\u201dAfter Russian troops seized Crimea and carried out a stealth invasion of Ukraine in 2014, relations grew openly hostile. American support for the new government in Kiev and condemnation of Russian behavior heightened Mr. Putin\u2019s rage at being told what he could do and not do in what he considered his own backyard.If Russia had only a fraction of the United States\u2019 military might and nothing like its economic power, it had honed its abilities in hacking and influence operations through attacks in Eastern Europe. And it could turn these weapons on America to even the score.By making mischief in the 2016 election, Mr. Putin could wreak revenge on his enemy, Mrs. Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, damaging if not defeating her. He could highlight the polarized state of American democracy, making it a less appealing model for Russians and their neighbors. And he could send a message that Russia would not meekly submit to a domineering America.Hence the two Russian women who toured the United States in 2014, keyboard warriors granted the unusual privilege of real-world travel, hitting both coasts, Illinois, Louisiana and Texas. At that point, according to a Russian document cited by the special counsel, Mr. Putin\u2019s intentions for 2016 were already explicit: to \u201cspread distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d\u201cWho is behind these provocations?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe know that among them are employees of official American institutions.\u201dThen something unexpected happened. Of the more than 20 major-party candidates running for the American presidency, only Mr. Trump had repeatedly expressed admiration for Mr. Putin as a \u201cstrong\u201d leader and brushed off criticism of Russia. Only he had little interest in the traditional American preoccupation with democracy and human rights. Only he had explored business interests in Russia for years, repeatedly pursuing a Trump Tower project in Moscow and bringing his beauty pageant there in 2013.\u201cDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow,\u201d the future candidate tweeted at the time, adding wistfully, \u201cif so, will he become my new best friend?\u201dIf Mr. Putin had been designing his ideal leader for the United States, he could hardly have done better than Donald Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cby a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.\u201dAs Donald J. Trump emerged as the favorite for the nomination, his campaign brought on aides tied to Russia.Mr. Trump had steamrollered his primary opponents in part by taking aim at Republican foreign policy orthodoxy. The post-9/11 wars were foolish and costly, he would often say at campaign events. America\u2019s allies were deadbeats and freeloaders, he told supporters, who cheered in agreement. Russia was not an existential threat, he said, but a potential ally in beating back terrorist groups.They took particular umbrage at Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about the Russian president, writing that his \u201cadmiration for foreign dictators such as Vladimir Putin is unacceptable for the leader of the world\u2019s greatest democracy.\u201dBut Mr. Trump was not cowed. He soon signed on new advisers and aides, including some who had been pushed to the fringe of a political party that had long lionized President Ronald Reagan for staring down Soviet leaders at the height of the Cold War.To the Kremlin, they must have looked like a dream team.Mr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, had long viewed Russia as a natural ally in what he saw as a \u201cworld war\u201d against radical Islam. In June 2013, when he was D.I.A. chief, he sat inside the imposing headquarters of the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, and chatted with officers. Two years later, he sat at Mr. Putin\u2019s elbow at a gala dinner in Moscow.Mr. Manafort, a longtime Republican lobbyist, had earned millions working for a pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine and had a history of business dealings with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminum magnate close to Mr. Putin. He was nearly broke when he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 \u2014 hired to help prevent a mass defection of convention delegates \u2014 and yet he offered to work on the campaign unpaid.Carter Page, a businessman who spent several years working in Moscow, was virtually unknown in Washington when Mr. Trump appointed him a foreign policy adviser. But the S.V.R., Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, knew who he was.In 2013, Mr. Page met in New York with a Russian spy posing as an attach\u00e9 at the United Nations and passed along energy industry documents in hopes of securing lucrative deals in Moscow.The F.B.I., which had been tracking Russian spies when Mr. Page came on the bureau\u2019s radar, determined that he had no idea he was meeting with a Russian agent.The new team was in place by the end of March, and Mr. Trump had a new message that was strikingly similar to one of Mr. Putin\u2019s most ardent talking points.\u201cNATO\u2019s not meant for terrorism,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cNATO doesn\u2019t have the right countries in it for terrorism.\u201dBy then, the Russian intelligence operation to intervene in the American election \u2014 including efforts to infiltrate and influence the Trump campaign \u2014 had begun.Mr. Papadopoulos, the 28-year-old campaign adviser, did not know this when he met in the cafe of the London hotel with Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cniece\u201d (he has no niece) and an obscure Maltese professor in late March. The academic had taken an interest in Mr. Papadopoulos when he joined the campaign.F.B.I. agents have identified the professor, Joseph Mifsud, as a likely cutout for Russian intelligence, sent to establish contact with Mr. Papadopoulos and possibly get information about the direction of the Trump campaign. He disappeared after his name surfaced last October, and his whereabouts is unknown. At one point he changed his WhatsApp status to a simple, if cryptic, message: \u201cAlive.\u201dProfessor Mifsud arranged an email introduction between Mr. Papadopoulos and a Russian foreign ministry official. The American also exchanged emails with Olga Polonskaya, the woman in the cafe. \u201cWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d she wrote in one message, and the two discussed a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump.Over time, though, Mr. Papadopoulos came to question whether the messages were actually from Ms. Polonskaya. The woman he had met in the cafe barely spoke English. The emails he received were in nearly perfect English.\u201cI even remember sending her a message asking if I\u2019m speaking to the same person I met in London because the conversations were so strange,\u201d he said during an interview this month.In late April, Mr. Trump gave his first major foreign policy address in the ballroom of a historic Washington hotel. Some of the speech was a familiar litany of Republican policy positions \u2014 hawkish warnings to Iran and pledges to be tough on terrorism. But midway through the speech, as Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States watched from the front seats, Mr. Trump pivoted and said the United States and Russia should look for areas of mutual interest.\u201cCommon sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility, must end, and ideally will end soon,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the signal to meet,\u201d Mr. Papadopoulos wrote in an email to his Russian foreign ministry contact that evening, meaning that Mr. Trump\u2019s favorable comments about Russia suggested he might be interested in meeting Mr. Putin.Just one day earlier, Professor Mifsud had told the campaign aide about a possible gift from Moscow: thousands of hacked emails that might damage Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy.It was a breathtaking revelation. But there was no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos \u2014 while ambitious and eager for advancement in the bare-bones campaign \u2014 passed the information along to anyone inside the Trump circle.More than two years later, Mr. Papadopoulos says he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of telling anyone in the campaign about the emails. He said he was supposed to have a phone call that day with Stephen Miller, a top campaign adviser, but it was postponed. If the two men had talked, Mr. Papadopoulos said, he might have shared the information.\u201cHow fate works sometimes, I guess,\u201d said Mr. Papadopoulos, who has been sentenced to 14 days in jail for lying to the F.B.I.As Mr. Trump continued to win primaries and vacuum up convention delegates late in the spring, the Russians made multiple attempts to establish contact with campaign officials.A Republican operative connected to the N.R.A. tried to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and a Russian central banker at an N.R.A. convention in Kentucky in May. \u201cPutin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d wrote the operative, Paul Erickson, in an email with the subject \u201cKremlin connection.\u201d \u201cEver since Hillary compared Putin to Hitler, all senior Russian leaders consider her beyond redemption.\u201dMr. Page, the foreign policy adviser, was invited to deliver the commencement address at the prestigious New Economic School in Moscow. That invitation now appears to have been an effort both to gain information about the Trump campaign and to influence it by feting Mr. Page in the Russian capital. Russian television that year was describing him as a \u201cfamous American economist,\u201d but he was an obscure figure in this country.At that time, the last American to give the commencement speech was Mr. Obama, who used the opportunity to criticize Russia for its treatment of Georgia and Ukraine.Mr. Page, though, criticized the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the United States and its NATO allies for lecturing Russia about bullying its neighbors, which were former Soviet republics, while the Westerners were taking \u201cproactive steps to encourage regime change overseas.\u201d During his time in Moscow, Mr. Page met with at least one top Russian official and numerous business leaders.And there was the now infamous June 2016 approach to Donald Trump Jr. by Russians whom he and his father had known from their days taking the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. The Russians met at Trump Tower in Manhattan with top campaign officials after promising damaging information on Mrs. Clinton.See the timeline of events that surround the Trump Tower meeting.What exactly transpired during the meeting is still a mystery, but it appears that the Russians pulled a bait-and-switch. They used the session to push for an end to the crippling economic sanctions that Mr. Obama had imposed on Russia.Donald Trump Jr. has said how disappointed he and other campaign advisers were that they didn\u2019t get what the Russians had promised. The campaign\u2019s reaction to the Russian attempts to discredit Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was not to rebuff them or call law enforcement \u2014 it was to try to exploit them.Experts who have studied Russian operations for decades see the catalog of contacts and communications between Russians and Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers as a loosely coordinated effort by Russian intelligence both to get insight into the campaign and to influence it.\u201cThe Russians aren\u2019t reckless, and I don\u2019t see them going through with this effort without thinking they had a willing partner in the dance,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. officer who served as the spy agency\u2019s station chief in Moscow.By midsummer 2016, the Russian contacts sounded alarms inside the F.B.I., where agents had received a tip about Mr. Papadopoulos and puzzled over Mr. Page\u2019s Moscow visit. The bureau sent a trusted informant to help understand what was happening: Stefan Halper, a former Nixon and Reagan adviser and professor at Cambridge University, reached out to Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos under false pretenses.American officials have defended Professor Halper\u2019s work, saying the use of such a confidential informant is routine in a counterintelligence investigation. Mr. Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have called him something different: a \u201cspy\u201d sent by the Obama administration to infiltrate the campaign.Eventually, Mr. Trump would use such episodes as a foundation for his view that America\u2019s law enforcement agencies had been aligned against him from the beginning \u2014 ammunition for a looming war with the \u201cdeep state.\u201d This idea would consume Mr. Trump after he became president, feeding his sense of grievance that the legitimacy of his victory was under attack and shaping his decisions as he tried to blunt the widening Russia investigation.The long-promised \u201cdirt\u201d the Russians had on Mrs. Clinton would soon be made public. Three days after the Trump Tower meeting, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, appeared on a British Sunday television show.He said that his website would soon be publishing a raft of emails related to Mrs. Clinton. And he said something at once ominous and prescient: \u201cWikiLeaks has a very big year ahead.\u201dUsing a hacker persona, Russian military intelligence officers began to reveal documents stolen from the Democrats. A website made its splashy debut three days later, presenting a jaunty hacker who called himself Guccifer 2.0. He had broken into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer network, Guccifer said, offering as proof a selection of purloined documents.\u201cHere are just a few docs from many thousands I extracted when hacking into the DNC\u2019s network,\u201d Guccifer wrote on June 15. \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks,\u201d he added \u2014 which seemed to explain Mr. Assange\u2019s boast.Russian intelligence had worked fast. Just the day before, D.N.C. officials and their cybersecurity contractor, CrowdStrike, had announced that Russian hackers had penetrated the committee\u2019s computer network.Overnight, Russian military intelligence officers set up the website and created the Guccifer persona to counter the D.N.C. accusations. Guccifer \u2014 a name borrowed from a real Romanian hacker \u2014 was presented as a jovial Romanian, a \u201clone hacker,\u201d who in his posts wanted to make one thing very clear: He had nothing whatsoever to do with Russia.Yet the Guccifer gambit would prove remarkably effective at creating doubt about Russia\u2019s responsibility for the hack. Republican operatives working on congressional campaigns emailed \u201cGuccifer\u201d and received hacked documents relevant to their races. For journalists, the claims of the supposed \u201clone hacker\u201d made the role of Russian intelligence seem to be a disputed allegation rather than a proven fact.See the timeline of hacking that led to the indictment.The agency, now called the Main Directorate but often referred to by its former abbreviation, the G.R.U., proved agile, brazen and not terribly discreet \u2014 the same pattern it would show two years later in the nerve-agent poisoning in England of its former officer, the defector Sergei V. Skripal.The hacking might have drawn little attention had the G.R.U. stopped there, simply stealing emails to peruse for intelligence clues. But the Russians\u2019 decision to leak the emails to undercut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy was a huge escalation.The Russian officers\u2019 political skills proved equal to their hacking expertise. They deftly manipulated a long list of Americans and Europeans, many of whom embraced Guccifer\u2019s tall tale and took seriously the claim that the other Russian false front, DCLeaks.com, was run by American \u201chacktivists.\u201dBut the Russians\u2019 masterstroke was to enlist, via the Guccifer persona, the help of WikiLeaks. Neither of the Russians\u2019 websites, Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks.com, had much reach. But WikiLeaks had a large global audience. Its editor, Mr. Assange, shared Mr. Putin\u2019s hatred of Mrs. Clinton and had a soft spot for Russia.Mr. Assange assisted with the subterfuge. He repeatedly denied that he\u2019d received the documents from Russia; whether he was really taken in by the \u201cGuccifer\u201d ruse is uncertain.\u201cThat was just a robbery, I believe, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d the interviewer said. \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m suggesting that our sources take risks,\u201d Mr. Assange said \u2014 and then declined to say if Mr. Rich was a source.Unknown to the feuding Democratic delegates, a cyberdrama had been playing out in secret for weeks, as CrowdStrike experts tried to root out the Russian hackers who had penetrated the D.N.C. and its sister organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Robert S. Johnston, a lead investigator for CrowdStrike, said the Russian hackers, uniformed officers of military intelligence, were \u201clike a thunderstorm moving through the system \u2014 very, very noisy.\u201dCrowdStrike had begun watching the Russians in April, asking D.N.C. staffers to keep quiet about the intrusion. \u201cWe only talked over Signal,\u201d an encrypted text and call service, said Mr. Johnston, a former Marine and veteran of the United States Cyber Command who is now chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Adlumin. Only by following the hackers for several weeks could CrowdStrike be certain it had found the Russians\u2019 tools and blocked their access.But somehow, possibly by intercepting communications inside the D.N.C. or the F.B.I., which was investigating the breach, the G.R.U. officers learned they had been spotted. On May 31, two weeks before the public disclosure of the hack, Ivan Yermakov, a G.R.U. hacker who had used American-sounding online personas \u2014 \u201cKate S. Milton,\u201d \u201cJames McMorgans\u201d and \u201cKaren W. Millen\u201d \u2014 suddenly began searching online for information about CrowdStrike. He sought to find out what the cybersleuths knew about the Russians\u2019 main tool, a nasty piece of malware called X-Agent, the indictment noted.After that, the spy-versus-spy contest escalated. \u201cWe knew it was the Russians, and they knew we knew,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cI would say it was the cyber equivalent of hand-to-hand combat.\u201dThe candidate favored by the Russians alternated between denying their help and seeming to welcome it. On June 15, the day after the D.N.C. hack was disclosed, the Trump campaign pitched in with a novel idea to deflect blame from the Russians: The D.N.C. had somehow hacked itself.But at other times, he appeared to accept that Russia was responsible.\u201cThe new joke in town,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on July 25, \u201cis that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should have never been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.\u201d\u201cBecause we know the ideas of Mr. Stevenson, we in our hearts all favor him,\u201d Khrushchev said in a message passed on by the Soviet ambassador. \u201cCould the Soviet press assist Mr. Stevenson\u2019s personal success? How?\u201dMr. Stevenson declined the offer, in language that reflected the broad American political consensus about foreign election interference. \u201cI believe I made it clear to him,\u201d Mr. Stevenson wrote, \u201cthat I considered the offer of such assistance highly improper, indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned.\u201dRussia did not deliver on Mr. Trump\u2019s request for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. But it had obtained something just as useful: 50,000 emails of John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, stolen via a phishing attack by the G.R.U. Roger Stone, a political operative and longtime Trump friend, seemed to have advance word. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Aug. 25, it would soon be \u201cPodesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201dBut WikiLeaks withheld the Podesta emails for months after receiving them from \u201cGuccifer\u201d in June, evidently waiting for the right moment to have the biggest impact on the race. The time came on Oct. 7, amid two blows to the Trump campaign.See the timeline of events that surround the release of the emails.And then came a potentially lethal disclosure for the Trump campaign: the shocking \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in which Mr. Trump bragged of groping and sexually assaulting women. The candidate desperately needed to change the subject \u2014 and that was the moment WikiLeaks posted the first of thousands of Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails.They were invaluable for political journalists, offering embarrassing comments from staffers about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shortcomings and the full texts of her highly paid speeches to banks and corporations, which she had refused to release. WikiLeaks assisted by highlighting interesting tidbits in yellow.\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d had said \u201cbehind closed doors,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, that terrorism was \u201cnot a threat\u201d; that she had \u201ca great relationship with the financial industry\u201d; that ISIS might infiltrate groups of refugees coming to the United States; that a politician needed to have \u201cboth a public and private position\u201d on policies; and on and on.The quotes were taken out of context, of course, and subjected to the most damaging interpretation. But they seemed to offer a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s hidden views.For the last month of the campaign, in daily releases that kept the Clinton team on the defensive, WikiLeaks delivered the Russians\u2019 gift. If the July D.N.C. dump had been an explosion, the October series was more like unrelenting sniper fire. Whether the timing was decided by the Russians or by Mr. Assange, it proved devastatingly effective.Russian trolls, using fake accounts on social media, reached nearly as many Americans as would vote in the election.David Michael Smith, a Houston political scientist and activist, spotted the alarming call on Facebook. A group called Heart of Texas was suddenly urging Texans to come at noon on May 21, 2016, to protest a 14-year-old Islamic center in downtown Houston.\u201cStop Islamization of Texas,\u201d the post declared, with a photo of the Islamic Da\u2019wah Center, which it called a \u201cshrine of hatred.\u201d It invited protesters to prepare for battle: \u201cFeel free to bring along your firearms, concealed or not!\u201d\u201cWe immediately asked, \u2018What the blank is the Heart of Texas\u2019?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Smith, who started calling friends to organize a counterprotest.Months later, he would find out.Heart of Texas, which garnered a quarter-million followers on Facebook, was one of 470 Facebook pages created 5,000 miles from Houston at the Internet Research Agency, the oddly named St. Petersburg company that would become the world\u2019s most famous manipulator of social media. The two Russian employees who had visited Texas during that 2014 American tour, Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova, evidently had returned home with big ideas about how to exploit the emotional chasms in American politics and culture.Just as the Russians\u2019 Guccifer character had reached out to American activists, journalists and WikiLeaks, the Russian online trolls understood that their real political power would come from mobilizing Americans. The Russian company\u2019s formula was simple: tap into a simmering strain of opinion in the United States and pour on the fuel.Consider the Texas protest. After the Russians put up the \u201cStop Islamization\u201d Facebook post, several dozen like-minded Texans added their own incendiary comments. \u201cAllah Sucks,\u201d wrote one, adding a threat to kill any Muslim who tried to visit him. Another wrote of the Islamic center, \u201cNeed to Blow this place up.\u201dA dozen yelling white supremacists turned out for the protest, at least two of them with assault rifles and a third with a pistol. Others held Confederate flags and a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d banner.Houston police managed to keep them away from a much larger crowd of counterprotesters \u2014 some of whom had responded to a second Russian Facebook call. In a blatant attempt to create a confrontation, another Internet Research Agency page, this one called United Muslims of America, had asked people to rally at exactly the same time and place to \u201cSave Islamic Knowledge.\u201dThe event had no lasting consequences, though clearly it could have ended in tragedy. Still, it demonstrated that young Russians tapping on keyboards in 12-hour shifts could act as puppet masters for unsuspecting Americans many time zones away.When Facebook first acknowledged last year the Russian intrusion on its platform, it seemed modest in scale. The $100,000 spent on ads was a trivial sum compared with the tens of millions spent on Facebook by both the Trump and Clinton campaigns.See the timeline of events that shows Russia\u2019s social media campaign.Oct. 6 18,634 tweetsTweets spike on Oct. 6, the day before the Obama administration formally accuses the Russian government of hacking.

The St. Petersburg trolls tapped the power of Silicon Valley for their stealth intervention in American democracy.The Russian troll operation had gotten its start two years before, focusing at first on government targets closer to home.In 2014, Vitaly Bespalov, then 23, finished a journalism degree in the Siberian city of Tyumen and signed on as a \u201ccontent manager\u201d at the Internet Research Agency, which looked vaguely like a digital marketing firm and offered a relatively generous salary of $1,000 a month.Mr. Bespalov was surprised to discover that his job was to write or swipe stories to post on counterfeit Ukrainian websites, spinning the conflict there to fit the Russian government\u2019s view. He had to be sure always to use the word \u201cterrorists\u201d for the Ukrainian fighters opposed to the Russian invasion that was tearing the country apart.\u201cMy first days on the job I was in shock \u2014 I had no idea what kind of an operation this was,\u201d Mr. Bespalov said in a recent interview while vacationing in Ukraine: his first visit to the country about which he had written so many bogus stories.He was put off by the company\u2019s work but said he chose to stick around for several months, in part to study its operations. \u201cIt was very monotonous and boring,\u201d Mr. Bespalov said. \u201cIt seemed that almost no one liked this work. But almost nobody quit, because everyone needed the money.\u201dSoon he began hearing about a new, secretive department inside the St. Petersburg company that was recruiting English speakers to focus on the United States.If Mr. Trump was borrowing the hacked emails from the Russians for his stump speeches, the online trolls in St. Petersburg returned the favor, picking up the candidate\u2019s populist rhetoric. Even pages that seemed nominally hostile to him often worked in his favor: \u201cWoke Blacks\u201d critiqued Mrs. Clinton for alleged hostility to African-Americans; \u201cUnited Muslims of America\u201d showed her with a woman in a head scarf and a slogan \u2014 \u201cSupport Hillary, Save American Muslims\u201d \u2014 that seemed aimed at generating a backlash.The Russians managed to call a dozen or more rallies like the one in Houston, sometimes paying unwitting American activists for their help via money transfer. The same method may have been used to get the bridge banners of Mr. Putin and Mr. Obama hung.Facebook, reluctant to step into the divisive politics of the Trump presidency, did not acknowledge the Russian intrusion until nearly a year after the election, asserting that Russia had chiefly aimed at sowing division. A closer look suggested a more focused goal: damaging Mrs. Clinton and promoting Mr. Trump.Many of the Facebook memes portrayed Mrs. Clinton as angry, corrupt or crazed. Mr. Trump was depicted as his campaign preferred: strong, decisive, courageous, willing to shun political correctness to tell hard truths. The Russian operation also boosted Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who had dined with Mr. Putin in Moscow, to draw votes from Mrs. Clinton. It encouraged supporters of Mr. Sanders to withhold their votes from Mrs. Clinton even after he endorsed her.The impact is impossible to gauge; the Internet Research Agency was a Kremlin fire hose of influence wielded amid a hurricane of a presidential election. Christopher Painter, who had served under President George W. Bush at the Justice Department and as the State Department\u2019s coordinator for cyberissues from 2011 to 2017, said the propaganda flood and the leaked emails certainly affected the vote. But no one can say whether it made the difference in an election decided by the tiniest of margins, fewer than 100,000 votes in three states.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how much voter suppression it caused, discouraging people from coming out,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how many votes it changed.\u201dHe added that \u201cpeople don\u2019t like to admit they\u2019ve been fooled\u201d \u2014 hence the strenuous efforts from Mr. Trump and his supporters to deny or dismiss the significance of the Russian interference.A case in point would be Harry Miller, a devoted Trump supporter in Florida who was paid to organize a rally in which a woman portraying Mrs. Clinton sat behind bars on the back of his pickup truck. It turned out that the people who had ordered up the rally, \u201cMatt Skiber\u201d and \u201cJoshua Milton,\u201d were pseudonyms for Russians at the Internet Research Agency, according to the Mueller indictment.But don\u2019t tell that to Mr. Miller. Contacted via Twitter, he insisted that he had not been manipulated by Russian trolls.\u201cThey were not Russians, and you know it,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote, adding, \u201cIf you don\u2019t then you are the one snookered.\u201dThe president has created doubts about the investigation and an affinity for Russia among his supporters.The White House statement released at 7:21 p.m. on May 17, 2017, was measured, even anodyne. Reacting to the news that Mr. Mueller had been appointed special counsel for the Russia investigation, the statement quoted Mr. Trump saying that he was \u201clooking forward to this matter concluding quickly,\u201d and that in the meantime he would be fighting \u201cfor the people and issues that matter most to the future of our country.\u201dExactly 12 hours and 31 minutes later, early in the morning without his staff around him, he told the world what he really thought.It had been little more than a week since the president had fired his F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, but the \u201cRussia thing\u201d wasn\u2019t going away. Now the president was up against someone who could become even more formidable \u2014 a careful, tenacious former Marine whose stewardship of the F.B.I. during the Bush and Obama years had been praised by Washington\u2019s establishment.Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct was to fire Mr. Mueller, but he settled for a different strategy. He has used all his power to try to discredit the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Revelation upon revelation about Russian encounters with Trump associates has followed in the months since Mr. Mueller was appointed, intensifying the fear in the White House. Mr. Trump has used his Twitter pulpit to repeatedly assault the Mueller inquiry, and has made scathing remarks at rallies about claims of Russian interference. \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax, O.K.?\u201d he told a Pennsylvania crowd last month. The attacks have had an impact on how Americans view the country\u2019s national security apparatus, how they view the Russia story, even how they view Russia itself.See the full timeline of Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated denials and attacks.The strategy has helped sow doubts about the special counsel\u2019s work in part because Mr. Mueller and his prosecutors only rarely go public with the evidence they have been steadily gathering in secret interviews and closed-door sessions of a grand jury.During a period of 146 days over this year \u2014 between the Feb. 16 indictment of the Internet Research Agency operatives and the July 13 indictment of Russian intelligence officers \u2014 Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was effectively silent. The president was not, sending at least 94 tweets that denied he had been involved in \u201ccollusion,\u201d called the Russian interference a \u201choax\u201d or labeled the Mueller investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dIndictment of Internet Research Agency operativesIndictment of Russianintelligence officersAprilJulyOct.AprilJulyJan. 2017Jan. 2018Jan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018Indictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesAprilIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJulyIndictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018AprilJulyJan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018Indictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesAprilIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJulyBy July, one poll showed that 45 percent of Americans disapproved of how Mr. Mueller was handling the investigation, a 14-point increase from January. The shift was even more dramatic among Republican voters: from 49 percent to 78 percent. More recent polls, conducted since the indictment of the G.R.U. officers and Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction, have shown a reversal of the trend.The president\u2019s aides hardly make a secret of their goal to discredit the investigation before a jury of the public. There is little expectation that Mr. Mueller would ignore Justice Department guidelines and try to indict a sitting president, so Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers see Congress and impeachment as the only threat. Turn the public against impeachment, the thinking goes, and Congress is less likely to act.\u201cMueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game,\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s omnipresent lawyer, told The New York Times last month, without citing any data to buttress his assertion.\u201cSo I think we\u2019ve done really well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my client\u2019s happy.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s frustration with the Russian investigation is not surprising. He is right that no public evidence has emerged showing that his campaign conspired with Russia in the election interference or accepted Russian money. But the inquiry has buffeted his presidency, provoked concern that his attempts to thwart the investigation amount to obstruction of justice and fed his suspicion that the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies \u2014 what he calls \u201cthe deep state\u201d \u2014 are conspiring against him.The desire of the president to make deals with Mr. Putin, and the longstanding skepticism of the intelligence community about Russian intentions and actions, might have made a clash inevitable. But Mr. Trump appears to have had success in persuading some Americans that the spy and law enforcement agencies are corrupt and hyperpartisan. He has scrambled alliances that solidified over decades, including the Republican Party\u2019s reflexive support of the national security agencies. A president in open war with the F.B.I., once inconceivable, is now part of the daily news cycle.Mr. Trump began laying the foundation immediately after he won the presidency, when he questioned the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings that Russia had disrupted the election, and likened America\u2019s spies to Nazis. Since taking office, he has worked with partners in Congress to cast the agencies as part of an insurgency against the White House.It continued in July, when he stood next to Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and declared that he trusted the Russian president\u2019s assurances that Moscow was innocent of interfering in the 2016 election.\u201c\u2018We have found nothing to show collusion between President Trump & Russia, absolutely zero, but every day we get more documentation showing collusion between the FBI & DOJ, the Hillary campaign, foreign spies & Russians, incredible.\u2019\u201dThe reshuffling of alliances has seeped into the media, where the president\u2019s reliable allies have been joined by voices on the left to dismiss the Russia story as overblown. They warn of a new Red Scare.On Fox News, the network where Sean Hannity fulminates nightly about Mr. Mueller and his team, the journalist Glenn Greenwald, a founder of the left-leaning news site The Intercept and a champion of government whistle-blowers, has appeared regularly to dismiss revelations about the investigation and decry officials \u201cwilling to leak, even at the expense of committing crimes,\u201d in order to damage Mr. Trump.Multiple frenzied television segments and hyped news stories have given credence to the concerns of Mr. Greenwald and others about a 21st-century McCarthyism. And critics of the \u201cdeep state\u201d were given powerful ammunition after the release of text messages between two F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, that revealed their animosity toward Mr. Trump. The pair, who were involved in a romantic relationship at the time, have been skewered regularly on Mr. Hannity\u2019s show as the \u201cTrump-hating F.B.I. lovebirds.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s glowing words about Mr. Putin and Russia have created a new affinity for Russia \u2014 in particular its social conservatism and toughness on terrorism \u2014 among Mr. Trump\u2019s most devoted supporters.During a period of myriad accounts about Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the last election, the percentage of Republicans who view Mr. Putin favorably has more than doubled (from 11 percent to 25 percent), according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. Democrats are now far more likely than Republicans to see Russia as a threat. An October 2017 poll showed that 63 percent of Democrats and just 38 percent of Republicans said they saw \u201cRussia\u2019s power and influence\u201d as a significant threat to the United States.Once again, Mr. Trump has flipped the script in the party of Reagan: A country that was once seen as a geopolitical foe is now embraced by many Republicans as a bastion of Christianity and traditional values.Michael McFaul, ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that despite the country\u2019s relative economic and military weakness, Mr. Putin had often played a poor hand deftly. \u201cAcross many dimensions, Putin is using all kinds of instruments of power,\u201d he said.\u201cIt feels to me,\u201d the former ambassador said, \u201clike he\u2019s winning and we\u2019re losing.\u201dOn July 16, the president woke early in Helsinki, hours before he was to sit face to face with Mr. Putin. The meeting came three days after Mr. Mueller indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers. Once again, Mr. Trump dashed off a tweet.\u201cWe agree.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.

{"Headline": "Tech Giants Now Share Details on Political Ads. What Does That Mean For You?", "Date": "2018-09-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe tried out new tools from Facebook, Google and Twitter that let you look up campaign ads. Here\u2019s what the databases can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 do. \u201cDark ads.\u201d That is the catchall term researchers use to describe online political messages that keep people in the dark about why they were targeted with the ads, who paid for them or how much was spent. Each company\u2019s political ad archive works a bit differently and contains varying levels of detail about each ad. But they all allow users to look up current campaign ads for elected federal offices in the United States. And they all show the name of a political ad\u2019s sponsor, how much was spent on the ads, when they were shown and how many times. Google\u2019s database shows the demographic categories a campaign used to target an ad. If you click on the sponsor\u2019s name, you can see data on the total number of ads the sponsor bought through Google\u2019s ad services and the total amount the sponsor spent.Details on an ad from Representative Blackburn look like this:The Google and Twitter tools are available to anyone. The Facebook archive requires you to be logged into a Facebook account. Getting in is the easy part. Navigating them can be more complicated.None of the archives is currently designed to search for phrases. That means, for instance, if you search the Facebook archive for \u201cdon\u2019t go to vote\u201d \u2014 a phrase that a Kremlin-linked group employed in a Facebook ad discouraging users from going to the polls \u2014 you\u2019ll end up with thousands of resulting ads that used the word \u201cvote.\u201d On Facebook, you\u2019ll need to search by the name of the candidate or political issue you\u2019re looking for. On Google, search under the candidate\u2019s or advertiser\u2019s name. On Twitter, look for the name of the account the ad ran under. Once you get results, you can click an individual ad to learn more.The search giant lets advertisers, including political campaigns, target ads based on consumers\u2019 keyword searches on Google. But the archive does not disclose the keywords that campaigns may have used to target a particular political ad. You also can\u2019t see a demographic breakdown by gender and age of the audience who actually saw the ad.If you don\u2019t know, or can\u2019t locate, the Twitter handle of the campaign you are looking for, you won\u2019t be able to search for its ads. In addition, the company doesn\u2019t show certain ad-targeting categories \u2014 like sports interests \u2014 that a campaign may use have used to target an ad.Twitter said it planned to broaden its archive at the end of September to include ads on national legislative issues, like health and gun control, as well as ads that mention a political candidate by name.Nope. But the archives will do little to curb other prevalent voter influence techniques \u2014 like using unpaid posts, pages and groups to sow social divisiveness and spread misinformation. On that score, we\u2019re still pretty much in the dark.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: Lifetime\u2019s \u2018You\u2019 Lets You Stalk the Stalker", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLifetime\u2019s new stalker drama, \u201cYou,\u201d has two major flaws: Its name is near impossible to use in conversation or to Google in any meaningful capacity, and it is premiering Sept. 9 as part of the fall TV season rather than a few months ago, when it could have been the steamy summer show we needed.Other than that, \u201cYou,\u201d based on Caroline Kepnes\u2019s novel, is a vicious thrill; smart and mean in all the right ways, with a devilish sensibility and a clever, inviting pessimism, like the friend who wants you to sit in the back with her and make jokes. \u201cYou\u201d rolls its eyes at trying-to-be-cool people the same way actual cool people do.Penn Badgley, best known as the Brooklynite Dan Humphrey on \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d stars as Joe Goldberg, a bookstore manager who is immediately smitten with Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), a poetry grad student. She goes by Beck, so you can immediately tell how cool and irreverent she is \u2014 well, how cool and irreverent she wants to be. She\u2019s actually tedious and self-absorbed and way too into Instagram.And that\u2019s good news for Joe, because Joe is a stalker, and social media makes his stalking all the easier. He narrates most of the series, so we spend a lot of time in Joe\u2019s head, hearing his musings on his neighbors (too noisy) and exercise (challenging) while also following him through his surveillance and kidnapping errands. Keeping constant tabs on someone else is a ton of work!Benji\u2019s awfulness is one of the real treats of \u201cYou,\u201d and the show relishes in poking fun at the performatively hip. Peach (Shay Mitchell), Beck\u2019s spoiled, rich bestie, pouts that because of a medical condition, she can only have alcohol with a certain pH, \u201clike Ketel One, or Goose, or pear juice.\u201d Joe\u2019s co-worker at the bookstore raves about his balalaika teacher. Beck\u2019s other friend, Annika (Kathryn Gallagher), is an Instagram influencer whose vacuous self-empowerment posts are absolutely dead-on. Beck is deeply intimidated by a fellow grad-school student, and marvels with utter reverence and jealousy: \u201cShe wrote this piece about how she and her mother got bulimia together while in Italy. She was 12.\u201dThat\u2019s why beyond the Badgley overlap, \u201cYou\u201d is a lot like \u201cGossip Girl.\u201d It\u2019s very New York. (Joe might be a violent and dangerous person, but even he bristles at having to schlep all the way to Greenpoint.) It\u2019s very salty. It\u2019s very class-conscious. It\u2019s also occasionally beyond absurd, as when Joe\u2019s bookstore has a soundproof glass vault in the basement, where he can repair antique books or imprison people, and sometimes both.\u201cYou\u201d comes from the megaproducer Greg Berlanti, whose empire includes most of the CW comic book shows, and Sera Gamble, most recently of \u201cThe Magicians.\u201d It shares that show\u2019s canny awareness of its characters\u2019 insecurities. Thanks to Joe\u2019s twisted narration, there\u2019s an occasional \u201cDexter\u201d moment, too, and thanks to gentle hypnosis of swinging between budding romance and calculated foul play, there\u2019s a \u201cGone Girl\u201d vibe. This is much more a story show than an acting show, though Ms. Mitchell\u2019s soapy performance makes everything that much juicier.In the five episodes made available to critics, \u201cYou\u201d zips along, never dwelling in its least-believable moments long enough to ruin the ride, and never indulging in its romances too much that you lose sight of the toxicity and danger underlying all the bonds. It\u2019s not just Joe who sees the world in a grotesque and entitled way. Peach sees through some of Joe\u2019s scam, but she herself manipulates and harms her friends, too. Beck is a habitual liar.\u201cYou\u201d knows they\u2019re all terrible, and it also knows the real fight isn\u2019t against terribleness, it\u2019s against boringness. \u201cYou\u201d is never boring, which sounds like faint praise. But in an era of glassy dramas defined by sad-man montages, weary characters standing dead still in moody showers and bewildering mysteries that are often just covers for poor characterization, it\u2019s a relief.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Elon Musk Turned Down a Fraud Settlement With the S.E.C.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the commission convinces a jury that Mr. Musk misled investors, he could be blocked from serving as an executive or director of any public company. That could force him to assume a different position at Tesla. It could also affect his other companies, SpaceX and the Boring Company, were they to go public, and potentially harm their ability to raise money from investors.Andrew\u2019s take:Mr. Musk will want to prove that his intent wasn\u2019t to mislead investors, probably by demonstrating that he had real conversations to take the company private. But his intent is almost beside the point. He can be found guilty simply for being \u201creckless.\u201d And na\u00efvet\u00e9 isn\u2019t a defense.This is turning into a sad story for Tesla\u2019s employees, investors and ultimately everyone who has followed Mr. Musk\u2019s efforts to transform the auto and energy industries.The data suggest that companies still feel confident enough about the economy to strike big deals. Much of this year\u2019s activity was driven by giant takeovers like Walt Disney\u2019s acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox and T-Mobile\u2019s proposed acquisition of Sprint.What remains to be seen is whether trade wars and other economic sandbags will weigh down the M.&A. run.In March 2017, State Street Global Advisors, one of the world\u2019s largest fund managers, pushed companies to put more women on corporate boards. FactSet has crunched the numbers, and there\u2019s a long way to go:\u2022 Companies in the Russell 3000 stock index with no female board members declined to 18 percent, from 23 percent.\u2022 Companies in which women hold 15 percent of the board seats or less decreased to 47 percent, from 58 percent.\u2022 The boards of 22 companies are equally split between men and women, while women make up the majority at 14 companies, up from five.\u2022 Just 5 percent of companies in the index are led by women, unchanged from March 2017.The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds. Every time since 1960 that it has inverted \u2014 when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates \u2014 a recession has followed. For much of this year, the spread has been at its narrowest level in more than a decade. Many economists believe it will invert next year.Six-year-old Bytedance, which was said to be seeking around $3 billion in the current round, started out by using artificial intelligence to personalize content for users but has successfully branched out into short-video via a service called Douyin, known as Tik Tok abroad. That service had 500 million monthly active users as of July. It also owns the Musical.ly app, which has about 100 million users and is being merged with Tik Tok, the company said in August.One reason for investor caution: With companies like Tencent getting involved in short video, Tik Tok may struggle to grow in a saturated market.But he also wonders what might happen if other companies embraced its vision:If Apple\u2019s more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech\u2019s dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks.The financial crisis ruined Goldman Sachs\u2019s reputation in the eyes of the public. Ten years on, it is finally out of the doghouse.But let\u2019s not get carried away.

{"Headline": "Can You Spot the Deceptive Facebook Post?", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "Advertisement\nFacebook, Twitter and Google executives have been invited to testify in Washington on Wednesday about foreign influence campaigns and disinformation online ahead of the midterm elections in November.The problem has been far reaching. Over the summer, Facebook announced the discovery of hundreds of fake pages and user accounts on its site. Some pages appeared to specifically target Americans with divisive messages, using the same tactics that Russian operatives did to influence voters during the 2016 presidential campaigns.The latest influence campaigns also imitated posts by legitimate pages and groups on Facebook that advocate political beliefs, making it difficult to tell what was a genuine post and what was not. Let\u2019s compare some to see if you can tell the difference. Spoiler: It isn\u2019t easy.\u201cResisters\u201d was a fake account that Facebook removed in July. \u201cFeminist News\u201d is a real Facebook page, as far as we can tell. (We asked Facebook to confirm the examples of real accounts used here are in fact authentic, and were told there was no apparent reason to suspect otherwise.)The Resisters page existed for more than a year and described itself as \u201conline and offline feminist activism against fascism,\u201d according to Facebook and researchers at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which analyzes disinformation online and works with Facebook.Although Facebook has still not tied this page to Russia, the language used in its posts and several other factors suggest a connection. For one, a Russian account that Facebook removed in 2017 had been set as an administrator of the Resisters page, though \u201cfor only seven minutes,\u201d Facebook said. Before being shut down, a Russian account had also shared an event created by the Resisters page with its followers.Facebook removed the event page before the rally, and informed 3,200 users who either expressed interest in the counterprotest or said they would attend about the suspicious activity behind it.\u201cAztlan Warriors\u201d was part of an influence operation, and \u201cAztec Mayan Inca Native Warriors\u201d is a real Facebook page.The Aztlan Warriors and Brown Power pages both addressed issues around immigration and colonialism, often relying on historical references. Here\u2019s an Aztlan Warriors post from July, and a Brown Power post that Facebook took down in 2017:Like the Resisters page, the Aztlan Warriors page also corresponded to the name of a Twitter account, \u201c@warriors_aztlan,\u201d that was recently identified as part of Russia\u2019s influence operation. That account, according to archives, posted tweets with similar sentiments about immigration.\u201cMindful Being\u201d was part of an influence operation, and \u201cRevolutionary Self-Care\u201d is a real Facebook page.The Mindful Being page existed for only two months before Facebook removed it. The page mainly focused on innocuous topics like health and well-being, though some of its posts challenged the media and the pharmaceutical industry, suggesting it was laying the groundwork to tread into more controversial content.According to information collected by the Atlantic Council before the page was shut down, however, Mindful Being did on at least one occasion employ a tactic common among the Russian pages. The text in the post below was wholesale copied and pasted from an article on the website Gaia.com.Russian pages frequently plagiarized in this way, possibly to get around the language barrier that gave them away in other posts.\u201cBlack Elevation\u201d was part of an influence operation, and \u201cBlack Excellence\u201d is a real Facebook page.Black Elevation was the largest of the fake pages Facebook shut down at the end of July, with nearly 140,000 followers. The group targeted activists fighting for racial equality in the United States.Like the Resisters and Aztlan Warriors pages, Black Elevation had a corresponding Twitter account, @black_elevation, that was identified this year as part of a Russian influence operation.Mimicking groups like Black Lives Matter to sow divisions among Americans is a well-known strategy of Russian influence operations. Hundreds of the Facebook ads bought by Russian trolls, removed from the social network last year and released by Congress in May, were clearly meant to incite racial tension.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it was a false page,\u201d said Carla Cubit, an activist in New York who had shared the page\u2019s Facebook events on her Twitter account. \u201cIt seemed legitimate.\u201dHow did you do?Images from Facebook, the Atlantic Council and CongressAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "What China Can Teach the U.S. About Artificial Intelligence ", "Date": "2018-09-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVisionary research is no longer the most important element of progress.Mr. Lee is a venture capitalist and former artificial intelligence researcher.Every technology goes through an age of discovery and an age of implementation. During the age of discovery, the critical work takes place in research laboratories, where scientists make the breakthroughs that move the field forward. During the age of implementation, the technology reaches a point of practical utility and begins spilling out of the lab and into the world.Over the past decade, I\u2019ve watched firsthand as the field of artificial intelligence has transitioned from one phase to the other. The 1980s and 1990s were a period of discovery in A.I., one that I participated in through my research on speech recognition at Carnegie Mellon University and Apple. More recently, I participated in the implementation phase through my work as the head of Google China and as an early investor in the Chinese mobile internet.This movement from discovery to implementation marks a significant shift in A.I.\u2019s center of gravity \u2014 away from the United States and toward China. The age of discovery relied heavily on innovation coming out of the United States, which excels at visionary research and moonshot projects. The country\u2019s freewheeling intellectual environment, unparalleled network of research universities and traditional openness to immigrants (such as myself) have for decades made it an incubator for big ideas in A.I.A.I. implementation, however, plays to a different set of strengths, many of which are manifested in China: abundant data, a hypercompetitive business landscape and a government that actively adapts public infrastructure with A.I. in mind. China also excels at turning an abstract scientific breakthrough into thousands of useful and commercially viable products. This process, which is far more challenging than most researchers acknowledge, has driven the market capitalization of many Chinese tech companies far beyond that of the American peers they were once accused of \u201ccopying.\u201dVisionary research will always be important to A.I., which means that China still has much to learn from the United States. But as practical implementation increasingly becomes the name of the game, the United States now has much to learn from China, too.What emerges from these enormous data flows is a multidimensional picture of each Chinese user, which allows A.I. companies to better tailor their services. Silicon Valley companies are working on similar products, but the data at their disposal is largely limited to online activities: Google searches, YouTube views, Amazon purchases and Facebook likes.With regard to its competitive business ecosystem for A.I., China\u2019s advantage is frequently mischaracterized by Western analysts who view Chinese technology as built largely on intellectual property theft. This misunderstanding reflects a difference in cultural attitudes over a perfectly legal form of copying: imitating a successful business model and then tweaking it.In Silicon Valley, there is substantial stigma attached to imitating the business models or features of other companies. Doing so violates the \u201cthink different\u201d ethos associated with innovators like Steve Jobs. The result is that pioneers often go unchallenged for long periods, allowed to dominate the industry even though they don\u2019t explore or exploit all of their technology\u2019s possibilities.In contrast, Chinese entrepreneurs have few qualms about imitating what works. Once a concept is proved to have traction, dozens or even hundreds of other companies rush into the industry, setting off a ferocious fight for survival. The result is analogous to natural selection in evolution: All the companies start from the same branch on the family tree, but they make mutations in their product or business model to gain an edge. The companies with tweaked products that work well survive and grow, while businesses that are slow to adapt perish.You can see this clearly in how the sharing economy developed in China. After companies like Uber and DiDi proved the viability of ride sharing, China\u2019s start-up world tried out every possible iteration of it: shared basketballs, shared umbrellas, shared bicycles, shared mobile phone chargers. Most of these efforts died quickly, but those that survived \u2014 including a handful of the strongest shared-bike start-ups \u2014 turned into multibillion-dollar companies and revolutionized urban transport in just a couple of years.Finally, there is the question of the Chinese government\u2019s support of A.I. In the simplistic story often told in the United States, Chinese bureaucrats in the central government pick winners among the companies, load them up with enormous subsidies and then protect them from foreign competition. But this account fundamentally misunderstands how the Chinese government is encouraging A.I. implementation.The Chinese government understands that as A.I. moves from affecting the purely digital world to the physical one, public infrastructure and institutions will have to change. If we want autonomous cars to reduce accidents, we may need to embed sensors in our roads. If we want A.I.-powered diagnosis to spot cancer earlier, we may need hospital administrators to develop data-sharing agreements that protect privacy while also allowing research to be conducted. These are decisions that entail a degree of risk for public actors, particularly in a highly combative political environment where every misstep becomes fodder for the opposition.In declaring A.I. to be a top national priority, Beijing has sent a signal to local officials that they will be rewarded for fostering this kind of A.I. infrastructure. The Chinese model isn\u2019t based on top-down orders or limitless subsidies; it\u2019s based on encouraging local officials to make the changes needed in their area so that private A.I. companies can develop products that can actually be used.Am I arguing that China now has the recipe for A.I. success? Not at all. The fact that the field is shifting from discovery to implementation does not mean that discovery no longer matters. Indeed, with many problems in A.I., it is unclear which approach is best.Consider an A.I.-powered product like fully autonomous vehicles. Technology companies in both countries are still feverishly chasing the dream of the large-scale deployment of cars that drive themselves far better than any human could. Who wins this race is likely to depend on whether the main obstacle turns out to be a matter of core technology or simply execution details. If it\u2019s technical \u2014 major improvements in core algorithms \u2014 then the advantage goes to the United States. If it\u2019s implementation \u2014 smart infrastructure or policy adaptation \u2014 then the advantage goes to China.At this point, we don\u2019t know which it will be, but we do know that each country can improve its odds of success by learning from the other\u2019s strengths. Chinese researchers, start-ups and A.I. companies should let their imaginations run a little wilder, placing long-term bets that give them a chance of breaking new ground rather than playing catch-up. At the same time, American companies should embrace the less glamorous business of relentlessly developing variations on a proven concept. And American policymakers could move away from a hands-off stance toward A.I., looking instead to actively adapt the nation\u2019s physical structures and public institutions to better mesh with new technology.If both countries can make these shifts in perspective, then what might look like a zero-sum battle for A.I. supremacy between China and the United States will begin to resemble something totally different: an opportunity to learn across cultures and collectively advance the global project of building A.I. that improves human lives.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Hey, Alexa, Why is Amazon Making a Microwave?", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 If you\u2019re one of the millions of people without a smart speaker in your home, Amazon wants to talk to you.On Thursday, the company announced not one, not six, but more than a dozen devices for its Alexa voice assistant \u2014 all meant to solve problems in your life that you may not have even known you had.There\u2019s even a microwave.\u201cIf you have ever tried to defrost peas, it\u2019s a number of clicks,\u201d said Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices and services.Mr. Limp said the $59.99 microwave, made by AmazonBasics, the company\u2019s house brand, was a way for Amazon to try out the smart home tools it is building out. The company wants the devices to be easier to set up out of the box and for other companies that make kitchen appliances \u2014 from rice makers to ovens \u2014 to tap into the Alexa platform.\u201cWhen we imagine a future with thousands of devices like this, this is going to become essential,\u201d Mr. Limp said.The microwave was perhaps the cheekiest in a blizzard of announcements at the event inside Amazon\u2019s headquarters.\u201cWe took advantage of the hands-free moments,\u201d Tom Taylor, senior vice president of Alexa, said in an interview. \u201cHow do we continue to expand? Where else are those opportunities?\u201dSo far, Amazon\u2019s answer appears to be \u201ceverywhere.\u201dThe company has a long history of introducing products and services at a rapid clip, in sharp contrast to competitors like Apple, which focuses on a few very refined releases at a time. Some of Amazon\u2019s ideas work, like its Kindle e-reader, and the company keeps building on them. But many of them fail, like its Fire smartphone, and the company quickly drops them.On Thursday, Mr. Limp also introduced an Echo Auto that plugs into cars; Fire TV Recast, a DVR recording device that lets users record live TV and watch on a variety of devices; and an analog wall clock with a voice-controlled timer.Another suite of devices announced on Thursday is aimed to appeal to audiophiles. Echo devices can now be used for individual left and right channels, meaning a pair can create stereo sound. And the new Echo Sub provides rich bass sounds, which Mr. Limp showed by booming Lorde\u2019s \u201cRoyals.\u201d The new Echo Input is the first Echo device without a speaker so users can connect their speakers to the brain of the Alexa.Since it introduced its Alexa smart assistant four years ago, the company has not shied from trying out new forms and uses. First it had an Echo speaker, a tall cylinder, then an Echo Dot, a version the size of a hockey puck. Then it added a screen, too, with the Echo Show. At the same time, developers wrote thousands of apps \u2014 or skills \u2014 for the devices. There are now more than 50,000 skills.The strategy helped Amazon quickly take the lead in the voice-controlled device market \u2014 a market it practically created. But it now has some stiff competition.A device from Google, the Home Mini, is now the top-selling smart speaker worldwide, Strategy Analytics, a research firm, wrote in a report this week. Google offers fewer types of devices, but has an advantage because millions of customers already have access to its voice assistant through the smartphones that use its Android operating system. Apple has also introduced its own high-priced voice-controlled speaker, focused on pristine audio quality, which Amazon looks to now be challenging head-on.\u201cThe earlier days were more inventing on behalf of customers,\u201d said Mr. Taylor. \u201cNow we have a chance to invent by listening to customers.\u201dThe announcements Thursday show Amazon trying to flood the field, not just with its own devices but with products intended to model a way for outside manufacturers to build off Alexa\u2019s interface.\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming \u2014 that\u2019s the risk for the consumer,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. \u201cThey have been so early in the market that they need to make sure the geeks that jump into the smart home early have something, but at the same time, they need to make it really simple for people who haven\u2019t yet.\u201dNot all of the announcements were products. Amazon introduced new ways Alexa will try to anticipate the needs of users, not just respond to questions. The Alexa Hunches function, which will be public later this year, tries to provide suggestions; for instance, if a user says good night to Alexa, the voice assistant might note that a porch light is on and offer to turn it off.And users can turn on Alexa Guard when they leave their home, and the device will notify them if it detects a smoke alarm alert or the sound of a burglar smashing a window.Amazon also said users would no longer need to sign up individual skills to use them. Instead, they will be able to speak to Alexa, which will automatically pick the best skill.\u201cThat was a big barrier, you learning how to talk to Alexa versus Alexa learning how you speak, which is how it should be,\u201d Ms. Milanesi said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an Amazon voice assistant function that anticipates users\u2019 needs. It is Alexa Hunches, not Alexa Hunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018The First,\u2019 on Hulu, the Future Is Not That Dark", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW ORLEANS \u2014 These days, the most natural question to ask about a television series set in the future is a simple one: So how bad does it get?The success of shows like \u201cWestworld,\u201d \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d indicate that dystopias, or at least deep discomfort, are resonating with viewers. \u201cThe First,\u201d Beau Willimon\u2019s Hulu series about the space program in the not-too-distant 2030s (debuting Friday), is a bit of a curveball.The optimism of frontiersmanship, the desire to boldly go where no one has gone before, has long been a fascination for Mr. Willimon.\u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in space and adventure travels,\u201d he said over the phone recently. \u201cNot just space, but also tales of people pushing themselves to extremes, to their limits. Whether it\u2019s climbing a mountain or going to the ocean depths, or Shackleton trying to traverse Antarctica.\u201d\u201cSome of these desires are almost irrational,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause there really is no way to explain why someone would place themselves in that much risk and peril in order to get to this place that doesn\u2019t necessarily even have a practical benefit other than the accomplishment itself.\u201dMr. Willimon began work on the optimistic \u201cThe First\u201d shortly before leaving \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d after its fourth season. His main character, Tom Hagerty (Mr. Penn, in his first major television role), is a decidedly different protagonist than the Machiavellian politician Frank Underwood of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d A veteran flyboy, Hagerty is a bit of a swashbuckler, but torn between his daughter\u2019s newfound yet shaky stability and the tantalizing skies.Hagerty\u2019s emotional foil, Laz Ingram (Ms. McElhone), is a cerebral but slightly awkward STEM visionary, all clockwork brains and fierce drive, frustrated by the tiresome bureaucracies that throw roadblocks in her path to the stars.Another star, though inanimate, is the show\u2019s setting. New Orleans wasn\u2019t initially a factor during Mr. Willimon\u2019s conceptual and writing process. But once Louisiana bolstered a tax credit program for film and TV production that had briefly been in flux, the city\u2019s presence began seeping into the creator\u2019s writing.\u201cHere\u2019s a place that\u2019s teeming with life in every sense,\u201d said Mr. Willimon, who also had a New Orleans-set play, \u201cLower Ninth,\u201d a conversation among tenuous survivors trapped on a rooftop in the aftermath of the 2005 floods from Hurricane Katrina. \u201cFrom this sort of swirling biological chaos of swamps and the Delta and the ocean, to the swirling human chaos of a city that\u2019s so rich in culture and history and every sort of person you can imagine.\u201dA similar thing happened with Hagerty\u2019s house, a key location in the show. After searching the elegant Garden District to no avail, Willimon happened to be back at the edge of Bywater, looking across the Mississippi, and found it: a two-story house with a balcony that feels like a ship\u2019s prow, where an explorer might look out at expanses of water and sky and grassy levee and see the edge of the world. \u201cEverything started to click,\u201d he said. \u201cIt suddenly became Tom Hagerty\u2019s house almost instantly, and I started writing to the architecture.\u201dAnd the river itself, the wide earth-colored force that has both cradled and menaced the below-sea-level city for centuries, is the site of a tragedy essential to the plot.As befits a show about the future, \u201cThe First\u201d is full of neat gadgetry and believable technology like reliable self-driving cars, augmented reality and Google Glass-ish personal communication hubs. (The only thing that seems far-fetched is the implication that by 2031 listening to voice mail messages will have made a comeback.) New Orleans was also convenient to real-life NASA facilities like the John C. Stennis Space Center, a rocket-testing facility (and summer space camp site!) on the Mississippi border, and the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. Actors as well as writers and production designers put in hours there and with the consultants Christopher Ferguson and Michael Lopez-Alegria, both retired NASA astronauts. Some scenes were even shot at Stennis.\u201cI think we all recognize, whether it\u2019s in ourselves or in others, this thing that is the explorer, the wanderer, the person who wants to take themselves out of either their own or society\u2019s comfort zone,\u201d Mr. Penn said.\u201cTo hear him talk about it, it\u2019s universe-broadening,\u201d he said.For LisaGay Hamilton, it was the emotional, rather than the technical details that she hoped to understand. She spoke with the aerospace engineer Jeanette Epps in preparation for her role as Kayla Price \u2014 who, like Ms. Epps, is a black female astronaut. \u201cI wanted to speak to someone who looked like me, and who potentially had a similar experience of the world,\u201d Ms. Hamilton said. The conversation was grounding, she said. One of the topics that the two women spent time on was death. \u201cI mean, here you are, actually going into a profession where you could die, and not come back to earth,\u201d she said.Price butts up against some of the uglier realities that, perhaps no surprise, still plague us in even a hopeful future. In this way, she provides the flip side to Mr. Willimon\u2019s belief that the impulses that propel us to the stars are timeless; so too are the ones that drag us back to earth.\u201cIt\u2019s both a noble pursuit and it has potentially really damaging and selfish aspects to it as well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think those two things go hand in hand. You can applaud someone who discovered the North Pole, but you can ask yourself the question, well, at what cost? What did that person put their family through? How much ambition was part of that? It wasn\u2019t purely a selfless act.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Pinterest Is a Unicorn. It Just Doesn\u2019t Act Like One.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Ben Silbermann does not enjoy being interviewed. He isn\u2019t a fan of speaking at tech industry conferences. Nor does he like sitting for glossy magazine portraits. He doesn\u2019t think he should have to explain Pinterest, the web service that allows people to save images to virtual pinboards, to anyone other than those who want to use it.That is the case even in the last couple of years, when Pinterest and Mr. Silbermann, its co-founder and chief executive, could have been shouting the company\u2019s virtues from the rooftops.Its peers, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been drowning in toxic harassment, fake news and Russian disinformation campaigns. Critics have denounced social media-induced anxiety and addiction.Pinterest, by Mr. Silbermann\u2019s design, is the opposite: the web\u2019s last bastion of quaint innocence. Having de-emphasized its social media elements years ago, Pinterest aims to be a safe and happy place for inspiration, self-improvement and salted caramel cookie recipes. It also rejects Silicon Valley\u2019s typical unicorn formula of moving fast, breaking things, chasing growth at all costs and bragging about every victory.But the reserved, slow and steady approach has long frustrated some investors and employees, who believe that it has neutered growth, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with or for the company. Many of those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the company\u2019s private affairs.Matt Novak, a partner at All Blue Capital, said his firm was trying to sell its stake in Pinterest, which the firm acquired on the secondary market, because it had not lived up to its potential.\u201cIf they don\u2019t keep up, they very quickly become prehistoric,\u201d said Mr. Novak, who would not disclose the size of his firm\u2019s stake in Pinterest.And yet despite Mr. Silbermann\u2019s approach \u2014 or maybe because of it \u2014 the company is worth $12.3 billion and growth is accelerating. In the past week, the company crossed a new milestone \u2014 250 million monthly active users. Those users have pinned 175 billion items on 3 billion virtual pinboards. The company is on track to top $700 million in revenue this year, a 50 percent increase over last year, according to a person familiar with the company. There is wide speculation that it will go public next year.If Pinterest continues its trajectory, it could change the narrative of what it takes to build a successful company in Silicon Valley, a meaningful feat at a time that the start-up world is seeking new templates for leaders. If it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019ll serve as another example of wasted potential, or worse, a cautionary tale.\u201cI tell them, \u2018You have to tell your story, especially now,\u201d said Scott Belsky, an entrepreneur who was an early investor in Pinterest.Mr. Belsky said, \u201cHe is so comfortable being misunderstood and underestimated.\u201dWhen Mr. Silberman was asked about his limited public profile in a recent interview, he noted with a hint of exasperation that he was right there, talking to me for this article.\u201cThat\u2019s something!\u201d he said.Tech companies usually reflect the personalities of their founders. Mark Zuckerberg infused Facebook with a \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d hacker mentality. Uber\u2019s founder, Travis Kalanick, pushed a \u201ctoe-steppin\u2019\u201d and \u201chustling\u201d culture at Uber.Mr. Silbermann, 36, grew up in Des Moines in a family of doctors and assumed he\u2019d also go to medical school. But his first encounter with high-speed internet, at Yale in 1999, changed his mind. \u201cYou could find your people there and really explore inside yourself,\u201d he said.He has tried to instill that same thinking at the company. Pinterest values \u201cknitting,\u201d a term its employees use to describe collaboration among groups. \u201cWe believe innovation happens when disciplines knit,\u201d the company\u2019s website says.In the beginning, when Pinterest was desperate to hire engineers as quickly as possible, Mr. Silbermann screened potential hires for their values before even considering their technical skills.Mr. Silbermann is someone who \u201cmeasures twice, cuts once,\u201d said Rick Heitzmann, a managing director at FirstMark Capital and early investor in Pinterest.\u201cPerfectionist doesn\u2019t overstate it,\u201d said Jeff Jordan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Pinterest board member.Pinterest\u2019s offices in San Francisco display the sort of cutesy, self-referential bric-a-brac that\u2019s common at start-ups \u2014 a giant statue of a pushpin made of Legos, a Pinterest surfboard. But Mr. Silbermann\u2019s demeanor is serious and reserved. In conversation, he listens carefully and responds with earnest sincerity, qualifying statements as his own opinion, rather than declaring them as facts.He also doesn\u2019t focus on Pinterest\u2019s image in the business world. Instead, he dedicates an outsize amount of time to meeting with Pinterest users, going on six tours a year and holding weekly lunches at Pinterest\u2019s offices. That\u2019s a meaningful time commitment for the chief executive of a 1,500-person organization.If Pinterest addresses the needs and desires of its users, he said, \u201cthe business will take care of itself.\u201dPinterest has always confounded Silicon Valley insiders. Its first users were not teenagers \u2014 the typical early adopters of digital services \u2014 but Midwestern women. And Mr. Silbermann and his co-founder, Evan Sharp, were not engineers, a prerequisite for many venture capital investors.\u201cFrom the beginning, this company did things differently from how most storybook Silicon Valley companies have operated,\u201d said Jeremy Levine, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, Pinterest\u2019s largest shareholder.The business case was simple and powerful: It was a shopping mall disguised as a mood board that held its users\u2019 aspirations, unearthing pure and unfiltered commercial desire. \u201cYou can draw a direct line from those interests to a commercial opportunity or retail category,\u201d said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at eMarketer.But just as the company began selling ads in 2014, user growth stalled and it wasn\u2019t clear why, according to multiple people familiar with the company. The company disagreed that growth had stalled, arguing that it had \u201cslightly slowed.\u201dExecutives on Pinterest\u2019s \u201cgrowth\u201d team proposed spending $50 million a year to acquire users through marketing, a common tactic for web companies. Other executives argued that the company should court celebrities and pay influencers to share content on Pinterest, similar to YouTube\u2019s premium content program.Mr. Silbermann opposed both, according to people familiar with the decision. He preferred what he called \u201cquality growth.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a natural rate at which you can scale a company that\u2019s healthy,\u201d Mr. Silbermann said. So Pinterest stuck to its knitting.Not everyone was sold on the message. Even by the standards of start-ups, where employee turnover is common, the number of executives leaving Pinterest has been notable in recent years. Since 2015, the company lost people who ran media partnerships, operations, finance, growth, engineering, brand, product, tech partnerships, marketing, corporate development, communications and customer strategy, along with its general counsel and president. Jamie Favazza, a Pinterest spokeswoman, said, \u201cTurnover is natural at high-growth start-ups, but we\u2019ve built a strong team of leaders for the long-term.\u201dSome former executives argue that the company should have hired salespeople faster. Several ex-employees say morale would have been better if Pinterest had taken big swings on hype-worthy cutting-edge tech, like Snap\u2019s camera-embedded sunglasses, introduced in 2016.But those glasses, called Spectacles, became a costly punch line. And unlike most of its money-losing start-up peers, Pinterest, with $1.5 billion in venture backing, has flirted with breaking even in recent quarters, according to the company.What Pinterest\u2019s critics identify as negatives (conservative decision-making, less urgency, squandered opportunities), its supporters cite as positives (bullets dodged, wasted time avoided).As a result, conversations about Pinterest tend to raise fundamental questions about the nature of success in Silicon Valley.\u201cI want to believe that more thoughtful, slower growth is better,\u201d said Tracy Chou, a former Pinterest engineer. \u201cBut the examples that are very visible seem to suggest that really aggressive growth wins, at least in the near term.\u201dInvestors and former executives say that Pinterest has rallied in the past year under a new chief operating officer, Francoise Brougher, and a new head of sales, Jon Kaplan, both formerly of Google.Pinterest\u2019s founders \u201chave this look in their eye like this is working now,\u201d said Mr. Belsky, the early investor.The company has accelerated growth in users, up 27 percent over last year. More than half of all users now come from international markets. That change happened after the company realized it needed to promote local content, not what was popular in the United States, to new users in each region. (British users did not respond to American Crock-Pot recipes, it turns out.)Revenue growth is also picking up, which Mr. Kaplan attributed to having the right measurement data to show brands that ads on Pinterest are effective. The company has hired more salespeople, introduced more ad options and refocused on small- and medium-size advertisers. It is preparing to start selling ads in non-English speaking countries, starting with France.The company is even trying to raise its profile a little bit, hiring a new chief marketing officer and coming up with a new marketing plan to emphasize the service\u2019s benefits. Ms. Brougher said she, like Mr. Silbermann, prefers to under-promise and over-deliver. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t always work well in the tech world,\u201d she said.Mr. Silbermann said, \u201cIn technology, people are very, very fast to declare something a winner or loser, like, \u2018That\u2019ll never work,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019ll take over the world.\u2019 The truth is always somewhere in between.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The company did not disclose the valuation of the financing round.The Infatuation began life as a side project for two former music industry executives who wanted a way to recommend restaurants and bars to friends.

{"Headline": "Is Cash Better for Poor People Than Conventional Foreign Aid? ", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFIXESU.S.A.I.D., the American foreign aid agency, is conducting a trial that measures the impact when poor people abroad are simply given money with which to decide what\u2019s best for themselves.Mr. Gunther reports on global issues that include poverty and development aid. In Matinza, a village in eastern Rwanda, Esther Nyirabazungu, a 63-year-old widow, lives with her son, daughter and two grandchildren in a hut with a dirt floor and no electricity or running water. Her life is hard, but not as hard as it was before she received six monthly cash donations worth about $100 each, with no strings attached, from a United States government trial program.Her family had been malnourished, so Ms. Nyirabazungu first bought corn, soybeans, sorghum and a small amount of beef with her newfound funds. Then she purchased four goats, which cost between $28 and $46 each, and two chickens, which cost about $5 apiece. The goats had babies, which she now sells for cash to buy more food. \u201cThe life I was living before and the life I am living now are very different,\u201d she told me when I visited. \u201cMy kids are now eating eggs. They now eat meat. We were sleeping on the floor. Now we have a mattress.\u201d This is the first time U.S.A.I.D. has funded programs that simply give people cash, experts say, and they believe it is also the first time any funder has used cash as a tool to help determine which other programs work and which do not.\u201cCash transfers are not currently a big part of the global aid package, but perhaps they should be,\u201d said Daniel Handel, an official with the American aid agency who proposed the experiment when he was an economic growth officer in Rwanda. Now based in Washington, Mr. Handel, 39, is a senior adviser on aid effectiveness, a job that was created for him.\u201cThere\u2019s increasing evidence to suggest that unconditional cash transfers to ordinary citizens are one of the fairest, most cost-effective and most impactful ways to alleviate poverty and stimulate economic growth,\u201d said Diana Ohlbaum, a former U.S.A.I.D. official.The results of the early studies matter less than the fact that U.S.A.I.D. is willing to challenge its own assumptions about what works. \u201cIf GiveDirectly helps to shift even a small portion of institutional spending from less-cost-effective programs to cash transfers, it would be a major accomplishment,\u201d Ms. Tuna said.In an interview, Ms. Glassman said that \u201cmost programs and policies are not being evaluated rigorously.\u201dFounded in 2009 by four graduate students in economics at Harvard and M.I.T., GiveDirectly has big ambitions: It aims to reshape international giving by using cash as a kind of \u201cindex fund\u201d of development against which actively managed interventions can be measured. In the NPR story, Paul Niehaus, a founder of GiveDirectly, said: \u201cWe would like to see organizations make the case that they think they can do more good for the poor with a dollar than the poor could do for themselves.\u201d A report provided by Catholic Relief Services lists the program\u2019s accomplishments: 37,887 households served, 14,854 improved latrines constructed, 6,388 farmers provided with small livestock and 3,159 villages in which community health clubs were established. But these are \u201coutputs\u201d and not \u201coutcomes,\u201d Alemayehu Gebremariam, a Catholic Relief official in Rwanda, acknowledged. \u201cOur impact is expected at the end of the five years.\u201dTwo development economists, Craig McIntosh of the University of California at San Diego and Andrew Zeitlin of Georgetown University, designed the comparison study. Innovations for Poverty Action, a United States-based nonprofit with offices in Rwanda, carried out the research, hiring local staff members to interview 2,788 households. U.S.A.I.D., Innovations for Poverty Action, GiveDirectly, Catholic Relief Services and the economists all declined to comment on the results.Some people argue that a second advantage of cash is philosophical. Mr. Niehaus, of Give Directly, said: \u201cThe basic question is, is it better for us to figure out how to spend this money, or is it better to let poor people decide?\u201d There are, of course, limits to what cash can do. \u201cCash is far from a silver bullet,\u201d Ms. Glassman, of the Center for Global Development, said. \u201cCash won\u2019t provide roads, hospitals or primary health care clinics.\u201d Marc Gunther is a journalist based in Bethesda, Md., who reports on foundations and nonprofits.

{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Plan to Reach 500 Million Indians: Speak Their Language", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBANGALORE, India \u2014 Only 10 percent of India\u2019s 1.3 billion people know English. Yet most of the country\u2019s e-commerce services have been offered only in English, closing off online shopping to the vast majority of people here.Now Amazon is aiming to break through that language barrier. The e-commerce giant on Tuesday offered a hearty \u201cnamaste\u201d to this country\u2019s half a billion Hindi speakers by making its local website and apps available in India\u2019s most popular language. Users of the India site or app will be able to choose Hindi as their preferred language, much as American users can choose Spanish.Amazon\u2019s expansion into Hindi \u2014 its first foray into an Indian language, even as other companies have tried that strategy and pulled back \u2014 is vital to the company\u2019s ambition of making India its next big market.\u201cThe next 100 million customers will have to be in the vernacular language,\u201d said Kishore Thota, director of customer experience and marketing for Amazon India.Mr. Thota said the company\u2019s research found that eight in 10 Indian customers would prefer to shop in a language other than English. \u201cThe level of trust increases when they see something in their own language,\u201d he said in an interview at Amazon\u2019s India headquarters in Bangalore.If the Hindi versions of its site and apps are successful, Amazon plans to quickly add options to shop in other major Indian languages, such as Bengali, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu, which are dominant in regions outside the Hindi belt in the north.Amazon is betting that the market is more ready now, especially as cheap mobile data means that Indian-language speakers are coming online at a brisk clip.Paytm, a digital payments company that operates the No. 3 online retailer, Paytm Mall, began allowing customers to make purchases in 10 Indian languages in October. About 15 percent of the site\u2019s customers do that, said Amit Sinha, who heads the digital marketplace.But most of Paytm\u2019s listings are still in English. Converting them to other languages requires Paytm to build new automated translation tools as well as to persuade sellers and brands to translate their own content. \u201cIt\u2019s a multidimensional problem,\u201d Mr. Sinha said.For Amazon, creating a Hindi-language site and app was difficult from the start. When the company began building its Hindi app and site about two years ago, it first tried to run the English version through a translation algorithm. The result \u201cwas completely illegible,\u201d Mr. Thota said.So the team went back to the drawing board, tapping people to translate key listings and steps in the purchase process into colloquial Hindi. They then showed samples to actual and potential customers, refined them and used the final versions to train the algorithms to do mass translation.Not everything has been translated yet, and Amazon is working with leading brands to convert their pages. People are also reviewing pages to make sure they look right, since there is often more than one way to translate an English phrase into Hindi.One challenge is that spoken Hindi mixes in a lot of English. Amazon decided that some words and phrases, like \u201cfree,\u201d \u201cjeans\u201d and \u201ccash on delivery,\u201d should be kept in English but written using Hindi\u2019s Devanagari script.Most of the 390 million Indians with internet access use it to chat with friends and family, watch videos, listen to music, look for religious content and read the news, the study found. Just 40 percent transact online, and about one-third of those stop after one purchase.Roopa Kudva, who heads Omidyar\u2019s operations in India, said that buying something online is the last step in the journey of a new internet user.\u201cIndians are very comfortable experimenting on the internet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the moment it comes to making payments online, people think it\u2019s a very sophisticated thing that requires expert knowledge, and they shy away from it.\u201dWhile being able to shop in a familiar language is important, she said, many of the global conventions of online shopping, such as the shopping cart, are unfamiliar to Indians, who are more used to going to a store and asking a shopkeeper to pull items from a shelf.Amazon said it realized that the Hindi version of its site would not suddenly solve those problems.\u201cIt will make people feel a lot more comfortable that we understand them,\u201d said Amit Agarwal, the head of Amazon India. \u201cBut we are focused on all the barriers that will ultimately transform how India buys and sells.\u201dFor example, Amazon offers customer support in half a dozen Indian languages, and today, more than half the queries are in languages other than English.The company has also signed up about 14,000 retail locations across India for its Amazon Easy program, in which a local shopkeeper helps customers place Amazon orders, receives packages and then delivers them. \u201cThey provide basic customer service in a language the customer understands,\u201d Mr. Thota said.Google is also considering a move into e-commerce in India. It recently invested in the Chinese online retailer JD.com, and last week announced plans to turn its multilingual Indian payments app, Google Pay, into more of a portal through which offline and online merchants could handle transactions.By 2021, 73 percent of India\u2019s internet users will prefer to use languages other than English, compared with 57 percent in 2016, according to a study last year by KPMG and Google.Given those trends, every e-commerce site in India has to figure out a way to address the local-language problem.\u201cAnybody who is serious about this country will have to do it,\u201d said Mr. Sinha of Paytm.Advertisement"}

We know voting is important, but taking the time to research all of the candidates and their values can be time consuming, and honestly, a little confusing. We wanted to find out what people our age should know in order to vote responsibly.This week, we were joined by another contributor to The Edit, Ebony Miranda, to talk to a few members of The New York Times politics team about the midterm elections and what we should know about them.This interview has been edited and condensed.After high school, instead of going straight to college like many of my friends, I moved to Busesa, a rural village in Uganda, for six months to work in a school and teach science. It was a drastic move, to say the least, but I think at that point in my life it was a welcomed change from my childhood in Kansas City. It took awhile to get used to it, but I began spending much more time at my school, as well as making friends in the village, so that I was constantly hanging out with someone or learning a new skill (like how to know when your goat is in heat! Yes, I'm serious). \u2014 Julia DavisIn 2011, my husband and I left Red Hook, Brooklyn for his tiny, rural hometown of Fort Bragg, Calif. Fort Bragg\u2019s population hovers around 7,000. Almost immediately, I hated it. I missed our community garden, walking everywhere, the museums, the food, the hustle and the bustle of New York, the diversity, the feeling that anything and everything was just around the corner. We lasted 11 months in Fort Bragg. I took a job teaching in Detroit for a year then made it back to Brooklyn. We stayed on in New York for three more years before finally succumbing to the realization that Fort Bragg had a lot to offer. I missed seeing the Pacific every day, the pleasant commutes, the kindness of everyone I met, the joyous bounty of the weekly farmer\u2019s market, the rugged beauty, and of course, the absolutely ideal marine climate. We\u2019ve been living here for a little over two years now and just purchased a house last October. We can hear the roar of the ocean from our backyard and there is so much small-town charm here from the Labor Day Paul Bunyan festivities (logging remains a big industry here) to the light-up truck parade at Christmastime. I feel very fortunate to call this lovely little town home. Now if only I could afford to keep an apartment in New York for visits... \u2014 Amy SariskyThe day before our big move, we visited Chicago's Field Museum, fine dined downtown and ended our day attending a Grant Park Symphony Orchestra concert. Two days later we arrived at Esterbrook, Wyo. With our arrival, the town grew from nine to 11 inhabitants. It was 19 miles by gravel road from a town of less than 4,000. Fine dining consisted of Friday night potlucks where neighbors competed for the most exotic dish. Roasted rattler anyone? How about porcupine stew? Our neighbors were just as interesting as our meals. One day, two of them got into a dispute over a barking dog. They argued, tempers flared and soon the dog was shot dead. Twenty minutes later the dispute was settled when the culprit was shot in the knee by the dog owner. We saw both of them a month later at our Friday potluck. One was limping badly. They had decided things had gotten a bit out of hand, but there were no hard feelings. And then there was us, well educated in everything useless for life on the Wyoming range. Discussing current events was difficult. There was no national news since there was no available TV. There were no newspapers. The lead story on the local radio station one day was the hours the cemetery would be open for Memorial Day. So, how did we do? Not so well. We lasted a year, then moved into the town of nearly 4,000. \u2014 James TaylorTiernaur Anderson, a junior at Columbia University, sent us a problem to figure out this week:I have a tendency to throw myself at a lot of things, and then slowly quit and back out of commitments as I find my overwhelming schedule taking a toll on my physical and mental health. But with this comes an immense amount of guilt, especially as I see my peers taking on more and more and toughing out the sleepless nights and lunch-less days. Last year, I tried to do it all in order to avoid this guilt and to keep up with my friends. It ended very badly. By the end of the spring semester, all this stress had exacerbated a chronic health issue I have, and my health and spirits were at an all-time low. I ended up having to take a step back and spend my summer at home focused on my wellness.Now, I can feel myself slipping back in to the same pattern of overcommitting myself. As I see it, my options are either backing out of said commitments and spending my then less-busy days feeling guilty, or sticking with everything I have committed to and trying to balance it all without letting it affect my health. I don\u2019t like either of these options! What do I do?!The idea is this: We\u2019re constantly bombarded with ideas, projects, opportunities and more that we\u2019d love to do \u2014 if only we had the time. But we don\u2019t, and time is a resource you\u2019ll find disappears exponentially quicker as you age. So you need to focus on your energy on things that truly matter to you.But how?Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Hits $1,000,000,000,000 in Value, Following Apple", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Amazon has become the second American company to cross that once-unimaginable line. Its shares rose as high as $2,050.50 on Tuesday morning, pushing it over $1 trillion in value, before immediately falling back and then ending the day at $2,039.51, below the $1 trillion threshold. Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is worth nearly as much as Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett put together.This time, the explanation is more complicated.Amazon captures 49 cents of every e-commerce dollar in the United States. It employs more than 550,000 people and generates $178 billion in annual revenue. It sells everything from computing space to peanut butter to appointments with plumbers.But the thing it has always sold the most \u2014 to investors, customers, the news media \u2014 is excitement.In the beginning, Amazon was an exciting new way to shop for books: online. Then it was an exciting new way to read (Kindle e-books), an exciting new way to publish (CreateSpace), an exciting new way to power the internet (Amazon Web Services), an exciting new way to get deliveries (Amazon Prime), an exciting new way to make your house a high-tech outpost (Alexa).Long before Amazon went to Hollywood and began making movies, it was the star of its own show, generating vast amounts of attention just for being Amazon. No other company had ever managed to turn its lack of profit into such effective drama, or the question of what its next move would be.Mr. Bezos made clear when Amazon went public in 1997 that he would not work for Wall Street, and the result was a company cast in an entirely different mold. It never feared losing money. In a real sense, there were no consequences for being wrong.Behind the drama is a relentless and sometimes scary ambition. Amazon is the Jay Gatsby of American companies, believing that tomorrow it will run faster, stretch its arms out farther, fulfill the desires of consumers in ways that no other business possibly could. You will live in Amazon\u2019s world, it says, and you will like it.One of the great benefits for Amazon of this approach is that it is impossible to tell where reality ends and hype \u2014 or perhaps even madness \u2014 begins.Take Amazon\u2019s drone program, which it first announced on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI know this looks like science fiction,\u201d Mr. Bezos said, as he showed a film of an unmanned vehicle delivering a package. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d He said there were \u201cyears of additional work\u201d to be done, but declared himself an optimist. Drone delivery, he predicted, would be a reality in \u201cfour, five years.\u201dThat was December 2013. Roughly a million features were written about Amazon and its drones, nearly all with the subtext: Isn\u2019t this the coolest thing ever?Over the years, the company kept raising the stakes, as if they were not already high enough. Amazon applied a few years ago for a patent for an \u201caerial fulfillment center\u201d that would float at 45,000 feet. Drones would fly out of it with your order and then glide down to your backyard.The fulfillment center, which looks in drawings like a blimp tugging a warehouse, has other uses besides delivering dinner. It would drift down to 2,000 feet to what the patent calls \u201cthe advertising altitude,\u201d where it would present information \u201cabout items and/or services.\u201d Perhaps it will be just like the movie \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and the floating ads will trumpet the joys of working in Amazon\u2019s off-world colonies. The patent was granted this summer.Haye Kesteloo, senior editor of the news site DroneDJ, noted that there were many hurdles to routine delivery by drone, even if the vehicles are not being launched from airships. The claimed drone attack on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela will not help soothe nervous citizens.Nevertheless, Mr. Kesteloo, like Mr. Bezos, proclaims himself an optimist. \u201cCompanies like Amazon will make routine drone deliveries to consumers by 2025,\u201d he said \u2014 only twice as far away as promised.\u201cThere is no doubt anymore,\u201d said Ron Nussbaum, who runs an investment management fund called Maverick Value in Los Angeles. \u201cThe stock always goes up, and no one doubts it will keep going up.\u201dMr. Nussbaum, who emphasized that over all his investments were profitable, might be the last Amazon skeptic. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d he said.And an expensive one. Last year, when Amazon crossed $1,000 a share, he started buying \u201cput\u201d options \u2014 bets that the stock would decline. One of his puts has dropped 85 percent; another, 92 percent.Mr. Nussbaum is planning to buy more. He thinks people are confusing their impressions of Amazon the company with Amazon as an investment.\u201cIf I fill up your gas tank for $1 but it costs me $2, you can say it\u2019s a great product, but it doesn\u2019t make any sense as a company,\u201d he said.Apple had profits of $48 billion last year. Amazon\u2019s were less than a tenth of that. If profits were all that mattered, Amazon should be worth about $100 billion, the size of United Technologies or Texas Instruments. That is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing to get people excited, either.Even before Amazon hit $1 trillion, the milestone was old news. There was a poll on Facebook run by a group of young Wall Street investors. The question: Would Amazon or Apple be the first to hit $2 trillion?The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of Amazon. Dreams will always triumph over devices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Technology Harming Teenagers?", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bylettersReaders critique a psychiatrist\u2019s essay debunking claims that technology is causing an epidemic of anxiety.To the Editor:Second, I agree with Dr. Friedman that kids and teenagers are facing an anxiety-provoking world, so distress is largely normal. But to dismiss parents\u2019 instincts that our kids are in trouble and that technology may be part of the problem risks being both misguided and condescending. Finally, Dr. Friedman argues, like many before him, that smartphones and video games are just another technological innovation that has triggered existential panic. I disagree. There is a qualitative difference between worries about television and \u201cbrain rot\u201d and worries about our current digital ecosystem. Television was not designed to mediate our lives, track our every purchase and movement, or listen in on our conversations. My parents never had to worry about internet trolls and haters during Saturday morning cartoons.Excellent research is underway to tease apart the links between anxiety and technology so that we can find real solutions.To the Editor:Young people today experience increased financial uncertainty relative to previous generations, with housing, education and health care costs having escalated astronomically relative to income. In addition, young people today have to contemplate the consequences of climate change over the next five or six decades, which will in all likelihood transform the quality of everyday life in many ways, almost none of which are desirable.So if Dr. Friedman is correct in considering much anxiety reported by young people to be \u201ceveryday\u201d anxiety, and not due to digital technology, he is nevertheless incorrect in assuming that the level of distress is not more acute.To the Editor: This is no Luddite writing. I love my phone. The internet has given me Google Classroom, an infinitude of teaching resources that would have previously taken me several lifetimes to access. And yeah, I play solitaire while waiting for the dentist.But I have to disagree that technology has not caused increased anxiety. There are more visits to the social worker, more running down to the nurse, more medication. The most frightening change of all: The halls are quiet. The bell rings, and all the students whip out their phones. They make no eye contact, and the loud, raucous chatter that used to drive us all crazy is gone.I miss it.To the Editor:It concerns me when I see a young mother strolling down the street with her infant while looking down at her phone rather than engaging with her newborn. It concerns me when teachers lament their inability to get their students to pay attention in the classroom. The list goes on. I do not see this as an epidemic of anxiety \u2014 rather an incursion of technology.People develop powerful relationships with their cellphones. Like any transformative tool, it has its risks. I think we do well to realize that the technology industry is fueled by for-profit businesses invested not in the emotional or intellectual well-being of the public but in maximizing profits by getting people to stay connected to their devices. For this reason alone, a healthy skepticism is warranted in evaluating the impact of technology on mental health.To the Editor:As a developmental psychologist, I find it plausible that the impact of social media in particular could be a factor, given its newness and prevalence in our lives. Consider that social media has enabled the sharing of carefully curated lives, leading some teenagers \u2014 as well as adults \u2014 to experience a sense of exclusion or inadequacy relative to peers. Further, these platforms have resulted in cyberbullying, potentially more psychologically damaging than any bullying that might happen in a schoolyard or on a campus. Without better epidemiological data, it would be premature and unwise to conclude that increased anxiety among teenagers is a \u201cmyth.\u201dTo the Editor:Here is what I believe are the questions to ask: Does technology, like marijuana and alcohol, when used by adolescents, reduce the time they spend learning effective coping skills? Does the amount of time teenagers spend looking at their phones reduce their interpersonal skills, thereby increasing their anxiety and loneliness? Does the fact that parents are also spending an enormous amount of time on their phones reduce their ability to teach coping skills to their teenagers?Phones are the new alcohol. Not because they\u2019re addictive, but because people turn to them at the first sign of distress, which ultimately means they do not learn how to cope any other way.To the Editor:Advertisement"}

His move to buy most of Fox forced Disney to raise its bid for those assets so much that when it came time to compete for Sky, Disney had a hard time bidding against Comcast without overleveraging itself. Time will tell whether the Sky deal proves successful \u2014 but if scored simply on the dark arts of deal making, Mr. Roberts already won.We\u2019ll see whether Disney ends up selling Fox\u2019s stake in Sky to Comcast.

Lawmakers and the New Mexico attorney general \u201care really stepping up and putting pressure on the companies that should be coming from the F.T.C.,\u201d he added.Still, Mr. Golin said he was optimistic that the congressmen could glean information from Google.\u201cThese are not questions we\u2019ve ever gotten answers to, and it would be great to get on the record what Google and YouTube actually know about this,\u201d he said.The Federal Trade Commission declined to comment.The letter from the two lawmakers concludes with a series of pointed questions that ask Google to explain how it determines the age of its users, whether or not it collects the same personal data from children and adults and why YouTube includes channels that are \u201cclearly child-directed.\u201dMr. Cicilline and Mr. Fortenberry gave Google a deadline of Oct. 17 to reply.Advertisement"}

Followers of FIRE tend to be male and work in the tech industry, left-brained engineer-types who geek out on calculating compound interest over 40 years, or the return on investment (R.O.I.) on low-fee index funds versus real estate rentals. Some practice \u201clean FIRE\u201d (extreme frugality), others \u201cfat FIRE\u201d (maintaining a more typical standard of living while saving and investing), and still others \u201cbarista FIRE\u201d (working part-time at Starbucks after retiring, for the company\u2019s health insurance). To be \u201cfiring\u201d is to slash one\u2019s expenses to maximize saving while amassing income-generating investments sufficient to support oneself. To have \u201cfired\u201d is to have achieved that goal.\u201cA lot of people think you\u2019re a new-age hippie,\u201d said Mr. Jensen, who sold his four-bedroom, four-bathroom house, downsized to a more modest home and maxed-out retirement accounts while firing. \u201cThey can\u2019t even wrap their minds around it.\u201d In retirement, Mr. Jensen and his wife and two daughters plan to live on roughly $40,000 a year generated from investments. Because his wife currently works, they have yet to draw on those accounts. But already, it\u2019s a life rich on time but short on luxuries: Groceries are bought at Costco, car and home repairs are done by him. \u201cPeople always assume there\u2019s an external circumstance: \u2018Oh, you must have received an inheritance,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jensen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just chosen to live far below our means. That itself is a radical idea.\u201dEqually radical is opting out of the work force in your 30s or early 40s, a time of life when men and women are normally leaning into their careers, or, less happily, enduring the daily grind to pay the bills until Social Security kicks in. But Mr. Long said he was deeply unhappy in his job, where over his career he witnessed drug costs skyrocketing, sick people battling with health insurers and the over-prescription of opioids and the resulting addiction crisis. His customers, angry, confused, financially stretched, often lashed out at the person behind the counter. \u201cThere were days when I had 12- or 14-hour shifts where I didn\u2019t use the restroom, where I didn\u2019t eat, because so much work was piled up on me,\u201d Mr. Long said. Like Mr. Jensen, he had been saving a sizable portion of his income over the past decade, and he and his wife had a paid-for house and an investment portfolio worth a little more than $1 million. Why stick around? \u201cThe reality is the numbers are there for me,\u201d Mr. Long said. \u201cTo go to a job that\u2019s making you miserable every day, it doesn\u2019t make sense to pad the bank account at that point.\u201d But Vicki Robin, who wrote that financial guide with Joe Dominguez, said the FIRE crowd is a different breed of dropout than those in the \u201990s. \u201cOur aim was not just to have a whole bunch of people quit their jobs,\u201d Ms. Robin said. \u201cOur aim was to lower consumption to save the planet. We attracted longtime simple-living people, religious people, environmentalists.\u201dThe FIRE adherents are, by contrast, \u201cvery numbers oriented, fascinated by the minutiae of taxes and accounting,\u201d Ms. Robin said. But if, as Ms. Robin said, FIRE adherents \u201cdon\u2019t have the aspirational part\u201d of earlier generations, why are they so determined to quit the work force? Many millennials haven\u2019t been working longer than a decade, if that. It\u2019s about having agency, Ms. Robin said: \u201cThe worker in this economy has very little sense of control over their existence. People are expendable. You\u2019re a young person and you look ahead and you say, \u2018What\u2019s there for me?\u2019\u201dMs. Shen\u2019s wake-up moment came when she watched a fellow I.T. colleague collapse at his desk after clocking 14-hour days and get hauled away in an ambulance. For several years before that, she and Mr. Leung, following the path laid out by their parents, had tried to buy a house in Toronto\u2019s ever-escalating real estate market. But, Ms. Shen said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter how much you saved, it was a goal post that kept moving. And I was seeing people stressed out paying their mortgages.\u201dThough they had good educations and well-paying jobs in the booming tech sector, Ms. Shen and Mr. Leung faced the looming threats of outsourcing and artificial intelligence, and had no hope of a retirement pension, or even that their employers would exist in five years. At the same time, their jobs were all-consuming, their work hours basically 24-7. Rather than chain themselves to a costly mortgage, and therefore to high-pressure jobs, the couple decided to pour their money into an investment portfolio and peace out. \u201cThe rule books our parents have given us is advice that\u2019s perfect for 1970,\u201d Ms. Shen said. \u201cWe have to throw out that rule book and write a new one.\u201d Mr. Leung spoke of the challenges his generation faces more bluntly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have jobs that will take care of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to take care of ourselves.\u201dBy ditching a big city, Ms. Shen and Mr. Leung exemplify another underlying reason for the popularity of FIRE: the high price of urban life, especially in places like New York and Southern California. There\u2019s the insane housing prices, the high cost of child care, the temptations of so-called lifestyle creep.\u201cWe were spending nearly $3,000 a month on rent, and that was considered a good deal,\u201d said Scott Rieckens, 35, who, along with his wife, Taylor, 33, and their infant daughter until recently lived in Coronado, Calif., a pricey beach town across the bay from San Diego. \u201cWe made something like $160,000 between the two of us, but we didn\u2019t have a whole lot left over.\u201d But even with those lifestyle cuts, the couple couldn\u2019t increase their savings rate substantially unless they relocated to a cheaper community, a deleveraging tactic the FIRE crowd calls \u201carbitrage.\u201dThe idea, Mr. Adeney said, is \u201cto reap the high salary\u201d of a place like Silicon Valley, \u201cthen take that nest egg out to any of the thousands of nice, affordable cities and towns we have in this country and begin a second stage of life on your own terms.\u201d Ms. Rieckens, who works in recruiting, was initially reluctant to give up her BMW and beachy life and the prestige that went with it, until she saw a retirement calculator that showed they could retire in 10 years if they adopted FIRE and moved, or when they are 90 if they continued their upscale lifestyle in Coronado. \u201cI never paid attention to the finances, I thought it will all work out,\u201d Ms. Rieckens said. \u201cAfter I had a baby, I had stress around how I could spend more time with her. I was almost a slave to my job because of the way we were living.\u201dThey ended up in Bend, Ore., where there\u2019s no state sales tax and they could afford to buy a house. Gas for their used Honda CRV with 186,000 miles (they got rid of the BMW and downsized to one vehicle) is a dollar-per-gallon cheaper than in San Diego, although Mr. Rieckens often rides his bike around town. \u201cThe whole retire early thing is unimportant to me. It\u2019s more about gaining control of your time,\u201d Mr. Rieckens said. \u201cIf you dive into the definition of retirement, what you\u2019re retiring from is mandatory labor. It\u2019s not necessarily about pi\u00f1a coladas on the beach.\u201d A retirement that starts well before you go gray and lasts 40, 50 even 60 years is an anomaly in modern life. How do you fill all those days, months, decades? On a recent weekday afternoon, Mr. Jensen was taking his two daughters, ages 8 and 11, to the Boulder County Fair. \u201cI told them, \u2018O.K., we\u2019re going to wait until Thursday for half-price day,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by the way, we\u2019re walking there. It\u2019s two miles from our house.\u201dFearing boredom, Mr. Jensen at first took on way too much, and he found it strange to be at the local rec center exercising alongside senior citizens, or shopping at empty big-box stores on a Tuesday. He also beat his own mother to retirement, which made for awkward family get-togethers. It\u2019s hardly surprising that a tech-savvy generation would proselytize on the internet. Also, blogging can provide the holy grail of early retirement, an additional income stream. One month into FIRE, he wrote of the guilt he felt spending money (on video games), and his concern that he would be over his household budget. He spent his days with family, at the gym, doing housework, exercising. He had no regrets so far: \u201cI made the right decision. This is life.\u201dIn the months that followed, he rewatched the mini-series \u201cRoots,\u201d lost all interest in talk of FIRE now that he had achieved it, feared a looming stock market crash, had nightmares that \u201cI\u2019m back at work and arguing with morons,\u201d finished a marathon in a personal best sub-three hours, felt moments of social isolation, took a two-week road trip across the heartland, and went twice to the beach in Florida with his wife and watched their net worth reach its highest point, despite not working, which he attributed to \u201cthe passage of the tax cut for wealthy job creators like myself.\u201d Oh, and he started a blog. \u201cMy life is so much better than it was before,\u201d Mr. Long wrote seven months in. \u201cI hope everyone here finds this peace.\u201d Speaking by phone, Mr. Long acknowledged it was possible that he\u2019d simply burned out, that all of this FIRE stuff was just a needed break until he found a more satisfying career. When he was recently offered a job back in the pharmaceutical field, it induced a mild panic attack. That morning, he\u2019d woken up on his own, \u201cnot when an alarm clock told me that I had a responsibility.\u201d He\u2019d read the news online for 30 minutes, went on a seven-mile run, took a nap and \u201cwatched the ceiling fan spin around for a little bit.\u201dAdvertisement"}

All of our worst social paranoias contained in a single interaction.But there\u2019s an easy way to get around this, simultaneously coming off as more likable while working to build a deeper, more genuine connection with someone: Ask questions.Those follow-up questions, the study found, are especially helpful to increase how much we are liked because they show that we are listening sincerely and trying to show we care.Imagine that! Being a genuine, sincere conversation partner makes people like you more. What a world.A team of researchers from Yale, Harvard, Cornell and the University of Essex found that after initial interactions \u201cpeople systematically underestimated how much their conversation partners liked them and enjoyed their company.\u201dThis is called the liking gap, or the difference between how much we think people like us and how much people actually like us.The study looked at how relationships evolved between new acquaintances and found that the anxiety and self-doubt of meeting someone new can pervade in any type of relationship, sometimes lasting for months.\u201cPeople are often biased by their own internal monologues, which, after social interactions, can be remarkably self-critical and negative,\u201d the authors wrote.

Simply having the knowledge that any self-doubt about an interaction with a new person is unwarranted is a powerful shift in the way we approach new connections. If you feel like someone dislikes you based on a single meeting, odds are that\u2019s just not the case (and they\u2019re probably thinking the same thing).Just keep asking those questions, listening to the answers and being as genuine as possible.

I am a Russian bot in the Capitol.\u201dDozens of protesters roamed Capitol Hill on Wednesday to disrupt the second day of confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court.But Mr. Jones was on hand to cast a shadow over a different show \u2014 a pair of marquee congressional hearings scrutinizing the influence of two of the nation\u2019s largest technology companies, Facebook and Twitter.It was quite a performance, even for the incendiary Mr. Jones, whose website, Infowars, has peddled theories that the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax, that Hillary Clinton is a demon, and that Democrats run a global child-sex ring. He tussled with the police, wandered in and out of the hearing room, thrusting a smartphone up in the air to film the proceedings. For nearly an hour, he inveighed against Democrats and mainstream news outlets that he said were slandering him, sweating through his blue oxford shirt.When Senator Marco Rubio, the pugnacious Florida Republican, stepped out of the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing to speak with reporters, Mr. Jones homed in. Mr. Rubio launched into a discussion of the risks of authoritarian governments abusing social media platforms.\u201cBut what about the Democrats purging conservatives?\u201d Mr. Jones cut in. \u201cHe\u2019s not answering. Republicans are acting like it isn\u2019t happening. Thank God Trump is.\u201dA bewildered Mr. Rubio rolled his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s weird,\u201d he said, asking aloud who Mr. Jones was \u2014 a question that appeared designed to irk Mr. Jones.Then Mr. Jones patted Mr. Rubio on the shoulder.\u201cDon\u2019t touch me again, man,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cI\u2019m asking you not to touch me.\u201dMr. Jones asked if the senator would have him arrested.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get arrested,\u201d Mr. Rubio continued. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of you myself.\u201d\u201cOh, he\u2019ll beat me up. He doesn\u2019t know who I am, but he is so mad,\u201d Mr. Jones said with excitement. \u201cYou are not going to silence me. You are not going to silence America. You are literally like a little gangster thug. Rubio just threatened to silence me.\u201dThe senator walked away and the show went on.For Mr. Jones, the appearance of top Facebook and Twitter executives was personal enough to bring his trolling out of the dark corners of the internet and into the halls of the House and Senate.In early August, Facebook and YouTube banned Mr. Jones and Infowars from their platforms, drastically reducing his reach. Since then, he has led an on-air crusade against the companies, pointedly accusing them of an unfounded campaign to suppress conservative speech.\u201cI am here to face my accusers one way or another,\u201d he declared to a bank of cameras just outside a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, where Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, and Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter, faced questions from senators about how to combat foreign influence campaigns on their platforms. He urged lawmakers either to block the companies from banning users or to simply break the companies up.\u201cThe real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people,\u201d Mr. Jones bellowed. \u201cThey are outright banning people and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.\u201dNeither Mr. Jones nor Infowars actually earned a mention inside the Senate\u2019s hearing room, as lawmakers debated how to combat the ability of foreign powers like Russia to influence the American political process. But later in the day, as House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee pressed Mr. Dorsey on what they called Twitter\u2019s censorship of conservative political figures and viewpoints, Mr. Jones\u2019s arguments appeared to have more resonance.Jack Posobiec, an ally of Mr. Jones, microphone in hand, repeatedly conducted interviews with Mr. Jones. He complained about being barred from testifying. Other allies were on hand, armed with rolling cellphone video, including Laura Loomer, a former member of the undercover conservative group Project Veritas, and Charles C. Johnson, a right-wing internet provocateur.Ms. Loomer made her own attempt to halt the proceedings, standing up in the House hearing room to publicly accuse Mr. Dorsey of lying about censoring conservatives.\u201cYou are censoring conservatives, and I am asking you, President Donald Trump, to help us,\u201d she shouted, bringing the hearing to a sharp halt.Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a certified auctioneer, quickly stepped in with a fast-paced patter in an attempt to drown out Ms. Loomer until the police could remove her from the hearing room.Earlier, as he waited with a large gaggle of reporters trying to intercept Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey outside the Senate hearing room, Mr. Jones sounded pleased with what he had pulled off.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun to get out of the studio,\u201d he said to his entourage. \u201cNow when they have these hearings, I am going to show up.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated Laura Loomer\u2019s affiliation with Project Veritas.

{"Headline": "Republicans Accuse Twitter of Bias Against Conservatives", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe sparring focused on the testimony of Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, who repeatedly denied the accusations during a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Republicans grilled Mr. Dorsey, suggesting that Twitter\u2019s algorithms suppress conservative viewpoints and discriminate against Republican voices.Representative Mike Doyle, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, accused Republicans of sounding the alarm of bias for political gain. The idea that social media services exhibit a partisan slant, Mr. Doyle said, was a \u201cload of crap.\u201dYet the notion that social media companies might be intentionally choosing what political content to display was also pushed by the Trump Administration. Before the afternoon hearing, the Justice Department said Attorney General Jeff Sessions planned to hold a meeting with state attorneys general this month to examine how social media companies \u201cmay be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\u201dWhile Mr. Sessions has weighed in on free speech issues in the past, the scrutiny of social media pushes his agenda into a hotly contested and political area. Democrats and media law experts immediately pushed back.\u201cThis is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction to the president\u2019s misguided belief in such bias, which has been disproved time and again by legitimate researchers,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, a former senior official at the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama administration.\u201cThey are outright banning people and they are blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech,\u201d Mr. Jones said of Facebook and Google on Wednesday.Those issues have prompted outrage from lawmakers, who hauled Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to Washington to testify in April.\u201cIt\u2019s totally politics,\u201d said Andrew Schwartzman, a lecturer at Georgetown University Law Center, of the House hearing. He said Republican lawmakers accused social media companies of bias but he doubted that Congress would want to create laws to monitor speech on the services.\u201cI don\u2019t hear any discussion that suggests there are genuine legislative solutions to problems they are talking about,\u201d Mr. Schwartzman said.During the hearing, Mr. Dorsey repeatedly said that Twitter did not exhibit any bias against conservatives, echoing his previous denials. He also sidestepped taking sides in the partisan debate. When Kathy Castor, a Democrat of Florida, asked if he felt manipulated by Republican politicians for fund-raising purposes, Mr. Dorsey demurred.\u201cI do believe there is growing concern around power companies like ours hold,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople do see us as a digital public square and that comes with certain expectations.\u201dThe lawmakers\u2019 comments were a stark shift from the harsh criticism that they had leveled at the social media companies for months.\u201cAfter the election, you were reluctant to admit there was a problem,\u201d said Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the committee and a Democrat of Virginia. \u201cEach of you have come a long way with respect to recognizing the threat.\u201d\u201cTo the invisible witness, good morning to you,\u201d said Senator Kamala Harris, a Democrat of California. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida, said Google may not have shown up \u201cbecause they are arrogant.\u201dThe afternoon\u2019s House hearing was far more political from the start. One lawmaker brought up Twitter\u2019s decision to take down an anti-abortion post by Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican. Others said the company needed to hire people outside of San Francisco so its employees would have more diverse political perspectives.\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion if there wasn\u2019t a general agreement that your company had discriminated against conservatives,\u201d Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, said to Mr. Dorsey.During the hearing, House Republicans pressed Mr. Dorsey about the way Twitter\u2019s systems treat conservative voices, including the methods by which the service suggests people to follow or selects certain users to be promoted.Mr. Dorsey, in his prepared testimony \u2014 which he also posted on Twitter \u2014 called bias in algorithms an important, but complex, matter. \u201cOur responsibility is to understand, measure, and reduce accidental bias due to factors such as the quality of the data used to train our algorithms,\u201d he said.Democrats slammed their Republican colleagues, saying they were promoting unproven allegations of bias for political fund-raising ahead of the midterms. Campaigns for House Leader Kevin McCarthy and President Trump have promoted their criticism of social media bias in online fund-raising ads.Again and again, Mr. Dorsey rebuffed the claims that Twitter favors one political viewpoint over another. \u201cLooking at the data, we analyzed tweets sent by all members of the House and Senate, and found no statistically significant difference between the number of times a tweet by a Democrat is viewed versus a Republican, even after our ranking and filtering of tweets has been applied,\u201d he said at one point.The contentiousness was evident more than an hour into the House hearing, when the right-wing activist Laura Loomer interrupted to accuse social media executives of censoring conservative voices. Holding up a cellphone on a stick to record herself, Ms. Loomer called on Mr. Trump to \u201csave us.\u201dHer interruption was largely drowned out by Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a certified auctioneer, who started calling out prices as Ms. Loomer repeated her accusations at increasing volume. The bidding reached $550 before Ms. Loomer was escorted from the room, and Mr. Long ceased his patter and yielded the floor back to the House Committee.Katie Benner and Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington and Kate Conger from San Francisco.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I populisti italiani ammorbidiscono la legge sulle vaccinazioni al rientro a scuola dei bambini", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 Da anni, la comunicazione anti-establishment del Movimento 5 Stelle diffonde confusione sui vaccini. Il suo cofondatore ha collegato i vaccini all\u2019autismo. I suoi leader politici hanno condotto compagne contro una legge che rendeva obbligatorie le vaccinazioni.La galassia di siti web che fa riferimento al M5S ha ospitato innumerevoli post di scettici sui vaccini e gli attivisti del Movimento hanno accusato i vaccini di provocare tumori e allergie. Una senatrice \u00e8 arrivata a definire le cicatrici lasciate da alcune vaccinazioni \u201cmarchi per le bestie\u201d.Gioved\u00ec scorso, nella settimana di riapertura delle scuole, il Movimento 5 Stelle e il suo partner di governo, la Lega, hanno approvato un decreto che consente agli alunni di stare in classe a condizione che i loro genitori attestino che sono stati vaccinati o che lo saranno entro marzo. Non occorre nessuna certificazione medica.I contrari ritengono il decreto un provvedimento pericoloso e puramente politico, che crea caos nel sistema scolastico, aumenta i rischi per gli alunni affetti da carenze del sistema immunitario ed espone il paese a una possibile emergenza sanitaria.Nel corso del 2017, i casi di morbillo in Italia sono schizzati a 5.006 rispetto agli 843 dell\u2019anno precedente, collocando il paese al terzo posto in Europa per incidenza della malattia in rapporto alla popolazione, preceduto da due paesi ben pi\u00f9 poveri, la Romania e la Grecia. Il Messico ha raccomandato ai suoi cittadini che intendono recarsi in Italia di vaccinarsi.L\u2019Italia \u00e8 forse il caso pi\u00f9 grave di un contagio di altro genere che si va diffondendo in Europa e nel Mondo Occidentale, un contagio nel quale la politica populista, la disinformazione e la pseudoscienza veicolate da Internet si sono combinate con un sentimento anti-sistema che impone la diffidenza verso chi possiede competenze. Ma ora le forze populiste che hanno alimentato quella tendenza sono al potere e devono fare i conti con le conseguenze che questa comporta per la sanit\u00e0 pubblica e la sicurezza dei cittadini.\u201cFa tutto parte della deriva anti-sistema\u201d, ha detto Beatrice Lorenzin, ministro della salute nel precedente governo di centrosinistra e promotrice della legge del 2017 sull\u2019obbligatoriet\u00e0 delle vaccinazioni che porta il suo nome. \u201cDato che tutto \u00e8 casta, anche la scienza diventa una casta. Ma la scienza \u00e8 l\u2019ultimo bastione, e quando si riduce al minimo l\u2019autorevolezza della scienza non resta nient\u2019altro\u201d.Di fronte all\u2019aumento dei casi di morbillo e a un\u2019erosione della fiducia nei vaccini iniziata da una decina d\u2019anni, il precedente governo decise che i bambini dovessero ricevere dieci vaccinazioni prima di potere essere ammessi nelle scuole. La legge \u00e8 entrata in vigore quest\u2019anno.Quest\u2019estate, tuttavia, il ministro pentastellato Giulia Grillo, successore della Lorenzin nel nuovo governo populista, ha cercato di allentare i vincoli imposti dalla legge sulla vaccinazione obbligatoria, inserendo nella sua formulazione un concetto che ha definito \u201cobbligo flessibile\u201d. Giulia Grillo, che non ha voluto rilasciarci dichiarazioni, ha deciso, in via definitiva, per l\u2019estensione dell\u2019iscrizione agli scolari senza certificazione vaccinale.\u201cNon \u00e8 cambiato niente; \u00e8 esattamente come prima\u201d, ha dichiarato Rocco Casalino, portavoce dei Cinque Stelle, gioved\u00ec, dopo l\u2019approvazione della legge, sollevando l\u2019ovvia domanda: ma allora, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 stata approvata?Gioved\u00ec stesso, alcuni senatori del M5S hanno dichiarato che il loro prossimo impegno sarebbe stato la dissoluzione completa della legge sulle vaccinazioni.\u201cPurtroppo, lo Stato ha diffuso informazioni ambigue che potranno confondere i genitori che stanno cercando di decidere se vaccinare i figli o no\u201d, ha dichiarato Roberto Burioni, prestigioso immunologo dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 Vita-Salute San Raffaele e oggetto di odio feroce da parte del movimento \u201cno-vax\u201d (una mamma ha scritto nella sua pagina Facebook che sperava che affogasse durante la sua vacanza al mare). \u201cLo Stato dovrebbe essere chiaro, e prendere chiaramente posizione a fianco della scienza\u201d, ha conclluso il professor Burioni.Il vaccino antimorbillo, che negli ultimi 50 anni ha contribuito a debellare completamente la malattia negli Stati Uniti, \u00e8 stato reso obbligatorio in Italia nel 1976. La copertura \u00e8 andata costantemente crescendo fino a superare il 90% nel 2003. Purtroppo, ha fatto rilevare Beatrice Lorenzin, l\u2019obbligo \u00e8 diventato meno rigoroso nel 1999 perch\u00e9 le autorit\u00e0 italiane hanno creduto, erroneamente, che la fiducia nella scienza e nei vaccini fosse ben radicata nella cultura nazionale. Invece, ha detto l\u2019ex ministro, si \u00e8 dimostrato vero il contrario.Lorenzin ha attribuito l\u2019ondata di sfiducia nei vaccini al fatto che alcune malattie fossero diventate cos\u00ec rare da non sembrare una minaccia reale, all\u2019effetto disastroso di un studio confutato e sconfessato da tempo apparso sulla rivista medica \u201cThe Lancet\u201d, nel quale si sosteneva una correlazione tra il vaccino trivalente e l\u2019autismo e a quello che l\u2019ex ministro ha chiamato \u201cil dottor Google\u201d. Nel 2015, la copertura era scesa intorno all\u201985%. I casi di morbillo, una malattia che pu\u00f2 causare cecit\u00e0, encefalite, polmonite e talvolta il decesso, sono andati aumentando.Anche il movimento \u201cno-vax\u201d \u00e8 andato crescendo. A Rimini, un fertile terreno di attivit\u00e0 no-vax nonch\u00e9 citt\u00e0 in cui un magistrato locale, nel 2012, pronunci\u00f2 una sentenza - poi annullata - che stabiliva l\u2019esistenza di una correlazione tra vaccini e autismo, i militanti anti-vaccini hanno fatto ricorso alla pubblicit\u00e0 aerea, con striscioni che recavano la scritta \u201cTutti a scuola. Libert\u00e0 di scelta\u201d.Il governatore leghista della Regione Veneto Luca Zaia si \u00e8 fatto promotore di un approccio \u201cpersonalizzato\u201d alla valutazione delle vaccinazioni; alcune famiglie hanno organizzato una \u201cscuola nei boschi\u201d isolata per i bambini non vaccinati, altri bambini hanno fatto lezione in abitazioni private.Beatrice Lorenzin ha affermato che se fosse ancora il ministro della salute, manderebbe la polizia a chiudere le scuole illegali. \u201cSono una bomba chimica\u201d, ha aggiunto.Mattia Marchi, uno dei portavoce del Coordinamento per il Veneto dell\u2019Associazione Corvelva, un gruppo che raccoglie organizzazioni no-vax e free-vax, ha affermato che i genitori diffidenti dei vaccini non avevano praticamente altra scelta che far vaccinare i figli. \u201cNessuno ha mai detto che i vaccini causano l\u2019autismo\u201d, ha dichiarato Marchi. \u201cMa se mille persone vedono un UFO, vogliamo dire a queste persone che sono matte o vogliamo trovare una soluzione?\u201d.La scorsa settimana Federico Aliberti, un artigiano di Livorno, \u00e8 venuto a Roma con il figlio di tre anni per protestare contro l\u2019obbligo di vaccinare qualsiasi bambino si volesse iscrivere al nido d\u2019infanzia, alla scuola materna e alla scuola elementare. Il sig. Aliberti, un elettore dei Cinque Stelle, si \u00e8 detto irritato dall\u2019\u201carroganza\u201d degli scienziati che hanno la presunzione di capire una cosa complessa come il sistema immunitario umano.Il feed della sua pagina Facebook, ha detto, era stato inondato da clip di politici Cinque Stelle che promettevano la libera scelta e da articoli e video sugli interessi dell\u2019industria farmaceutica nel campo dei vaccini e sui presunti collegamenti dei vaccini con i tumori e l\u2019autismo. Ha concluso che il governo gli aveva dato speranze ma poi, anche con il nuovo decreto, non veniva fatto altro che sferrare \u201cuna pugnalata alla schiena\u201d. In effetti, per anni, il Movimento 5 Stelle e, pi\u00f9 di recente, la Lega, gli avevano dato qualcosa in cui credere.Beppe Grillo, il cofondatore del Movimento 5 Stelle, ha presunto che esista un legame tra vaccini e autismo, suggerito che i vaccini indeboliscano il sistema immunitario dei bambini sani e asserito che l\u2019industria farmaceutica promuova le vaccinazioni per fare profitto. Vari membri del partito eletti al Parlamento Europeo hanno proposto l\u2019eliminazione di alcune vaccinazioni obbligatorie per determinate categorie di dipendenti pubblici e dichiarato di ritenere le vaccinazioni possibili cause di leucemie, tumori e autismo. In un\u2019altra circostanza, hanno espresso preoccupazioni per la possibile pericolosit\u00e0 dei metalli contenuti nei vaccini. Il sindaco pentastellato di Livorno ha definito \u201cintollerabile\u201d l\u2019obbligo vaccinale, mentre alcuni suoi colleghi pugliesi hanno esortato i cittadini a rivolgersi a medici convinti che un\u2019alimentazione ricca di noci fosse una misura profilattica pi\u00f9 efficace dei vaccini.Lo scorso febbraio Paola Taverna, una senatrice molto in vista nello schieramento pentastellato al Senato, ha evocato con appassionata nostalgia i tempi in cui \u201candavano in processione a casa del cugino\u201d per prendere tutte le malattie esantematiche possibili e togliersi il pensiero come alternativa preferibile ai Centri di Vaccinazione, dove \u201cfanno i marchi per le bestie\u201d. Comunque, questa settimana, la senatrice ha dichiarato che avrebbe fatto vaccinare i suoi figli.A luglio, un membro eletto al Consiglio Regionale del Lazio con i Cinque Stelle ha presentato la proposta di imporre una quarantena di 4-6 settimane agli scolari dopo la vaccinazione. Il promotore, Davide Barillari, ha anche insistito per l\u2019organizzazione di uno \u201cstage informativo\u201d in tema di \u201ccorrelazioni causali\u201d tra vaccini e patologie diretto ai genitori che si rivolgono ai centri vaccinali. \u201cLa politica viene prima della scienza\u201d, ha dichiarato.Davide Casaleggio, il potente figlio dell\u2019altro cofondatore del Movimento 5 Stelle, che secondo molti controlla la piattaforma web attraverso la quale il partito funziona, ha scritto nel suo blog che il Movimento \u201cprende completamene le distanze\u201d dalle affermazioni di Barillari.Lo contraddice per\u00f2 Marco Canestrari, ex dipendente della Casaleggio Associati uscito dall\u2019azienda e dal partito e coautore del libro Supernova, dedicato al funzionamento interno del M5S, affermando che la costellazione di siti di Casaleggio era solita dare spazio ad articoli \u201capertamente contrari ai vaccini\u201d. \u201cLo facevano per incrementare le visite e la pubblicit\u00e0 in tema di salute sui siti\u201d ha detto. \u201cC\u2019era un forte consenso intorno alla cosa, ma poi, quando il partito \u00e8 cresciuto e l\u2019argomento \u00e8 diventato scomodo, hanno preso le distanze\u201d.Durante la campagna elettorale, ogni qualvolta i candidati sollevavano questioni sui vaccini, i leader del partito badavano bene a rispondere sempre di non essere contrari ai vaccini. Hanno continuato a farlo anche dopo il decreto approvato gioved\u00ec. Matteo Salvini, leader della Lega anti-immigrazionista e partner di governo dei Cinque Stelle, sembrava chiaramente intenzionato a partecipare al fronte anti-vaccini mentre andava costruendo il suo movimento populista.A marzo 2013, Salvini non sembrava affatto darsi pena dei vaccini, quando scriveva su Twitter che sua figlia Mirta aveva fatto le prime vaccinazioni e commentava: \u201cRideva, la pi\u00f9 preoccupata \u00e8 stata la mamma\u201d. Due anni dopo, a ottobre 2015, quando era ancora ai margini della politica, \u00e8 sembrato voler saggiare la forza elettorale dell\u2019argomento. \u201cVaccinazioni obbligatorie, sanzioni ai medici che le sconsigliano. Che ne pensate?\u201d Altri due anni dopo, ad aprile 2017, chiedeva: \u201cil primo medico italiano che ha detto NO ai vaccini \u00e8 stato radiato. Che ne pensate?\u201dDi l\u00ec a poco ebbe la risposta e comunic\u00f2 via Twitter che, pur avendo vaccinato i suoi figli, pensava che fosse \u201cfolle\u201d imporre cos\u00ec tanti vaccini. Insist\u00e9 sul fatto che la scelta dovesse essere lasciata ai genitori e ai loro medici di fiducia. In tweet successivi dichiar\u00f2 di essere dalla parte dei genitori che protestavano davanti al Parlamento, che lui era sempre per la libert\u00e0 di scelta e che diffidava delle grandi multinazionali che promuovevano i vaccini.A settembre, ha unito due dei suoi argomenti preferiti chiedendo, a proposito delle centinaia di migliaia di migranti sbarcati in Italia: \u201cE LORO, CHI LI HA VACCINATI?\u201d Ha inoltre auspicato l\u2019introduzione di test preventivi prima della somministrazione dei vaccini, per garantire che non danneggino i bambini.\u201cTest di questo genere non esistono\u201d, ha detto Beatrice Lorenzin. \u201cQuesta \u00e8 disinformazione\u201d.Ha contribuito Emma Johanningsmeier.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Israeli Leader Claims Iran Has \u2018Secret Atomic Warehouse\u2019", "Date": "2018-09-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel told the United Nations on Thursday that his intelligence agents had discovered a \u201csecret atomic warehouse\u201d in downtown Tehran, escalating a growing confrontation with Iran and setting up a direct challenge to its government to open the facility to inspectors and prove it is not in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal.\u201cToday, I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said. \u201cA secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and material from Iran\u2019s secret nuclear weapons program.\u201dMr. Netanyahu did not describe what kind \u201cequipment and material\u201d was contained in the warehouse. Some types of equipment, especially if it was dismantled or could be put to a variety of industrial uses, may be permissible under the terms of the accord.Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman called the remarks \u201cfalse, meaningless and unnecessary,\u201d according to a Reuters translation of a Fars news agency report.Nonetheless, Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s assertion poses a delicate political challenge for the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, whose inspectors frequently visit Iran\u2019s declared nuclear facilities. The agency must now decide whether to demand access to the facility, based on the Israeli intelligence.If it does not do so, perhaps declaring that the evidence is too vague, it may strengthen Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s argument that the inspections have been far too lax, and focused only on known facilities. On the other hand, if the inspectors demand access to the warehouse, Iran may well resist, claiming that they are tools of Israel, Iran\u2019s chief adversary.During the speech Mr. Netanyahu held up a map showing what he said was the site of the facility, in the neighborhood of Turquzabad.\u201cLet me show you exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like,\u201d he said, before showing a Google street view of a building. \u201cAnother innocent-looking compound.\u201dHe also included the latitude and longitude of the building and challenged those watching at home to look it up on Google Earth.\u201cHow about inspections, right here, right now,\u201d he said as he pointed to a photo of the warehouse.Israel officials were disappointed when Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s disclosure in April of the atomic archive Israeli agents seized did not create the kind of headlines, or international outrage, they expected. That was in large part because the material was relatively old, most of it dating back 15 years or more.In July, his government invited three reporters, including one from The New York Times, to examine key documents from the trove. They largely confirmed what was already known: that before 2003 Iranian scientists appeared to be working on nuclear weapons, in a program code-named Project Amad. That was halted, and some of the work, on a much smaller scale, was moved under cover to other locations.The Israeli officials, during those meetings in Israel at which they released selected pages from the trove, never spoke of a second site.Iran maintains that the archive is a fraud, invented by the Israelis. Mr. Netanyahu argues it is evidence of a nuclear-program-in-waiting.On Thursday, he said, \u201cThe reason Iran didn\u2019t destroy its atomic archive and its atomic warehouse is because it hasn\u2019t abandoned its desire to create nuclear weapons.\u201d Then he issued a threat, intended to play on Iranian fears that their program is ridden with spies.\u201cI have a message for the tyrants of Tehran,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIsrael knows what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\u201cWhat Iran hides, Israel will find,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.Mr. Netanyahu pressed President Trump to exit the Iranian nuclear deal, which he did four months ago. The prime minister\u2019s position differed from that of many of his intelligence chiefs. They argued that the Iranians appeared to be complying with the deal\u2019s restrictions, at least for the time being, buying Israel some time before it has to confront the threat anew.The Israeli prime minister spent much of his speech in front of the General Assembly denouncing those who support the Iranian nuclear deal and providing what he called evidence that Tehran is still pursuing a nuclear weapons program despite the agreement.\u201cWhen I spoke here three years ago, Israel stood alone among the nations of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this hall,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran. We opposed it because it threatens our future, even our very survival.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The site\u2019s home page is full of standard curiosity-gap clickbait in a celebrity finance flavor, with headlines like \u201cBillionaire Michael Jordan Has Zero Influence On Which Players Wear His Shoes, And The Reason Why Is Kind Of Strange \u2026\u201d and \u201cHow Much Money Did Colonel Sanders Make Off Kentucky Fried Chicken? Not As Much As You\u2019d Guess!\u201d But CNW\u2019s core product is the collection of pages it maintains for celebrities (of varying degrees of celebrity) with authoritatively phrased estimates as to how much money they have.These pages include single paragraphs of biographical info, but they\u2019re rendered practically unreadable by formatting. What readers are after is a single number, at the top of the page in big type: $20 million (Chris Pine), $40 million (Chris Pratt), $90 million (Chris Hemsworth). If you want to know how rich (or not) a celebrity is, CNW has an answer. No one is vouching for the veracity of that answer \u2014 CNW\u2019s proprietors \u201cexpressly exclude liability for any such inaccuracies or errors to the fullest extent permitted by law,\u201d according to the terms of use \u2014 but it's an answer nonetheless.The \u201cbest possible ballpark\u201d is a low standard of accuracy for facts, but if you\u2019re the only one on the internet offering an answer to a question people are asking, you become the trusted authority. When slightly more respectable journalistic outlets repeat CNW numbers \u2014 and they often do \u2014 those figures get both murkier and more authoritative. \u201cBallparked\u201d net worth becomes \u201creported\u201d net worth becomes hard to dispute, as Ms. Nixon discovered.CNW is offering answers to questions that don\u2019t have hard and fast answers. Rich people don\u2019t know how much money they have, and \u201cnet worth\u201d includes appraisals on all sorts of nonliquid assets, from cars and houses to fractions of companies. Jeff Bezos doesn\u2019t have $150 billion in gold coins in a swimming-pool vault under the Space Needle. Most people know that, at least on some level. But that doesn\u2019t stop us from Googling, and it doesn\u2019t stop Google from sourcing snippet results from CNW. Prime placement of that information is not about its accuracy either. A Google spokesman said the featured snippets are meant to point users to the most relevant piece of content given their query\u00a0\u2014 and \u201crelevant\" is a very different criteria than \u201ccorrect.\u201dThe American media has printed guesses and lies about celebrities for as long as the two have existed; that\u2019s hardly Google or Amazon\u2019s fault.

Here are the tools that Emily Badger, a writer for The Upshot, uses to analyze the ripple effects. Q. As a writer for The Upshot, you do a lot of analysis, including on the effects and consequences of technology. What are the best websites and tech tools that you use regularly for that coverage?What have you found are some of the main unintended consequences of technology on how we live?For nearly every form of technology I use for work, or use for myself, I have mixed feelings. (These mixed feelings are also a good source of story ideas.) I love apps, like Redfin, that make public information about the housing market incredibly accessible. But I wonder if they also reinforce the unhealthy American expectation that we should all make money off our homes.Tech advances in transportation have major unintended consequences, too. We clearly see this in the fight in New York City over whether Uber and Lyft have made traffic worse. Studies in several cities suggest that they\u2019re putting cars on the road for trips people might otherwise have taken by foot or transit, or not at all. And they\u2019ve certainly made the curb more crowded. Now, all of a sudden, cities have to figure out how to manage that space where people hop in and out of cars \u2014 as if at a cab stand, but everywhere.My favorite transportation apps help me navigate public transit, telling me when the next bus is coming, for instance. That little piece of information can radically transform your sense of the quality of public transit. But people who don\u2019t have smartphones don\u2019t benefit from this. And that means that while I can run out of my house just when the bus is coming, someone else may wait on a corner for 20 minutes for the same bus. And now we\u2019re having very different experiences of the same public service. Mine is much better, because I have a smartphone.I use old-school docked bike share (which is funny to say, because these systems are less than 10 years old in the United States). But mostly I just use a regular old bike. I do wear a very souped-up bike helmet, a Christmas gift from my husband a couple of years ago. It has built-in lights controlled by a little panel attached to my handlebar, designed to allow me to signal that I\u2019m turning left or right \u2014 essentially, it lets me behave like a car, with taillights. I have mixed feelings about this, too. (So many mixed feelings!) I don\u2019t think I should have to behave like a car when I\u2019m on a bike, although I appreciate anyone who is trying to make cycling safer.You recently moved from San Francisco to Washington. What have you observed about how Washingtonians and San Franciscans use tech differently or the same?I have definitely seen fewer AirPods. And I have yet to see a driverless-car-in-training in Washington, something that was a near daily sight in San Francisco. As a source in San Francisco pointed out to me before I left: D.C. is a city full of people who would regulate this new technology \u2014 or hold think-tank symposiums on how to regulate it \u2014 but few here have seen it in action, let alone gone for a ride in a driverless car.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "California Lawmakers Pass Nation\u2019s Toughest Net Neutrality Law", "Date": "2018-08-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe California bill is viewed as even stronger and more consumer-friendly than the original measures carried out by the Obama administration and abolished in December by the Trump-era Federal Communications Commission. It is sure to set up a fight between broadband providers, which say strict rules would increase their costs, and consumer groups, which seek to ensure that all traffic on the internet is treated equally.If Gov. Jerry Brown signs the bill, California would become the fourth state to create a net neutrality law since the federal rollback, but it is considered the most significant. \u201cThis bill would set a tremendous precedent, with the power to shape the internet market not just in California but across the country for the betterment of consumers,\u201d Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, said in a statement.The F.C.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The bill was passed by the State Senate on Friday and the State Assembly on Thursday, both by large margins.\u201cWhen Donald Trump\u2019s F.C.C. decided to take a wrecking ball to net neutrality protections, we knew that California had to step in to ensure our residents have access to a free and open internet,\u201d State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat and one of the bill\u2019s authors, said in a statement.Lawmakers in California are seeking to bar internet service providers like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing down the transmission of web traffic to the state\u2019s broadband customers. The bill would also prohibit promotions of free streaming for apps, a practice that can stifle the businesses of other websites that don\u2019t have the resources to offer such promotions.The bill would ensure that consumers would not be charged extra for access to websites. Consumers would also be guaranteed that video streams from any site like Netflix, Vudu or Hulu would be delivered to a mobile device or an internet television at the same speeds and quality.The bill would become California\u2019s second major internet law passed in the last few months. In June, the state adopted an internet privacy law, the first in the nation. It gave California internet users the ability to know what information a company like Facebook or Google was collecting, and how it was being used and shared with third parties. The law also gave them the right to stop data collection.The law would face fierce resistance from telecommunications companies. Through their trade group, USTelecom, broadband providers lobbied against the bill, warning that the rules on their management of traffic would stifle innovation and hinder business models.Lawmakers said internet service providers had already indicated to them that they would sue to overturn a net neutrality law. \u201cWe will fight with everything we have to defend it,\u201d Mr. Wiener said in a news conference.Some legal experts say the F.C.C. did not have the authority to prohibit state net neutrality laws. In a separate court battle, a federal appeals court will decide if the commission\u2019s rollback was legal.Federal net neutrality rules have been challenged in lawsuits several times over the past decade and the issue could eventually wind up before the Supreme Court.\u201cThe internet must be governed by a single, uniform and consistent national policy framework, not state-by-state piecemeal approaches,\u201d Jonathan Spalter, president of USTelecom, said in a statement.Governor Brown, a Democrat, has not indicated his view on the bill, but it was widely supported by Democrats in the Legislature and by federal Democratic lawmakers from California like Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader. Mr. Brown has until the end of September to decide on the bill, and he is expected to be intensely lobbied by telecommunications companies and consumer groups. In 2017, telecommunications providers fought against a state broadband privacy bill, which the Legislature never passed.\u201cTelecommunications companies have tremendous power and sway in California, so we know the fight is not over,\u201d said Barbara van Schewick, a professor of law at Stanford University, who has been a strong proponent of net neutrality laws.The California bill is the most significant victory for supporters of net neutrality rules since the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, scrapped federal regulations last year. Net neutrality advocates view broadband providers as important utilitylike services like the phone, saying that without the rules, big players with deep pockets have an unfair advantage.Mr. Pai viewed the rules as burdensome. Telecom companies said they wanted to experiment with business models such as free streaming promotions over mobile phones with business partners. The broadband providers promised they would not block or intentionally slow down other websites in an anticompetitive manner.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Politicians Are Coming for Silicon Valley ", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome regulations are necessary, but others could hinder innovation and growth in what is arguably the United States\u2019 greatest industry.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. On Wednesday morning, the Senate Intelligence Committee will grill two prominent Silicon Valley leaders and a piece of furniture. Specifically: A chair. Presumably, wooden.The pair of executives will be Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer, and Jack Dorsey, the founder and chief executive of Twitter. They will be lightly pummeled about their responsibility for election meddling by foreign powers and the related use and abuse of fake news on their enormous communications platforms. The chair would have seated either Larry Page, the co-founder of Google and chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet, or Sundar Pichai, who now runs Google. But neither accepted the committee\u2019s invitation to appear. They offered up the company\u2019s top lawyer, Kent Walker, in their stead, which the senators did not like so much, and thus the empty seat. If this sounds like empty political theater (like the hearings that are going on right now over the latest Supreme Court nominee), it\u2019s not. Congress has let Silicon Valley off easy so far. If the tech companies want to avoid a raft of onerous regulation, they need to be even more forthright than they have been about what went wrong, and how they plan to fix it. Google has submitted written testimony, but the absence of its leaders, while the other two major internet platforms offer themselves up for a public smacking, is a mistake. It reveals a perfect contrast in how to deal with the increasing pressure that tech will face as Washington turns its angry eyes westward. And, oh yeah, did you know tech is also dangerously addictive and killing our global psyche, the digital equivalent of drinking a Big Gulp while lighting up a Juul?Washington is a toxic swamp for tech leaders to wade into. But they must \u2014 and carefully \u2014 lest they get eaten, drown or just end up very, very dirty. Mark Zuckerberg, Ms. Sandberg\u2019s boss, already endured 10 hours of interrogation by the Senate and the House commerce committees in April, from which he emerged relatively unscathed, thanks to the utter incompetence and lack of expertise of most of the politicians asking the questions. That is not the case with Richard Burr of North Carolina, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat. Unlike what has been served up so far by their counterparts in the House \u2014 I\u2019d like a dopey Devin Nunes platter, with a side order of inaccurate Trump tweets, please \u2014 their focus on the nefarious Russian influence on the American election has been laudable. And sources from all sides say that the pair have agreed to try to keep the focus on the important issues.This matters, because America needs a clear explanation of what its social media giants expect to become, before legislation forces all manner of regulations on them. Some of these will be decent, like forcing better privacy rules, but others could hinder innovation and growth in what is arguably the United States\u2019 greatest industry. \u201cIt\u2019s how democracies are done, having to justify yourself and your actions in public,\u201d an employee of one of these companies who asked to remain anonymous told me. \u201cAnd admitting you got things wrong.\u201dTruth. But it will be the drilling down \u2014 and not just the sound bites \u2014 that will be key. That includes requiring Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey to provide deep specifics on how well the platforms have cleaned up fake accounts; how transparent they have made the buying and selling of online political ads (and maybe all ads); and how much progress they have made in demoting and deleting fake news. Also critical is explaining how and why they let their platforms be so easily manipulated to begin with. This will perhaps require admitting that bad actors used them in exactly the way they were built to be used. The platforms, long focused on goosing audience and revenue, let that happen. Given all the political and media scrutiny, they now have plenty of incentives to crack down.They will also have to address crazier notions, like the obsession many politicians on the right now have with the idea that the platforms are biased against them, hiding or playing down conservative voices. After the Senate intelligence hearing in the morning, Mr. Dorsey alone will face questions later in the day from the House Energy and Commerce Committee on how Twitter manages its algorithm and moderates its content. While that will most likely produce more fireworks and plenty of dumb assertions, Mr. Dorsey will have to sit still and take it with equanimity. On other topics, tech leaders need to take what Washington throws at them more seriously because of the threat of legislation that is looming. Already, regulators in Europe and legislators in more aggressive states like California have taken tough actions on privacy, data and more, which could be a prelude to federal laws.Protecting tech platforms from abuse is only the first big challenge. These companies are going to have to manage increasingly complex issues, and this is going to require working with the government and accepting some level of regulation. How will they protect consumers from the \u201cinternet of things\u201d? Who will regulate autonomous vehicles? Should tech companies continue to get immunity from what is on their platforms? Should algorithms be transparent? What are the rules around artificial intelligence, automation, robotics, data portability \u2014 even embedded tech in people, like, say, a permanent mobile phone in your ear or screen in your eye?You get the idea. And, just to note, there is another congressional hearing set for October on antitrust issues and tech giants. That means it\u2019s going to be a very long and bumpy road for Silicon Valley leaders. They might want to strap themselves into those wooden chairs today and hold on tight. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Netherlands, a Tax Avoidance Center, Tries to Mend Its Ways", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE HAGUE \u2014 The Netherlands wants you to know that it is not a tax haven. But Menno Snel, the country\u2019s No. 2 finance official, grudgingly acknowledges that the Dutch have become experts at something else: aggressive tax planning.That\u2019s backed up by the amount of money pouring across its borders. For tax avoidance purposes, the Netherlands offers the status of a European country, while allowing big multinationals, like Google and Ikea, to move global profits through Dutch subsidiaries, drastically lowering their tax payments.The atrium of the Dutch Finance Ministry, where Mr. Snel works, is even adorned with full-grown potted palms that give it a whiff of a tropical tax haven. The suggestion of any parallel is probably unintentional.In any case, the Dutch position as a tax avoidance center could be about to change. In a major reversal, the Finance Ministry this week submitted proposals to Parliament that would shut down the benefits that made the Netherlands a magnet for international corporations \u2014 especially American ones, like Netflix, Nike and Uber. Debate on the measures is expected to continue through December.Under the proposals, the Netherlands plans to impose levies on profits being transferred to tax havens and to block companies from exploiting inconsistent national laws to take the same deduction twice. Whether those proposals will get past the array of accountants, lawyers and consultants who help foreign companies reduce their tax payments, and who have voiced opposition to the changes, is not yet clear.Mr. Snel, whose formal title is state secretary of finance, said in an interview, \u201cWe must be fair in recognizing that some companies are misusing the open tax system that the Netherlands has.\u201dAmid a popular backlash against what many see as multinationals gaming the system, tax change has been a hot political issue in the Netherlands this year. In addition, legislators must close loopholes to avoid breaching new European Union rules that take effect in 2019.Tax cuts in the United States also affect the appeal of the Dutch system. At the same time, new rules passed in Washington make it harder for companies to stash profits overseas.As a relatively affluent member of the eurozone, the Netherlands offers a reliable court system and lack of official corruption not always present in island tax havens. It also boasts a comprehensive network of tax treaties with almost every nation, and little or no tax on money passing through the country. It is easy to move money in, and easy to move it out.The Netherlands has been especially popular with American corporations. Google and IBM have big presences in the country, as do such service providers as the law firm Baker McKenzie and the accounting company Deloitte. Fiat Chrysler is technically a Dutch company. Nike has its European headquarters in Hilversum, just south of Amsterdam.The sports apparel maker used a common, legal method of shifting profits to a tax haven, according to the consortium\u2019s research. First, it allocated ownership of its \u201cswoosh\u201d trademark and other intellectual property to a subsidiary in Bermuda, which has no corporate income tax. Then, its subsidiary in Hilversum paid royalties for the use of the trademarks to the Bermuda unit. The royalties counted as business expenses and in that way avoided taxation in the Netherlands.\u201cNike fully complies with tax regulations, and we rigorously ensure our tax filings are fully aligned with how we run our business,\u201d the company said in a statement to The Times.At least until recently, the Dutch Finance Ministry was a willing enabler for such arrangements. Corporate accountants and lawyers could call at the ministry for preapproval of their strategies. The Netherlands long justified its laws by arguing that they encouraged multinational companies to establish their headquarters in the country, creating jobs and investment.More recently, however, legal thinking and public opinion have turned.In national elections last year, almost all the major political parties promised change. And the public anger has provided political impetus for the government.Mr. Snel, a member of the Democrats 66 party, a socially liberal partner in the governing coalition, is credited by many activists for pursuing the task with more zeal than his predecessors.\u201cMenno Snel is being more proactive and more constructive in addressing tax avoidance,\u201d said Francis Weyzig, a tax policy expert in The Hague for the charity Oxfam, which argues that island havens steal revenue from developing countries. \u201cDefinitely, there has been a change.\u201dFor example, Mr. Snel has proposed measures to prevent companies from exploiting inconsistencies in national rules that allow profits to fall through the cracks, avoiding taxation.Other provisions he has proposed oblige lawyers and accountants to disclose information about questionable arrangements. The Netherlands will also limit the size of deductions that companies take for interest payments, a measure aimed at another popular method for shifting profits to tax havens. In that arrangement, firms take out loans in low-tax countries but allocate the interest to the Netherlands, where it is deductible as an operating expense.But tax is a big business for the Netherlands, leaving open the possibility that vigorous objections from multinationals could weaken efforts to retool the system.\u201cThe Netherlands is not serious about ending its tax haven status,\u201d said Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament who is the Green Party\u2019s spokesman on tax policy. He noted that the Netherlands had resisted attempts to prevent European countries from competing to have the lowest corporate rate.\u201cCompanies that want to come to the Netherlands and set up a genuine business \u2014 the question is whether you would scare them off by being too strict,\u201d said Bartjan Zoetmulder, a tax partner at Loyens & Loeff, a big Dutch law firm.So far, there are no signs of mass unemployment among the thousands of Dutch lawyers, accountants and notaries who specialize in working with foreign corporations. Many young people still regard tax advising as a lucrative career with a future, a sign they do not expect the changes to undercut the appeal of the Netherlands.Enrollment in courses for budding tax consultants \u201chas never been so high,\u201d said Jan van de Streek, a professor at the University of Amsterdam who teaches tax policy, with a hint of chagrin.And lately there has been public outrage over an exemption for shareholder dividends that is seen as benefiting Shell and Unilever, two of the Netherlands\u2019 biggest corporations, at the expense of ordinary citizens.Mr. Snel said that Dutch officials would continue to consult with businesses, but would apply stricter standards that were either in place or would go into force in coming years. And the secrecy is over. The Netherlands has already begun sharing information with other countries.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be seen as tax evaders,\u201d Mr. Snel said. \u201cWe pay our taxes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Worry Worry Man United", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn SoccerMANCHESTER, England \u2014 It was past midnight when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and his coaching staff finally left the Old Trafford changing room, with their impromptu conclave at an end.They had spent a couple of hours in there, mulling over the penalty shootout defeat to Derby County on Tuesday night that had ended Manchester United\u2019s (admittedly mild) interest in this year\u2019s Carabao Cup.For the most part, though, they had churned through ideas for how to approach Saturday\u2019s Premier League game at West Ham United, searching for a tactical tweak, a selection decision, that might get their team back into gear, that might head off the encroaching shadow of looming crisis \u2014 never too far away at Old Trafford, these days \u2014 at the pass.By the time Tuesday had become Wednesday, though, no answer had been found, no solution discovered, so Mourinho and his inner circle called it a night. There was no epiphany, no burst of clarity, no white smoke. Manchester United and its manager would remain shrouded in uncertainty for another day.His team may be flawed, but he is hardly working with flotsam: Only a handful of managers in the world would not gladly swap their squad for Mourinho\u2019s collection of World Cup-winners and league champions and $100 million strikers.Manchester United may well win at West Ham, beat Valencia in the Champions League next week, and then defeat Newcastle United \u2014 Old Trafford\u2019s next visitor \u2014 for good measure. Mourinho, as he has done before, would take great pleasure in once again proving the \u201cfootball geniuses\u201d in the news media to be the know-nothings he (probably correctly) believes them \u2014 us \u2014 to be.Mourinho, though, is no fool. He knows that the sense of drift at Old Trafford is not an invention of newspapers desperate to drive up sales. He does not sincerely believe that all the reports of dissatisfaction among his players are mere clickbait by websites hungry for advertising revenues, or that some social media algorithm has decided that he does not play sufficiently attractive soccer.He knows that pretending he believes all of those things is helpful; that the news media provides a convenient, and at times entirely obliging, scapegoat; that it is 2018, and assailing the evils of fake news and failing newspapers and partisan talking heads is very much the zeitgeist, and that among his fans he will find some who are willing to believe what they want to be true.But he and his staff did not stay late on Tuesday night because of some hysterical reporting in the morning newspapers, or because of the iniquities of Google, or because Twitter was in a furor. They stayed because Mourinho knows that something is wrong, and because if he is to fix it, he has first to find out what it is.It has been like this for some time: for much of this young season, certainly; for most of preseason, too; on and off throughout his time at Old Trafford, in fact. Manchester United has become the sort of club it never used to be: one of those teams that always seems to be skirting the fringes of meltdown, one of those places where it never takes much to send it over the edge.That might be a couple of poor results; the defeats to Brighton and Tottenham, for example, that brought the glare of scrutiny just a month ago. It could be some injudicious comments from a player: most often, at this point, from Paul Pogba, who has obliquely referred to problems with his manager in public more than once, and has privately disclosed that he wishes to leave. It could be a hint of discord between the manager and the chief executive over transfer budgets.Or, as was the case on Tuesday, it could be something as insignificant as a poor Wi-Fi connection. Pogba had watched the Derby game from a private box. During the first half, he tried to upload a video to one of his social media accounts. The connection was poor, and it was not posted online until after the game had finished, and United had been beaten. Unaware of the technical difficulties, Mourinho took that timing \u2014 understandably \u2014 as Pogba making light of the team\u2019s defeat, and the two exchanged words in training, captured by a television camera. Pogba apologized, explained, and Mourinho quickly moved on, but the damage, at least to the watching public, was done.Mourinho\u2019s public stance has always been that a hyperbolic news media is to blame for this culture, where one defeat is a disaster, where a humdrum misunderstanding is a diplomatic incident. That there is an element of hypocrisy to that claim \u2014 Mourinho, more than most managers, is a media creature \u2014 should not detract from its inherent accuracy.Yet he has been around for long enough to know that the existence of the cycle itself is noteworthy, a consequence, rather than a cause, of the condition. There are breakdowns in communication and tense relationships and poor days at Manchester City, too, and yet the same gloom never seems to descend.Mourinho\u2019s logic has always been that it is rooted in either a bias against him or his club from \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 the news media, or because soccer has no greater unit-shifter than Manchester United. But Old Trafford was not always a bed of roses under Alex Ferguson, United was no less popular and the media no less hungry. The consequences are different because the circumstances are. Put simply, a lot of problems go away when you are winning.Mourinho has tried everything to inspire his team to do that on a more reliable basis. He has tried pretty much everything in his arsenal, in fact: he has protected his players in public, to shield them, and criticized them, too, to ignite a spark. He has changed his team, and his system. He has reminded the world of his record: a kind interpretation would see that as an act of reassurance to an uncertain squad; a less generous one might have it as getting his rebuttal in first.He has, at times, managed to inspire a brief recovery, but as yet there has been nothing permanent. It is hard not to feel that is because he is trying to find the solution, when his first concern is fully to understand the problem.Quite what that might be remains a matter of debate. Some might suggest that Mourinho\u2019s cautious style is not in keeping with either Manchester United\u2019s traditions, or the talents of his squad, or the modern Premier League. Others have indicated that he perhaps does not know how to get the best out of a younger generation of players who do not share his martial values. Perhaps he is missing his trusted lieutenant, Rui Faria, who left this summer. Maybe the club let him down by failing to invest even more millions in the squad.There is no sense of mutiny among the players. Pogba is not alone in believing that United\u2019s style has become a little too staid, a little too predictable, that Old Trafford no longer holds the dread it once did and that Mourinho must adapt accordingly, but there is no widespread dissatisfaction with his methods.Likewise, there is no appetite for a change of manager among the hierarchy. Speaking to the club\u2019s investors this week, Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, made it plain that everyone at Old Trafford was committed to adding to the club\u2019s, and to Mourinho\u2019s, haul of trophies. Mourinho was appointed because he has always won, wherever he has worked. That faith has not yet evaporated.Nobody, though, is under any illusion that his job is growing ever harder. United is already eight points behind Liverpool, and six behind Manchester City and Chelsea. Given that City dropped only 14 points over the whole of last season, there is now little margin for error.United is chasing its own tail, struggling out of crisis and then lurching back again, drifting and circling at a time when its rivals are striding forward, the gap growing slowly, inexorably larger. Mourinho has to find an answer or \u2014 sooner or later \u2014 it will swallow him whole.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Says Google Is Rigged, Despite Its Denials. What Do We Know About How It Works?", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOnline search and Google are synonymous. About 90 percent of all searches on the web run through Google, giving the company an enormous role in directing the worldwide flow of information on the internet.As the web has grown in size and complexity, the importance of Google Search has grown. A minor tweak to its algorithm can redirect huge amounts of web traffic. Still, not many people have a good understanding of how Google delivers search results. And for good reason \u2014 Google tries to keep it a secret.Here, we\u2019ll explain how it works, and why search experts say there is little evidence behind the president\u2019s claims.Let\u2019s say you want to do a search for \u201chealth benefits of kale.\u201d When you start typing, Google\u2019s computer systems begin sifting through its index of hundreds of billions of web pages that use that exact wording or a related phrase. (Google estimates that there are more than 53 million pages that match \u201chealth benefits of kale.\u201d)Then, Google puts those pages in order, using a secret algorithm.There are hundreds of factors weighed by Google\u2019s algorithm. While Google keeps most details of its search formula under wraps, it has revealed some specifics of how it works.One of the major breakthroughs with Google\u2019s search engine was a formula called PageRank, named after Larry Page, one of Google\u2019s founders and now the chief executive of its parent company, Alphabet. PageRank works on the basic premise that a page\u2019s value can be determined by how many sites link to it. In the early days of web search, this was a novel concept, and it helped to propel Google past competitors like Yahoo and AltaVista.The search engine has gotten more sophisticated over the years. (It was founded 20 years ago on Tuesday.) In addition to PageRank, the company has also said that the software looks at how often and where the keywords being searched for show up on a specific page, how recently the page was created (a sign of the freshness of the information) and the location of the person making the search.Google said there were no major differences between how it retrieved news stories and other search results, although some factors, such as when the page was created, take on greater importance in news searches.Google says that revealing its formula would make it easier for people who try to game search results. There is already a cottage industry of people who specialize in search engine optimization, or S.E.O., and help companies gain greater visibility for their pages. With greater insight, the thinking goes, spam sites and advertisers could displace the most relevant pages from the top of search results.But of course, Google has another reason for keeping its search engine formula secret: It\u2019s proprietary. For the most part, Google has established its dominance in search because it did a better job of revealing the best answers to a given query. Google wants to keep its search algorithm from competitors, just as Coca-Cola doesn\u2019t reveal its recipe.Google said political ideology was not a factor in any aspect of its search results. Google said that whether a user is conservative or liberal is not part of the information collected by the company, and that it didn\u2019t categorize web pages by political leanings.It relies on an army of human \u201craters\u201d to inform the quality of search results. Google has 10,000 raters spread around the world. They rate the quality of search results to determine whether the pages ranked first deliver expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness.Not quite. When Google search was created, the search results were bare-bones \u2014 a list of 10 blue links. The main objective at the time was to deliver relevant results to get people out of Google as quickly as possible. That has changed significantly over the years. Instead of simply providing links, Google is packing more information onto its web pages \u2014 deepening the tension between publishers and other services, like the review site Yelp, that rely on Google to direct traffic to their sites. Google has argued that users go to Google for more than just links \u2014 they go for information.There is also the problem of hidden bias. These are issues not about deliberate bias against one political ideology like Mr. Trump raised, but about how algorithms or artificial intelligence will unintentionally amplify societal biases about groups like women and racial minorities.Google has said that it is aware that these types of biases may creep into search results, but that it remains vigilant in trying to stamp out those problems. Now, when starting a search with \u201cDonald Trump is,\u201d the top three Autocomplete suggestions are \u201ca democrat,\u201d \u201ca great president\u201d and \u201cmy president.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leaked Google Video After Trump\u2019s Win Adds to Pressure From Conservatives", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A video posted to the right-wing media site Breitbart on Wednesday showed Google executives bemoaning the election of President Trump at a company meeting in 2016.The hourlong video of a companywide meeting in November 2016 shows a parade of senior executives from Google and its parent company, Alphabet, expressing dismay about the election. Google often holds all-hands gatherings it calls T.G.I.F. meetings. They are usually streamed over the internet to company offices all over the world.Among the people who spoke were Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, and Ruth Porat, Alphabet\u2019s chief financial officer. Both appeared to become emotional, choking up while speaking. Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder, said that he was \u201cdeeply offended\u201d by the election of Mr. Trump and that his victory was in conflict with many of the company\u2019s values. Mr. Brin, who immigrated from the Soviet Union as a child, said, \u201cAs an immigrant and refugee, I certainly find the selection deeply offensive.\u201dAlso, Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s head of people operations, said some conservative employees had told her that they were uncomfortable with being open about their political views. She encouraged employees to be tolerant of other views.\u201cWe value perspectives from all sides of the political spectrum,\u201d she said.In a statement, Riva Sciuto, a Google spokeswoman, said that at the regularly scheduled session, some Google employees \u201cexpressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season.\u201d She added that \u201cnothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.\u201dRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, tweeted that Google needed to be questioned in front of Congress about the email and potential plans for a censored search engine for China. Other conservatives seized on the video as evidence of Google\u2019s bias and echoed Mr. McCarthy\u2019s sentiments.Google has also added to the political pressure. The company offered to send Kent Walker, its senior vice president of global policy, to last week\u2019s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. The committee balked and said Google, like Facebook and Twitter, should send a top executive like Mr. Pichai or Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder and the chief executive of Alphabet.His dismissal became a rallying point for conservatives who saw Silicon Valley companies as dominated by liberal political and social views. Mr. Damore is suing Google for workplace discrimination, claiming that Google is biased against white men with conservative views.The company also upset conservatives when thousands of Google employees protested the company\u2019s work on developing artificial intelligence for the Pentagon. Google responded to the dissent by agreeing to not renew a contract with the Pentagon when it expired.Advertisement"}
