{"Headline": "New iPhones Are Coming. Here\u2019s How to Save on an Upgrade.", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt\u2019s the time of year when smartphone makers introduce their newest wares to tempt you to spend your hard-earned dollars on the latest, priciest devices.And this Wednesday, Apple is set to introduce three new iPhones, including some models with bigger screens and higher starting prices.According to a person briefed on Apple\u2019s new products, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential, the changes will include:\u2022 A new entry-level phone to replace the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, with a larger display, at 6.1 inches.\u2022 The introduction of a big-screen premium phone with a 6.5-inch display, Apple\u2019s biggest ever.In what has become an ever-clearer trend, the prices of some of these new iPhones are also expected to go up. The new entry-level iPhone may start at $749, with the 5.8-inch iPhone X coming in at $949 and $1,049 for the giant 6.5-inch-screen model, analysts estimated. In contrast, just a few years ago Apple\u2019s iPhones started at $649 for the smaller model and $749 for the larger one.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the prices of the new phones.The increasing number of higher-priced, bigger-screen smartphones has become a well-worn strategy by the phone makers. Given that many people around the world \u2014 especially in developed countries \u2014 already own a phone and upgrade at a slower pace than they used to, phone vendors industrywide are focused on wringing more dollars out of each device by having them get larger and more expensive.So where does that leave us? If you want to upgrade to some of the latest devices without breaking the bank, I have a few tips on how to achieve that.The easiest way to save some money on your next phone is to trade in your current cellphone. In the last few years, wireless carriers and retailers have expanded their trade-in programs to be seamless and more inclusive.Here\u2019s an overview of how some of them work.After trading in your phone, you can use the credit in a couple of ways.Let\u2019s say, for example, you are trading in an iPhone 7 to Verizon Wireless. The Verizon webpage offers $185 in credit for that phone, and you accept it.Now let\u2019s imagine that the next new iPhone costs $1,049. If you buy the device outright from Verizon, you could shave $185 off the $1,049, bringing the total to $864.Or you could opt to pay for the new iPhone with an installment plan and spread the cost of the phone into monthly payments. If Verizon hypothetically requires a $300 down payment for the new iPhone, your $185 in credit would reduce the amount you pay up front to $115. From there, you\u2019d pay $31.20 a month for 24 months to cover the remaining $749.You could sell your old device directly to another consumer for a chance to get more cash than through a trade-in program. This is similar to how selling a used car in a private sale usually yields more money than trading it in at a dealership.But there are trade-offs: Some buyers can be a nuisance and bombard you with lots of questions or take a long time to send payment.You could also ask your friends and family whether they want to buy your used phone. Just don\u2019t offer it to the hagglers among them.Taking care of your gadgets takes time. But with the rising costs of phones, the benefits are greater now that you will save even more by sticking with the tried and true.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "Thirty years ago, British youth culture was transformed by acid house music and the drug Ecstasy \u2014 with, surprisingly, a little help from a group of flier designers.Supported byCulture reporter\u201cThey used to clear all the equipment away and put a sound system and a D.J. in the corner,\u201d Mr. Georgiou said. \u201cIt was extremely loud, very crowded, this awful strawberry smoke everywhere, strobe lights going off all the time.\u201d13 PhotosAs Mr. Georgiou put it: \u201cIt was like our punk. It completely changed how people acted. You suddenly had football hooligans filling up clubs all loved up, hugging each other.\u201d You also saw celebrities dancing alongside teenagers from working-class neighborhoods, bankers alongside students, he said, and no one cared.The events would also claim to be invitation-only private parties, which gave Mr. Anthony an argument to give to the police when they inevitably turned up and tried to shut down the events.One club did try to up the game in flier design: Mr. Oakenfold\u2019s Spectrum night, held on Mondays and finishing at 3:30 a.m. Many of the over 1,200 people who attended each week went straight to after-parties and then in to work, Mr. Oakenfold said.Mr. Little started doing sleeves for a friend\u2019s record label, which led to the work on fliers. The Spectrum job did not pay well, he said \u2014 \u201cI think about \u00a3100 and free entry to the club for life\u201d \u2014 but he put a lot of effort into its fliers. He was told that the design had to feature an all-seeing eye, and he tried to give the flier a direct link to \u201960s psychedelia, filling it with coded references to the Grateful Dead\u2019s artwork. \u201cMaybe three out of the 10,000 people made the reference,\u201d Mr. Little said. But everyone who picked up one kept it, he said. \u201cNo one threw it in the street.\u201dBy 1989, the music was no longer confined to clubs. Instead, tens of thousands of people would go to raves in fields, their locations announced at the last minute via a telephone line to prevent the police from stopping them. (Eventually, law enforcement and the government would largely halt such events, especially after lurid tabloid coverage around several drug-related deaths).Alex Lazar, 58, has a shoe box full of fliers from his early days of clubbing. \u201cI sold my \u201988, \u201989 and \u201990 ones following a motorcycle accident a few years ago,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cI paid my rent for four months doing that.\u201d\u201cI always knew they\u2019d be collectible,\u201d Mr. Lazar added. \u201cI was 29 then, and I knew about the first Summer of Love, with all the beatniks going out to the fields. And it was like that. It was such a movement.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve watched my two children being born,\u201d he said. But taking Ecstasy and dancing to this new music in a rave for the first time topped even those memorable experiences: \u201cIt obviously beats that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "PayPal Cuts Off Alex Jones\u2019s Infowars, Joining Other Tech Giants", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 PayPal has become the latest tech giant to cut off Infowars, the conspiracy website run by the right-wing provocateur Alex Jones.Infowars was informed by PayPal on Thursday night that it would have 10 business days to find a new payment processor.PayPal handles all transactions, including credit cards, for the Infowars online store. The store has been a significant source of revenue for the company, selling vitamins and nutritional supplements, as well as Infowars-branded apparel. PayPal has also handled donations that Infowars receives from its supporters.PayPal said it had made its decision not because of any policy violation but because Infowars\u2019 \u201cpromotion of hate and discrimination runs counter to our core value of inclusion.\u201d\u201cOur values are the foundation for the decision we made this week,\u201d PayPal added.The aggressive steps against Infowars have become fodder for claims that Silicon Valley companies are biased against conservative voices \u2014 an opinion expressed by President Trump and a number of Republican officials. Jeff Sessions, the United States attorney general, plans to meet with Republican state attorneys general next week to discuss the tech industry, competition and free speech.After the phaseout period of 10 business days, PayPal will stop doing any business with Infowars and its subsidiaries, like the site Prison Planet, a PayPal spokesman said.The spokesman declined to cite any specific problems that had led to the decision, but said that after \u201cextensive reviews\u201d the company had \u201cfound many instances of content that promoted hate and discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions.\u201dThis is not the first time that PayPal has waded into politically fraught territory. In 2010, the company cut off payments to WikiLeaks. More recently, PayPal stopped working with neo-Nazi and alt-right websites.Since being barred from Facebook and Twitter, Infowars has had to find new online platforms, and its audience has fallen off significantly. But PayPal\u2019s decision may be particularly damaging, because it will be much harder for Infowars to find another company to handle transactions for the site.For now, Infowars is still able to sell at least some of its goods on Amazon and eBay, where its payments are not handled by PayPal.An article on the Infowars site that announced PayPal\u2019s decision said the move was a \u201cpolitical ploy designed to financially sabotage an influential media outlet just weeks before the midterm elections.\u201dThe article said PayPal had told Infowars that the decision was made because Infowars had violated its \u201cacceptable use policy.\u201d PayPal\u2019s spokesman said its decision went beyond the violation of any single policy.Infowars did not respond to an email requesting comment.videoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Should I Do With Old Racist Memorabilia?", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistWhile renovating our home 30 years ago, we found an album of old postcards lodged in a rafter. Many were from the turn of the century, addressed to members of a family that settled in our community. A brief search at the time did not turn up any descendants.The album was disintegrating, and we removed the cards. Over the years I forgot about them, but in getting ready to move, I came across them again. One in particular is offensive in its captioning and art to people of African descent. While I presume there is a market for this type of memorabilia, there is no way I would seek to profit from it. I offered it to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. I never heard from them, so it moved with us.My husband thinks I should throw it away, but that feels wrong. I feel it is history that we should acknowledge, however painful and wrong. Your thoughts?Name WithheldThe day shall come when all your guiltShall rob your soul of rest,And you will hate the Mongrel childThat pulls upon your breast.Reader, I am that Mongrel child. The poet, who had a particular horror of miscegenation, was writing about my parents\u2019 wedding (and yes, he rhymed \u201cPeggy Cripps\u201d with \u201cNegroe\u2019s lips\u201d). Back in the early 1950s, the National Citizens Protective Association was selling the poem at a very reasonable price: 50 for a dollar. I paid $200.The document \u2014 at once repugnant and strangely hilarious \u2014 is a worthy addition to the scrapbook my mother kept of the wildly various responses to her much-written-about wedding. Why should we want it to disappear from the historical record?It\u2019s a familiar thought that we need to understand our past, not least in order to help us avoid repeating the worst aspects of it. So your impulse to offer this souvenir card to a museum seems right. Of course, the sort of document you describe is well represented in collections already, and this may be why you didn\u2019t hear back. But who knows whether there isn\u2019t something about it that a historian might find useful in unpacking some detail of the history of American racial attitudes?So if you think this card does have historical value, and you can\u2019t readily find an interested archive or scholar, you could just put it up for sale on eBay, say, where it will join a large assemblage of racist artifacts. You can\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll approve of the motives of the buyer, but someone who is willing to pay for it is most likely to preserve it.Given that your motives are honorable, I don\u2019t share your worry about profiting from the sale. Selling an image isn\u2019t endorsing its message. And my guess is that most contemporary collectors of such items aren\u2019t motivated by racism. Still, if you want to avoid profiting, there\u2019s an easy solution. Just send the proceeds to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. That\u2019s an offer they won\u2019t turn down.While in the process of downsizing, I came upon a notorious piece of history. My son, who died in his teens in 1991, was given a World War II artifact by his great-uncle. It was a German Nazi armband he took from a deceased soldier. I was recently laid off from work and have been dealing with financial difficulties. Do I seek to gain some monetary value from this thing or, given our current political situation, should I just burn it?Name WithheldA few years ago, I was asked by the cemetery commission in my hometown if I would contribute to a commemorative plaque for my great-grandfather\u2019s grave, honoring his service as a soldier in the Confederate Army. I wrote a check, reasoning thus: My great-grandfather would have been in his mid-20s when he joined the Confederate Army in Texas. He had emigrated from Germany at age 12 and worked as a saddler, work that he continued to do as a soldier. As I understand it, he didn\u2019t see combat, never owned slaves and likely had little understanding of or stake in the war.Though I never heard him spoken of when I was growing up, I still felt sympathy for a person whose life was touched by the grisly Civil War. For me, the emblem on his grave merely commemorated a truth about his life, one over which he had had no control. I feel sure that he had none of the clarity that we have today about the dreadful events of his day.But I am an elderly white socialist with a black grandson, and I now feel that I made a mistake in contributing to a Confederate memorial.

{"Headline": "Jack Ma\u2019s American Dream Runs Up Against China First", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsJack Ma\u2019s American dream has woken up to a bitter reality. Alibaba\u2019s retiring founder rescinded a promise to create 1 million jobs in the United States. He blamed tariff tensions between the United States and China, but his $420 billion company has not given foreigners a level playing field on his international e-commerce site. Like any exporter, Mr. Ma\u2019s public championing of free trade blends enlightenment with self-interest.Alibaba.com was originally built to connect small Chinese wholesale manufacturers to overseas buyers. As domestic consumption boomed, however, the export operation was eclipsed by Taobao, Alibaba\u2019s eBay-like marketplace, and the complementary Tmall, which hosts stores for bigger retailers. When Mr. Ma met Donald Trump in January 2017 before his inauguration, the Alibaba chairman vowed that 1 million small American businesses would gain access over five years and lead to a similar number of jobs, helping rebalance trade in the process.Most of those smaller merchants would have set up shop on Tmall Global. Theoretically, this subsite provides an easier channel to sell directly to Chinese customers, without the hassle and expense of creating an onshore entity, as required by Tmall. It attracted Costco, Gerber and most recently U.S. grocery chain Kroger, which began peddling a modest line of vitamins and nuts in August.The portal hosts around 18,000 vendors, so 1 million more would have been impressive. Since shopkeepers pay for the privilege of a storefront, Alibaba\u2019s fees were more likely to rise than sales or jobs.The company does not break out specific sales figures for Tmall Global, describing it as a \u201ctesting ground.\u201d While Tmall.com is the fourth most-visited website in China, Tmall.hk, the domain for Tmall Global, ranks 357th, according to Alexa data. In essence, it\u2019s a smaller shopping center located far from where the Chinese action is. Why isn\u2019t exactly clear, but domestic vendors on Taobao might not be so receptive to foreign competition.Even the mainstream Tmall has lost some foreign interest of late. Some Western companies have complained about the cost, others of the grey marketeers reselling their brands \u2014 or counterfeits \u2014 next door at Taobao.Alibaba has gotten better at helping Chinese merchants sell overseas. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that per se, but it\u2019s hardly a solution to imbalanced trade.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Movie Stars Have Heroines, Too", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bythe new seasonWe asked actresses, directors and writers with this fall\u2019s films to tell us about the forerunners they admire. Tilda Swinton, Rashida Jones, Michelle Rodriguez and others explain in their own words.It\u2019s the rare fall film season that features as potent a lineup of female-driven movies as this one \u2014 a convergence, perhaps, of fortuitous timing and the industry\u2019s focus in the last year on women\u2019s rights in initiatives like Time\u2019s Up. But for every woman hitting her mark in front of the camera or running things behind the scenes, there are countless others whose stars haven\u2019t been allowed to shine quite as brightly as they might have, for reasons that are often inexplicable.Here, in their own words, women involved in this season\u2019s films praise the female colleagues they most admire \u2014 past or present, relatively unknown or famous in their own right.Offscreen, she also stood for what was right, which meant fighting for civil rights, not performing to segregated crowds on a U.S.O. tour, not a particularly popular move at the time.From the Cotton Club to her legacy at MGM, I think she is far underappreciated as a performer and part of entertainment history. And there is something distinctly feminine about her work. I\u2019m not sure what that means exactly, except that it\u2019s new. Women are very adept at fitting themselves into and relating to a male narrative, a male lead character. We\u2019ve had to; we would have been starved for art that we could relate to otherwise. Sarah\u2019s films don\u2019t make me do that. So I feel thrilled, challenged and easy all at once when I watch Sarah Polley\u2019s work as a director. Sarah Polley has an extraordinary r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Her acting work is second to none. The director Isabel Coixet\u2019s 2003 film, \u201cMy Life Without Me,\u201d is one of my favorite films and performances. I could watch Sarah\u2019s acting work all day but it\u2019s her work as a director that I would like to see more of. Her 2007 debut feature, \u201cAway From Her,\u201d was extraordinary and earned her an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay. I loved her 2012 follow-up film, \u201cTake This Waltz,\u201d a uniquely female portrayal of a relationship. In her acting, directing and writing, she has a very personal voice and one I would like to hear much more of. Fredi Washington, known by most for her role in the original 1934 classic \u201cImitation of Life,\u201d is a woman whose talent, courage and conviction I truly admire. Her passion and activism helped forge the way for all black Hollywood, including Josephine Baker, Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne and me. Thank you, Fredi Washington. You are phenomenal.I don\u2019t know why more people don\u2019t know Lynn Shelton\u2019s movies. They\u2019re really good. She tries many different genres and she writes about many different things, which really impresses me because I sometimes think I have no imagination and can\u2019t write about anything except my own life. And she does the opposite, to great effect. One minute, in \u201cYour Sister\u2019s Sister,\u201d she\u2019s writing about a sister who\u2019s sleeping with the boyfriend of her sister, and the next, in \u201cOutside In,\u201d it\u2019s about a guy who gets out of prison and is in love with his former high school teacher, which I think is kind of brilliant.There\u2019s an independent movie ghetto that sometimes we find ourselves in. Most people don\u2019t know who I am either. I think a woman making independent films does get put in a drawer. I\u2019m not complaining. I like my drawer.The former action queen Marrie Lee was my stepmom for almost a year when I was a little kid in Singapore, but I knew her as \u201cAuntie Doris,\u201d the bespectacled goofball who told the best ghost stories. Before her time with my turbulent father, and unbeknown to me then, Marrie had, at age 18, played the title role of the kung fu-fighting Interpol agent in \u201cThey Call Her Cleopatra Wong\u201d (1978), an exuberant low-budget actioner by Bobby Suarez. This film and its spinoffs shot her to cult stardom in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East (lobby cards in many languages can still be found on eBay) \u2014 and it also captured the imagination of one future American auteur: Quentin Tarantino has said Uma Thurman\u2019s character in \u201cKill Bill\u201d was partly inspired by Marrie\u2019s Cleo.Dissatisfied with working conditions in the Philippines, Marrie left Suarez\u2019s Manila studio and returned to Singapore in 1979 before they could make the proposed star vehicles \u201cSuper Woman\u201d and \u201cQueen Cobra.\u201d This predated the Hong Kong action movie boom of the early \u201980s that birthed a generation of action stars, including Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh. In a business that\u2019s mostly about timing, Marrie had simply hit a bit too early.When my father met Marrie, she\u2019d already retired, at 21, from the movies and was managing a dance troupe called the Devil\u2019s Angels that toured hotel bars in feathers and sequins. In the late \u201990s, I helped organize a revival screening of \u201cCleopatra Wong\u201d (largely forgotten by then), and Marrie got her second wind. Invitations to festivals in Europe and Australia followed, but more important, her sense of her own creative destiny changed. She now wanted to make her own movies. In the past decade, working with a largely volunteer crew in Singapore, Marrie has written, directed and produced two movies and is now, having just recovered from a stroke, working to make a third!In 1984 I saw Laurie Metcalf do the Steppenwolf production of Lanford Wilson\u2019s \u201cBalm in Gilead\u201d in New York. She had a monologue that was showstopping and breathtaking, and I remember thinking she was the finest actress I had ever seen. For years I would watch her build these characters on television in \u201cRoseanne\u201d as well as her brilliant work on HBO\u2019s \u201cGetting On\u201d but not get the attention I felt she deserves. I am so happy that she was recognized for her work in Greta Gerwig\u2019s film \u201cLady Bird,\u201d and I hope now that she will continue to be noticed. But for years I felt that she was unrecognized for her amazing contributions.I wanted to just send three sentences\u2019 worth of names:Mai Zetterling, Wendy Toye, Margaret Tait, Binka Zhelyazkova, Larisa Shepitko, Wang Ping, Moufida Tlatli, Marion H\u00e4nsel, Barbara Kopple, Lotte Reiniger, Alison de Vere, Marzieh Meshkini, Sarah Maldoror, Dinara Asanova, Ana Mariscal, Kinuyo Tanaka, Val\u00e9rie Massadian, Yuliya Solntseva, Malvina Ursianu, Cecile Tang Shu-shuen, Sai Paranjpye, Lorenza Mazzetti ... for starters.But since you ask for one:When Kira Muratova died in June, there was no foot-long obituary in the Western newspapers. This masterly director of 22 films, pioneer of the complex crane maneuver, of tracking shots to give any in \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d a breathtaking run for its money: her epic, rebarbative, wildly chaotic, furious, visionary films have earned her a revered place in the international \u2014 intergalactic \u2014 canon for her work of five decades. It\u2019s high time she made it over the wire.Of all the wonderful women in this industry, I\u2019d have to tip my hat to Kathryn Bigelow. Kathryn\u2019s follow-through is impeccable, and when I witnessed her transition from the commercial spectrum into serious storytelling, I was in awe. I appreciate \u201cPoint Break\u201d all the way to \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d as they have an innate understanding of the male-driven pulse within the industry. I can\u2019t think of another female filmmaker since Mary Pickford who could have successfully navigated the industry waters from the \u201990s into the new millennium with equal patience, resilience and creativity.The first name that comes to mind is Forough Farrokhzad, an Iranian filmmaker and poet with a strong feminine voice whose poetry was banned after the revolution in Iran, and who was a true pioneer in women\u2019s liberation and independence. Her documentary \u201cThe House Is Black\u201d is considered an essential part of the Iranian new wave and is a true inspiration to me. And I can\u2019t help but think of a lot of other Middle Eastern filmmakers and actresses who, like her, were often misunderstood, marginalized and sometimes even exiled from their own countries just because of their unconventional views, considered too controversial or too provocative for their time.To admire Anna Magnani is to admire a total woman, an extraordinary actress and, above all, an expression of \u201cpolar\u201d femininity. Anna expressed strength and weakness, and while staying true to herself, joyfully embodied the contradictions of all that is feminine: hence charm and violence, gentleness and ferocity, folly and lucidity, courage and fragility.In Italy\u2019s early postwar years especially, she catalyzed the desires of an orphan nation, a newborn democracy looking for a mother. In neorealism and for the rest of her career, Anna Magnani became a reliable, thoughtful mother for this young Italy recovering from the wounds of war. But she was also despairing and severe, alone in front of a candle waiting for her sons to return. A woman who was a symbol and a nest and a bitter smile, old yet immature. Pasolini called her \u201cMamma Roma\u201d and the name stuck.Not only is Jane Fonda an incredible actress and hilarious, but she has done so much to advocate for women, victims of abuse and violence, the environment and humanity in general. I\u2019ve never had the pleasure to meet her, but I imagine her to be someone who has strong morals and follows that compass when making decisions. And that is never easy. To have such a long and diverse career, without losing that sense of self, is something I aspire to. And her relationship with Lily Tomlin is one of my all-time favorite things. I mean, come on.Advertisement"}

Hers was two pieces: a ruffled pinafore in a pale blue calico over a Peter Pan-collared, bell-sleeve blouse in a contrasting floral, called the Apron. Both garments sell for around $400 apiece and are designed by a woman who has come to be known by one name, Batsheva (her surname is Hay). The recent crush of Lower East Side Laura Ingalls Wilders is in large measure attributable to her and a selective but influential group of acolytes, who manage to make the dresses\u2019 Amish dowdiness seem a provocative fashion choice.It comes, said Ms. Hay, who herself pairs the dresses with combat boots, out of \u201cconflicting forces.\u201d There is, according to the designer, a genuine nostalgia for Laura Ashley, Gunne Sax and \u201cLittle House on the Prairie\u201d that women over 30 can relate to, along with a sort of \u201cre-appropriation and parody\u201d of stereotypically feminine silhouettes and styles. Ms. Hay added: \u201cSome of the women who wear my clothes are just being pretty and simple, going to a Venice Beach brunch where they want to look feminine and relaxed. Others are being feminist and radical and wearing the dresses with hard-core boots and are going more Cindy Sherman, playing with the look.\u201d \u201cI have a fondness for a puffy shoulder,\u201d said Hailey Gates, 28, the host of Viceland\u2019s \u201cStates of Undress\u201d and a devoted wearer of Batsheva\u2019s line, having learned about it from Ana Kras, a photographer and furniture designer. \u201cI had an eBay alert set for \u2018vintage moir\u00e9\u2019 and then I saw she had this moir\u00e9 dress in the color of really salty butter.\u201dBut Ms. Gates associates Batsheva\u2019s dresses less with an actual butter-churning milieu than with memories of a lost New York of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the last time prairie chic was in fashion here. Some women\u2019s associations with the style, however, are more obvious. \u201cI\u2019ve always been inspired by all things Western and frontier,\u201d said Margaret Kleveland, one of two sisters who design Doen, a two-year-old fashion brand based in Los Angeles whose sepia-toned social media feed suggests a Sofia Coppola adaptation of \u201cO Pioneers!\u201d The most recent ad campaign featured a flaxen-haired lass, sun filtering through the gathered yoke of her \u201cPrairie Paisley\u201d blouse as she feeds a baby lamb. Lest you think this is all marketing: Hilary Walsh, the photographer who shot the campaign, raises chickens in her backyard in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. Alyssa Miller, a model turned accessories designer (her line, naturally, is called Pilgrim) and one of Doen\u2019s \u201cmuses,\u201d keeps a 200-pound pig, Paul, and hens in the middle of Hollywood. For the formerly minimalist Calvin Klein, Raf Simons constructed a sinister barn set and sheer, breast-exposing, bib-front gingham dresses paired with knit balaclavas and metallic leather gloves. And as part of a series of advertisements hashtagged #myCalvins, Mr. Simons placed those most American of superstars, the Kardashian-Jenner sisters, in an abandoned horse barn with the reality pioneers swathed in red-and-white patchwork quilts. Though many would argue that prairie dressing in its modesty of cut and price is a corrective to the five-figure, stripper style of the Kardashian-Jenners\u2019 Calabasas homestead, it could also be seen as a conscientious counterpoint to fast fashion and the current street wear trend (though a Doen new season alert is pounced upon with the same zeal reserved for a Supreme drop and sells out almost as quickly). \u201cThere is a slowness to it, even the visual identity of it feels slow,\u201d said Aurora James, the designer of Brother Vellies. \u201cYou\u2019re not running in it. It\u2019s the complete opposite of those gigantor Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga sneakers. There\u2019s something very gentle and thoughtful about wearing dresses.\u201dI visited Ms. James at her store in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, days after her return from a trip to England, where she posted a series of selfies wearing an ankle-length Batsheva floral Prairie dress in a golden wheat field. Brother Vellies makes the handwoven baskets and huaraches that many U.P.G.\u2019s like to pair with their dresses, and created a capsule collection with Batsheva of her classic styles subverted in sheer iridescent (called the CD Rom) and latex.On my walk down Franklin Street I passed a vintage boutique called Walk the West; Home of the Brave, a design store selling homemade earthenware ceramics; and a cafe, Littleneck Outpost, which sells cowboy-ready enamelware mugs and bowls and tea towels made from antique, homespun hemp linen. \u201cI feel like with all the new information about food safety and organic living, people are trying take that into their own hands,\u201d Margaret Kleveland said. \u201cI think we\u2019re living in a time of fear and uncertainty and there\u2019s a certain level of self-sufficiency that people are seeking.\u201d The sisters know families on the Central Coast of California, where they grew up, who are trying to live solely by trade and barter. The Klevelands\u2019 father boasts that he lives off the grid at his ranch, \u201cI think he knows that if everything goes crazy he has a well and a garden, a survivalist plan,\u201d Katherine Kleveland said. \u201cHomesteading brings about a different style of life and that\u2019s really desirable right now.\u201dAnd even for (perhaps especially for) people who live in $9,000 per month lofts in TriBeCa, the survivalist aesthetic has appeal. The Best Made Company Axe Shop there promises customers \u201ca lifeline in the wilderness, and at home it\u2019s a magnificent window into that wilderness\u201d and includes $400 styles with names like Lincoln, Fortitude and Smithereens.Meanwhile \u2014 back to butter \u2014 Food52\u2019s online shop seduces customers to \u201cchannel a day on the farm,\u201d with its hand-crank Mason jar churner. \u201cChurning butter, making your own almond milk, these are innate reactions of \u2018how can I reclaim a safe space for myself,\u201d Ms. James said. \u201cWith everything that\u2019s going on in politics a lot of us got really burnt out. How do you maintain yourself and your spirit?\u201dThis more modest style of dress has also coincided neatly with the #MeToo movement. When Sarah Sophie Flicker, an activist, attended the reopening of Judy Chicago\u2019s \u201cDinner Party\u201d swathed in Batsheva ruffles, it felt like a deliberate feminist stance. Though others may feel that ascribes too much meaning on what is, at the end of the day, just a dress with frills. Ms. Gates heard someone describe a Batsheva design \u201cas the perfect dress for the #MeToo movement, which I found truly asinine,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople still seem to believe that the amount of clothing a woman wears dictates whether she will be assaulted or not.\u201dAnd yet the last revival of this style was the late 1960s to the early \u201970s, when feminism was also in high gear. Jessica McClintock started her Gunne Sax line (the name comes from gunny sacks: the Old West burlap carryalls) during the tumultuous Summer of Love; Laura Ashley and \u201cLittle House\u201d soon followed.But that era\u2019s iteration was more Woodstock meets Willa Cather. There was a bohemian, hippie overtone that is absent this time around. It also is arguably more inclusive. \u201cPolitically speaking, my head space right now, I\u2019m trying to maintain my love for this country and for some reason that makes me gravitate toward wearing a certain style of prairie dress, which is interesting because that was never, as a woman of color, something I was included in,\u201d said Ms. James, who described the discomfort she felt seeing the way a black model was styled in a prairie dress by Sandy Liang, a designer. It felt jarring to her, Ms. James said: \u201cI was like, \u2018Wow that makes me feel like it\u2019s in the South a long time ago. So there is a fine line there, being able to reclaim something versus not having that thing be positioned properly.\u201dFor her part, Margaret Kleveland is looking at the \u201cLittle House\u201d series with a new perspective. \u201cRereading it through a new lens I totally understood that it was problematic,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we take from it is more of a visual library,\u201d said Katherine Kleveland, whose children are named Wilder, Shepard and Prairie.\u201cI mean \u2026 can I wear this in public? I look like I\u2019m about to go milk a cow?\u201d my friend texted with the photo of her up to here in the pinafore. Indeed, she looked like a waifish version of Kirsten Larson, the 1860s pioneer American Girl Doll. However, I also liked it. Was yes to both a possible answer? When I sent back my own fitting photo she replied, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if I love it or if it\u2019s your \u2018Big Love\u2019 Halloween costume,\u201d followed by a still of Chlo\u00eb Sevigny from the HBO show about Mormon fundamentalists, wearing almost the identical ensemble, down to the ruffled collar and oxen tongue pink color. I know she\u2019s right. But I\u2019m definitely going to wear it again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "3 Investments That May Have Hit Their Peak", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersThis week is the 10th anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, a flash point in the financial crisis. The economy has rebounded since then and the stock market has risen to record highs, but a feeling of caution looms over many investors.One of them is Dan Rasmussen, a contrarian investor who has marshaled data and historical returns to argue that three of the most popular asset classes for high-net-worth investors are not as desirable as they seem.\u201cI want to give the advisers the intellectual ammunition to allow them to say, \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to put money into these strategies,\u2019\u201d he said.But some advisers challenge this point of view, saying it is almost akin to market timing. \u201cYou could look at any asset class at any point in time and position it in a way and understand why it\u2019s outperformed or underperformed,\u201d said Scott Stackman, managing director of private wealth at UBS Wealth Management.Here is Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s argument for caution in three areas:During the financial crisis, Mr. Rasmussen worked at Bain Capital, a leading name in private equity. One of his jobs was to collect data on deals by Bain and its competitors to determine why some had done well and others had not.The more profitable deals were the least expensive ones, he found. The cheapest 25 percent of deals accounted for 60 percent of the funds\u2019 profits. The top 50 percent accounted for just 7 percent of profits. The difference was the price paid for the company. This was not solely for the obvious reason that paying less is better, but because private equity funds typically borrow 60 percent of the purchase price, which affects a company\u2019s profitability.Mr. Rasmussen said he admired the success Bain had in the 1980s and \u201990s, but began to question whether the private equity model it had helped pioneer was still sustainable.When early private equity firms bought relatively small companies at a discount and loaded them up with debt, the amount of leverage on the company was still about four times the company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of profitability known as Ebitda.Private equity firms continued to apply this strategy, but they were paying more for the companies, and consequently the amount of debt was rising to more than six or seven times Ebitda. With leverage at 10 times Ebitda, Mr. Rasmussen found, a company\u2019s free cash was almost all going toward debt service, and it was nearly impossible to be profitable.Mr. Rasmussen said the sector would look worse if not for a few high-performing funds that pulled up overall returns.\u201cIt\u2019s probably the worst time ever to invest in private equity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd now, it\u2019s being packaged for wealth management firms and registered investment advisers.\u201dAccording to PitchBook Benchmarks, which gathers data on private equity investments, only 25 percent of funds have been outperforming the market, and have done so by a smaller amount.Mr. Stackman of UBS said he was still putting money into private equity and hedge funds for certain clients, and reducing their investments in public equities or fixed income.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d term it as a true shift,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our belief in how the high-net-worth clients could and should be invested.\u201dMr. Rasmussen said the funds that still provided high returns equal with the risk were generally smaller ones that acted more like the owners of the companies they bought and didn\u2019t just add debt to increase returns.At his own firm, Mr. Rasmussen said, he modeled the strategy on what private equity funds were doing in the 1980s and 1990s: buying smaller companies at cheap prices and putting a reasonable amount of debt on them. In Verdad\u2019s case, Mr. Rasmussen focused on buying publicly traded companies with a small market capitalization.Verdad\u2019s main leveraged company fund lagged its small-cap benchmark in the first two quarters of this year but kept pace with a broader global benchmark. Over the past three years, the strategy has beaten both the small-cap and global benchmarks by six percentage points.The argument against venture capital is less nuanced. Top private equity funds are still delivering high returns, but venture capital funds have largely functioned as what Mr. Rasmussen calls \u201ca rich man\u2019s lottery.\u201dHe cites data from Cambridge Associates showing that venture capital has underperformed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Nasdaq over the last 15 years. And he argues that those venture capital firms that built big names often did so with a few spectacular investments that overshadowed more mediocre ones.The venture capital firm Benchmark, for example, invested $6.7 million in eBay in 1997. That investment grew to $5 billion in two years, outshining other investments.Any venture capitalist will argue that the big winners make up for all the bets that did not pay off. Mr. Rasmussen does not dispute that; he emphasizes how difficult it is to find those funds that are going to consistently make the big winning investments.Mr. Rasmussen draws a distinction between real estate owned by private equity firms and real estate investment trusts. And for him, the difference in returns comes down to fees. A REIT typically charges a management fee of less than 1 percent. A fund that owns real estate will charge a typical private equity fee, which can be as high as 2 percent to manage the money and 20 percent of the profits.\u201cBy and large, it\u2019s a pretty efficient asset class, since rental income is a fixed contract,\u201d he said. So fees play a big role in the difference in returns.But real estate owned in REITs, he said, could be a good buffer for anxious investors because they have a low correlation to traditional equities given their stream of rental income. They\u2019re also less risky, he wrote, than his focus, small-cap stocks.Excluding entire asset classes can be a tough sell, some financial advisers say. Investors should be asking instead whether an asset class is performing as it should.\u201cYou could put together a low-volatility portfolio of hedge funds, and they will get very consistent return,\u201d Mr. Stackman of UBS said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not getting the generous returns the S. & P. has been giving you since 2009.\u201dThat would be around 2 percent a year for hedge funds versus about 18 percent for the S. & P. 500. And many asset classes now have had a good run.There\u2019s another cautionary argument on private investments. Because they are inherently risky, they should be undertaken only by the most experienced investors.Michael W. Sonnenfeldt, founder and chairman of Tiger 21, an investment club for people with $10 million to $1 billion, said the group\u2019s 630 members had increased their investments in private equity and real estate.The group\u2019s collective portfolio has about 50 percent allocated to private equity and real estate. Public equity and debt make up just 35 percent.Mr. Sonnenfeldt said that such high allocations to risky private assets were a product of how Tiger 21\u2019s members often made their fortunes, building businesses and taking risk.But he agreed with Mr. Rasmussen\u2019s argument on investing in smaller companies.\u201cWhat our members do is not a referendum on the entire market,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. \u201cIt\u2019s our members. Most people who are thinking about these investments wouldn\u2019t do well without the skills to be successful. That\u2019s an important distinction.\u201dAnd he said the group\u2019s members expressed interest in private asset classes because, they said, their experience allowed them to influence the management of the investment.\u201cOur members overwhelmingly express their interest in private equity through ownership of a company or investment in a company,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a third have put money into a fund, and then they\u2019re biased toward the smaller funds over the larger ones, for the reasons Rasmussen is talking about.\u201dIn other words, the message is a resounding caveat emptor.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I\u2019ve Gone to Look for America. Here\u2019s What I Found.", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt usually went like this: In a compact rental car considered midsize only by some rental company\u2019s dubious standards, I would adjust the driver\u2019s seat to fit my question-mark frame. I\u2019d then check the radio, making musical scat of the syndicated provocateurs before choosing a local station on the inferior AM bandwidth, where every word seems to pass through the filter of an indefinable past.Depending on mood and place, I would absorb the aching wails of Hank Williams, or maybe the fire-next-time portents of some storefront preacher. With any luck I\u2019d find a program called Tradio, or Swap Shop, through which callers engage in a sort of on-air eBay. Once, while driving through West Virginia, I heard a woman announce that she was looking to sell a house, 16 acres, a bowling ball and a sequined dress slit up the side.Seat; check. Mirrors; check. Now all I\u2019d have to do is put the car in drive and point it to Somewhere, America.Often sitting beside me would be a New York Times photographer (\u00c1ngel Franco, or Nicole Bengiveno, or Todd Heisler \u2026) or maybe the videographer Kassie Bracken. I was grateful for an unerring eye \u2014 and for the companionship, since I find myself to be miserable company.These dispatches, filed from every one of the 50 states, were stand-alone stories that seemed to fit together, jigsawlike, into an epic larger than their individual selves. But when combined, what were they telling me?Most of the people I encountered had never spoken before to a journalist. Invariably, they were just trying to get through another day in America, their wills tested by crime, by fates, by natural disaster. I lingered and listened and, in doing so, I detected a theme that seems to persist no matter the president or the era: shared resilience.Given our fractured and fractious times, you could argue that there is no center to this nation; that what exists instead is an ever-widening chasm between the reds and the blues, the rural and the urban, the haves and the have-nots, us and them. At times it seems as though the United States is less one country than a collection of distinctly different fiefs, connected more by geographic happenstance than by a shared embrace of ideals.Marking the exact spot is a small metal disc engraved with the word CENTER. Planted beside it is an American flag whose red and white stripes become ragged from the elements and wind. But then a new flag is planted, and the center continues to hold.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How I Dressed to Heal My Heartbreak", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of my only productive strategies for working with fear was dressing with intention. That became even more important when I was healing myself. Then in June 2017, \u201csomeday\u201d came. It was two days after I turned 29; 10 days after a devastating breakup (I was wearing a vintage Comme des Gar\u00e7ons dress that still hurts to look at); and three years and six months after I made the difficult decision to cut ties with my mother. The inescapable weight of my grief told me this was the time \u2014 now, not later \u2014 to finally pick up the book. It is said that the Buddha taught metta as an antidote to fear, which appealed to me as a newly single woman struggling to unpack a lifetime of toxic internalized messages and knee-jerk self-destructive behaviors. Knowing it was going to take more than a brief, daily practice to heal my heart, I went home and entered an online lottery for a weeklong retreat the following spring, which was to be held at a New England meditation center. Participants were to observe noble silence \u2014 meaning no reading, writing, speaking, or eye contact. By the end of fall, 100 names had been drawn. Mine was one of them. When I arrived in rural Massachusetts after traveling by train, bus and car from my apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, I was wearing black linen pants that I had thrifted in Arizona, where I\u2019m from; a boxy long-sleeve tee I bought on sale at COS; and a heavily discounted pair of magenta-and-gold Asics sneakers I\u2019d purchased online two years earlier with my ex-partner, who owned a lime green pair. The shoes were part of a loving nudge to get me to take up running, which he thought could help my anxiety. What he didn\u2019t realize was that I had anxiety about running, too. My mom was a runner. It felt like a slippery slope.As I was settling into my dorm room that afternoon, hanging my clothes and making the bed, it occurred to me that I should save my favorite shirt, which I\u2019d acquired on a beautiful trip to Mexico despite being told not to go there, for safety\u2019s sake, as a pick-me-up should I need it, or a celebration should I succeed. The shirt was hand-embroidered with happy-hued flowers, and was the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of a wide textile collection I\u2019d amassed over the years \u2014 each piece a reminder of home.But like anything else, \u201chome\u201d was complicated. It was desert walks, Instagrammable sunsets, and time with loved ones; it was also feelings of unworthiness, troubling memories, and immense sadness. It was lucky thrift store finds, adobe blocks in Barrio Viejo, and the joy of Arizona sunshine on my skin; it was also shame for not speaking Spanish, guilt for leaving, and \u201cdon\u2019t get too dark,\u201d a warning I\u2019d hear every summer as a kid. This is what I was working with. This is why I was on retreat.On the first full day of sitting, I wore a pajama-like J. Jill linen pant set, scooped up in an eBay auction. It was loungewear at its best: loose, breathable, and the color of Sedona\u2019s majestic red rocks. Something about the hue felt warm and right. By lunchtime, it was clear to me that a watch, shawl and slippers are the accessories that best serve someone who attends a silent retreat. Luckily, I had packed all three, taking the advice of the retreat center\u2019s website, which urged participants to 1) be prepared and 2) be comfortable. In addition to ample outfit options for the unpredictable spring weather, I\u2019d also brought an assortment of functional and decorative extras, which I wore intermittently throughout the week: Adam Selman x Le Specs mirrored sunnies that I bought myself for Christmas; a Patagonia fanny pack worn unironically around my waist; two cotton bandannas; a brand new tube of bright red Mac lipstick; a headlamp purchased at Paragon Sports; tiny hand-me-down hoop earrings from a former colleague I admire; a baseball cap I bought after a hike with my little sister; an oversized black cashmere sweater I got for $2 in a Southern Arizona retirement community, and a loose quartz crystal charged at Joshua Tree\u2019s Integratron, for good measure.Sartorially speaking, Days 2 through 4 are all out of order in my memory, but I can tell you this: There was a red bandanna worn as a neckerchief, along with a white linen shirt from Uniqlo, brown linen pants from eBay and my sage Barbour coat, which I bought new with tags from a fashion blogger on DePop. I remember that outfit was still early in the retreat, and how, looking in the mirror after a particularly difficult sit, I found stability in the fact that I was wearing a hankie. Unlike my Barbour coat, which retailed for a price so high that wearing it felt like living in a fancy new condo with waterfront views, my bandanna had nothing to prove. It was a cheap and cheerful pop of flair that served no purpose other than self-expression. And what it expressed was happy.Then there was the day I threw on my favorite indigo vest, which featured interesting arm hole shapes and bright bands of embroidery. What I especially loved about this vest was that I had found it on Etsy \u2014 and it fit. The whole thing seemed to me a stroke of great luck, like when I was hired to work at their Brooklyn headquarters fresh off my move from Arizona. Walking into the shrine room at retreat that morning, I noticed that one of the teachers \u2014 the British one, whose accent sounded like my ex\u2019s \u2014 was wearing a vest, too. Though these first few days were grueling, it was kind of wonderful to be here, so many of us connected by metta. And vests.Another day, a cloudy day, I decided to go for a run. I was filled with so much anger and grief \u2014 at myself, at my situation, at the world. As I slipped on my Nike sports bra, I thought about the story behind it: how my ex-partner had taken me to the company\u2019s store on 57th Street and offered to treat me to some new gear. We had just returned from celebrating Christmas with his family in England. It was too much. I didn\u2019t deserve it, or so I told myself. I insisted that we leave and look for cheaper athletic wear at T.J. Maxx or Marshalls \u2014 the places I\u2019d shopped with my mother growing up. Looking back, that was the beginning of the end.On the evening of the sixth day, we started using our voices again; I had just the outfit. I slipped on my Mexican embroidered shirt. I had made it through somehow, and this shirt was my celebration. Though I\u2019ve worn it dozens of times before, this one was different.Aleksa Brown is a writer and editor living in Brooklyn.Advertisement"}

You\u2019re in a New York City that looks like today\u2019s New York but isn\u2019t. A winged \u201cStatue of Extra Liberty\u201d towers in the harbor. Humans rent themselves out in a turbocharged gig economy, while Muppet-like robots hustle chess games in the park. Tiny wheeled \u201cpoop bots\u201d trudge the sidewalks cleaning up dog waste. (The subways \u2014 well, the subways are still recognizably lousy.)On these retro-techno streets (basically, the future as imagined in 1980) we find Owen (Jonah Hill) and Annie (Emma Stone), two strangers who meet as subjects in a dodgy trial for psychiatric medication that promises to give its users\u2019 subconsciouses a deep cleaning by inducing dangerous, therapeutic dreams.Owen, the disdained younger son of a plutocrat family (they made their fortune in poop bots), is scraping by on temp jobs and haunted by hallucinations. The street-savvy Annie has gotten hooked on illicit samples from the drug trial that allow her to re-experience a defining trauma. He joins the experiment to earn cash; she joins to get a fix.The first episode mostly follows Owen\u2019s story, the weaker of the two. His humiliation by his family of entitled bros (with Gabriel Byrne as the pushy paterfamilias) plays like \u201cSuccession\u201d with extra psychosis. Mr. Hill is so subdued and mumble-mouthed he seems to be performing under local anesthesia.In Episode 2, Annie crashes the narrative, driven by guilt over the disintegration of her family and a generalized rage at the world. Ms. Stone plays her like she\u2019s packed with gunpowder. She blackmails her way into the trial, telling her unfortunate target that she\u2019s not crazy, \u201cI\u2019m just goal-oriented.\u201d In the lab, she and Owen are assigned honeycomb-like pods and set to the job of dreaming.The experiment is itself a family drama. Dr. James Mantleray (a wonderfully pompous Justin Theroux, in a Warhol moptop) has a long-simmering resentment of his mother, Greta (Sally Field), a best-selling pop-psych author, and he\u2019s channeled his issues into his anthropomorphized computer. The machine \u2014 revealingly named GRTA \u2014 inevitably glitches, threatening both science and subjects: My Mother, the HAL 9000.Based on a Norwegian series about the Walter Mitty delusions of a psychiatric patient, \u201cManiac\u201d was created by Patrick Somerville, a former writer for \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d You can catch echoes of that metaphysical drama\u2019s cosmic oddball moments here.But the real surprise is Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directs all 10 episodes and is known for shooting Season 1 of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d \u201cManiac\u201d is as playful and vibrant as that series was gothic and dark, lit in neon pink and electric blue, borrowing aesthetics from Japanese design and the \u201clate \u201970s electronic toys\u201d section of eBay.Much of the action takes place in Annie and Owen\u2019s shared dreams, where they must combat their personal demons, often with small-arms fire. Mr. Fukunaga jumps genres ably in these segments. One, involving the heist of a lemur, is like a Coen Brothers screwball caper; another is convincing \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d high fantasy. (Their computer-engineered phantasms are less like chaotic actual dreams and more like a sampler of the Netflix recommendations menu.)But for all its invention, \u201cManiac\u201d keeps the \u201cInception\u201d convolutions to a minimum, toggling intelligibly between the lab and the flights of fancy in Annie and Owen\u2019s heads.In dreamspace, he\u2019s freed of his meekness, she of her self-flagellation. Yet in every incarnation \u2014 mobster, diplomat, secret agent \u2014 they encounter figures from their real-life history. For Owen, it\u2019s his brother Jed (Billy Magnussen), a manipulative imp; for Annie, her estranged sister, Ellie (Julia Garner). They become like partners in a two-player video game, in which the boss to be conquered is the familial past.Occasionally, all this psycho-gaming slips into dorm-room heavy-talk about what it all means, man; \u201cOur brains are just computers that make our life stories make sense,\u201d Owen says, as if we haven\u2019t been watching a series about precisely that. And the series seems to realize that Annie\u2019s arc is the more involving of the two, shifting focus to it over its run.But \u201cManiac\u201d is inventive and well-paced enough (the episodes clock in at a welcome 40 minutes or less) to breeze past its missteps. If you can resist a story line in which Ms. Stone relives a defining catastrophe in the person of a cynical elf warrior, your \u201cdefense mechanisms,\u201d as Dr. Mantleray would put it, are stronger than mine.In an age of desiccated puzzle-stories, \u201cManiac\u201d puts emotion first, even at the risk of sentimentality. It\u2019s a heart-shaped Rubik\u2019s Cube, a funny, consistently surprising fable of broken machines trying to reassemble themselves.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Flea Circus", "Date": "2018-09-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDueling dealers! $1,000 T-shirts! Homemade fruit spreads! In the age of eBay, the Rose Bowl market\u2019s still got it. PASADENA, Calif. \u2014 At 4 a.m. on the second Sunday of every month, headlamps light up like fireflies in Lot K of the Rose Bowl Stadium here. They are worn by collectors searching for treasure: Hans Wegner club chairs, perfectly aged Levi\u2019s jeans (preferably from before 1971), and AC/DC and Wu Tang Clan concert T-shirts.Owners of vintage-clothing stores complain relentlessly about the deals being \u201cgone,\u201d yet they not only come back, but also scale the chain-link fence at the perimeter to get a head start before the gates open at 5 a.m.This is what Patrick Matamoros, a dealer who placed Kim Kardashian in a Sade shirt and Rihanna in a Whitney Houston one, did in August, shortly before he nearly came to blows with another vintage dealer.The immediate cause of their spat was a Black Crowes T-shirt, but the kerfuffle was years in the making.Then things boiled over as they stood on opposite sides of a clothing rack, just before dawn, arguing over who first reached the black, white and pink skeleton-print shirt.Mr. Matamoros pulled it in one direction. Mr. Cole pulled it in the other. Even with headlamps on, it was hard to see what was happening, but everyone around heard the sound as it ripped down the middle.Mr. Cole started laughing. As he saw it, there was nothing else to do. But this enraged Mr. Matamoros.\u201cIt just seemed so condescending,\u201d Mr. Matamoros said afterward.The argument escalated quickly. \u201cI called him a thief and a liar,\u201d Mr. Cole said.\u201cI said if he called me a thief again, bad things would happen,\u201d Mr. Matamoros said.Mr. Cole sneered at him and walked away.Once he saw the price tag, Mr. Matamoros turned regretful. \u201cIt was $150,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t worth $50.\u201dStill, he bought it from the seller. Partly because he felt responsible for destroying it. But mostly to spite Mr. Cole. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to repair it yet,\u201d he said.All over the East Coast, flea markets are withering away.Buyers don\u2019t want to bundle up on winter mornings and scour for merchandise that can be found easily on eBay, Etsy or 1stdibs, with better guarantees. Sellers don\u2019t want to load pickup trucks with merchandise that can easily be sold online.Yet in Los Angeles, good weather, job scarcity and higher commercial real-estate costs have fueled a thriving swap-meet scene.In May, the 15-year-old Saturday afternoon swap meet in Silver Lake went from once a month to every week. About a third of its sellers are old flea market types who never made the digital transition, according to Fiora Boes, the event\u2019s organizer. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving them is the desire to be cool and to have the next post on Instagram,\u201d Ms. Boes said, as she described how \u201cthese kids\u201d scour through social-media posts, Goodwills and rag houses for rare finds. \u201cThen they wear it once or twice and sell it at the flea \u2014 or over Instagram \u2014 and buy something else.\u201d The legalization of marijuana has also fortified the market, not simply because lots of dealers start getting high with one another at 6 a.m., but also because so many of the products being sold contain THC or refer to weed culture.Ms. Rhoades is also among the 2,500 sellers paying about $100 for a booth at Rose Bowl, which for 50 years has taken place on the second Sunday of every month in the parking lots surrounding the 90,000-seat football stadium that the U.C.L.A. Bruins call home.The Rose Bowl flea was started by Richard Gary Canning, whose firm RG Canning Attractions began with concert promotion and car shows. The market was intended as a peripheral revenue stream. \u201cWe never thought we\u2019d give up concert promotion and just have this, but that\u2019s what happened,\u201d said its chief administrative officer, Mike Redd, 71, who has been at the Rose Bowl more or less every month since 1968.In the 1970s and \u201980s, the Rose Bowl\u2019s biggest market was antiques, Mr. Redd said. In the early 2000s, the vintage-clothing market exploded and the Rose Bowl became a religious ritual for hoarder hipsters united in the desire to get baked and beat each other to Cross Colours jackets, Chanel handbags, Charlie Brown sweatshirts and other assorted pop-culture peculiarities.After rolling in before dawn, sellers use the next few hours to set up their stations and buy among themselves. Around 8 a.m., the Bowl becomes a street-style spectacular, as the bearded and tattooed rummage for Red Wing work boots amid collectors like Lisa Eisner, a jewelry designer and frequent companion to Tom Ford; the transgender actress Candis Cayne; and Brad Pitt, known among this crowd as much for his furniture expertise as for his movies.A few years back, Mr. Redd said, Mr. Pitt came in and spotted a chair he wanted. The seller was asking $600 for it. Mr. Pitt knew it was worth much more than that. So he pulled out a wad of cash and gave the seller a $2,000 bonus.Given Southern California\u2019s progressive politics, it\u2019s unsurprising that many of the sellers talk about placing people before profits and wanting to be one with the earth. But many also have an appreciation for memorabilia of questionable taste.\u201cFree O.J.\u201d shirts from back when O.J. Simpson was on trial for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, abound. They usually trade for about $100 each, which is around what it costs to get an old R. Kelly shirt (not cheap for someone now infamous for alleged sex crimes). Nicholas Baier, a dreadlocked dealer at the Bowl, was shopping near his station and stumbled upon a shirt with a Confederate flag. He wasn\u2019t offended. \u201cI have Bill Cosby in my booth,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s history.\u201d (Mr. Baier is white.)Recently, Mr. Matamoros has been buying up Russian Harley Davidson, Tower Records and McDonald\u2019s shirts. \u201cThe potential for misinterpreting why someone is wearing a Russia shirt right now is awesome,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the shirts I sell to be political. I\u2019m trying to say something.\u201dWhich is what, a reporter asked. \u201cDon\u2019t be boring!\u201d Mr. Matamoros said.Given how easy it is to search for concert tees on eBay, finding an authentic one from the Talking Heads 1983 tour for $50 has gotten increasingly unlikely. And shirts by Bell Biv Devoe and En Vogue cost a lot, the prices propelled by scarcity (most R&B and hip-hop acts from that time did not tour extensively) and surging demand from kids born in the \u201990s, who now have money, nostalgia and a desire to look like Kanye West, even as they make fun of his behavior.Americana from every era proliferates at the Rose Bowl, but great antiques, formal wear and fancy jewelry are in shorter supply than they used to be.In the lot adjacent to the vintage clothing section, Dwaine Williams offered nearly every issue of Playboy Magazine from 1959 to 1985, most priced around $10. A few spaces away, a seller had hundreds of Star Wars toys, which came from his personal collection and became a job when he got laid off from work and his wife told him to start divesting.Gramophones aren\u2019t exactly a growth industry, but two booths sell them near the stadium\u2019s main entrance.One is manned by Scott Corbett, a fifth-grade teacher at Sierra Vista Elementary School in Upland, Calif., and his wife, Denise, a teacher\u2019s aide there.The Oliphant brothers\u2019 wives are merely \u201cunderstanding,\u201d about their hobbies, according to Jeff, while Ms. Corbett has become an enthusiastic partner.After years of competing for customers at the Rose Bowl and bumping into one another at hobbyist events, the Corbetts and the Oliphants barely speak. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Mr. Corbett said.And when Jeff Oliphant seemed particularly cheery on a recent summer morning, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out why. \u201cHe\u2019s not here!\u201d Mr. Oliphant said, smiling brightly.Brian Cohen, a 44-year-old dealer who that morning was selling a rack of \u201950s-era harlequin print shirts, priced at $50 each, said: \u201cThere could be an ensemble Christopher Guest movie based on the cast of characters at the Rose Bowl.\u201d Mr. Cohen, wearing a retro flattop, as if he was the sidekick from a James Dean movie, wasn\u2019t being judgmental. In 2008, he plunked down $25,000 on a black crepe Hawaiian shirt with swirling tigers and bright red clouds. \u201cI only wore it once,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting in a bin with a bunch of other shirts, being enjoyed by no one.\u201dYet he can\u2019t seem to part with it. \u201cI might never be able to get it again.\u201dMr. Cohen grew up in Westchester, N.Y., and made his first windfall as a dealer at the age of 12, selling portions of his autographed baseball cards and souvenir collection for $300 at a baseball memorabilia convention in Poughkeepsie.In high school, friends scavenged for dates while he headed to the Chelsea flea market in Manhattan for lunchboxes, Star Trek memorabilia and action figures.During college \u2014 Boston University, class of 1996 (\u201cI got a B.S. in b.s.\u201d he said) \u2014 Mr. Cohen contemplated entering the business world. But he found summer jobs as a temp unbearable.His epiphany came a year later during a West Coast buying trip as he watched Japanese collectors dart around the parking lots in Pasadena armed with shopping carts filled to the brim with Big Es Levi\u2019s jeans and old, rare Nikes.\u201cThere was so much action. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Mr. Cohen said.Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles and took a monthly space at the Rose Bowl. \u201cThe night before, I couldn\u2019t even fall asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just so excited about all the things I could sell, all the things I could buy.\u201dHe had a Pavlovian response to the stench of vintage clothes wafting through the dry Pasadena air. And he was fascinated by the people: driven by a compulsion to acquire, yet seldom displaying any serious inclination toward power and wealth.Indeed, many were selling simply so they could keep collecting. \u201cThe biggest thrill wasn\u2019t really making a profit,\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \u201cIt was finding that new rare piece for the collection.\u201dThe Bowl\u2019s organizers also defy the conventional laws of capitalism, even as the business got more complicated in the internet age. \u201cWe do not tell sellers how to run their businesses, and we take no cut from sales,\u201d Mr. Redd saidPeople who inherited their parents\u2019 furniture, the sort who once had sold them in yard sales or to local dealers, could now go on eBay and see how much similar things were selling for.When customers arrive at the Rose Bowl on Sunday mornings, Mr. Cohen said, the first sentence out of their mouth has become, \u201c\u2018Is that really your best price?\u2019 Even if they don\u2019t speak English, they know the word \u2018discount.\u2019\u201d\u201cMy romantic life has definitely suffered because of this,\u201d he said, describing dates during which he tried to put his phone away but couldn\u2019t help himself when it started buzzing and he realized there were incoming photographs of clothes he was interested in buying. Today, there are a lot more young women selling at the Bowl, and many sell in smartly designed tented booths with tribal rugs on the ground. But Mr. Cohen disdainfully calls them \u201cthe Etsy girls\u201d and laments their effect on the Bowl: \u201cIt became all about ambience.\u201dSean McEvoy, 37, who has sold vintage Sonic Youth T-shirts and highly collectible denim at the Bowl for a decade, has a wife, Rikki McEvoy, who runs his online business\u201cI\u2019ve been doing meditation and seeing a therapist because collecting is like any other addiction,\u201d Mr. McEvoy said. \u201cWhen he was young, I did blow and chased women. Those things got replaced by this. Part of why I\u2019m buying women\u2019s clothes today is because I don\u2019t have any attachment to the stuff. I just move it.\u201dMr. McEvoy walked over to to a seller with a collection of Levi\u2019s and picked out six pairs he thought he could resell. But getting the price from $1,700 to $850 was brutal. \u201cI got to have a ciggie,\u201d Mr. McEvoy said at one point. \u201cI\u2019m getting stressed out.\u201dEven after Mr. McEvoy prevailed, he seemed unsure of whether he\u2019d gotten a great deal or a big discount on a rip-off.Off in the distance, Mr. Matamoros was complaining about the cost of his shirts. \u201cEvery month it gets harder,\u201d he said.Yet the bowl is his calling and his compulsion. He knows what would happen if it went away. \u201cI\u2019d be homeless,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Search of \u2018Shabby Chic\u2019 at the Braderie de Lille", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLILLE, France \u2014 A tarnished brass-and-crystal chandelier here, a flaking gilded-wood mirror there. A sideboard with rococo curves and a chipped tureen on top.\u201cIt\u2019s the most amount of merchandise I can access in one trip,\u201d said Mary Homer, a dealer from Pennsylvania, on Saturday as she inspected a 23-euro (about $27) coffee pot at a pitch specializing in vintage enameled kitchenware.The character of the Braderie has also changed, creating mixed feelings among long-term professional exhibitors and visitors.\u201cThere\u2019s less interest in antiques, and the quality is lower,\u201d said Beno\u00eet Viriot, a dealer in Braderie staples such as old French mirrors and ironwork, who has been exhibiting at the event for 25 years. \u201cThe clientele is more international,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s still a good market.\u201dIn the 1980s and \u201990s, the Braderie had a reputation for being a market where centuries-old bargains could be discovered, freshly unearthed by locals from their attics. But on Saturday and Sunday this year, the streets reserved for \u201ccommer\u00e7ants riverains,\u201d or \u201cresident traders,\u201d were lined with T-shirts, sneakers and fast-food stalls, not grand-m\u00e8re\u2019s prized S\u00e8vres porcelain.Professional dealers, or brocanteurs, offering antique and vintage items, such as Mr. Viriot, were mainly concentrated in the mile-long Boulevard de la Libert\u00e9 that runs diagonally through the city, as well as in the area around the Champ de Mars to the north. This year, secondhand dealers represented about 600 \u2014 less than 10 percent \u2014 of the 6,500 traders and individuals with registered pitches, Jacques Richir, the deputy mayor in charge of the Braderie, said in an email.\u201cI haven\u2019t found one yet. I see more in English antique shops,\u201d said Ms. Barlow, adding that traders back home in Kent priced confit pots at about 150 pounds. \u201cI guess the English have come over and raided them all.\u201d\u201cI like the mix of European treasures, Ms. Raddatz said. \u201cThere are stories attached to all these things, and prices are very reasonable.\u201dAt the Champ de Mars, Bouwe Krol, a Netherlands-based dealer in hand-painted Delft pottery, disagreed with Ms. Raddatz\u2019s assessment of the value on show.\u201cThese are too expensive,\u201d Mr. Krol said, putting a Delft thimble priced at \u20ac3 back in its pile. What should it be priced at? \u201cOne euro,\u201d said Mr. Krol, who was at least pleased with the purchase of a plate painted with windmills, knocked down to \u20ac4, from an asking price of \u20ac5.To be sure, a flea market is a flea market, but this \u201csecondhand\u201d element of the Braderie has contracted, as has the event as a whole, particularly after the 2016 cancellation.Mr. Richir, the deputy mayor, said that in the past, before the current system of obligatory registration for exhibitors, \u201cpeople settled everywhere in the city. They sometimes had to come one week before the event in order to have a place.\u201dThis year, although Mr. Richir said exhibitor numbers were up 25 percent compared with 2017, there were dozens of empty pitches in the Rue Nationale, formerly one of the Braderie\u2019s best-known trading streets.Ms. Homer, the Pennsylvania dealer, had noticed the same thing. According to her, \u201c2015 was much bigger, and it was also much more of a real flea market.\u201dAppley Hoare, a specialist dealer in 18th- and 19th-century French furniture who is based in Gloucestershire, in western England, said in a telephone interview that she stopped visiting the Braderie more than a decade ago. \u201cFifteen years ago you could find things. It was exciting, it was mad,\u201d she said. But now, \u201cAll the interesting pieces have gone.\u201dAnd yet the crowds keep coming. Initial estimates from the Mayor\u2019s office suggested that about 2 million people visited Lille for the Braderie weekend. But on Saturday, few of them appeared to be buying anything other than something to eat or drink.Ms. Hoare said that if she wanted to find French antiques, she would be more likely to visit specialist fairs in France, such as those in Avignon, Beziers and Montpellier. \u201cIf I went to the Braderie now,\u201d she said, \u201cit would be for fun, not to look for stock.\u201dThat\u2019s one thing about the Braderie de Lille that doesn\u2019t seem to have changed: It\u2019s still a lot of fun. Two million people certainly seem to think so.Advertisement"}
