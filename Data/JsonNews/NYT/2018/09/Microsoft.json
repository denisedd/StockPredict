{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s China Fight Puts U.S. Tech in the Cross Hairs", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says his trade war with China will protect America\u2019s dominance and derail Beijing\u2019s plan for technological and economic supremacy.Mr. Trump\u2019s next round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods goes into effect on Monday, hitting thousands of consumer products from handbags to refrigerators to bicycles. The tariffs will also hit the tech and telecom companies that provide much of the gear that powers the internet, mobile networks, data storage and other technology. United States customs will begin collecting a tax on circuit boards, semiconductors, cell tower radios, modems and other products made and assembled in China and exported into America.Those tariffs, Intel warned in a letter last month, are \u201ca game changer for the American consumer.\u201d The tariffs begin at a rate of 10 percent and increase to 25 percent next January.Like American automakers and other manufacturers, the tech sector has increasingly outsourced production to China, where manufacturing and assembly of products is cheaper than in the United States. In recent decades, Intel, Dell, and Apple began shifting manufacturing overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and align operations closer to customers in emerging markets.Intel, for instance, designs and manufactures most semiconductors in the United States but relies on Chinese facilities for assembly of their chips, which will now be taxed. Moving those manufacturing and assembly operations outside of China is unrealistic, the company has warned, saying \u201cit is too expensive to relocate established and integrated supply chains.\u201dGoogle, Dell, IBM and others say the tariffs will increase costs for companies and consumers, hindering America\u2019s ability to dominate the next generation of technology, like 5G wireless networks. Rising prices, the industries say, will slow business growth, increase costs for consumers and put other nations, like China, in a more competitive position to dominate tech.\u201cThe tariffs affect the heart of the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank financed by tech companies including Microsoft, Google and Intel. \u201cIf we are going to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, we should impose them on items that hurt the Chinese, not us.\u201dMr. Trump does not share that view, seeing the tariffs as a weapon to force China to change trade practices that the administration \u2014 and many companies, including tech firms \u2014 say are unfair.\u201cChina is engaged in numerous unfair policies and practices relating to United States technology and intellectual property \u2014 such as forcing United States companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement last week.Tech companies agree that China has long pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business in China or engaged in outright theft of intellectual property. But they argue that using tariffs as a retaliatory measure will hurt American companies while doing little to change China\u2019s ways.Tech and telecommunications products are among the fastest growing imports from China. In 2014, electronics accounted for 40 percent of all Chinese imports, according to the United States International Trade Commission. While the total value of telecommunications parts affected by the latest round of tariffs is unclear, the Telecommunications Industry Association estimates \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in extra costs for companies.The impact on the industry is amplified by the timing, as the United States and China race one another to dominate the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks, known as 5G. The faster networks will fuel the use of artificial intelligence in driverless cars and robotics and other technologies used by military. Companies have warned that the administration\u2019s tariffs will undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s stated plan to lead in those areas.\u201cThese latest duties threaten to raise the cost of 5G infrastructure in the U.S. by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Nokia officials told the F.C.C., according to public filings.\u201cOf course, this is related to some of the product that we import into the U.S. that is manufactured in China, and we are very much focused on mitigating that manufacturing,\u201d Micron\u2019s chief executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in an interview on CNBC.Other companies are weighing legal options. A leading trade group, the Consumer Technology Association, which represents 2,000 tech companies, said the administration is overstepping its authority on trade policy and is considering legal action against the administration.\u201cWe are exploring all options,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the association\u2019s president, said when asked if his group would sue the administration. \u201cThe tariffs will stifle our global leadership in 5G, create and internet tax on business and cause uncertainty for companies.\u201dThe inclusion of tech products only increased tension between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Silicon Valley has sparred with Mr. Trump on immigration. Mr. Trump accused tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google of political bias against conservatives and Amazon of avoiding tax payments. The companies have refuted the president\u2019s claims.Some companies have been partially spared. After intense lobbying by Apple and Fitbit, the Trump administration removed several consumer electronics products from the latest round of tariffs. Left off the list are technologies that affect Apple\u2019s Watch and other fitness trackers, AirPod earbuds and wireless speakers. The administration spared a total of 300 products from an earlier proposal drafted in July.On Friday, a senior administration official who has been engaged in trade negotiations defended the decision to offer relief to Apple\u2019s products. In a briefing with reporters at the White House, the official rejected the notion that winners and losers were being determined based on lobbying power.\u201cThis has been talked about a lot as an Apple issue, Apple has been very vocal about it, but the tariff lines that have been exempted, they applied to a whole range of companies in addition to Apple,\u201d the official said, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the trade battle with China would be resolved.When asked about the exemptions of Apple\u2019s products, Mr. Cook said that while the iPhone is assembled in China, many parts are made and developed in the United States. The tariffs would cost a company like Apple when it imports devices assembled in China.\u201cI think they looked at this and said that it\u2019s not really great for the United States to put a tariff on those type of products,\u201d Mr. Cook said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Nokia\u2019s headquarters. It is Finland, not Sweden.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It blamed violations of its abusive-behavior policy.Apple, Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube mostly barred Mr. Jones last month, for hate speech. Until now, Twitter had only temporarily suspended him, for comments that appeared to foment violence.A look back at months of critical presidential tweets, and their effect on stock prices, suggests that investors are shrugging off Mr. Trump\u2019s broadsides.

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Doesn\u2019t Like Trump. It Can Still Work With the Government.", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookAlex Karp grew up in a liberal household and considers himself a progressive. He voted for Hillary Clinton, and he lives and works in Silicon Valley.Yet Mr. Karp, the chief executive of Palantir, has found himself increasingly at odds with his peers in the technology industry as it publicly distances itself from the government, particularly the Department of Defense, under President Trump.Mr. Karp readily admits he would prefer that Mr. Trump didn\u2019t occupy the Oval Office. But he believes that Silicon Valley \u2014 already facing something of a crisis of user confidence over issues including privacy and foreign influence \u2014 is setting itself up for a fall.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very significant problem for the Valley,\u201d Mr. Karp, who rarely speaks publicly, said in an interview in his Manhattan office.\u201cI don\u2019t know how you stand up and talk to a Marine or a special operator and explain to them how you have a piece of software that will allow them to come home \u2014 or more likely allow them to come home \u2014 and you\u2019re not going to allow them to use it,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a nearly impossible argument to make outside the Valley without people being legitimately pretty upset.\u201dAll of this has set off a quiet \u2014 but growing \u2014 debate across corporate America in the age of Trump: What does it mean to be a patriotic company when you vehemently disagree with your nation\u2019s leader?In truth, the ethical arguments are a diversion. This is political.And there is a real danger in letting politics undermine the storied relationship between the government and Silicon Valley \u2014 Hewlett-Packard built sonar, radar and aviation equipment for the government during World War II, for example \u2014 that has led to much of the innovation we enjoy today.Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School and a member of the Defense Innovation Board, an independent federal advisory committee set up under President Barack Obama, said he believed that the partisanship that was contributing to the debate would ultimately stifle innovation.\u201cI worry that it will stall progress,\u201d he said. \u201cInnovation has been fueled for decades by private-public partnerships. It smacks of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Even if you\u2019re not a fan of the president, you can still serve your country.\u201dMr. Karp, whose parents met at a civil rights demonstration, said he believed that American companies, including those in Silicon Valley, had a moral obligation to support the country and its military, no matter who was living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201cWe\u2019re proud that we\u2019re working with the U.S. government,\u201d he said.Of course, Mr. Karp certainly has an interest in maintaining relationships between the government and the technology sector. Palantir, which uses technology to analyze vast troves of data, was founded with the help of $2 million from the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s venture capital arm, and much of its business model was to use data to help the government in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. But that makes his willingness to be so forthright about his view of the president refreshing when his peers who may have similar views stay quiet.\u201cI obviously am very biased,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a problem if I go to a cocktail party in Silicon Valley because they want to know, \u2018Is it true that your product is used to target terrorists?\u2019 Yes. And some people don\u2019t agree with that. That\u2019s fine, by the way. I don\u2019t expect everyone to agree with that.\u201dHis outspokenness is even more surprising given that a co-founder of Palantir is Peter Thiel, a serial entrepreneur who has publicly supported Mr. Trump.\u201cWe didn\u2019t vote for the same people,\u201d Mr. Karp said without hesitation. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to vote for the same people.\u201dStill, even if it is political allegiances that have prompted tech workers to push back, the ethical issues around artificial intelligence are not insignificant. Everyone from Elon Musk to Stephen Hawking has raised questions about technological warfare in the future. But we are still most likely decades away from those extreme kinds of worries being realized.Reid Hoffman, who founded LinkedIn and sold it to Microsoft, where he now sits on the board, said there were real worries about how the government would use powerful technologies like artificial intelligence.\u201cI think that the majority of Silicon Valley people have a strong worry/reflex against weapons,\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who is a member of the Defense Innovation Board with Mr. Grant. The Trump administration, he said, has \u201camplified\u201d concerns over \u201cpossible bad government action.\u201dBut Mr. Karp said claims that a president could steer us toward an authoritarian world powered by artificial intelligence were too extreme.\u201cAmerica is a complicated modern democracy with numerous checks and balances so that no one person has the ability to do insane things,\u201d Mr. Karp said. With government work, he added, \u201cyou\u2019re buying into the inherent fabric and structure of the country.\u201dLost in the conversation in Silicon Valley is its own history. The internet itself was originally funded by an arm of the Defense Department that is now called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. As recently as the Obama administration, Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest technology giants embraced roles advising the government.But there is a difference between today\u2019s tech giants like Google and Facebook and those who turned the Santa Clara Valley into Silicon Valley. A bond with the government \u201cwas clearly not part of the founding of the consumer internet in any relevant way,\u201d Mr. Karp said.It is a connection that should be better understood by the employees now pushing for it to be severed. Those bright minds are able to have this debate in part because of the work done by their predecessors.And given the very real questions that have emerged about the benefits \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 that the biggest tech companies truly offer society, those workers might want to rethink their position.As Mr. Karp pointed out when we talked about the big technology companies, \u201cIf actually the narrative was \u2018We are helping also with our defense,\u2019 then people would understand the value of these other things\u201d they do.There could come a time when Silicon Valley wishes it was waving that flag.Advertisement"}

She had a strict cutoff at noon, and we were leaving extra time for things to go wrong. We would be using Microsoft\u2019s new \u201cvolumetric capture\u201d technology \u2014 which deploys advanced computer algorithms to compress the nearly 10 gigabytes of information collected every second, and would help us give a new twist to the epithet \u201cnewspaper of record.\u201d Ashley, in this brief recorded sequence, would be endlessly available to be projected into the world.Long a staple of science fiction, the ability to beam somebody into your space in three dimensions (think receiving an urgent message from Leia in \u201cStar Wars\u201d), and walk around them as if they\u2019re actually there, is gradually becoming real.This is a new video format, with a new production process. Rather than record Ashley from just a few perspectives, she is captured from all angles using more than 100 cameras positioned around her on a stage that is essentially a giant green-screen in-the-round. The images from the cameras are then composited and processed together to create a single hologram that, when viewed through the screen on your phone or tablet, can be placed into your own physical environment. Joanna helped choose her as the subject of our first exploration of this new AR form. \u201cAshley has been a champion for body diversity and positivity for years. She was one of the first curvy women to be on the cover of Sports Illustrated,\u201d she explains. \u201cThis technology allows people to see a model in motion without the filters, the Photoshopping and the angles the fashion industry is used to.\u201dWhich is exactly the way Ashley wants it. \u201cYou see my lower belly fat, you might be seeing some cellulite, you see the curves of my arms and my butt. You\u2019re seeing all of it,\u201d she told Joanna during her interview. \u201cI\u2019m showing the real me. And I want other women to know that you can show the real you and the real you is perfect, the real you is beautiful.\u201dWe recorded Ashley Graham at Metastage, a brand new volumetric video studio in the Culver City Studios complex. \u201cHaving Ashley as one of our first captures was a testament to how far we\u2019ve come with female empowerment in business,\u201d said the studio\u2019s chief executive, Christina Heller. \u201cWe had a strong, vivacious supermodel performing on a state-of-the-art volumetric capture stage run by women. The energy was fun and inclusive, just like it should be.\u201dAs might be expected, the technology is not without its limitations at this early stage. The capture zone is confined to an 8-foot-diameter circular area, for instance, which required some creative problem solving \u2014 such as designing walk patterns that would fit and look natural in a small space. \u201cIt was like a math problem,\u201d Joanna noted. Before she even stepped onto the stage, we worked with Ashley on a piece of circular carpet outside the dressing room area, drawing patterns and arrows on paper as if planning a football play. We also needed to work within specific styling guidelines from the studio. No super-skinny stiletto heels, for example, and hair needed to be contained to a unified shape, as small flyaway strands are confusing to the capture system. While Ashley came with an entourage and stylist in tow, the studio has its own stylist, Harmony Arnold, who knows how to keep the algorithms from getting angry. When Ashley emerged with her hair styled down, it was deemed \u201crisky,\u201d and Harmony helped restyle it into something pulled back.There are new issues to contend with in the viewer experience as well, like controlling how close the viewer can get to the subject without violating her personal space. We\u2019ve solved this for now by having the hologram go transparent once a certain threshold of closeness is crossed.Our last shoot of the day was our most treacherous, and potentially ankle-twisting. We\u2019d asked Ashley to walk on a special rail-free treadmill to create a walk cycle, and out of concern for her safety suggested she try it barefoot, which she did. Then, unfazed, she insisted she could do the treadmill walk in heels. With that, it was a wrap. Shoes already on, Ashley was off to the airport for her next shoot.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Enforcement Officials Confront Tech Companies\u2019 Power", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Top Justice Department officials met with 14 state attorneys general on Tuesday to weigh whether they have the right tools to confront privacy and competition concerns surrounding Facebook, Google and other tech companies that have amassed extraordinary amounts of data about their consumers and advertising markets.Americans increasingly recognize that tech companies wield tremendous power and deserve greater scrutiny, the law enforcement officials said, and they discussed whether traditional approaches to antitrust issues were still suitable for modern disputes over privacy and the tech business model.Xavier Becerra, the attorney general of California, cautioned against comparisons to landmark antitrust cases. \u201cMost would agree, this is not Standard Oil, this is not even Microsoft,\u201d he said. But, he added, \u201call of those situations inform you.\u201dThe Justice Department called the conversation productive, though no decisions were made or announced. The meeting, largely a forum for officials to share ideas, sharply contrasted with Monday\u2019s chaos at the Justice Department over the confusion of whether Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, would leave the job.He attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting, sitting alongside Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the acting associate attorney general, Jesse Panuccio, the department\u2019s No. 3 official. The head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, and the acting head of the civil rights division, John M. Gore, also attended.Three major issues were broached: the tech business model, which is based on accumulating consumer data; privacy; and user terms and conditions, according to people in the room.Google came up more than other companies, according to a person in the room who was not authorized to publicly describe the discussion and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A few attorneys general expressed concern about Google\u2019s ability to track, in a granular way, the everyday routines of people.Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, was set to meet with lawmakers in Washington on Friday, including Republicans who plan to ask him about the company\u2019s competitive practices; its work with countries accused of human rights abuses, like China and Russia; and whether its workers and search engine magnify biases.\u201cGoogle has a lot of questions to answer about reports of bias in its search results, violations of user privacy, anticompetitive behavior and business dealings with repressive regimes like China,\u201d the House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, said in a statement.Technology companies mine consumer behavior online for data, which they then sell on an open marketplace much in the same way that a company might sell oil. A handful of large companies control and sell the vast majority of that data.The conversation was originally billed by the Justice Department as a way to address free speech issues, as well as competitive concerns. Before it was announced, Mr. Trump, whose Twitter account is perhaps his core communications platform, amplified claims that tech and social media companies try to suppress conservative voices and opinions.But the law enforcement officials touched only briefly on whether the companies were politically biased or suppressing the free flow of ideas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon\u2019s Antitrust Antagonist Has a Breakthrough Idea", "Date": "2018-09-07", "News": "With a single scholarly article, Lina Khan, 29, has reframed decades of monopoly law.Supported by\u201cAntitrust Dilemma.\u201d \u201cThe Antitrust Impulse.\u201d \u201cAntitrust in an Expanding Economy.\u201d Shelf after shelf of volumes ignored for decades. There are a dozen fat tomes with transcripts of the congressional hearings on monopoly power in 1949, when the world was in ruins and the Soviets on the march. Lawmakers believed economic concentration would make America more vulnerable.At the end of the antitrust stacks is a table near the window. \u201cThis is my command post,\u201d said Lina Khan.It\u2019s nothing, really. A few books are piled up haphazardly next to a bottle with water and another with tea. Ms. Khan was in Dallas quite a bit over the last year, refining an argument about monopoly power that takes aim at one of the most admired, secretive and feared companies of our era: Amazon.If competitors tremble at Amazon\u2019s ambitions, consumers are mostly delighted by its speedy delivery and low prices. They stream its Oscar-winning movies and clamor for the company to build a second headquarters in their hometowns. Few of Amazon\u2019s customers, it is safe to say, spend much time thinking they need to be protected from it.Amazon has more revenue than Facebook, Google and Twitter put together, but it has largely escaped sustained examination. That is beginning to change, and one significant reason is Ms. Khan.Ms. Khan disagreed. Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, she presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the economy.Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: \u201cThe thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon\u2019s rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.\u201dThe paper got 146,255 hits, a runaway best-seller in the world of legal treatises. That popularity has rocked the antitrust establishment, and is making an unlikely celebrity of Ms. Khan in the corridors of Washington.She has her own critics now: Several leading scholars have found fault with Ms. Khan\u2019s proposals to revive and expand antitrust, and some have tried to dismiss her paper with the mocking label \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201d Unwilling or perhaps unable to accept that a woman wrote a breakthrough legal text, they keep talking about bearded dudes.\u201cAs consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.\u201dAt the S.M.U. library in Dallas, Ms. Khan was finding that vocabulary. These dead books, many from an era that predated the price-based era of monopoly law, were an influence and an inspiration. She was planning to expand her essay into a book, she said in an interview here in June.Then her life shifted, and she abruptly went from an outsider proposing reform to an insider formulating policy. Rohit Chopra, a new Democratic commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, pulled her in as a temporary adviser in July, at a time when urgent questions about privacy, data, competition and antitrust were suddenly in the air. The F.T.C. is holding a series of hearings this fall, the first of their type since 1995, on whether a changing economy requires changing enforcement attitudes.\u201cIdeas and assumptions that it was heretical to question are now openly being contested,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it.\u201dGenuinely original voices are rare in Washington policy circles, and Mr. Chopra is pleased to have Ms. Khan in his camp. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to come across a legal prodigy like Lina Khan,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing about her career is typical. You don\u2019t see many law students publish groundbreaking legal research, or research that had such a deep impact so quickly.\u201d\u201cIt takes time to crush men who are pursuing legitimate trade. But one of Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s most impressive characteristics is patience. \u2026 He was like a general who, besieging a city surrounded by fortified hills, views from a balloon the whole great field, and sees how, this point taken, that must fall; this hill reached, that fort is commanded. And nothing was too small: the corner grocery in Browntown, the humble refining still on Oil Creek, the shortest private pipeline. Nothing, for little things grow.\u201dWhen Ms. Khan read that, she thought: Jeff Bezos.Her Yale Law Journal paper argued that monopoly regulators who focus on consumer prices are thinking too short-term. In Ms. Khan\u2019s view, a company like Amazon \u2014 one that sells things, competes against others selling things, and owns the platform where the deals are done \u2014 has an inherent advantage that undermines fair competition.\u201cThe long-term interests of consumers include product quality, variety and innovation \u2014 factors best promoted through both a robust competitive process and open markets,\u201d she wrote.The issue Ms. Khan\u2019s article really brought to the fore is this: Do we trust Amazon, or any large company, to create our future? In think tanks and universities, the battle has been joined.\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that antitrust enforcement has gotten far too weak,\u201d said Daniel Crane, a University of Michigan scholar who doesn\u2019t agree with Ms. Khan but credits her with opening up a much-needed debate. \u201cIt\u2019s a bridge much further to say we should go back to the populist goal of leveling playing fields and checking \u2018bigness.\u2019 \u201dThe analogies with Amazon are explicit. Don\u2019t let the government pursue Amazon the way it pursued A.&P., Mr. Muris and Mr. Nuechterlein warned.\u201cAmazon has added hundreds of billions of dollars of value to the U.S. economy,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is a brilliant innovator\u201d whose \u201cbreakthroughs have in turn helped launch new waves of innovation across retail and technology sectors, to the great benefit of consumers.\u201dAmazon itself could not have made the argument any better. Which isn\u2019t surprising, because in a footnote on the first page, the authors noted: \u201cWe approached Amazon Inc. for funding to tell the story\u201d of A.&P., \u201cand we gratefully acknowledge its support.\u201d They added at the end of footnote 85: \u201cThe authors have advised Amazon on a variety of antitrust issues.\u201dAmazon declined to say how much its support came to in dollars. It also declined to comment on Ms. Khan or her paper directly, but issued a statement.\u201cWe operate in a diverse range of businesses, from retail and entertainment to consumer electronics and technology services, and we have intense and well-established competition in each of these areas,\u201d the company said. \u201cRetail is our largest business today and we represent less than 1 percent of global retail.\u201dHer father was a management consultant; her mother an executive in information services. Ms. Khan went to Williams College, where she wrote a thesis on the political philosopher Hannah Arendt. She was the editor of the student paper but worked hard at everything.\u201cWe were routinely emailing each other on separate floors of the library as it was closing at 2 a.m.,\u201d said Amanda Korman, a classmate.Like many a wonkish youth, Ms. Khan headed to Washington after graduating in 2010, applying for a position at the left-leaning New America Foundation. Barry Lynn, who headed the organization\u2019s Open Markets antimonopoly initiative, seized on her application. \u201cIt\u2019s so much easier to teach public policy to people who already know how to write than teach writing to public policy experts,\u201d said Mr. Lynn, a former journalist.Ms. Khan wrote about industry consolidation and monopolistic practices for Washington publications that specialize in policy, went to Yale Law School, published her Amazon paper and then came back to Washington last year, just as interest was starting to swell in her work.\u201cPolls show huge concerns about concentrated power, corporate power, but if people are asked, \u2018Do we have a monopoly problem?\u2019 they answer, \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 \u201d said Mr. Lynn. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the language for it.\u201d\u201cThe whole country has been struggling to understand why the economy is not operating in the right way,\u201d Mr. Cicilline said. \u201cWages have remained stagnant. Workers have less and less power. All we\u2019re trying to do is create a level playing field, and that\u2019s harder when you have megacompanies that make it virtually impossible for small competitors.\u201d He added, \u201cWe\u2019re at the very beginning of solutions to this.\u201dSomewhere in the midst of all this, Ms. Khan found the time to marry Shah Ali, a doctor now doing a cardiology fellowship in Dallas, which explains why she was camping out at the S.M.U. law library. The honeymoon was in Hawaii. Dr. Ali took Jane Austen\u2019s \u201cPersuasion,\u201d because he hadn\u2019t reread it in a while. Ms. Khan brought a book on corporations and American democracy.The battle for intellectual supremacy takes place less these days in learned journals and more on social media, where tongues are sharp and branding is all. This is not Ms. Khan\u2019s strong suit. She is always polite, even on Twitter. One consequence is that she didn\u2019t give much thought about what to call the movement to reboot antitrust. Neither did anyone else.\u201cAntitrust Hipsterism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEverything old is cool again.\u201dMr. Medvedovsky, who calls Ms. Khan\u2019s article \u201cthe face of this movement,\u201d said the term was designed to be \u201cplayful rather than pejorative.\u201dAdmirers of Ms. Khan and her fellow reformers have sometimes called them the New Brandeis School or the New Brandeisians, after Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era foe of big business. As brands go, these are somewhat less catchy than \u201cHipster Antitrust.\u201dThe Hipster issue was sponsored by Facebook, another sign that Big Tech is striving to shape the monopoly-law debate. The company declined to comment.Things are moving fast, so there is a lot to write papers about.Contemporary antitrust regulation, the commissioner wrote, is conducted in the courts, which makes it numbingly slow and dependent on high-paid expert witnesses. He called for the agency to use its authority to issue rules that would \u201cadvance clarity and certainty\u201d about what is, and what is not, an unfair method of competition.These rules would not be \u201csome inflexible prescription\u201d but standards, guidelines, pointers or presumptions, he wrote. Since everyone affected by a proposed rule would have the opportunity to weigh in on it, the process would be more democratic.There is more than an echo here of Ms. Khan\u2019s notion that the past can help rescue the future.\u201cThese are new technologies and new business models,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cThe remedy is new thinking that is informed by traditional principles.\u201dMs. Khan was not the first to criticize Amazon, and she said the company was not really her target anyway. \u201cAmazon is not the problem \u2014 the state of the law is the problem, and Amazon depicts that in an elegant way,\u201d she said.From Amazon\u2019s point of view, however, it is a problem indeed that Ms. Khan concludes in the Yale paper that regulating parts of the company like a utility \u201ccould make sense.\u201d She also said it \u201ccould make sense\u201d to treat Amazon\u2019s e-commerce operation like a bridge, highway, port, power grid or telephone network \u2014 all of which are required to allow access to their infrastructure on a nondiscriminatory basis.Ms. Khan put those ideas out there, which is how Rachel Tsuna found them.Last fall, the Barnard College senior was casting about for a subject for her senior thesis. \u201cWhat is really interesting to you?\u201d her adviser asked. Ms. Tsuna, now 22, had worked for a chewing gum start-up \u2014 yes, there are such things \u2014 that sold through Amazon, and knew firsthand the retailer\u2019s tight grip. \u201cAmazon is scary!\u201d she exclaimed.This impulsive declaration suggested a topic: Did the F.T.C. have the grounds to move against Amazon? Ms. Tsuna made little progress until she came across Ms. Khan\u2019s paper.\u201cI finally felt like I was pursuing something valid,\u201d Ms. Tsuna said. \u201cLina Khan gave me the confidence I needed.\u201d The thesis, which is quite fair to Amazon, got an A minus.That\u2019s the way movements begin. Little things grow.\u201cThis is a moment in time that invites a movement,\u201d said Ms. Khan. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than antitrust, bigger than Big Tech. It\u2019s about whether the laws serve democratic ends.\u201dIt was late at night in late July, and she was eating a burrata concoction at a popular restaurant near the Washington apartment she uses when not in Texas with her husband. After the death of Judge Reinhardt, her options opened up. She had the Columbia fellowship. Maybe she would also write the book. Or go back to the F.T.C. full time. Or somehow do it all.\u201cAmazon is a monopoly, and I worry that it monopolizes Lina,\u201d said her husband, Dr. Ali. \u201cI learn about what she is doing from looking at her Twitter feed.\u201d\u201cI throw myself into things,\u201d Ms. Khan agreed. \u201cMy life is spread out now.\u201dWith some cajoling, she revealed her Amazon account. There were just three purchases in 18 months. An altimeter for her father, who has taken up hiking, is the only one she will agree to have mentioned, although the other two are incredibly benign. One attribute Ms. Khan shares with Amazon is a strong desire to control the flow of information.Balancing the attention and the achievement, the expectations and the demands, is difficult, perhaps impossible.\u201cI don\u2019t think of my work in grandiose terms. I feel an urgency but I\u2019m also wary of hubris,\u201d Ms. Khan said. \u201cNobody has been expecting this to succeed. I\u2019m awed by the challenge.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Metamorphosis of Silicon Valley C.E.O.s: From Big to Boring", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the Art\u201cI don\u2019t know what a Twitter C.E.O. should look like,\u201d Mr. Barton said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look like what a C.E.O. of Twitter should look like.\u201dThe congressman had a point. Mr. Dorsey \u2014 who sported a nose ring, a popped-collar shirt and a craggy Moses beard \u2014 looked more like a hipster version of a Civil War officer than a tech icon. Yet more striking than his look was his manner before skeptical lawmakers.Faced with tough questions, Mr. Dorsey did not mount an aggressive defense of his company and his technology, as an earlier generation of tech leader might have. Instead, he demurred, conceded mistakes and generally engaged in a nuanced and seemingly heartfelt colloquy on the difficulties of managing tech in a complex world. Even in response to Mr. Barton\u2019s comment about his look, Mr. Dorsey was solicitous. \u201cMy mom agrees with you,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony prompted questions about what we expect from tech leaders today \u2014 and how thoroughly what we expect has been upturned in the last few years. Since the 1980s, a common leadership archetype has loomed over the tech business: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Sometimes unconsciously and often deliberately, a generation of tech leaders attempted to ape the Apple and Microsoft founders\u2019 charisma, their quirks, their style and above all their irrepressible, hard-charging confidence, to say nothing of arrogance.That is, Mr. Dorsey sounded less like a quotable visionary who can see beyond the horizon and more like what he actually is and ought to be \u2014 a thoughtful, accessible, transparent and, despite the beard and nose ring, kind of boring manager of a serious company whose decisions have world-changing consequences.When it comes to tech C.E.O.s, boring is the new black. Under the glare of global scrutiny, the daring, win-at-all-costs ethos that defined so much of the tech industry in the last couple of decades has been undergoing a thorough metamorphosis.Google once played up the nerdy antics of its founders, but now the company\u2019s leaders are almost unidentifiable ciphers. Larry Page, who runs Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has become a recluse, and even Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s achingly pleasant chief, declined to appear at last week\u2019s hearings.Oh, and I almost forgot about Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O. In my defense, everyone forgets about Mr. Nadella.\u201cA start-up that has five million people using it \u2014 that\u2019s small for Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s a tremendous number of people, and so even they have a large amount of responsibility in the world,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.The tech press has also gotten tougher. Once, novelty alone would merit coverage, but in the social media age, even the tiniest misstep can be ruinous. It has become crucial to get a leader who doesn\u2019t speak out of turn.Mr. Musk\u2019s odd behavior underlines the tensions at play as understated style takes over tech. There is a reason that a big, Jobsian personality was once so prized. Tech companies are leaps of faith. In their early days they exist on the knife edge of oblivion, and it is often only through a founder\u2019s force of personality that investors, employees and the media take any notice. The most beloved founders possess an uncanny genius for selling the world on ideas that look useless, pointless or impossible before we all realize we can never live without them.Though he has made good on only some of those points \u2014 Tesla is now struggling to fulfill orders for the Model 3, the \u201ceven more affordable\u201d car in the plan \u2014 posting the plan was part of an impish ploy to generate publicity for what looked like an outlandish idea. That ploy worked; ever since, Mr. Musk has leveraged his growing celebrity as if it were a currency.Every few months, he makes new promises about this or that amazing thing coming soon. Each time, he reaps more attention and financing and, eventually, builds real cars that are sold to real people. In this way, Mr. Musk\u2019s personality became a key element of not just his companies\u2019 brands, but their business models.But it\u2019s a tricky, high-stakes gamble. For one thing, Mr. Musk has to deliver on his promises. More recently, another problem has eaten at this strategy: The future has been getting less obviously wonderful, so it\u2019s hard to take any tech chief\u2019s assurances that their new thing will indeed be as great for the world as they say.\u201cI tried to convince people to slow down A.I.,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cThis was futile. I tried for many years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.\u201dThus, the tension: On one hand, Mr. Musk wants us to believe that everything he\u2019s building is going to turn out wonderfully. On the other, he\u2019s telling us to be very scared. This sounds like a contradiction, but in its admission of doubt and complexity, it\u2019s actually a pretty good picture of the future.No wonder he sounds crazy. No wonder everyone else is going for boring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retooling the Met Opera\u2019s Problematic \u2018Ring\u2019 Machine", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne morning in August, Peter Gelb settled into a seat in the nearly empty auditorium of the Metropolitan Opera, where he is general manager, and waited for a run-through of Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d to begin.The storm depicted in the prelude silently took shape onstage, with a huge array of upright planks forming a forest of trees. Video projections buffeted the set with swirling snow. Then the planks shifted, morphing seamlessly to form the inside of a forest dwelling.The \u201cmachine\u201d is back. And, after spending months in the shop, it should be ready to go for another spin this spring, Met officials hope.As opera-lovers know, the machine is the mammoth and ambitious \u2014 but also notoriously noisy and glitch-prone \u2014 centerpiece of Robert Lepage\u2019s high-tech production of Wagner\u2019s epic \u201cRing\u201d cycle. When it worked, it could be mind-blowing: The 45-ton set of narrow planks rotated into sculptural sets bathed in vivid video imagery, taking operagoers from the depths of the Rhine to the downfall of the gods over the course of four operas.But first Mr. Gelb sought to tame its gremlins \u2014 to make sure it could run smoothly and quietly, so its creaks would no longer risk drowning out the Wagner tubas.Here is a look at how the Met quieted and retooled its machine \u2014 first over the course of several months in a cavernous soundstage in Middletown, N.Y., more than 65 miles north of the opera house, then this summer during tech rehearsals on the Met stage.Mythical tools play many roles in the \u201cRing\u201d cycle.The Tarnhelm, a dwarf-made magic helmet, allows its wearer to disappear or change shape at will. Nothung, a mystically powerful sword, presents itself in hours of dire need, and proves ideal for dragon slaying. The spear of Wotan, the king of the gods, enforces contracts (which could prove useful in an opera house when it comes to capricious stars). Then there\u2019s that ring everyone is after, which brings measureless might to those who renounce love.Now the Met is pinning its hopes on another bit of hardware: its new custom-fabricated hydraulic wrench.The wrench is the Met\u2019s secret weapon against the annoying clicking sound that could often be heard in past \u201cRing\u201d performances. The machine has 24 rotating planks that spin around a long center axis stretching the width of the Met\u2019s stage. The axis is so long that it had to be built in three sections so it could fit on the trucks that take it to and from the opera house; they were then bolted together. But as the planks spun around the axis, they gradually loosened the custom-made 4.5-inch nuts and bolts that held it together. The result? \u201cClick, click.\u201dEngineers devised a pattern for tightening the nuts \u2014 similar to way lug nuts are tightened in order on cars \u2014 and recommended more tension, enough to require a hydraulic wrench. So, the Met had one custom-made to tighten its custom-made bolts.\u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is that the axis can withstand the trials and tribulations of the machine a lot better than with what we were using before, which was hand wrenches,\u201d Jeff Mace, the Met\u2019s director of production operations, said backstage in August. \u201cInstead of relying on as much strength as the guy can throw on the wrench, we can dial it in to 900 foot-pounds of torque exactly.\u201dThey are finding fewer clicks.When the giant planks spun into new positions \u2014 moving swiftly, say, to transform from the forest where the young hero Siegmund is being hunted to the fateful house where he seeks shelter \u2014 a whooshing sound could sometimes be heard. Officials -dubbed it the \u201crainstick effect.\u201dMr. Mace said that the problem was created by cascading bits of metal slag that had accumulated inside the hollow planks when the set builders had drilled holes into them to attach their coverings.\u201cThe \u2018rainstick effect\u2019 was all of those little bits of slag, from thousands of holes, making really the most beautiful, ethereal noise,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not in the score, so it\u2019s got to go.\u201dThe solution? Glue. Stagehands shook the planks to gather the slag at the bottom, drilled new holes into them, and sprayed in glue to try to keep all the tiny pieces of metal stuck firmly in one place.The 45-ton machine was so heavy that the Met had to reinforce its stage to bear the weight. The axis that the planks rotate around is suspended between two 26-foot towers, which can raise and lower it. A combination of hydraulics, pneumatics, gravity and plain old muscle power \u2014 sometimes the planks are moved with ropers, as if they were puppets \u2014 powers the machine.But the largest rotations had a habit of making a deep, unsettling \u201cclunk\u201d noise. \u201cThe entire machine structure shifts its weight, radically, and that used to cause this big clunking noise,\u201d Mr. Gelb explained.To fix it, Mr. Mace said, the Met installed shims to restrict the freedom of movement within the two towers, eliminating the clunks during weight shifts. The company also refurbished the mechanical elements, installing a new metal chain, wheels and pulleys \u2014 lubricating it all carefully. No, not with WD-40: The Met used red lithium grease.When Mr. Lepage first began unveiling his high-tech \u201cRing\u201d operas, Apple had only recently released the iPhone 4. Technology \u2014 from smartphones to the stage \u2014 has changed quite a bit since then. So in some areas the \u201cRing\u201d is updating.Many of the worst mishaps in the early outings of the cycle stemmed from a bug in the control system originally used to operate the machine. Mr. Mace, who was at the house for many of the performances \u2014 he called the night of the frozen rainbow bridge \u201cone of the worst nights of my career\u201d \u2014 said that every once in a while the old system would simply take too long to do its calculations, then stop.\u201cAll of this stuff fails safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019d have a stop, and you would have to reset manually.\u201dNow the Met is using its new house computer system to control the machine, which is faster, better integrated with the company\u2019s other technical systems, and much easier to control. That, officials believe, will improve reliability and create a safer environment. (The acrobats used as body doubles in the production are getting an upgrade, too: The cables that pull them up the planks will now be tugged by power winches instead of the old hand-cranked winches.)But in some areas, the Met found, the Lepage \u201cRing\u201d was still at the vanguard \u2014 especially with its video. After determining that new video technologies were unlikely to surpass or even match some of the effects created in the production \u2014 especially the depth and three-dimensionality of \u201cSiegfried\u201d \u2014 the Met decided to reinvest in its original video system, refurbishing the hardware to keep it running.For all the Met\u2019s efforts, the Lepage \u201cRing\u201d is still dauntingly complex, its idiosyncrasies difficult to control. As Mr. Gelb looked on at that recent technical run-through of \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d last month, a low, worrisome rumbling noise emerged from the stage as things got underway. Mr. Gelb turned to John Sellars, the Met\u2019s assistant general manager for production, to ask what had happened. Mr. Sellars explained that the sounds had come from a rolling platform.\u201cBut that\u2019s something that is easily fixed,\u201d Mr. Gelb said.Mr. Sellars said, \u201cIt\u2019s something we have to contend with, certainly.\u201d They discussed various strategies to ease and quiet its path across the stage.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moving parts,\u201d Mr. Sellars said, as the planks turned again.Advertisement"}

Each also identified a female employee in a STEM field to be featured in the campaign, alongside women who work at Boeing and the Adler Planetarium in Chicago.The centerpiece of the campaign are videos in which the seven women discuss with girls (actresses with an interest in STEM subjects) what they do professionally and what the opportunities are. The professionals are also featured on the campaign\u2019s website, SheCanStem.com, and in individual profiles on Instagram and in more traditional media.The women featured in the campaign, or their employers, will post photos of them taken when they were girls, with a note that says, \u201cIf she can STEM, so can you.\u201d The Ad Council will also encourage women in all STEM fields to do the same.Girls will also be directed to @SheCanSTEM on Instagram, where they can find information on other women working in STEM fields and on resources from the campaign\u2019s corporate and nonprofit partners. The campaign\u2019s website also will contain information for parents and teachers.Others involved with the campaign include Karina Garcia, the YouTube star known as the Slime Queen; the Disney actress Olivia Rodrigo; Alyssa Carson, a space enthusiast and astronaut hopeful; and Mari Takahashi of the YouTube channel Smosh Games. Nonprofit partners include the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., Black Girls Code, ChickTech, Girls Who Code and the Society of Women Engineers.According to research by the Department of Commerce, women make up half of the college-educated work force in the United States but only 25 percent of the STEM work force. Studies by the Girl Scout Research Institute and National Center for Education Statistics show that many girls begin losing interest in STEM subjects when they are in middle school, a path that continues in high school and college.Linda Boff, chairwoman of the Ad Council and chief marketing officer of General Electric, said it was \u201cimportant to get the attention of young girls and inspire them through real STEM role models they can relate to.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about inspiration \u2014 it\u2019s about insight,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you show young girls women who have achieved in STEM, hopefully you\u2019re showing them the pathway.\u201dG.E. has been involved in numerous initiatives to encourage girls\u2019 interest in STEM, including a summer program for girls in the United States and other countries; educational programs in Boston, where its headquarters moved in 2016; and its \u201cUnseen Stars\u201d project, which projected the faces of 12 female scientists and engineers on the constellations painted on Grand Central Terminal\u2019s ceiling last September.The Ad Council\u2019s message to girls \u201ccould have a big effect,\u201d said Amy Fitzgerald, the outreach coordinator at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Edgerton Center. The center, which is supported by G.E., provides educational resources for M.I.T. students, faculty and staff, as well as for students and teachers in kindergarten through grade 12.It is vital that the campaign features \u201cmechanical engineers, aviation engineers, women who get their hands dirty, not just in research-lab-coaty positions,\u201d Ms. Fitzgerald said. \u201cI want to see hard hats. Girls, especially, do not have an idea of the range of possibilities.\u201dThe Ad Council is not the only organization trying to raise the consciousness of young girls about STEM. In June, Mattel introduced a robotics engineer Barbie and joined forces with Tynker, a game-based platform that teaches kids how to code, to offer Barbie-inspired coding lessons.In addition, in the past few years, the Girl Scouts organization, which has offered STEM-related programming for over a century, has introduced new programs in space science and exploration, cybersecurity, mechanical engineering, robotics and computer science.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is This the End of Governors Island?", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAfter a long, steamy summer, the weather was starting to change on Governors Island. A wind had kicked up and it looked as if it might rain, dark clouds loitering on the horizon and threatening to ruin the coming weekend\u2019s OctFest. (Held, despite its name, in September.) Beer trucks, ice trucks and all kinds of vehicles were making their way onto the famously vehicle-free island for the second annual beer and music festival.Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen was in a golf cart with Michael Samuelian, president of the Trust for Governors Island, giving a tour of what the future might hold for Manhattan\u2019s largest redevelopment site. A few weeks earlier, Mayor Bill de Blasio had announced the opening of the public review process, kicking off New York City\u2019s plan to rezone 4.5 million square feet on the island for mixed use to attract new tenants and builders.Artists, waterfront advocates and general lovers of the island had heard the news and were already worried, planning to attend the first of several public meetings to ensure the city doesn\u2019t ruin one of its last undeveloped tracts. But Ms. Glen shook it off.\u201cIt\u2019s New York,\u201d said the deputy mayor, whose specialty is housing and economic development. \u201cEverybody freaks out about everything.\u201dIn the golf cart, Ms. Glen took the lead in the narrative as she and the much more low-key Mr. Samuelian drove along empty paths past deserted historic buildings. Ms. Glen grew up in a family of civil servants on the far Upper West Side (her mom was a State Supreme Court justice and her dad worked for Mayor Edward I. Koch), and Mr. Samuelian was raised in Bensonhurst, getting his start on the stage crew at Edward R. Murrow High School.They pointed out three buildings that will, if all goes to plan, be home to an Italian day spa by 2020. They zipped past the abandoned hospital built in 1917 during the island\u2019s military days, where countless Army brats, including the Smothers Brothers, were born. It\u2019s said to be one of two haunted spots on the island. (The other is the South Battery Building, with its darkened ballroom and its Amityville Horror windows staring out onto the Buttermilk Channel.)When she looks at the hospital, Ms. Glen doesn\u2019t see dead people; she envisions a boutique hotel. In place of the new luxury glamping site dotted with white tents may rise a bigger, more permanent hotel and a \u201creally cool\u201d convention center.New York already has a convention site, the Javits Center, but Ms. Glen is no fan. \u201cIf you were Steve Jobs, would you have ever launched a product at the Javits Center? I don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t really inspire innovation and coolness.\u201dThough very few people were milling about this weekday morning, Ms. Glen could practically see the ghosts of Governors Island Future. She could envision its skyline \u2014 a single 30-story building next to a bunch of smaller buildings of 10 stories or so, smiling New Yorkers going to work, enjoying the park and the looming Manhattan skyline just 800 yards away. On the other end of the island, she said, maybe a university or some other research institute could find a home. An act of Congress would be needed to change the deed on the property, so apartment buildings are not in the island\u2019s future. Still, Ms. Glen could picture the state-of-the art gondola that would shuttle commuters back and forth to Manhattan.\u201cThis is a nice piece of real estate,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we want more people to enjoy it, and we want all these uses to work together.\u201d Things, she added, cost money. The island\u2019s operating budget for 2019 is $20.6 million, with the city picking up 80 percent of the cost. \u201cArtists and poets are usually not so great about what it costs to run a ferry and get freight on and off the island and keep the lights on,\u201d Ms. Glen said. \u201cWe have to balance these things.\u201dBalance is the operative word. Governors Island is at a tipping point; after years of conjecture and big dreams, development seems imminent. But what lands here is anybody\u2019s guess \u2014 and everyone\u2019s dream.Ever since 1637, when a Dutch governor bought the island \u2014 known as Nut Island \u2014 from two Native Americans for two ax heads, a string of beads and handful of nails, settlers have been trying to make a go of it. An Army post was established in 1783, then Castle Williams and Fort Jay were built, and eventually the Coast Guard took over in the mid-1960s. In 1995, after the Coast Guard announced it was moving out, the federal government sold the island to New York for $1 \u2014 not much more than that initial investment of ax heads, beads and nails.But over the past two decades, big plans have been pitched again and again, only to be dashed. Because of a Catch-22 in its deed restrictions and city zoning \u2014 the deed handed over by the federal government forbids residential development, though the island is mostly zoned for housing \u2014 long-term development has been impossible. But that didn\u2019t stop the dreamers.Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani suggested a Monaco-like \u201chigh class\u201d casino. Donald J. Trump, long before he was president, said the island should be a combination of hotels, housing, recreation and entertainment; in an interview about the Coast Guard leaving back in 1995, Mr. Trump envisioned the island \u201cconverted into a total and unbelievable experience.\u201d The developer Richard LeFrak, quoted for that same article, said \u201can exclusive island enclave arrived at by ferry sounds very delicious.\u201dA soccer stadium, a free-trade zone, a red-light district, a Sponge-Bob-themed hotel, a golf course, a prison and an amusement park have all been floated. Nut Island, indeed.But it\u2019s not until now, with the zoning changes and Mayor de Blasio throwing down the development gauntlet, that something may actually be built. Over the next year the city will hold a series of public meetings to discuss the rezoning of Governors Island. By 2020, the administration hopes to open the island to development proposals.\u201cWe want to dispel the myth that we\u2019re plopping spaceships down here,\u201d Ms. Glen said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite the contrary. This is all parkland and productivity. And isn\u2019t it a little sad that no one\u2019s here today?\u201dThat depends on whom you ask. Some fans \u2014 mostly longtime visitors who discovered the island early on \u2014 are happy that many of its 52 historic buildings sit empty. Pioneers look back fondly on the days when the island was undiscovered, a wild, slightly creepy place in the middle of the harbor that most New Yorkers simply ignored.The writer Gabriel Cohen, who went to the island to research his crime novel, \u201cThe Graving Dock,\u201d back when it first opened to civilians in 2005, remembers the remnants of the Coast Guard era: the bowling alley, the Burger King, the schools, the movie theater \u2014 all hastily abandoned like Pompeii. \u201cMost New Yorkers were not aware of this place,\u201d he said. \u201cThey saw this strange island out there and wondered what it was.\u201dAntony Zito and Jack Robinson, co-founders of 4heads, running an art fair on the island for the past decade, reminisced about the rundown nature of the place when they first arrived. \u201cIt was cool,\u201d Mr. Zito said, wistfully. \u201cIt looked like a postapocalyptic film scenario.\u201d During their first art fair, a security guard came by and announced there were a whopping 12 visitors.Leslie Koch, who had worked for years in education and at Microsoft, was appointed in 2006 by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to lure more visitors to the island, and in 2010 was made head of the Trust for Governors Island. Under her quirky watch, this strange, deserted place slowly revealed itself to a few New Yorkers, mostly those looking for peace and quiet. Ms. Koch curated and oversaw it all by bike, pedaling from one end of the island to the other.Merritt Birnbaum, who leads the Friends of Governors Island, the fund-raising nonprofit that shares a building with the Trust, said the island was never really for tourists, who usually come to New York for the crowds and excitement. \u201cWe in New York City crave this open space and this disconnection,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who come as tourists already have that. They want to see Times Square.\u201dThe ferry and bicycle rentals were free at first, to encourage the public to come and enjoy the green space and open sky. No cars were allowed, so there was no traffic. Parents came with their kids to ride bikes around the 172 acres, to play mini-golf, to make art in tents and get a fantastic view of the Statue of Liberty. The island was open only on weekends and only in summer. And except for a few concert dates, it was never open at night.To draw more people into the orbit, music events like the Black and White festival were held, as well as one infamous M.I.A. concert that was interrupted by a thunderstorm, and Governors Ball, which moved to Randalls Island after just one year.\u201cLeslie saw that wasn\u2019t going to add anything,\u201d said David Koren, the founder of the Figment public art project, which helped bring some of the first visitors and set up the funky miniature golf course. \u201cIt might be a big check, but it was not going to build the culture. It was going to chase some people away.\u201dSummer attractions included a Dutch festival, a French carnival with antique rides, and the Jazz Age Lawn Party, which still takes up residence twice a year on Colonels Row. Under Ms. Koch, the New York Harbor School, a public high school specializing in scuba diving, oyster farming and other water-related studies, found its home in an old converted barracks. But her greatest achievement was probably the Hills, a park rising 70 feet above sea level, built on landfill made from demolished buildings and old subway cars.In the last few years, people started coming in droves. More ferries were added. And things started to change. As Yogi Berra once said: \u201cNobody goes there anymore. It\u2019s too crowded.\u201dThat first summer in 2005, a total of 8,000 people came to visit. This past year, there were 800,000.In February 2016, Mr. de Blasio, in his state of the city address, declared that the island would be \u201cactivated\u201d and turned into a year-round destination for New Yorkers. A few months later, Ms. Koch stepped down and was replaced by Mr. Samuelian, a real estate developer who is best known for his planning of the Hudson Yards project in Manhattan.Under the mayor\u2019s mandate, Mr. Samuelian is trying to pay for daily operations and the maintenance of the historic district through high-priced events and a new restaurant. Luxury glamping, with tents rented for as much as $850 a night, was added this year in the western development zone.The island\u2019s season was extended to six months and seven days a week. Weekend nights were added. OctFest, featuring live bands, gourmet food and 250 craft beers, as well as Pinknic, a ros\u00e9 wine and dance music festival, have thrived.Mr. Cohen, the crime writer, accidentally stumbled upon the Pinknic festival two summers ago, and said he was horrified by what he found \u2014 much more so than he was by the spooky empty buildings years ago. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know this existed,\u201d he said of the festival. \u201cBut suddenly, there was this thump, thump, thump and people dressed in pink and white, drunk out of their minds, vomiting. I said, this is not a nice use of this public park. It was gross.\u201dNo one but the 18,000 Pinknic revelers seem to like Pinknic all that much. Everyone involved in Governors Island said, off the record, that it was everyone\u2019s least favorite event, but it brings in $95 a head.Pierrick Bouquet, the co-founder of the festival, which got its start three years ago during Ms Koch\u2019s tenure, said Pinknic was a crucial part of the island\u2019s programming and had brought much needed media attention. But he was aware of complaints and was reworking the business plan to address them. This year, the number of restaurants was raised from 3 to 12 to help balance alcohol consumption. Next year the hours will be pushed back to limit the interaction with other guests on the island. \u201cWe love the island,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. And we would like to keep Pinknic there.\u201dThose who like to see the world in black and white (not in pink) blame the new administration for the changes that have come. But anyone who has been paying attention knows it has been a slow evolution and that the zoning changes and development were always part of the long-term plan.Robert Pirani, who helped preserve the open space on the island back in its beginnings while working for the Regional Plan Association and helped form the Governors Island Alliance (the precursor to the Friends), said it was only a matter of time before some space was developed.Mr. Samuelian, he said, who was on the Friends board before being appointed by Mayor de Blasio, once asked why it couldn\u2019t just be one big park.Mr. Pirani explained: \u201cWe need to use the development of those 33 acres to attract people so the island can be open year round so somebody will invest some capital and reinvest in the buildings. That\u2019s always been the goal. But finding that happy balance is tough.\u201d\u201cThe deed restrictions reflect that advocacy we did,\u201d Mr. Pirani added. \u201cThe idea was not private residential. At the time that was the danger; you would have 4,000 voters on an island and ultimately, like Battery Park City, you would have people with a vested interest in keeping out the public.\u201dThe deed and zoning have helped slow down development on the island, Mr. Zito said. \u201cSo the city can think about the right way to do things,\u201d he said. A series of public meetings will take place over the next year as the city applies for its zoning changes.One of the casualties of progress has been the Figment art fair, an 11-year fixture that helped establish the island as a cool place to visit. Mr. Koren recently announced he would be pulling out of Governors Island and signing a new lease with Roosevelt Island for next summer. When Mr. Samuelian heard the news, he sat down with Mr. Koren and tried to work out a solution.\u201cBut I was like, \u2018We have to go now,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Koren. \u201cThere was a difference with the whole way things were being run,\u201d he added, referring to a more freewheeling era before Mr. Samuelian\u2019s arrival. \u201cIt has gotten harder and harder to work there given the population, given the desire to increase the season, the increase to seven days a week. More and more process has been added in terms of permits and costs.\u201dEach year, the Figment pavilion \u2014 an architectural structure \u2014 was placed on the big green parade ground. One year it was made of empty jugs, another year of concrete reef balls and rebar. It never failed to impress island visitors. This year, because the parade ground was being used by large events like OctFest, the pavilion \u2014 made of grain silos \u2014 was placed on the Brooklyn side of the island next to a giant pile of rubble, practically hidden from view. It seemed to be the last straw for Mr. Koren. As cultural programming has grown, Mr. Samuelian points out, Figment is now just one of 58 arts groups vying for free public space on the island.As part of his farewell, Mr. Koren organized 14 arts groups to draw up a statement that was read at the first open meeting. Co-signing the statement is 4heads.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to strap ourselves to bulldozers or anything,\u201d said Mr. Zito, of the arts organization 4heads, which co-signed Mr. Koren\u2019s statement. \u201cIt\u2019s not a protest.\u201dThough from the look of the crowd that showed up on Wednesday night, it seemed that way. More than 120 people jammed into the ferry terminal in Lower Manhattan for the first public meeting on the development. Many were there to plead with Mr. Samuelian to save their island oasis. Some wore khaki T-shirts that read, \u201cDefend Governors Island.\u201d There were artists, but also parents, park rangers, politicians, green-space activists, waterfront advocates, and just regular citizens, all with one thing in common: a fierce attachment to the island.Loudly applauding one another, these relative strangers begged for transparency, for a say in what happens and for a moratorium on skyscrapers. Kevin C. Fitzpatrick, the author of the \u201cGovernors Island Explorer\u2019s Guide,\u201d implored officials to preserve the views and limit buildings to 111 feet \u2014 the height of the Statue of Liberty from her feet to the top of her crown.\u201cWe must act,\u201d said Mr. Fitzpatrick. \u201cWe must defend Governors Island. Otherwise the Trust won\u2019t be heroes. They will go down as villains in the same stripe as Robert Moses.\u201dBut there is also a sense that the changes coming to the island are inevitable, and the best that can be hoped for is cooperation.Rob Buchanan, a boat builder and founder of the New York Water Trail Association, said he has been pushing for years for human-powered boat access to the island \u2014 kayaks, canoes and the like. Last spring, he was thrown a bone when a dock was restored. \u201cBut you have to call security when you arrive, and there\u2019s a locked gate,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m not objecting to the fact that they\u2019re rezoning the island,\u201d Mr. Buchanan said. \u201cIt\u2019s the direction the island has taken, and by extension all the waterfront parks in the city are going \u2014 in the direction of privatization. The park was created with the promise of open access. Making money through real estate should be secondary to public access.\u201dPeter Malinowski, who runs the Billion Oyster Project, which is based on Governors Island and seeds New York\u2019s oyster beds with the help of Harbor School students, said he knew change was coming. But he was confident it will be positive change; he has hopes for an aquarium or some university or institution that could help restore New York Harbor.\u201cWe love undeveloped Governors Island but totally understand that\u2019s not a long-term reality,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s so amazing coming out here in the middle of the winter when there\u2019s no one out here. The snow stays white. So that\u2019s a little sad. But I\u2019m hopeful they\u2019ll do the right thing.\u201dMurray Fisher, the co-founder of the oyster project and the Harbor School, said the island provides a unique opportunity to build a global campus for studying nature, biodiversity and climate change that could be itself sustainable and set an example for the rest of the planet. \u201cLet\u2019s not just throw another Battery Park City out there,\u201d he said.For her part, Deputy Mayor Glen said those who love the island the way it is shouldn\u2019t worry. \u201cThe things that people love about Governors Island are not changing. We\u2019re going to invest more money in their facilities and make this island a better place,\u201d she said as she guided her golf cart past the empty and possibly haunted South Battery Building. \u201cAll those people who hate everything should be applauding us. It\u2019s going to be fine. It\u2019s going to be better than fine.\u201dMr. Samuelian, a man of few words, chimed in. With the revenue that new tenants will bring, the old movie theater could be restored to create programming with Lincoln Center or the Tribeca Film Festival. Artist, science and writer residencies could be added in Nolan Park, the quaint collection of yellow clapboard houses near the island\u2019s center.As he made his way from the golf cart back to his office, Mr. Samuelian laid out his philosophy. \u201cThe mantra is no single user. No single use. The best neighborhoods in New York are a mash-up of things. If it\u2019s going to remain public, it needs to have a diversity of uses,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cGetting the right balance is absolutely the most important thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Takeover of Shazam Is Cleared by European Regulators", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 European authorities on Thursday cleared Apple\u2019s acquisition of the popular song-recognition app Shazam, after months of study into whether the deal would give the iPhone maker an unfair advantage over rival streaming music services like Spotify.Apple said in December that it had agreed to buy Shazam, prompting European regulators to scrutinize the proposed takeover as part of a broader effort to examine the value of data when evaluating mergers.In the case of Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam, regulators questioned whether the app held important information on Apple competitors. The focus on data transfer is a departure from typical antitrust enforcement, which tends to zero in on how a deal may affect customers in terms of a product\u2019s cost.The Apple deal, Ms. Vestager said, would not impede competition.The case was a rare instance in which European antitrust authorities have passed on an opportunity to act against an American technology giant. The region has gained a reputation as the world\u2019s strictest overseer of the technology industry.When starting their investigation of the Apple-Shazam deal in February, regulators said they were concerned that Apple would block Shazam from referring customers to rival services, or that it would use the app to poach customers.On Thursday, the European Commission said that after a six-month review, it had concluded that the app did not give Apple an unfair advantage that merited government intervention.\u201cAccess to Shazam\u2019s data would not materially increase Apple\u2019s ability to target music enthusiasts and any conduct aimed at making customers switch would only have a negligible impact,\u201d the commission said in a statement.Spotify, a major rival to Apple\u2019s own music-streaming service, declined to comment.Shazam was an early hit in Apple\u2019s App Store thanks to its novel ability to quickly identify a track after using a smartphone\u2019s microphone to \u201clisten\u201d for only a few seconds. The two companies established closer ties in 2014, when Shazam was integrated into Apple\u2019s voice-powered digital assistant Siri, allowing users to ask, \u201cHey Siri, what song is playing?\u201dThe app mainly makes money by selling advertisements and collecting fees when it refers users to a music service like Apple and Spotify. Shazam is also a valuable source of data, giving music companies insight into what songs and artists are performing well, and in which regions.Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam has been seen as a possible test case for Ms. Vestager, who has said antitrust enforcement must evolve to consider the value of data.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers effectively pay with their data, and that they are not always getting a fair deal.Broadening the interpretation of antitrust law would have consequences for future acquisitions. But whether such an argument would hold up in a courtroom has not yet been well established, making it harder for authorities to step in.Working in Apple\u2019s favor was the fact the European Commission had previously approved acquisitions between several data-rich companies, including Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of LinkedIn.Advertisement"}

What should we teach our kids?\u201dThese are admittedly big questions, and this is a sweeping book. There are chapters on work, war, nationalism, religion, immigration, education and 15 other weighty matters. But its title is a misnomer. Although you will find a few concrete lessons scattered throughout, Harari mostly resists handy prescriptions. He\u2019s more interested in defining the terms of the discussion and giving you historical and philosophical perspective.He deploys, for example, a clever thought experiment to underscore how far humans have come in creating a global civilization. Imagine, he says, trying to organize an Olympic Games in 1016. It\u2019s clearly impossible. Asians, Africans and Europeans don\u2019t know that the Americas exist. The Chinese Song Empire doesn\u2019t think any other political entity in the world is even close to being its equal. No one even has a flag to fly or anthem to play at the awards ceremony.The point is that today\u2019s competition among nations \u2014 whether on an athletic field or the trading floor \u2014 \u201cactually represents an astonishing global agreement.\u201d And that global agreement makes it easier to cooperate as well as compete. Keep this in mind the next time you start to doubt whether we can solve a global problem like climate change. Our global cooperation may have taken a couple of steps back in the past two years, but before that we took a thousand steps forward.So why does it seem as if the world is in decline? Largely because we are much less willing to tolerate misfortune and misery. Even though the amount of violence in the world has greatly decreased, we focus on the number of people who die each year in wars because our outrage at injustice has grown. As it should.Here\u2019s another worry that Harari deals with: In an increasingly complex world, how can any of us have enough information to make educated decisions? It\u2019s tempting to turn to experts, but how do you know they\u2019re not just following the herd? \u201cThe problem of groupthink and individual ignorance besets not just ordinary voters and customers,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut also presidents and C.E.O.s.\u201d That rang true to me from my experience at both Microsoft and the Gates Foundation. I have to be careful not to fool myself into thinking things are better \u2014 or worse \u2014 than they actually are.As much as I admire Harari and enjoyed \u201c21 Lessons,\u201d I didn\u2019t agree with everything in the book. I was glad to see the chapter on inequality, but I\u2019m skeptical about his prediction that in the 21st century \u201cdata will eclipse both land and machinery as the most important asset\u201d separating rich people from everyone else. Land will always be hugely important, especially as the global population nears 10 billion. Meanwhile, data on key human endeavors \u2014 how to grow food or produce energy, for example \u2014 will become even more widely available. Simply having information won\u2019t offer a competitive edge; knowing what to do with it will.Similarly, I wanted to see more nuance in Harari\u2019s discussion of data and privacy. He rightly notes that more information is being gathered on individuals than ever before. But he doesn\u2019t distinguish among the types of data being collected \u2014 the kind of shoes you like to buy versus which diseases you\u2019re genetically predisposed to \u2014 or who is gathering it, or how they\u2019re using it. Your shopping history and your medical history aren\u2019t collected by the same people, protected by the same safeguards or used for the same purposes. Recognizing this distinction would have made his discussion more enlightening.I was also dissatisfied with the chapter on community. Harari argues that social media including Facebook have contributed to political polarization by allowing users to cocoon themselves, interacting only with those who share their views. It\u2019s a fair point, but he undersells the benefits of connecting family and friends around the world. He also creates a straw man by asking whether Facebook alone can solve the problem of polarization. On its own, of course it can\u2019t \u2014 but that\u2019s not surprising, considering how deep the problem cuts. Governments, civil society and the private sector all have a role to play, and I wish Harari had said more about them.But Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. All three of his books wrestle with some version of the same question: What will give our lives meaning in the decades and centuries ahead? So far, human history has been driven by a desire to live longer, healthier, happier lives. If science is eventually able to give that dream to most people, and large numbers of people no longer need to work in order to feed and clothe everyone, what reason will we have to get up in the morning?It\u2019s no criticism to say that Harari hasn\u2019t produced a satisfying answer yet. Neither has anyone else. So I hope he turns more fully to this question in the future. In the meantime, he has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century.Bill Gates is the co-founder of Microsoft and co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Americans Want to Believe Jobs Are the Solution to Poverty. They\u2019re Not.", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "FeatureU.S. unemployment is down and jobs are going unfilled. But for people without much education, the real question is: Do those jobs pay enough to live on?Supported byAt her childhood home, Vanessa began caring for her ailing father. He had been a functional crack addict for most of her life, working as a landscaper in the warmer months and collecting unemployment when business slowed down. \u201cIt was something you got used to seeing,\u201d Vanessa said about her father\u2019s drug habit. \u201cMy dad was a junkie, but he never left us.\u201d Vanessa, 33, has black hair that is usually pulled into a bun and wire-framed glasses that slide down her nose; a shy smile peeks out when she feels proud of herself.Vanessa\u2019s father died a year after Vanessa moved in. The family erected a shrine to him in the living room, a faded, large photo of a younger man surrounded by silk flowers and slowly sinking balloons. Vanessa\u2019s mother, Zaida, is 62 and from Puerto Rico, as was her husband. She uses a walker to get around. Her husband\u2019s death left her with little income, and Vanessa was often broke herself. Her health failing, Zaida could take only so much of Vanessa\u2019s children, Taliya, 17, Shamal, 14, and Tatiyana, 12. When things got too loud or one of her grandchildren gave her lip, she would ask Vanessa to take her children somewhere else.If Vanessa had the money, or if a local nonprofit did, she would book a motel room. She liked the Red Roof Inn, which she saw as \u201cmore civilized\u201d than many of the other motels she had stayed in. It looked like a highway motel: two stories with doors that opened to the outside. The last time the family checked in, the kids carried their homework up to the room as Vanessa followed with small grocery bags from the food pantry, passing two men sipping Modelos and apologizing for their loud music. Inside their room, Vanessa placed her insulin in the minifridge as her children chose beds, where they would sleep two to a mattress. Then she slid into a small chair, saying, \u201cY\u2019all don\u2019t know how tired Mommy is.\u201d After a quiet moment, Vanessa reached over and rubbed Shamal\u2019s back, telling him, \u201cI wish we had a nice place like this.\u201d Then her eye spotted a roach feeling its way over the stucco wall.\u201cOp! Not too nice,\u201d Vanessa said, grinning. With a flick, she sent the bug flying toward Taliya, who squealed and jerked back. Laughter burst from the room.When Vanessa couldn\u2019t get a motel, the family spent the night in the Chrysler. The back of the station wagon held the essentials: pillows and blankets, combs and toothbrushes, extra clothes, jackets and nonperishable food. But there were also wrinkled photos of her kids. One showed Taliya at her eighth-grade graduation in a cream dress holding flowers. Another showed all three children at a quincea\u00f1era \u2014 Shamal kneeling in front, with a powder blue clip-on bow tie framing his baby face, and Tatiyana tucked in back with a deep-dimpled smile.So that the kids wouldn\u2019t run away out of anger or shame, Vanessa learned to park off Route 1, in crevices of the city that were so still and abandoned that no one dared crack a door until daybreak. Come morning, Vanessa would drive to her mother\u2019s home so the kids could get ready for school and she could get ready for work.In May, Vanessa finally secured a spot in public housing. But for almost three years, she had belonged to the \u201cworking homeless,\u201d a now-necessary phrase in today\u2019s low-wage/high-rent society. She is a home health aide, the same job her mother had until her knees and back gave out. Her work uniform is Betty Boop scrubs, sneakers and an ID badge that hangs on a red Bayada Home Healthcare lanyard. Vanessa works steady hours and likes her job, even the tougher bits like bathing the infirm or hoisting someone out of bed with a Hoyer lift. \u201cI get to help people,\u201d she said, \u201cand be around older people and learn a lot of stuff from them.\u201d Her rate fluctuates: She gets $10 an hour for one client, $14 for another. It doesn\u2019t have to do with the nature of the work \u2014 \u201cSometimes the hardest ones can be the cheapest ones,\u201d Vanessa said \u2014 but with reimbursement rates, which differ according to the client\u2019s health care coverage. After juggling the kids and managing her diabetes, Vanessa is able to work 20 to 30 hours a week, which earns her around $1,200 a month. And that\u2019s when things go well.In recent decades, the nation\u2019s tremendous economic growth has not led to broad social uplift. Economists call it the \u201cproductivity-pay gap\u201d \u2014 the fact that over the last 40 years, the economy has expanded and corporate profits have risen, but real wages have remained flat for workers without a college education. Since 1973, American productivity has increased by 77 percent, while hourly pay has grown by only 12 percent. If the federal minimum wage tracked productivity, it would be more than $20 an hour, not today\u2019s poverty wage of $7.25.American workers are being shut out of the profits they are helping to generate. The decline of unions is a big reason. During the 20th century, inequality in America decreased when unionization increased, but economic transformations and political attacks have crippled organized labor, emboldening corporate interests and disempowering the rank and file. This imbalanced economy explains why America\u2019s poverty rate has remained consistent over the past several decades, even as per capita welfare spending has increased. It\u2019s not that safety-net programs don\u2019t help; on the contrary, they lift millions of families above the poverty line each year. But one of the most effective antipoverty solutions is a decent-paying job, and those have become scarce for people like Vanessa. Today, 41.7 million laborers \u2014 nearly a third of the American work force \u2014 earn less than $12 an hour, and almost none of their employers offer health insurance.The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines a \u201cworking poor\u201d person as someone below the poverty line who spent at least half the year either working or looking for employment. In 2016, there were roughly 7.6 million Americans who fell into this category. Most working poor people are over 35, while fewer than five in 100 are between the ages of 16 and 19. In other words, the working poor are not primarily teenagers bagging groceries or scooping ice cream in paper hats. They are adults \u2014 and often parents \u2014 wiping down hotel showers and toilets, taking food orders and bussing tables, eviscerating chickens at meat-processing plants, minding children at 24-hour day care centers, picking berries, emptying trash cans, stacking grocery shelves at midnight, driving taxis and Ubers, answering customer-service hotlines, smoothing hot asphalt on freeways, teaching community-college students as adjunct professors and, yes, bagging groceries and scooping ice cream in paper hats.America prides itself on being the country of economic mobility, a place where your station in life is limited only by your ambition and grit. But changes in the labor market have shrunk the already slim odds of launching yourself from the mailroom to the boardroom. For one, the job market has bifurcated, increasing the distance between good and bad jobs. Working harder and longer will not translate into a promotion if employers pull up the ladders and offer supervisory positions exclusively to people with college degrees. Because large companies now farm out many positions to independent contractors, those who buff the floors at Microsoft or wash the sheets at the Sheraton typically are not employed by Microsoft or Sheraton, thwarting any hope of advancing within the company. Plus, working harder and longer often isn\u2019t even an option for those at the mercy of an unpredictable schedule. Nearly 40 percent of full-time hourly workers know their work schedules just a week or less in advance. And if you give it your all in a job you can land with a high-school diploma (or less), that job might not exist for very long: Half of all new positions are eliminated within the first year. According to the labor sociologist Arne Kalleberg, permanent terminations have become \u201ca basic component of employers\u2019 restructuring strategies.\u201dHome health care has emerged as an archetypal job in this new, low-pay service economy. Demand for home health care has surged as the population has aged, but according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 2017 median annual income for home health aides in the United States was just $23,130. Half of these workers depend on public assistance to make ends meet. Vanessa formed a rapport with several of her clients, to whom she confided that she was homeless. One replied, \u201cOh, Vanessa, I wish I could do something for you.\u201d When Vanessa told her supervisor about her situation, he asked if she wanted time off. \u201cNo!\u201d Vanessa said. She needed the money and had been picking up fill-in shifts. The supervisor was prepared for the moment; he\u2019d been there before. He reached into a drawer and gave her a $50 gas card to Shell and a $100 grocery card to ShopRite. Vanessa was grateful for the help. She thought Bayada was a generous and sympathetic employer, but her rate hadn\u2019t changed much in the three years she had worked there. Vanessa earned $9,815.75 in 2015, $12,763.94 in 2016 and $10,446.81 last year.To afford basic necessities, the federal government estimates that Vanessa\u2019s family would need to bring in $29,420 a year. Vanessa is not even close \u2014 and she is one of the lucky ones, at least among the poor. The nation\u2019s safety net now strongly favors the employed, with benefits like the earned-income tax credit, a once-a-year cash boost that applies only to people who work. Last year, Vanessa received a tax refund of around $5,000, which included earned-income and child tax credits. They helped raise her income, but not above the poverty line. If the working poor are doing better than the nonworking poor, which is the case, it\u2019s not so much because of their jobs per se, but because their employment status provides them access to desperately needed government help. This has caused growing inequality below the poverty line, with the working poor receiving much more social aid than the abandoned nonworking poor or the precariously employed, who are plunged into destitution.When life feels especially grinding, Vanessa often rings up Sheri Sprouse, her best friend since middle school. \u201cShe\u2019s like me,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cShe\u2019s strong.\u201d Sheri is a reserve of emotional support and perspective, often encouraging her friend to be patient and grateful for what she has. But Sheri herself is also just scraping by, raising two daughters on a fixed disability check. And because Sheri\u2019s housing is subsidized through a federally administered voucher, it is also monitored. \u201cWith Section 8, you can\u2019t have people staying with you,\u201d Vanessa said. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t want to mess that up.\u201d When Vanessa was homeless, Sheri couldn\u2019t offer her much else besides love.Vanessa received some help last year, when her youngest child, Tatiyana, was approved for Supplemental Security Income because of a learning disability. Vanessa began receiving a monthly $766 disability check. But when the Mercer County Board of Social Services learned of this additional money, it sent Vanessa a letter announcing that her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits would be reduced to $234 from $544. Food was a constant struggle, and this news didn\u2019t help. A 2013 study by Oxfam America found that two-thirds of working poor people worry about being able to afford enough food. When Vanessa stayed at a hotel, her food options were limited to what she could heat in the microwave; when she slept in her car, the family had to settle for grab-and-go options, which tend to be more expensive. Sometimes Vanessa stopped by a bodega and ordered four chicken-and-rice dishes for $15. Sometimes her kids went to school hungry. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have nothing,\u201d Vanessa told me one morning. For dinner, she planned to stop by a food pantry, hoping they still had the mac-and-cheese that Shamal liked.Americans often assume that the poor do not work. According to a 2016 survey conducted by the American Enterprise Institute, nearly two-thirds of respondents did not think most poor people held a steady job; in reality, that year a majority of nondisabled working-age adults were part of the labor force. Slightly over one-third of respondents in the survey believed that most welfare recipients would prefer to stay on welfare rather than earn a living. These sorts of assumptions about the poor are an American phenomenon. A 2013 study by the sociologist Ofer Sharone found that unemployed workers in the United States blame themselves, while unemployed workers in Israel blame the hiring system. When Americans see a homeless man cocooned in blankets, we often wonder how he failed. When the French see the same man, they wonder how the state failed him.If you believe that people are poor because they are not working, then the solution is not to make work pay but to make the poor work \u2014 to force them to clock in somewhere, anywhere, and log as many hours as they can. But consider Vanessa. Her story is emblematic of a larger problem: the fact that millions of Americans work with little hope of finding security and comfort. In recent decades, America has witnessed the rise of bad jobs offering low pay, no benefits and little certainty. When it comes to poverty, a willingness to work is not the problem, and work itself is no longer the solution.Until the late 18th century, poverty in the West was considered not only durable but desirable for economic growth. Mercantilism, the dominant economic theory of the early modern period, held that hunger incentivized work and kept wages low. Wards of public charity were jailed and required to work to eat. In the current era, politicians and their publics have continued to demand toil and sweat from the poor. In the 1980s, conservatives wanted to attach work requirements to food stamps. In the 1990s, they wanted to impose work requirements on subsidized-housing programs. Both proposals failed, but the impulse has endured.Advocates of work requirements scored a landmark victory with welfare reform in the mid-1990s. Proposed by House Republicans, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, welfare reform affixed work requirements and time limits to cash assistance. Caseloads fell to 4.5 million in 2011 from 12.3 million in 1996. Did \u201cwelfare to work\u201d in fact work? Was it a major success in reducing poverty and sowing prosperity? Hardly. As Kathryn Edin and Laura Lein showed in their landmark book, \u201cMaking Ends Meet,\u201d single mothers pushed into the low-wage labor market earned more money than they did on welfare, but they also incurred more expenses, like transportation and child care, which nullified modest income gains. Most troubling, without guaranteed cash assistance for the most needy, extreme poverty in America surged. The number of Americans living on only $2 or less per person per day has more than doubled since welfare reform. Roughly three million children \u2014 which exceeds the population of Chicago \u2014 now suffer under these conditions. Most of those children live with an adult who held a job sometime during the year.A top priority for the Trump administration is expanding work requirements for some of the nation\u2019s biggest safety-net programs. In January, the federal government announced that it would let states require that Medicaid recipients work. A dozen states have formally applied for a federal waiver to affix work requirements to their Medicaid programs. Four have been approved. In June, Arkansas became the first to implement newly approved work requirements. If all states instated Medicaid work requirements similar to that of Arkansas, as many as four million Americans could lose their health insurance.In April, President Trump issued an executive order mandating that federal agencies review welfare programs, from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to housing assistance, and propose new standards. Although SNAP already has work requirements, in June the House passed a draft farm bill that would deny able-bodied adults SNAP benefits for an entire year if they did not work or engage in work-related activities (like job training) for at least 20 hours a week during a single month. Falling short a second time could get you barred for three years. The Senate\u2019s farm bill, a bipartisan effort, removed these rules and stringent penalties, setting up a showdown with the House, whose version Trump has endorsed. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that work requirements could deny 1.2 million people a benefit that they use to eat.Work requirements affixed to other programs make similar demands. Kentucky\u2019s proposed Medicaid requirements are satisfied only after 80 hours of work or work-related training each month. In a low-wage labor market characterized by fluctuating hours, tenuous employment and involuntary part-time work, a large share of vulnerable workers fall short of these requirements. Nationally representative data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation show that among workers who qualify for Medicaid, almost 50 percent logged fewer than 80 hours in at least one month.In July, the White House Council of Economic Advisers issued a report enthusiastically endorsing work requirements for the nation\u2019s largest welfare programs. The council favored \u201cnegative incentives,\u201d tying aid to labor-market effort, and dismissed \u201cpositive incentives,\u201d like tax benefits for low-income workers, because the former is cheaper. The council also claimed that America\u2019s welfare policies have brought about a \u201cdecline in self-sufficiency.\u201dIs that true? Researchers set out to study welfare dependency in the 1980s and 1990s, when this issue dominated public debate. They didn\u2019t find much evidence of it. Most people started using cash welfare after a divorce or separation and didn\u2019t stay long on the dole, even if they returned to welfare periodically. One study found that 90 percent of young women on welfare stopped relying on it within two years of starting the program, but most of them returned to welfare sometime down the road. Even at its peak, welfare did not function as a dependency trap for a majority of recipients; rather, it was something people relied on when they were between jobs or after a family crisis. A 1988 review in Science concluded that \u201cthe welfare system does not foster reliance on welfare so much as it acts as insurance against temporary misfortune.\u201dToday as then, the able-bodied, poor and idle adult remains a rare creature. According to the Brookings Institution, in 2016 one-third of those living in poverty were children, 11 percent were elderly and 24 percent were working-age adults (18 to 64) in the labor force, working or seeking work. The majority of working-age poor people connected to the labor market were part-time workers. Most couldn\u2019t take on many more hours either because of caregiver responsibilities, as with Vanessa, or because their employer didn\u2019t offer this option, rendering them involuntary part-time workers. Among the remaining working-age adults, 12 percent were out of the labor force owing to a disability (including some enrolled in federal programs that limit work), 15 percent were either students or caregivers and 3 percent were early retirees. That leaves 2 percent of poor people who did not fit into one of these categories. That is, among the poor, two in 100 are working-age adults disconnected from the labor market for unknown reasons. The nonworking poor person getting something for nothing is a lot like the cheat committing voter fraud: pariahs who loom far larger in the American imagination than in real life.Shamal and Tatiyana\u2019s father had recently moved back to Trenton, \u201ccarrying a sack like a hobo,\u201d Vanessa remembered. Other than erratic child-support payments and a single trip to Chuck E. Cheese\u2019s, he doesn\u2019t play much of a role in his children\u2019s lives. Taliya\u2019s father went to prison when she was 1. He was released when she was 8 and was killed a few months later, shot in the chest. Sometimes Vanessa\u2019s three kids teased one another about their fathers. \u201cYour dad is dead,\u201d Tatiyana would say. \u201cYeah? Your dad\u2019s around, but he don\u2019t give a crap about you,\u201d Taliya would shoot back.Other times, though, the siblings offered soft reassurances that their fathers\u2019 absence wasn\u2019t their fault. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for him,\u201d Tatiyana said once, as if it were her choice. \u201cI have time for my real friends.\u201d Taliya looked at her baby sister and replied: \u201cWatch. When you\u2019re doing good, he gonna start coming around.\u201dIf Vanessa clocked more hours, it would be difficult to keep up with all the ways she manages her family: doing the laundry, arranging dentist appointments, counseling the children about sex, studying their deep mysteries to extract their gifts and troubles. Yet our political leaders tend to refuse to view child care as work. During the early days of welfare reform, some local authorities thought up useless jobs for single mothers receiving the benefit. In one outrageous case, recipients were made to sort small plastic toys into different colors, only to have their supervisor end the day by mixing everything up, so the work could start anew the next morning. This was thought more important than keeping children safe and fed.Vanessa attributed her own academic setbacks \u2014 a good student in middle school, she began cutting class and courting trouble in high school \u2014 to the fact that her parents were checked out. At a critical juncture when Vanessa needed guidance and discipline, her father was using drugs and her mother seemed always to be at work. She didn\u2019t want to make the same mistake with her kids. Vanessa\u2019s life revolved around a small routine: drop the kids off at school; work; try finding an apartment that rents for less than $1,000 a month; pick the kids up; feed them; sleep. She didn\u2019t spend her money on extras, including cigarettes and alcohol. She was trying to save \u201cthe little money that I got,\u201d she told me, \u201cso when we do get a place, I can get the kids washcloths and towels.\u201dHere is the blueprint. First, valorize work as the ticket out of poverty, and debase caregiving as not work. Look at a single mother without a formal job, and say she is not working; spot one working part time and demand she work more. Transform love into laziness. Next, force the poor to log more hours in a labor market that treats them as expendables. Rest assured that you can pay them little and deny them sick time and health insurance because the American taxpayer will step in, subsidizing programs like the earned-income tax credit and food stamps on which your work force will rely. Watch welfare spending increase while the poverty rate stagnates because, well, you are hoarding profits. When that happens, skirt responsibility by blaming the safety net itself. From there, politicians will invent new ways of denying families relief, like slapping unrealistic work requirements on aid for the poor.Democrats may scoff at Republicans\u2019 work requirements, but they have yet to challenge the dominant conception of poverty that feeds such meanspirited politics. Instead of offering a counternarrative to America\u2019s moral trope of deservedness, liberals have generally submitted to it, perhaps even embraced it, figuring that the public will not support aid that doesn\u2019t demand that the poor subject themselves to the low-paying jobs now available to them. Even stalwarts of the progressive movement seem to reserve economic prosperity for the full-time worker. Senator Bernie Sanders once declared, echoing a long line of Democrats who have come before and after him, \u201cNobody who works 40 hours a week should be living in poverty.\u201d Sure, but what about those who work 20 or 30 hours, like Vanessa?Because liberals have allowed conservatives to set the terms of the poverty debate, they find themselves arguing about radical solutions that imagine either a fully employed nation (like a jobs guarantee) or a postwork society (like a universal basic income). Neither plan has the faintest hope of being actually implemented nationwide anytime soon, which means neither is any good to Vanessa and millions like her. When so much attention is spent on far-off, utopian solutions, we neglect the importance of the poverty fixes we already have. Safety-net programs that help families confront food insecurity, housing unaffordability and unemployment spells lift tens of millions of people above the poverty line each year. By itself, SNAP annually pulls over eight million people out of poverty. According to a 2015 study, without federal tax benefits and transfers, the number of Americans living in deep poverty (half below the poverty threshold) would jump from 5 percent to almost 19 percent. Effective social-mobility programs should be championed, expanded and stripped of draconian work requirements.While Washington continues to require more of vulnerable workers, it has required little from employers in the form of living wages or job security, creating a labor market in which the biggest disincentive to work is not welfare but the lousy jobs that are available. Judging from the current state of the nation\u2019s poverty agenda, it appears that most people creating federal and state policy don\u2019t know many people like Vanessa. \u201cHalf of the people in City Hall don\u2019t even live in Trenton,\u201d Vanessa once told me, flustered. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know what goes on here.\u201d Meanwhile, this is the richest Congress on record, with one in 13 members belonging to the top 1 percent. From such a high perch, poverty appears a smaller problem, something less gutting, and work appears a bigger solution, something more gratifying. But when we shrink the problem, the solution shrinks with it; when small solutions are applied to a huge problem, they don\u2019t work; and when weak antipoverty initiatives don\u2019t work, many throw up their hands and argue that we should stop tossing money at the problem altogether. Cheap solutions only cheapen the problem.This month, I had dinner with first-year honors students at a university in Massachusetts. Some leaned right, others left. But all of them were united in their inability to explain poverty in a way that didn\u2019t somehow hold the poor responsible for their predicament. Poor people lacked work ethic, they told me, or maybe a strong backbone or a commitment to a better life. I began to regret that alcohol hadn\u2019t been served when one student brought up the movie \u201cThe Pursuit of Happyness,\u201d in which Will Smith\u2019s character performs superhumanly well at his job to leap from homelessness to affluence. The student was no senator\u2019s son: He told us that times were lean after his parents divorced. As I watched this young man identify with Smith\u2019s character, it dawned on me that what his parents, preachers, teachers, coaches and guidance counselors had told him for motivation \u2014 \u201cStudy hard, stick to it, dream big and you will be successful\u201d \u2014 had been internalized as a theory of life.We need a new language for talking about poverty. \u201cNobody who works should be poor,\u201d we say. That\u2019s not good enough. Nobody in America should be poor, period. No single mother struggling to raise children on her own; no formerly incarcerated man who has served his time; no young heroin user struggling with addiction and pain; no retired bus driver whose pension was squandered; nobody. And if we respect hard work, then we should reward it, instead of deploying this value to shame the poor and justify our unconscionable and growing inequality. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard to get where I am,\u201d you might say. Well, sure. But Vanessa has worked hard to get where she is, too.Matthew Desmond is a contributing writer for the magazine and the author of \u201cEvicted,\u201d which won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sloan Kettering\u2019s Cozy Deal With Start-Up Ignites a New Uproar", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization.An artificial intelligence start-up founded by three insiders at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center debuted with great fanfare in February, with $25 million in venture capital and the promise that it might one day transform how cancer is diagnosed.Memorial Sloan Kettering holds an equity stake in Paige.AI, as does a member of the cancer center\u2019s executive board, the chairman of its pathology department and the head of one of its research laboratories. Three other board members are investors.At a staff meeting Thursday morning, Dr. Thompson and others, including Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, the acting physician-in-chief who replaced Dr. Baselga, described the recent events as a disruption and acknowledged that the hospital was under a microscope, according to several people who attended. Doctors said they were concerned about a lack of communication from hospital leadership, and one said patients were nervous that their health data was being commercialized by the institution.Hospital pathologists have strongly objected to the Paige.AI deal, saying it is unfair that the founders received equity stakes in a company that relies on the pathologists\u2019 expertise and work amassed over 60 years. They also questioned the use of patients\u2019 data \u2014 even if it is anonymous \u2014 without their knowledge in a profit-driven venture.In addition, experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance have questioned whether Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation\u2019s leading cancer centers, complied with federal and state law governing nonprofits when it set up the deal. The experts pointed out that charitable institutions like Memorial Sloan Kettering must show that they didn\u2019t provide assets to insiders for less than the fair market value.Cancer center officials said that they acted properly in approving the deal with Paige.AI and that if successful, the venture could change the future of cancer diagnosis. \u201cThis is an incredibly expensive undertaking \u2014 it needs a lot of money,\u201d Dr. Gregory Raskin, the hospital\u2019s vice president of technology development, said in an interview. \u201cWe feel this is a really valuable and important technology to get developed.\u201dOfficials said that some board members invested only after early efforts to generate interest from outside companies and investors had failed. But they acknowledged that they did not seek an independent valuation of the tissue archive, nor did they put the proposal out for competitive bidding before licensing it to a single company. In exchange for sharing its voluminous database, Memorial Sloan Kettering received ownership shares amounting to about nine percent in the company.\u201cIt just seems awfully coincidental that the individuals involved happen to be people in control and influence of that asset, and they ended up with an exclusive use of it,\u201d said Marcus S. Owens, a Washington lawyer who ran the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt organizations. \u201cIt seems to create a cascading series of conflicts for the operation of Sloan Kettering.\u201dThe decision to license images of the patients\u2019 tissue slides to a for-profit company also highlights the broader debate over the use of personal medical data, ranging from genetic information to, in this case, images of a person\u2019s cells, for research and commercial purposes.After ProPublica and The Times began asking questions about the arrangement, one of the founders \u2014 Dr. David Klimstra, the chairman of the pathology department \u2014 said he would divest his ownership stake.The Paige.AI project finally took off after enlisting the help of Norman Selby, a member of the hospital board\u2019s executive committee and a longtime health care consultant, manager and investor. He is listed as a founder and executive chairman of Paige.AI and holds an equity stake.The three other hospital board members who became investors are Stanley Druckenmiller, Alexander T. Robertson and Marie-Jos\u00e9e Kravis, according to Richard Beattie, honorary chairman of the cancer center\u2019s board and a member of its executive committee. \u201cWe were desperate,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis is more risky than most transactions, and we couldn\u2019t find investors.\u201dThe board investors in Paige.AI, and Mr. Breyer, either declined to comment or did not return calls and emails. Mr. Selby has pledged to donate some of his profits to the hospital, Mr. Beattie said.Experts in nonprofit law and corporate governance questioned whether Memorial Sloan Kettering, which is a charity, acted properly in what is known as a related party transaction with the founders of Paige.AI.While federal law does not specifically require seeking bids from competitors or independent appraisals of the assets in such a transaction, nonprofit groups that make deals with companies associated with board members or employees must demonstrate that they have taken steps to ensure that insiders don\u2019t get preferential treatment. If nonprofits are found not to have complied, they or the individuals involved could face tax repercussions.Mr. Beattie said the hospital relied on some investors to set a value for licensing the slides, with guidance from hedge fund leaders on its board. A law firm, which he did not identify, evaluated the documents and said it was a good deal.Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors who has written books about corporate governance, said the center\u2019s process was \u201cinadequate.\u201d\u201cThey could be throwing a dart at the wall to figure out what the valuation is,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re accepting somebody\u2019s word for it and that\u2019s very, very risky.\u201dMr. Beattie said the cancer center would follow I.R.S. rules requiring it to list the transaction on financial forms, which won\u2019t be public until next year. He also said the hospital had set up plans to manage conflicts for the three company founders. All four members who are invested, including Mr. Selby, must recuse themselves from any board actions about the company, Mr. Beattie said. A review of the hospital\u2019s I.R.S. filings does not show any similar transactions in recent years.In two meetings this month, staff pathologists confronted hospital leaders over the cancer center\u2019s relationship with Paige.AI, some of them angered by the deal that would allow others to profit from their work.At a tense meeting Sept. 12, some pathologists said they only learned about the deal online after it was announced, two people in attendance said.As for how the deal came about, Dr. Klimstra told colleagues that Google had twice approached the hospital about securing access to the pathology slides and was turned down. Mr. Beattie said there were never serious conversations with Google. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment.Doctors also expressed concerns about whether patients had consented to have images of their tissue used in this way.Dr. Klimstra told them the project had been approved by an institutional review board, which considers ethical issues involving patients. Patients who had not given their consent to having their readings shared would have all personal health information stripped from the images and notes, he said. Dr. Raskin said that between 30 to 40 percent of patients typically do not consent.And Paige.AI will not have exclusive access to slides that resulted from federally funded research, he added.It then says, \u201c(contemplate consulting fees, repeat with feeling.)\u201dIn an interview last week, Dr. Rosenblum said he wasn\u2019t seeking financial compensation, but felt \u201cthe leadership had not been particularly transparent with us about the founding of this company, and I feel that we were not sufficiently credited with what had been our intellectual input in this.\u201dKathryn Martin, the hospital\u2019s chief operating officer, said the cancer center did not anticipate the pathologists\u2019 objections. \u201cI think we could have done a better job communicating it,\u201d she said in an interview.Dr. Klimstra said in a statement that the project represented a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in the pathology field.\u201cOther than my family, there is nothing more important to me than running my department,\u201d he said, and added, \u201cI sincerely regret the fact that my equity ownership in Paige has served as a distraction to my primary leadership role at M.S.K.\u201dDr. Fuchs, the head of the computational pathology lab, defended his role in a separate statement. \u201cComputer scientists like myself very seldom get the chance to really help patients,\u201d he said.Details for distributing any profits or proceeds from Paige.AI have not been worked out, officials said. Ms. Martin suggested that if the deal is successful, some funds could be set aside for the pathology department to finance research projects.For now, much of the talk is theoretical \u2014 the company is years away from selling a finished product, with a staff of fewer than 20 employees.The roster of other key advisers also appears to be in flux. Until recently, Dr. Baselga was listed as the chairman of Paige\u2019s scientific advisory board. But his name disappeared from the company\u2019s website last week, the day after he resigned from Memorial Sloan Kettering. He also recently resigned from board positions at the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb and Varian Medical Systems, a radiation equipment manufacturer.Charles Ornstein is a senior editor at ProPublica.

{"Headline": "Parts of a \u2018Virtual\u2019 Border Wall, Built With the Tech Behind Driverless Cars", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "In a rural Texas county, lidar sensor technology is being tested as a way to spot illegal intruders from Mexico. That use could divide workers in Silicon Valley.Supported byDEL RIO, Tex. \u2014 In this tiny town at the edge of South Texas brush country, a black steel fence runs along the Mexican border. About 15 feet high and topped by small metal spires that bend toward Mexico, it stretches west from a Border Patrol checkpoint for about a mile and a half. Then it stops.The sensor belongs to a Silicon Valley start-up called Quanergy, one of a number of companies trying to land business along the Mexican border. While President Trump still vows to build a physical border wall, these companies hope to help build a \u201cvirtual wall\u201d that some policymakers believe would be more effective than miles of concrete and metal. A virtual wall would not offer a physical deterrence, but some people believe it would be cheaper to build and maintain.\u201cThe only way to have operational control of the border is to look at all 2,000 miles of it at the same time,\u201d said Representative Will Hurd, a Republican who represents Val Verde County, west of San Antonio. \u201cAnd the only way to do that is through technology.\u201dFounded in 2012 and backed by more than $160 million in funding, Quanergy was one of the many lidar makers created amid a rush to develop driverless cars. Over the last year, that investment boom started to feel like a glut as autonomous vehicle technology improved more slowly than some had hoped. Border control is another potential market for lidar, which can spot objects and people in all sorts of conditions, day or night.Working with the Val Verde County Sheriff\u2019s Office, Quanergy has spent the last year testing its lidar sensors on the ranch in Del Rio, angling for a contract with United States Customs and Border Protection.Still, where some see a moral quandary, others see a business opportunity. More than 20 companies have worked on the Pentagon project that Google pulled out of.Mr. Luckey left Facebook two years later after it was revealed that he supported a political action group that spread anti-Hillary Clinton memes. Not long after, he started working on his new company. Trae Stephens, the investor who founded Anduril with Mr. Luckey, tried to distance the company from Mr. Luckey\u2019s history of political provocation when asked about it in an interview.\u201cIt is a national security company,\u201d he said.Quanergy\u2019s executives also hope to keep politics at arm\u2019s length. In a recent interview, Louay Eldada, a founder and the chief executive of Quanergy, said the company always planned to expand beyond driverless cars. Border control, he said, was an obvious candidate.Cogniac, another Silicon Valley start-up that offers technology for identifying people and objects in camera images, is exploring similar work.Mr. Hurd, the congressman, is advocating for a wider technological system. \u201cThe question is, how do you cut for sign in the digital age?\u201d he said. \u201cWe should get to a point where we see absolutely everything coming across our border.\u201dThat could include the kinds of sensors tested by Quanergy in Del Rio, which can capture activity across 360 degrees and a distance of about 100 meters. Using this three-dimensional view of an area, software can automatically pinpoint people moving past and alert border agents.If lined up in large numbers and paired with cameras that snap images when movement is detected, these sensors could provide a more detailed picture of border activity and help agents organize their response.But the devices are limited. If left unprotected, they are easily vandalized. And they require both electrical power and a network connection. Quanergy has tested its sensors with solar panels, which eliminate the need for power lines. Still, along most parts of the border, the authorities would have to install new fiber lines or cell towers.Joe Martinez, Val Verde County\u2019s sheriff, has helped test the Quanergy sensors. He said he believed they could be a big help along some parts of the border. But if these sensors were used in the vast, rocky, undulating spaces in the western part of his county, he said, border and other law enforcement agents would have difficulty responding to alerts within any reasonable amount of time.\u201cThe needs to the west are different,\u201d Mr. Martinez said. \u201cAnd the needs to the south are different.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, lidar sensors are expensive. Quanergy charges a few thousand dollars per unit. Old tires are considerably cheaper.Such sensors, Mr. Martinez and others said, are best used in tandem with a wide variety of other methods under development. \u201cThis is about a layering of technologies,\u201d said David Aguilar, a former acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and a principal at Global Security and Innovative Strategies, a consulting firm in Washington. Current officials with the agency said it was testing many technologies with companies in Silicon Valley, with the goal of deploying new artificial intelligence techniques in the field.Some question whether these technologies will eat away at the privacy of residents. Much of the land at the border is private.Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University who specializes in border protection issues, said authorities should concentrate on border checkpoints, where a large portion of illegal crossings occur.\u201cNone of these things make sense to me,\u201d said Ms. Correa-Cabrera, who is also a fellow at the Wilson Center, a think tank in Washington. \u201cWhy would we continue to spend on technology that is not solving the problem?\u201dBut Mr. Aguilar said he believed that demands on the border for new sensors and new artificial intelligence would grow.\u201cWe started talking about this many years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the technology wasn\u2019t as mature as it is now.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the university where Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera is currently a professor. It is George Mason University, not the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, where she was previously a member of the faculty.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With Tobacco Revenue Now Forbidden, F1 Turns to High-Tech", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor decades, Formula One was synonymous with tobacco. Not only was the sport awash with money from cigarette companies, but the cars\u2019 liveries were also reflections of their sponsors, from the red and white Marlboro McLarens to the black and gold of the John Player Special Lotus.Tobacco brought in an average of $350 million per year for Formula One earlier this decade, and companies like British American Tobacco and Philip Morris International helped pay for the sport\u2019s continuous cycle of development, the technological arms race that often ensured that those who spent the most won the most.But that all ended late in 2006 after Formula One banned tobacco advertising. In 2015, the last year for which public figures are available, the sport\u2019s 10 teams raised about $750 million from sponsorships, a $200 million drop from 2012. That loss of income hit the sport about the same time as the financial crisis, which forced the Honda, Toyota and Renault teams to shut down, although Renault eventually returned. And now Formula One is reconsidering whether to continue to accept advertising from alcohol, fast-food and snack companies.So the sport has been looking for a new vein of money, and in the last few years teams have been working to form partnerships with the deep-pocket companies in the technology industry that would bring not only high-tech expertise, but also revenue.Technology and Formula One are natural partners, and companies like Microsoft and Dell have long invested in the sport. Mercedes, the current champion, has a number of technical partners, including the wireless technology company Qualcomm and the audio experts Bose, as well as Tibco, Pure Storage, Rubrik and Epson. Microsoft Dynamics has partnered with the Renault team since 2012, and Dell returned to the sport this year with McLaren, having previously worked with the now-defunct Caterham team.McLaren has been aggressive in obtaining partnerships over the past decade.James Bower, McLaren\u2019s marketing director, lived through Formula One\u2019s sponsorship upheaval.\u201cTowards the end of that era \u2014 between 2001 and 2006 when the new directive kicked in \u2014 what you did see was some brands (and I would say West and Lucky Strike were probably the more innovative) pushing harder into lifestyle and pushing harder into what we recognize now as the deeper activation levels, as opposed to just slam Marlboro on the side of the car, throw a few parties, entertain some B2B trade retailers and call it a day,\u201d Bower said, referring to business to business.\u201cThat was making the dollar work harder, because they knew at that point the legislation was coming and they needed to just continue to deepen their relationships with their consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat drove a more innovative state, and it coincided with Red Bull\u2019s entry into Formula One, which kind of almost took over the mantle of the lifestyle.\u201dThe loss of tobacco, the advent of lifestyle branding and active consumer engagement have also had teams like McLaren change their sponsorship focus, abandoning the old model of a big-ticket title sponsor for a series of smaller but longer-term deals. In 2018, McLaren has raised about 25 million pounds, or $32.4 million, in new deals with partners including Dell, HTC, Logitech and Airgain. Exact financial details are heavily guarded, but McLaren said that the money came in the form of longer contracts of five to six years.McLaren\u2019s roster of new partners is too recent to have made a difference to the team\u2019s racing results, but the four-time world champion Mercedes has already proved that the right technical partnership can increase performance and income.Because of Qualcomm, Mercedes in 2016 became the first team in the sport to wirelessly transmit data from the car to the garage, saving vital seconds as its rivals were forced to park and plug in. In a sport where the difference between success and failure is measured in tenths of a second, two seconds saved can \u2014 and did, in the case of Mercedes \u2014 help win championships.Over the course of a grand prix weekend, each racecar will generate more than 3 terabytes of data gathered from more than 200 sensors. Information like tire temperature and the health of mechanical components will be analyzed by track-side engineers and battalions at each team\u2019s home factory.Teams have been seeking partnerships with data storage and data security companies. The Williams team works with Acronis, while Ferrari has worked with Kaspersky Lab since 2010.It is not only the teams that benefit from technical partnerships. Thomas Been, chief marketing officer for the software company Tibco, a partner of the Mercedes team, said the Formula One environment had a singular appeal.\u201cWhat attracted us to Formula One is the level of competition, which I think is a very good analogy to what most of our customers are seeing; the level of technology, which I guess is just a laboratory in which you create the technologies that are going to be used in the cars of tomorrow; and that everything is in real time,\u201d Been said.The speed of development was also what attracted Qualcomm to the sport, said Derek Aberle, a former company president.\u201cIt\u2019s the ability to have an environment where you can do rapid prototyping,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can test things out. If it doesn\u2019t work we can change them.\u201d The engineering team, he said, is very strong and moves quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s the environment that we have here in the racetrack \u2014 I think it does push us.\u201cThe pace at which they move is impressive. Our guys at first were like, \u2018Wow.\u2019 They like that challenge. You get a problem, you\u2019ve got a week to do something. They jump on it, and it\u2019s exhilarating for them. We\u2019ve learned a lot, and I\u2019m hoping the Mercedes guys have learned a lot from us here. Eventually, we want to see that translate into breakthrough stuff for our business. That\u2019s where the future is coming: cellular connectivity to the car, then the vehicle.\u201dWhether called sponsorships or partnerships, the deals bring money to the teams.At McLaren, the combination of a broader business \u2014 McLaren Applied Technologies, a separate technology company linked with the race team \u2014 and a rich racing legacy has been a core element of the sales pitch.\u201cObviously with Formula One it is a technical sport, so you are always going to have those authentic stories on the technical side,\u201d said Henry Chilcott, group marketing director for the McLaren Group.\u201cNow it\u2019s about us as a team here finding those more authentic stories in other areas of business, whether that is outside of technology in turn or lifestyle, conversations and elsewhere. That\u2019s where I feel like we\u2019re unique in the sense that we\u2019ve got this multidimensional storytelling platform that perhaps another F1 team or another sports property won\u2019t have.\u201dThat storytelling is a core aspect of McLaren\u2019s new approach, Chilcott said.\u201cWe\u2019ve moved away from that traditional model. In essence, the brand that you see on the car is just the bridge between one brand and McLaren. Then it\u2019s beneath that overarching branding, it\u2019s what we\u2019re doing underneath the surface. That\u2019s where we\u2019re being unique and successful in the sense that we\u2019re approaching things with a more \u2018agency\u2019 mind-set. Discussions always lead with their objectives, rather than how much we seek to secure financially.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Frustration and Finger-Pointing as G.O.P. Pulls Out of Deal Talks on Hacked Materials", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans withdrew on Thursday from negotiations with Democrats over a pact that would have effectively barred both parties from using hacked or stolen material on the campaign trail this fall.Leaders of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans, and their counterparts at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had labored for much of the summer over rules that would have governed the way the congressionally run committees and their candidates treated material like the thousands of pages of damaging Democratic documents stolen and leaked by Russian hackers in 2016.Instead, the two parties were left on Thursday exchanging shots just two months before Election Day; Republicans claimed that Democrats had negotiated in bad faith and violated an agreement not to speak about the negotiations publicly, and Democrats said that Republicans were merely searching for an excuse to pull out. It only fed the complaint by Democrats that Republican lawmakers have resisted bridging partisan divisions in the two years since Russia began its brazen attack on the American political system.\u201cNegotiations are about trust. Once that trust is breached, there is simply no way to reach an agreement,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a spokesman for the Republican committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a pledge to do what we planned to do already. And we\u2019re certainly not going to be a pawn in someone\u2019s publicity stunt.\u201dHouse Republicans \u201care not seeking hacked materials,\u201d Mr. Gorman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want hacked materials. We have no intention of using hacked materials.\u201dDemocrats strongly rebutted that claim, accusing Republicans of slow-walking negotiations before pulling the plug based on a benign press interview.\u201cWe have been clear from Day 1 that the D.C.C.C. will not use stolen hacked materials for political gain, and have been negotiating in good faith for three months to get the N.R.C.C. on the same page,\u201d said Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n of New Mexico, the chairman of the Democratic committee. \u201cThe N.R.C.C. has needlessly delayed and made one excuse after another, and I\u2019m incredibly disappointed that they have backed out of this commitment not to use stolen hacked materials. This is a sad day for our democracy.\u201dThe two sides had been close to reaching an agreement as recently as the past week or so, according to officials involved in the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the talks. But a key difference of opinion remained over how to deal with hacked or stolen material that entered the public domain through news or other sources. Republicans argued that such material had to be fair game and that to ask candidates not to seize on news reports was unnecessarily prohibitive. Democrats countered that any agreement would be toothless without such a provision.As recently as Tuesday evening, Democrats proposed a draft of the agreement that would have required the two committees to pledge that they would not \u201cuse known stolen or hacked information, or promote or disseminate hacked materials to the press, regardless of the source,\u201d according to an official familiar with the latest version.The draft\u2019s other provisions included a pledge not to aid hacking efforts, not to seek out hacked or stolen materials, and to report any contacts with foreign actors to law enforcement authorities. The Democratic committee and its candidates plan to honor the draft\u2019s provisions.Without a deal, the parties will be left to more or less set their own standards, as they have in past election cycles. Outside political advocacy groups, which are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars on House races this fall, would not have been subject to the pledge.The hackers also released the home addresses, phone numbers and personal email addresses of Democratic House members.News outlets widely reported on the hacked campaign material, amplifying the impact of the Russian intrusion, in the run-up to the 2016 election. And after a Republican political advertisement aired that appeared to use hacked materials, Mr. Luj\u00e1n wrote a letter that August warning the Republican congressional committee that it would be complicit in Russia\u2019s influence campaign if it continued to use hacked or stolen material.American intelligence officials and technology titans like Facebook and Microsoft said they have seen evidence that Russia continues to actively interfere in the American political process. But there has not been evidence made public to suggest that Russia or any other state actor has penetrated the networks of candidates or either campaign committee.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Farm to Blockchain: Walmart Tracks Its Lettuce", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "The giant retailer will begin requiring lettuce and spinach suppliers to contribute to a blockchain database that can rapidly pinpoint contamination.Supported byWhen dozens of people across the country got sick from eating contaminated romaine lettuce this spring, Walmart did what many grocers would do: It cleared every shred off its shelves, just to be safe.By this time next year, more than 100 farms that supply Walmart with leafy green vegetables will be required to input detailed information about their food into a blockchain database developed by I.B.M. for Walmart and several other retailers exploring similar moves.The burgeoning blockchain industry has generated a great deal of buzz, investment and experimentation. Central banks are exploring whether it would be good for tracking money flows. Eastman Kodak has explored a blockchain platform that could help photographers manage their collections and record ownership of their work, while a group of reporters and investors are using the technology to start a series of news publications.But essentially the only real-world uses have come from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which use their own blockchains to store transactions. Walmart is now trying to bring blockchain into the lexicon of everyday consumers.\u201cIt is the first real instance of doing this at scale,\u201d said Brigid McDermott, vice president of I.B.M. Blockchain.I.B.M. is trying to position itself as a leader in the emerging technology of blockchains. It is competing with established companies like Microsoft and upstarts like Ethereum, which have been developing projects in areas as varied as financial trading and music rights.The Walmart effort will take time to roll out. In the meantime, it is likely to face questions from critics of the technology, who are skeptical of whether the blockchains being developed by corporations are all that different from old-fashioned online databases.\u201cI can\u2019t see how doing this in a blockchain data format will make this magical in any way,\u201d said David Gerard, the author of \u201cAttack of the 50 Foot Blockchain.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s mostly a P.R. move, so these companies can sell themselves as blockchain leaders,\u201d he said.Walmart\u2019s embrace of the blockchain highlights how difficult it still is for grocers, including the nation\u2019s largest, to keep track of their food.Last year, Walmart conducted an experiment trying to trace the source of sliced mangos.It took seven days for Walmart employees to locate the farm in Mexico that grew the fruit. With the blockchain software developed by IBM, the mangos could be tracked in a matter of seconds, according to Walmart.\u201cThe food chain is not always linear,\u201d said Frank Yiannas, vice president for food safety at Walmart.The original blockchain was the online database on which all Bitcoin addresses and transactions were stored. The database is maintained and stored by a network of volunteer computers, so that no single institution, like a bank, is required to keep the records. Because several computers have the records, it is much harder to change or fudge the data after the fact.Many large global corporations have been studying how they might use a similar database design to keep records among a wide array of parties \u2014 like the hundreds of people involved in moving spinach from the farm to the grocery shelf.The blockchains being tested by companies, including the version adopted by Walmart, generally have nothing to do with Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency \u2014 they are entirely new databases with no coins involved. And unlike the Bitcoin blockchain, which can be viewed by anyone, only certain people will be able to view and access the Walmart database.The system that Walmart is using, IBM Food Trust, has been developed for consumer companies, including Dole, Wegmans and Unilever, to track products moving through the supply chain.At each stop along the way, people handling produce for Walmart will make an entry on the blockchain, signing off when they receive it and then when they move it onto the next person in the chain. IBM and Walmart say they are already tracking other products like yogurt and poultry on the system.Blockchains are supposed to make it possible to keep updated databases without any central authority in charge. But currently, all of the records for the Walmart blockchain are being stored on IBM\u2019s cloud computers, for Walmart\u2019s use. That has led to questions about why a distributed database like a blockchain is even necessary.\u201cThe idea is right but the execution seems off,\u201d said Simon Taylor, the co-founder of 11:FS, a consulting firm that advises companies on blockchain adoption. \u201cIBM took new tech that doesn\u2019t need a middleman and made themselves the middleman.\u201dMs. McDermott said that the data would be encrypted in a way that will make it impossible for IBM to access or change it.Efforts to track goods on blockchains have also faced a more fundamental challenge. A blockchain can capture the digital record of a box of spinach. But it cannot tell if someone opened the box and changed the spinach inside, replacing it with arugula or illegal drugs.\u201cBlockchains won\u2019t protect you from fraud,\u201d Mr. Gerard said. \u201cYou need human inspectors who know the scams.\u201dWalmart says its blockchain will allow it to track food from the field, through washing and cutting facilities, to the warehouse and finally to the store. It will even be possible to pinpoint which part of the field and at what time the vegetables were harvested.Mr. Yiannas said Walmart was focusing on leafy green vegetables because, along with beef, they tend to have the highest incidences of contagion.\u201cWe can bring trust to the system,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Week\u2019s Wedding Announcements", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAll of the weddings right here on one handy page for you.Linara Jine\u00e9 Davidson and Henry Lawson Greenidge met in the fall of 2016, in Washington, at the annual legislative conference of the Congressional Black Caucus. Mr. Greenidge was then working in the office of the New York mayor as an assistant director for external affairs, and Ms. Davidson was a regional political director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.A mutual friend introduced them moments after another friend had finished telling Mr. Greenidge that he needed to open himself up to the possibility of meeting someone. \u201cShe left to have a drink and I turned around and Linara was there,\u201d he said.Ms. Davidson said that Mr. Greenidge made an immediate impression on her, too. \u201cTo be honest, when I saw him \u2014 and it\u2019s a wonky thing to say \u2014 the moment that I saw him, something said to me in my head, that is my husband right there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it.\u201d\u201cIt took me 35 years to meet him, but we\u2019ve been in the same room the whole time and didn\u2019t even know it,\u201d she said.The next day, Mr. Greenidge asked Ms. Davidson if she would have lunch with him two days later, when they were back in New York City, and they agreed to meet at his favorite Thai place, which was just around the corner from the Clinton campaign office in Brooklyn.She arrived at the date wearing Converse sneakers, he remembers, which were his personal favorite footwear. He saw it as another sign.\u201cIt just felt right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lunch wasn\u2019t a very good lunch. There were awkward pauses and we both didn\u2019t finish our food. But when we left, we shared a kiss. Just a peck on the lips but that\u2019s when I knew she felt the same way I did.\u201dCaroline Baumann and John Stewart Malcolmson met in 2011 on howaboutwe.com, a dating website that proposed two people get together for an activity rather than, strictly speaking, just a date. But the couple\u2019s connection was even more coincident than is usually the case with these things, as neither put more than a modicum of effort into their profile.In fact, Mr. Malcolmson stumbled onto the site because he was looking for an elegant user-interface design for a job he was working on. He signed up and went through the process of creating an account primarily so that he could assess the site\u2019s technical merits.Ms. Baumann had a similar lack of enthusiasm when the website popped up on her screen as a new offering.\u201cI thought, what the hell, I\u2019ve dated half of New York,\u201d Ms. Baumann said. \u201cI gave it no time at all, because I have no time, and then, voil\u00e0! He\u2019s the man of my life.\u201dMs. Baumann was drawn to Mr. Malcolmson\u2019s interest in the subjects that consume her own life \u2014 inspirational art and design \u2014 and though he found not much to go on in her profile, he was nonetheless intrigued.Mr. Malcolmson proposed that the two try a tennis match, but Ms. Baumann nixed that suggestion, leery of being committed to two hours if it turned out that she wasn\u2019t interested after all. So they agreed instead to go the Gagosian Gallery together, to see an exhibit of Andreas Gursky\u2019s satellite images.It was a brilliant move, as, Ms. Baumann explained, \u201cthe premise of our union is centered on art and design. It\u2019s what glues us together.\u201dThere was immediate chemistry between the two, and as neither wanted the date to end, they moved on to tapas and a glass of wine afterward.\u201cI was struck by her energy, her joie de vivre,\u201d Mr. Malcolmson said.

{"Headline": "Is Your Salad Habit Good for the Planet?", "Date": "2018-09-29", "News": "Popular fast-casual chains brag of sustainability, as customers toss their compostable and recyclable bowls into the trash with wild abandon.Supported byEvery weekday, shortly after 11 a.m., a line forms at the Broadway and 38th Street location of Sweetgreen, the eco-conscious salad chain. By noon, the line has usually tripled in size. It often takes more than 15 minutes to get to the front. The scene is similar at the Chop\u2019t at 41st and Broadway, or the Dig Inn on West 38th, or the Just Salad one block south. In the heart of Midtown Manhattan, the evidence is hard to dismiss: Greens, once so unappetizing that parents all over the country had to beg and bribe their children to eat them, have never been hotter. (Almost as hot: their denser, younger cousin, grains.)At Sweetgreen, the appeal is partly ethical. The ingredients are sustainably farmed, sourced from trusted partners and served with transparency. There are vegan, gluten-free and \u201cwarm bowl\u201d options. There are raw beets and organic carrots. There is local feta. It\u2019s enough to make the most wasteful among us feel good about consumerism. Is it any wonder that according to market research provided by Technomic, Sweetgreen is the fastest growing salad chain in the United States?The moral overtones extend even to the trash. As customers pay and head back toward their various workplaces, they pass an oft-overflowing garbage bin with a proud sign above it that says that all of the company\u2019s utensils, napkins, bowls and cups are plant-based, \u201cwhich means they go in the compost bin, along with any leftover food.\u201d\u201cNothing from inside Sweetgreen goes to the landfill,\u201d the sign declares further, virtuously.But that\u2019s far from the truth, though it\u2019s not the chain\u2019s fault.Matt Holtz, a salesman at Microsoft, is \u201caddicted\u201d to Sweetgreen, according to his co-worker, Michelle Munden, and goes almost every day. Mr. Holtz does not compost his disposable bowl once he is done eating, he said, though he \u201cwill compost if the opportunity is available.\u201dZara Watson, a lawyer who eats at Sweetgreen three times a week, throws the waste from her healthful lunch directly in the trash because she does not have composting at her office. So does Sam Hockley, the managing director at the software company Meltwater, who is willing to eat a Sweetgreen bowl for breakfast, lunch or dinner.But even as Sweetgreen and its wholesome brethren flourish, the compostable containers the chain puts such care into providing are, more often than not, going to a landfill. Picture the average salad obsessive: someone who eats right, exercises regularly, practices \u201cself-care\u201d \u2026 and throws his or her compostable waste, whether with guilt or casual oblivion, straight in the trash.\u201cI always see it, everyone\u2019s coming here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the salad destination. The typical design lunch. You\u2019re just eating kale. But it\u2019s really good!\u201dBut the healthy choice represented by a lunch at Sweetgreen, or at other healthy salad chains, is circumscribed by a punishing workweek and the city\u2019s waste disposal system.Sweetgreen\u2019s sales in 2017 grew 44.4 percent from 2016, faster than competitors like Chop\u2019t and Tender Greens, and it expanded to 92 locations, from 81 the previous year. It has thrived on an office culture in which antiquated things like \u201ccafeterias\u201d and \u201clunch hours\u201d are increasingly falling out of fashion.June Jo Lee, a food ethnographer who has traveled the country interviewing people about the way they eat, said that the working world had become so fast-paced, and involved so much complex collaboration, that people were eliminating their lunch hours, not only in the United States but increasingly, overseas.\u201cI remember seven years ago doing an interview with someone in Mexico City and they were saying the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are all these people waiting behind his chair for his job and he can\u2019t take a traditional lunch hour.\u201dSalad chains like Sweetgreen, Ms. Lee said, fit into that culture perfectly. Online ordering makes it a perfectly efficient lunch choice and the options available don\u2019t weigh its customers down like a burger would, allowing them to Just Keep Working.But if you were asking him anecdotally? \u201cYeah, sure, there\u2019s been an increase. Just by sight and sound, sure.\u201dMoreover, \u201cmost waste occurs at the consumer level,\u201d said Marc Bellemare, who directs the Center for International Food and Agricultural Policy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cRestaurants and grocery stores don\u2019t waste as much as consumers do.\u201d He added, \u201cmost of what gets wasted is not frozen pizza, it\u2019s not ice cream, it\u2019s produce, it\u2019s stuff that goes in salad. I suspect that the rise of those restaurants, my intuition is that those will mean the rise of food waste as well, because they sell this stuff to consumers, where the bulk of the losses tend to occur.\u201d Sweetgreen\u2019s most serious competitors \u2014 Chop't, Tender Greens and Saladworks \u2014 are still wedded to recyclable materials, though Chop\u2019t uses compostable fiber for its grain bowls. Another competitor, Just Salad, has more than 20 locations in New York and distributes reusable, washable plastic bowls to consumers. According to its director of marketing, Stephen Swartz, about a quarter of its customers use those bowls when they eat at the chain.\u201cJust Salad\u2019s reusable bowl program saves over 75,000 lbs. of plastic every year,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cAs we like to say, \u2018every bowl fulfills a goal.\u2019\u201dIn New York, despite a major effort by the city government over the past several years, that infrastructure is still being built. It is particularly difficult to compost from one\u2019s office, unless you work in a small business that makes a special push to do so. The city started collecting food waste five years ago, and only in the past two years has it begun to require some 2,100 of the city\u2019s more than 200,000 businesses to separate organic waste to be composted.Eric Goldstein, the New York City environment director at the Natural Resources Defense Council said that it typically takes a city about a decade to transition to successful composting and that New York faces several challenges, one of which is simply educating people on how to compost in the first place.\u201cIf you were to stop a person in the street, I don\u2019t know how many people could even tell you what composting really is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a large-scale program to let New Yorkers know why this is important and how to participate in the program.\u201dAnd of course, Mr. Goldstein said, composting itself is not the gold standard of eco-conscious lunch disposal.\u201cIt\u2019s still best to use reusable things, even before composting and recycling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut composting is an extremely valuable thing to do.\u201dConsumers do not like to feel wasteful, and experts say that, if educated, they might change their ways.\u201cPeople have this really gut negative reaction to seeing packaging waste,\u201d said Ms. Lee, who sympathizes with their lack of options. \u201cThere\u2019s guilt about what they\u2019re doing but it\u2019s also really inconvenient because it piles up.\u201d\u201cI'm like, \u2018ugh so much waste\u2019 and why can't there be a less wasteful way of doing it?\u201d she said, sounding pained. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we focus on that as a priority?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Real Google Censorship Scandal ", "Date": "2018-09-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s not about right-wing Americans. It\u2019s about China. Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Breitbart News described the 2016 video as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d because it showed Sergey Brin, the Google co-founder, telling everyone how he felt about the new leader of the free world.Spoiler: Not good.\u201cMyself, as an immigrant, as a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do, too,\u201d he said in his flat, nasal voice. He was obviously rattled, as were the other top Google executives on stage with him. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values.\u201dConservatives who have been spreading the canard that social media companies oppress their views \u2014 a drum Mr. Trump has himself been banging on lately \u2014 seized on the video as proof of Google\u2019s bias. But it should not have shocked anyone to find that Mr. Brin, a Russian exile who built the quirkiest of companies on the planet, is no fan of the president.Responding to the attack on its motives, a Google spokeswoman said, \u201cNothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.\u201d Blah blah blah. I don\u2019t mean to be cavalier. But I am astonished by the focus on this ridiculous scandal when a much more important issue concerning Google and censorship has been largely ignored by the public and by Washington.I\u2019m talking about the fact that Google is considering re-entering the Chinese market after leaving it with a lot of righteous indignation less than a decade ago. Reports say it might once again offer a range of services, including a censored version of its flagship search engine. A Google spokeswoman told me that the controversial effort \u2014 code-named Dragonfly \u2014 is \u201cexploratory,\u201d and that Google is \u201cnot close to launching a search product in China.\u201d What\u2019s most interesting is that much of the outrage about the possibility seems to be coming from Google employees who have registered strong objections, rather than from outside.For those who don\u2019t know the history, Google began operating in China in 2000 and in 2005 the Microsoft tech leader Kai-Fu Lee was hired as the head of Google China. By 2009 Google controlled more than 36 percent of the market share and served hundreds of millions of mainland Chinese users.It offered a truncated version of a search product, which included this disclaimer at the bottom of the page: \u201cSome results have been withheld because of the government restrictions.\u201d Google\u2019s justification for being there was that bringing more information to the information-starved Chinese was a good thing.\u201cAt least Chinese users knew what they were missing,\u201d Nicole Wong, a former top Google lawyer, recently explained to me on my podcast.The hope was that more information could help loosen the government\u2019s stranglehold. That did not happen.By 2010, Google was fed up with increasing repression and intrusions into its systems by Chinese-government-backed hackers. After a prolonged debate, Google withdrew to Hong Kong with a noncensored offering and was effectively out of the larger Chinese market. \u201cOur objection is to those forces of totalitarianism,\u201d Mr. Brin said at the time. He also wrote on his Google Plus page that the \u201cprimary threat by far to internet freedom is government filtering of political dissent.\u201d This rejection of censorship was a bold stance, setting Google apart from other companies, like Apple, that had compromised with the Chinese government in order to do business there.Fast forward to today, when Google is being falsely accused of censoring speech in the United States, when what it is really doing is mulling a return to censorship in China.If this makes you pause, it should, and Washington politicians should take all their sanctimony and direct it at the China issue, which actually deserves some scrutiny. Perhaps that is the real reason Google avoided sending its current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, to the recent Senate hearings, so he could avoid explaining what it was thinking when it came China 2.0: Now With 100 Percent More Hypocrisy.Google seems to have no problem climbing down off its high horse to grab the thing it needs in China.Which is, simply put, more data.That is what Ms. Wong and Dr. Lee, whom I also did a podcast interview with this week, suggested to me was the key impetus for the move.Right now, he notes, with China\u2019s aggressive use of sensors and you-say-facial-recognition-I-say-surveillance, a population hooked on mobile in a much more significant way than here and consumers more willing to trade away their privacy for digital convenience, China\u2019s internet companies have access to 10 to 15 times more data than American ones. Dr. Lee and others have called it a \u201cdata gap\u201d that Google has to bridge, and soon, if it wants to remain competitive.Ms. Wong agrees, noting that doing otherwise might give China the advantage in the next computing era.It\u2019s certainly a far cry from what he wrote with great emotion back in 2012 about leaving China:\u201cRegardless of how you feel about digital ecosystems or about Google, please do not take the free and open internet for granted from government intervention. To the extent that free flow of information threatens the powerful, those in power will seek to suppress it.\u201dWell said, Mr. Brin. Say it again.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Here\u2019s What You Didn\u2019t See on Miss America", "Date": "2018-09-10", "News": "Supported byATLANTIC CITY \u2014 If you tuned into the Miss America pageant last night, you may have noticed a few changes.For starters, this year\u2019s event was called a \u201ccompetition,\u201d not a \u201cpageant.\u201d The participants were \u201ccandidates\u201d \u2014 interviewing for the job of Miss America \u2014 not \u201ccontestants.\u201d There was no runway this year, and the word \u201cMiss\u201d had been stripped from the sashes, though each still had a little pocket that could conceal a lipstick tube.And, of course, in the wake of #MeToo, there were no swimsuits.This was the debut of the newer, woker Miss America \u2014 or \u201cMiss America 2.0,\u201d as it has been rebranded by its new chair, Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News anchor and Miss America 1989. This year\u2019s candidates, as the show\u2019s televised introduction explained, were \u201cdiverse and inclusive,\u201d \u201cempowered,\u201d \u201cleaders\u201d and \u201cbeautiful \u2014 inside and out.\u201dThe group included a neuroscience graduate from Harvard and a software developer for Microsoft whose platform was women in STEM. Candidates spoke about surviving cancer, growing up with incarcerated parents and campus sexual assault. Miss Michigan introduced herself by declaring: \u201cFrom the state with 84 percent of the U.S. fresh water but none for its residents to drink, I am Miss Michigan, Emily Sioma.\u201dBut what may not have been visible to those watching were the growing pains of Miss America 2.0. It\u2019s \u201ckind of a civil war,\u201d said Kirsten Haglund, the 2008 winner. Behind the scenes, state and local volunteers plotted a coup against Ms. Carlson, and the reigning Miss America blasted her on the \u201cToday\u201d show. Much of the turmoil hinges on the elimination of swimsuits, a lack of transparency in decision making, and the pressure to find relevance for a nearly 100-year-old institution in a very particular cultural moment. As Ms. Haglund put it: \u201cMiss America is never going to go back to the 1950s era of the silver screen. But what can it be for the 21st century?\u201dLater, there was that year the producers attempted to rebrand the competition as a reality show; the era that the show moved to Las Vegas (and cable); and the scandal of 1984, when Vanessa Williams, the first black Miss America, was stripped of her crown after it was revealed that she had appeared in Penthouse (the Miss America organization later apologized). \u201cSince the late \u201980s, Miss America has been adjusting its image to maintain relevance and keep viewership,\u201d said Margot Mifflin, an English professor at the City University of New York who is writing a cultural history of the pageant. \u201cPart of that is about the culture around it. At some point people didn\u2019t need to see scantily clad ladies on the stage anymore \u2014 they could see it on their computers.\u201dThe audience turnout has certainly been declining. This year program staff handed out fliers to random passers-by on the boardwalk, offering free tickets to fill up empty seats. \u201cAll you need to do is get dressed up, really nice, and show up to Boardwalk Hall,\u201d the flier read. Production staff said they pass these out every year, but this time, they had a reconfigured arena with fewer seats and they still had to give up more free seats.Maybe the usual crowds were turned off by the drama.Last December, it was revealed that Sam Haskell, the C.E.O., had sent vicious and lewd emails about former competitors, a move that only reinforced the perception of Miss America as retrograde and sexist.Ms. Carlson, who had become a leading figure in the #MeToo movement after her sexual harassment lawsuit against Fox, seemed like a perfect replacement \u2014 one who would help reform the pageant\u2019s image.\u201cShe seemed like a unanimous win,\u201d said Crystal Lee, a Miss America 2014 runner-up. \u201cWe saw her as a maverick, and a leader.\u201dAnd on Saturday, the day before the pageant, in perhaps the greatest show of revolt, more than 50 state leaders met privately in a hotel conference room to voice discontent with Ms. Carlson, and discuss legal action.Ms. Carlson declined to be interviewed for this article and remained largely out of sight for most of the week leading up to Miss America. She was holed up in the organization\u2019s corporate office, a small windowless space in the back of the stadium. (\u201cIt\u2019s the safest place to be in a hurricane,\u201d said Ida Jones, a longtime volunteer.) \u201cI keep saying to myself, O.K., what bomb is going to come today,\u201d said Bill Haggerty, a state leader from New Hampshire who has been involved in the organization for 50 years, and attended the meeting of state leaders. \u201cI\u2019ve heard online that a lot of people didn\u2019t want to come this year because they just didn\u2019t want to be involved in the drama.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a mess,\u201d said Suzette Charles, an actress and performer from New Jersey who was Miss America 1984. \u201cIt feels like every day, it\u2019s another thing. I keep thinking to myself, \u2018Is this a movie?\u2019\u201dIt\u2019s not a movie, but it is a show. This year, Miss Vermont\u2019s costume evoked her state\u2019s maple leaves and Miss Alabama\u2019s outfit was NASA-themed. Miss Georgia had Coca-Cola bottles on her shoes and Miss Mississippi festooned hers with hot air balloons.The women\u2019s costumes didn\u2019t count toward their competitive score. Instead, the candidates were judged on their 20-second answers to two interview questions, 8-second descriptions of their social and political platforms, and their 90-second talent performances.This year, the talents included singing, clogging, piano, ventriloquism (Miss Texas and two puppets had prepared a song by Johnny Cash), three monologues \u2014 including one by Nebraska\u2019s Jessica Shultis about her cancer diagnosis \u2014 a choreographed dance \u201cwith a ghost\u201d and speed painting by Delaware\u2019s Joanna Wicks, a high school art teacher, who managed to draw a rendition of Wonder Woman upside down, while swaying to Demi Lovato\u2019s \u201cConfident.\u201d Unfortunately, many of these performances didn\u2019t make it into the two-hour special.During the interview portion, Bridget Oei, a half-Irish, half-Chinese pre-med environmental chemistry graduate from Connecticut, was asked how she would advise women who want to compete but don\u2019t have a fine arts background. It was a chance to address some of the criticism that the competition leaves out those with talents that aren\u2019t usually performed in a gown onstage, like sports or coding.\u201cWe are heading into Miss America 2.0.,\u201d Ms. Oei said. \u201cWe have opportunity to showcase who women are, onstage and off.\u201dImmigrants, Miss Hawaii said, \u201care the basis of our country.\u201d And protests by N.F.L. players, said Miss Virginia, who won the interview portion of her preliminary competition, aren\u2019t about kneeling \u2014 they\u2019re about police brutality.The women are \u201cmore than just that,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to images of Vanessa Williams published in Penthouse magazine. She did not pose for the magazine; her images were sold to the magazine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "HBO and Netflix, Reluctant Rivals, Party Down After Winning 23 Emmys Apiece", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. \u2014 Richard Plepler, the chairman and chief executive officer of HBO, stood at the center of an airy plaza at the Pacific Design Center, where the network has held its post-Emmys party for more than a decade.Another awards season had just drawn to a close, with HBO and Netflix winning 23 Emmys apiece. HBO has long taken pride in its dominance of the Emmys, an honor that came close to ending Monday night. But Mr. Plepler bristled at the notion that there was a rivalry between the network he runs and the well-funded digital upstart.\u201cThis reductive idea that their success comes at our expense, or our success comes at their expense, is just not accurate,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cYou know how you know it\u2019s not accurate? Look at the last three, four years! We\u2019ve grown more in the last three, four years than at any time in history. They\u2019ve grown more. We\u2019ve done great work. They\u2019ve done great work. This is not a binary dynamic. Now \u2014\u2014 \u201dMr. Plepler looked to his left.\u201cLet me give the producer a hug,\u201d he said, moving into the arms of Lorne Michaels, the producer of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and the producer of the Monday night Emmys broadcast.\u201cMazel tov!\u201d Mr. Plepler said.Things had looked dicey for Mr. Plepler and his team until the final moments of the ceremony, when HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d took the statuette for best drama, the most prestigious award of the night.A sense of relief was palpable at the floral-themed HBO after-party. The music was not too loud, and the expansive room allowed for easy conversation. John Oliver, who had won his third Emmy in three years, in the best variety talk show category, walked by, and Mr. Plepler grabbed him and hugged him.\u201cThe thing we are proudest about is, in this incredibly fierce, competitive environment, the line of talent at our door is longer than it\u2019s ever been, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in that talent,\u201d Mr. Plepler said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes the network the network.\u201d\u201cAre we curating quality, are we curating excellence?\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd if we continue to do that, the awards are going to come and, more importantly, talent is going to keep coming.\u201dA few tables away stood Mr. Plepler\u2019s new boss: John Stankey, an AT&T executive of three decades.\u201cThere he is, there he is,\u201d Mr. Plepler said, gesturing toward Mr. Stankey.After mentioning that the two had sat together at the Microsoft Theater, Mr. Plepler added, \u201cHe\u2019s fully in the business now.\u201dIf Mr. Plepler had played down talk of a rivalry with Netflix, Mr. Stankey did not shy away from the subject. \u201cPercentage wise,\u201d he said, \u201cwe performed a lot better, a much higher win-loss ratio.\u201dDecades ago, HBO was in the position Netflix is in now, playing the role of challenger in an industry that was set in its ways. A longtime HBO advertising motto highlighted how different it was, in form and content, from the advertising-driven television business: \u201cIt\u2019s Not TV, It\u2019s HBO.\u201dAnd as it billed itself as the home to what would be called prestige TV, its marketing materials announced with pride, year after year, that it had won more Emmys than anyone else.But now, like every champion getting on in years, HBO has found that it must adjust its strategy if it is to avoid being knocked out by the competitors \u2014 Netflix, Amazon, Hulu \u2014 who would like to take its place as the envy of the industry.Amazon, with a significantly smaller programming slate than Netflix\u2019s, also had a strong night, winning five Emmys during the telecast, including best comedy for \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d The victory represented the first time a streaming service had taken the award.Netflix\u2019s 23 wins were the result of an aggressive strategy. It has reached its tentacles into many genres \u2014 from limited series, to reality shows, to stand-up specials \u2014 in an effort to appeal to almost every conceivable niche audience. The company is spending about $8 billion on content this year, roughly $6 billion more than HBO lays out annually for its programming.After the Emmys ceremony, Netflix\u2019s executives and stars packed NeueHouse, a fashionable work space in Hollywood located a few blocks from its new headquarters. Music was blasting, thanks to the of-the-moment D.J. Daisy O\u2019Dell, who had worked the CAA party on Saturday night and the Showtime party on Sunday.The revelers included Dave Chappelle, Jeff Daniels and Tiffany Haddish. They wended their way through narrow hallways covered in thick curtains in a shade best described as Netflix red. Ben Stiller held court in a murkily lit corridor until one of the many security guards present reluctantly told him he was blocking traffic.\u201cThrilled to share the night with HBO,\u201d Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix, said in an email. \u201cThe fact that our wins were across so many titles and forms made me particularly proud of the work of our creators and the team at Netflix.\u201dThe morning after the parties, the Nielsen numbers were in, and they were sobering. Despite all the hoopla \u2014 the campaign-season parties, the red-carpet events and acceptance speeches \u2014 the Emmys telecast had scored a low in the ratings, with 10.2 million viewers, a loss of 11 percent compared with last year\u2019s show.Advertisement"}

Mr. Ma turns 54 on Monday, which is also a holiday in China known as Teacher\u2019s Day.The retirement makes Mr. Ma one of the first founders among a generation of prominent Chinese internet entrepreneurs to step down from their companies. Firms including Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu and JD.com have flourished in recent years, growing to nearly rival American internet behemoths like Amazon and Google in their size, scope and ambition. For Chinese tycoons to step aside in their 50s is rare; they usually remain at the top of their organizations for many years.Mr. Ma, a natural salesman and charismatic leader, co-founded Alibaba with 17 others \u2014 some of them his students \u2014 out of his apartment in Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province in 1999.Alibaba started as an online marketplace for businesses to sell their products to other businesses. But it did not take off until it began the Taobao marketplace in 2003, which merchants used to sell goods directly to consumers. Alibaba later rolled out Alipay, an online payment service, to facilitate transactions in a country where few people had credit cards. Alipay later became Ant Financial, the financial subsidiary that Mr. Ma also controls.Today, Alibaba\u2019s empire encompasses e-commerce, online banking, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment \u2014 and even a corporate messaging service similar to Slack. The company owns or holds stakes in some of China\u2019s most important media assets, including the Twitter-like social media site Weibo and the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper The South China Morning Post.Among China\u2019s biggest companies, Alibaba is viewed as one of the firms with the deepest ranks of management talent. Many of the co-founders are still around, and professionals who joined the company later are now in charge.While Alibaba has become dominant in China, it has faced a tougher time expanding internationally. The company has increased its presence outside of China by investing in e-commerce and online finance companies in India and Southeast Asia. But its efforts to muscle into the United States largely have not been successful.As Beijing has increased its involvement in the private sector, Mr. Ma has shifted what he has said about China\u2019s government.

{"Headline": "U.S. Accuses North Korea of Plot to Hurt Economy as Spy Is Charged in Sony Hack", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 North Korea engaged in a yearslong effort to hack into American companies and steal from financial institutions around the globe, the Justice Department charged on Thursday in a 174-page criminal complaint that detailed how hackers caused hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of damage to the global economy.North Korea seemed primarily motivated by its continuing need for cash, as other countries have refused to do business with Pyongyang, and a desire to control American corporate behavior through fear. WannaCry presented the possibility that the North also wanted to sow chaos.The complaint was the most specific public accounting yet of North Korea\u2019s cyberattacks against other countries. The Justice Department has now brought charges against state actors from North Korea, China, Iran and Russia, the United States\u2019 most formidable cyberfoes.Mr. Trump wrote that Mr. Kim, whom he has sought to engage on nuclear talks, \u201cproclaims \u2018unwavering faith in President Trump.\u2019 Thank you to Chairman Kim. We will get it done together!\u201dIt was unclear whether Mr. Trump knew about the forthcoming complaint. A Justice Department official would not directly answer when asked whether he was briefed in advance.The complaint against Mr. Park was filed under seal on June 8, just four days before Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim held a historic summit meeting in Singapore.The complaint described only one side of the yearslong cyberconflict between North Korea and the United States. It made no mention of the American-led attacks on North Korea\u2019s missile program, ordered by President Barack Obama months before the Sony attack. And it omitted the source of some of the weapons in the WannaCry attack, which were leaked or stolen from the National Security Agency, though the United States has not publicly conceded that.Cyberattacks have not been a topic of the recent negotiations with North Korea. But as the complaint makes clear, such weapons have been the North\u2019s primary tool against American targets.\u201cThe North Korean government, through a state-sponsored group, robbed a central bank and citizens of other nations, retaliated against free speech in order to chill it half a world away, and created disruptive malware that indiscriminately affected victims in more than 150 other countries, causing hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars\u2019 worth of damage,\u201d John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, said in a statement.\u201cThese charges will send a message that we will track down malicious actors no matter how or where they hide,\u201d he added.Mr. Park, who also went by the alias Pak Jin Hek, is unlikely to see the inside of an American courtroom. The United States has no direct, formal relations with North Korea and did not communicate with its reclusive government ahead of the charges.Adding him to the Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions list means that no financial institution that does business in the United States can also do business with or provide accounts to Mr. Park or Chosun Expo Joint Venture, the company he worked for that American officials said was a front for the government. He actually appeared to work for North Korea\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, the country\u2019s closest equivalent to the C.I.A., intelligence officials said.The sanctions are unlikely to have much effect on Mr. Park and are a less powerful tool than the criminal charges in ensuring that Mr. Park cannot travel far outside North Korea and outing him as a state-sponsored hacker.In its complaint, the government mapped out a yearslong, brazen scheme to undermine institutions around the world and steal millions of dollars.North Korea broke into the systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment in late 2014 in retaliation for the company\u2019s production of a comedic film, \u201cThe Interview,\u201d that mocked Mr. Kim and depicted a plot to assassinate him.The attack wiped out 70 percent of the studio\u2019s computer capability, erasing all the data on about half of the company\u2019s personal computers and more than half of its servers. Sony was left without voice mail, email or production systems, essentially crippling operations.A month later, the F.B.I. pinned the crime on North Korea and the White House soon imposed sanctions on the country.Mr. Park and the other North Korean hackers would go on to engage in cyberattacks around the globe.From 2015 through 2018, they attacked banks to amass funds for North Korea, according to the complaint. They infiltrated Bangladesh Bank in 2016 by sending malware-ridden emails to employees, a practice known as phishing, and eventually gained access to computers connected to the global banking communication system.They directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to transfer money from Bangladesh Bank to accounts in other Asian countries, stealing $81 million. Only because an alert official at the reserve bank noticed that the word \u201cfoundation\u201d was spelled \u201cfandation\u201d did the transaction get additional scrutiny, and it was halted before more than an additional $900 million was transferred, the complaint said.Over the same time, the North unsuccessfully targeted American defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, with spear-phishing emails, in which malicious files or links are sent in a seemingly innocuous message.The complaint gave the most detailed technical accounting yet of how the crippling WannaCry malware made its way around the globe. It also made clear that the malware turned into an unguided missile \u2014 in which the British health care system, which used outdated Microsoft operating systems, turned out to be especially vulnerable.It acknowledged that some of the code, originally from the National Security Agency, was published by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers. But the code\u2019s American roots went unmentioned in the complaint \u2014 in essence, an extension of the American government\u2019s position that the North, rather than the American code makers who lost their weapons, bore complete responsibility for the attack.North Korea operated relatively freely in China, according to the complaint. Chosun Expo Joint Venture helped fund North Korean hacking organizations by doing legitimate programming work from an office in Dalian, China, a coastal city near North Korea. Some customers knew the employees \u201cwere North Korean computer programmers connected to the government,\u201d the complaint said.Mr. Park, who worked there from 2011 to 2013, and his colleagues were overseen by a company manager and North Korean political attach\u00e9\u0301, the Justice Department said.Even though the Justice Department made clear that many North Koreans were involved in the attacks, only Mr. Park was charged because the government apparently believed it had evidence to convict only him beyond a reasonable doubt, said John Carlin, the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.The Justice Department said the investigation is continuing. The indictment took years to put together, in part because it covers multiple hacking campaigns and because the government cannot use classified information when it brings a criminal case against a nation-state.\u201cIn order to get admissible evidence,\u201d Mr. Carlin said, \u201cprosecutors have to work through any issues the intelligence community might have.\u201dAdam Goldman contributed reporting from Washington, and Brooks Barnes from Los Angeles.videoAdvertisement"}

Unfortunately, the chances are pretty good that Google will lose \u2014 that the court will order the company to make certain information harder to find. For example, if you are in the United States and you use Google to search for a New York Times article that has been removed from European versions of the search engine, that article will no longer appear in your results.We should be equally worried, however, about the prospect of platforms like Google and Facebook, with their international reach and pervasive role in our lives, doing the bidding of governments around the world.For now, very few countries are asking online platforms to enforce their national laws elsewhere. And the courts that are considering worldwide removal orders mostly sit in democratic and rights-respecting countries. That should give us some hope for better outcomes in those cases. But it also means that their decisions will carry a lot of weight, and set expectations for other national courts and lawmakers about their own power to make platforms globally remove content.Governments around the world know that while online platforms have historically enabled the free flow of information, that needn\u2019t be the case forever. Technical intermediaries can just as easily become choke points, shutting down communication on prohibited topics. Governments of any country have at least some leverage to make this happen: National internet service providers can cut off access entirely. In 2016, for example, Malaysia blocked the entire Medium blogging platform for refusing to delete a London-based journalist\u2019s accounts of corruption in the Malaysian government.That kind of showdown is rare, though. As a matter of both law and international relations, few countries are willing to insist that the rest of the world be bound by their rules. Things should stay that way \u2014 particularly among countries whose laws meet international human rights standards, and vary only in interpreting things like the balance between privacy and speech rights.We would all suffer under a system in which any country could export its own rules through private online platforms. Let\u2019s hope that the European Court of Justice sees things that way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Plot to Subvert an Election: Unraveling the Russia Story So Far", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "Police never identified who had hung the banners, but there were clues. The earliest promoters of the images on Twitter were American-sounding accounts, including @LeroyLovesUSA, later exposed as Russian fakes operated from St. Petersburg to influence American voters.The Kremlin, it appeared, had reached onto United States soil in New York and Washington. The banners may well have been intended as visual victory laps for the most effective foreign interference in an American election in history.For many Americans, the Trump-Russia story as it has been voluminously reported over the past two years is a confusing tangle of unfamiliar names and cyberjargon, further obscured by the shout-fest of partisan politics. What Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in charge of the investigation, may know or may yet discover is still uncertain. President Trump\u2019s Twitter outbursts that it is all a \u201choax\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d in the face of a mountain of evidence to the contrary, have taken a toll on public comprehension.But to travel back to 2016 and trace the major plotlines of the Russian attack is to underscore what we now know with certainty: The Russians carried out a landmark intervention that will be examined for decades to come. Acting on the personal animus of Mr. Putin, public and private instruments of Russian power moved with daring and skill to harness the currents of American politics. Well-connected Russians worked aggressively to recruit or influence people inside the Trump campaign.To many Americans, the intervention seemed to be a surprise attack, a stealth cyberage Pearl Harbor, carried out by an inexplicably sinister Russia. For Mr. Putin, however, it was long-overdue payback, a justified response to years of \u201cprovocations\u201d from the United States.And there is a plausible case that Mr. Putin succeeded in delivering the presidency to his admirer, Mr. Trump, though it cannot be proved or disproved. In an election with an extraordinarily close margin, the repeated disruption of the Clinton campaign by emails published on WikiLeaks and the anti-Clinton, pro-Trump messages shared with millions of voters by Russia could have made the difference, a possibility Mr. Trump flatly rejects.As Mr. Trump emerged in spring 2016 as the improbable favorite for the Republican nomination, the Russian operation accelerated on three fronts \u2014 the hacking and leaking of Democratic documents; massive fraud on Facebook and Twitter; and outreach to Trump campaign associates.Consider 10 days in March. On March 15 of that year, Mr. Trump won five primaries, closing in on his party\u2019s nomination, and crowed that he had become \u201cthe biggest political story anywhere in the world.\u201d That same day in Moscow, a veteran hacker named Ivan Yermakov, a Russian military intelligence officer working for a secret outfit called Unit 26165, began probing the computer network of the Democratic National Committee. In St. Petersburg, shift workers posted on Facebook and Twitter at a feverish pace, posing as Americans and following instructions to attack Mrs. Clinton.On March 21 in Washington, Mr. Trump announced his foreign policy team, a group of fringe figures whose advocacy of warmer relations with Russia ran counter to Republican orthodoxy. Meanwhile, Unit 26165 was poring over the bounty from a separate attack it had just carried out: 50,000 emails stolen from the Clinton campaign\u2019s chairman.On March 24, one of the members of the Trump foreign policy team, George Papadopoulos, sat in the cafe of an upscale London hotel with a Russian woman who introduced herself as Mr. Putin\u2019s niece and offered to help set up a meeting between the Russian president and Mr. Trump. The woman and the adviser exchanged frequent messages in the weeks that followed. Today, Mr. Padadopoulos is unsure that those messages came from the person he met in the cafe.The Russian intervention was essentially a hijacking \u2014 of American companies like Facebook and Twitter; of American citizens\u2019 feelings about immigration and race; of American journalists eager for scoops, however modest; of the na\u00efve, or perhaps not so na\u00efve, ambitions of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers. The Russian trolls, hackers and agents totaled barely 100, and their task was to steer millions of American voters. They knew it would take a village to sabotage an election.Russians or suspected Russian agents \u2014 including oligarchs, diplomats, former military officers and shadowy intermediaries \u2014 had dozens of contacts during the campaign with Mr. Trump\u2019s associates. They reached out through email, Facebook and Twitter. They sought introductions through trusted business connections of Mr. Trump\u2019s, obscure academic institutions, veterans groups and the National Rifle Association.They met Trump campaign aides in Moscow, London, New York and Louisville, Ky. One claimed the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton; another Russian, the Trump campaign was told, would deliver it. In May and June alone, the Trump campaign fielded at least four invitations to meet with Russian intermediaries or officials.In nearly every case, the Trump aides and associates seemed enthusiastic about their exchanges with the Russians. Over months of such probing, it seems that no one alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the foreign overtures.Whether Mr. Trump or any of his associates conspired with the Russians is a central question of the investigation by Mr. Mueller, who has already charged 26 Russians and won convictions or guilty pleas from the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn; the former campaign chairman, Paul J. Manafort, and his deputy, Rick Gates; and from Mr. Papadopoulos. Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has pleaded guilty in a separate case.But none of the convictions to date involve conspiracy. There remains an alternative explanation to the collusion theory: that the Trump aides, far from certain their candidate would win, were happy to meet the Russians because they thought it might lead to moneymaking deals after the election. \u201cBlack Caviar,\u201d read the subject line of an email Mr. Manafort got in July 2016 from his associate in Kiev, Ukraine, hinting at the possibility of new largess from a Russian oligarch with whom they had done business.Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School and the great-granddaughter of the Soviet premier Nikita S. Khrushchev, said that what Russia pulled off, through creativity and sheer luck, would have been the envy of Mr. Putin\u2019s predecessors: puncturing the American sense of superiority and insisting on Russia\u2019s power and place in the world.\u201cThis operation was to show the Americans \u2014 that you bastards are just as screwed up as the rest of us,\u201d Professor Khrushcheva said. \u201cPutin fulfilled the dream of every Soviet leader \u2014 to stick it to the United States. I think this will be studied by the K.G.B.\u2019s successors for a very long time.\u201dDirect contactswith Russians byTrump officialsJUNE 16, 2015Trump announcescandidacyTime2016Russian socialmedia fraudRussianhackingDenials ofwrongdoing byTrump and associatesMAY 26, 2016Trump clinchesnominationNOV. 8, 2016Trump winselectionFederalinvestigation ofRussian meddlingJAN. 20, 2017InaugurationJANUARY2018SEPTEMBER2018Continuing\u2026JUNE 2015TrumpannouncescandidacyDirect contactswith RussiansTimeRussiansocial mediafraud2016RussianhackingMAY 2016Trump clinchesnominationELECTIONFederalinvestigationINAUGURATIONDenials ofwrongdoing byTrump and associatesJANUARY2018SEPTEMBER2018By The New York TimesSee the full timeline of events.The Russian leader thought the United States, and Hillary Clinton, had sought to undermine his presidency.The first Russian advance party was tiny: two women on a whirlwind American tour. Hitting nine states in three weeks in summer 2014, Anna Bogacheva and Aleksandra Krylova were supposed to \u201cgather intelligence\u201d to help them mimic Americans on Facebook and Twitter. They snapped photos and chatted up strangers from California to New York, on a sort of Russian \u201cThelma & Louise\u201d road trip for the era of social media.Even then, federal prosecutors would later say, the Russian government was thinking about the next United States presidential election \u2014 perhaps ahead of most Americans. Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova had been dispatched by their employer, an online propaganda factory in St. Petersburg, to prepare to influence American voters.But why did Mr. Putin care about the election, then more than two years away? He was seething. The United States, in his view, had bullied and interfered with Russia for long enough. It was high time to fight back.His motives were rooted in Russia\u2019s ambivalence toward the West, captured in the history of St. Petersburg, Russia\u2019s spectacular northern city and Mr. Putin\u2019s hometown. Peter the Great, the brutal but westward-looking 18th-century czar, had brought in the best Italian architects to construct Russia\u2019s \u201cwindow on Europe\u201d in a swamp.Czar Peter\u2019s portrait replaced Vladimir Lenin\u2019s in Mr. Putin\u2019s office when he took a job working for the city\u2019s mayor in the early 1990s. Twenty-five years later, the internet offered a different kind of window on the West \u2014 a portal that could be used for a virtual invasion.Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, had described the breakup of the Soviet Union as the \u201cgreatest geopolitical catastrophe\u201d of the 20th century, a remarkable statement from a man whose country experienced revolution, civil war, bloody purges and the deaths of 27 million people in World War II. Like many of his fellow citizens, Mr. Putin was nostalgic for Russia\u2019s lost superpower status. And he resented what he saw as American arrogance.With little evidence, Mr. Putin believed this American meddling helped produce street demonstrations in Moscow and other cities in 2011, with crowds complaining of a rigged parliamentary election and chanting, \u201cPutin\u2019s a thief!\u201dRequired fields are marked with an asterisk.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.And Mrs. Clinton, then secretary of state, cheered the protesters on. Russians, she said, \u201cdeserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted, and that means they deserve free, fair, transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them.\u201dAfter Russian troops seized Crimea and carried out a stealth invasion of Ukraine in 2014, relations grew openly hostile. American support for the new government in Kiev and condemnation of Russian behavior heightened Mr. Putin\u2019s rage at being told what he could do and not do in what he considered his own backyard.If Russia had only a fraction of the United States\u2019 military might and nothing like its economic power, it had honed its abilities in hacking and influence operations through attacks in Eastern Europe. And it could turn these weapons on America to even the score.By making mischief in the 2016 election, Mr. Putin could wreak revenge on his enemy, Mrs. Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee, damaging if not defeating her. He could highlight the polarized state of American democracy, making it a less appealing model for Russians and their neighbors. And he could send a message that Russia would not meekly submit to a domineering America.Hence the two Russian women who toured the United States in 2014, keyboard warriors granted the unusual privilege of real-world travel, hitting both coasts, Illinois, Louisiana and Texas. At that point, according to a Russian document cited by the special counsel, Mr. Putin\u2019s intentions for 2016 were already explicit: to \u201cspread distrust toward the candidates and the political system in general.\u201d\u201cWho is behind these provocations?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe know that among them are employees of official American institutions.\u201dThen something unexpected happened. Of the more than 20 major-party candidates running for the American presidency, only Mr. Trump had repeatedly expressed admiration for Mr. Putin as a \u201cstrong\u201d leader and brushed off criticism of Russia. Only he had little interest in the traditional American preoccupation with democracy and human rights. Only he had explored business interests in Russia for years, repeatedly pursuing a Trump Tower project in Moscow and bringing his beauty pageant there in 2013.\u201cDo you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow,\u201d the future candidate tweeted at the time, adding wistfully, \u201cif so, will he become my new best friend?\u201dIf Mr. Putin had been designing his ideal leader for the United States, he could hardly have done better than Donald Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s always a great honor to be so nicely complimented,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cby a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.\u201dAs Donald J. Trump emerged as the favorite for the nomination, his campaign brought on aides tied to Russia.Mr. Trump had steamrollered his primary opponents in part by taking aim at Republican foreign policy orthodoxy. The post-9/11 wars were foolish and costly, he would often say at campaign events. America\u2019s allies were deadbeats and freeloaders, he told supporters, who cheered in agreement. Russia was not an existential threat, he said, but a potential ally in beating back terrorist groups.They took particular umbrage at Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about the Russian president, writing that his \u201cadmiration for foreign dictators such as Vladimir Putin is unacceptable for the leader of the world\u2019s greatest democracy.\u201dBut Mr. Trump was not cowed. He soon signed on new advisers and aides, including some who had been pushed to the fringe of a political party that had long lionized President Ronald Reagan for staring down Soviet leaders at the height of the Cold War.To the Kremlin, they must have looked like a dream team.Mr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, had long viewed Russia as a natural ally in what he saw as a \u201cworld war\u201d against radical Islam. In June 2013, when he was D.I.A. chief, he sat inside the imposing headquarters of the G.R.U., Russia\u2019s military intelligence agency, and chatted with officers. Two years later, he sat at Mr. Putin\u2019s elbow at a gala dinner in Moscow.Mr. Manafort, a longtime Republican lobbyist, had earned millions working for a pro-Kremlin leader in Ukraine and had a history of business dealings with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian aluminum magnate close to Mr. Putin. He was nearly broke when he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 \u2014 hired to help prevent a mass defection of convention delegates \u2014 and yet he offered to work on the campaign unpaid.Carter Page, a businessman who spent several years working in Moscow, was virtually unknown in Washington when Mr. Trump appointed him a foreign policy adviser. But the S.V.R., Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, knew who he was.In 2013, Mr. Page met in New York with a Russian spy posing as an attach\u00e9 at the United Nations and passed along energy industry documents in hopes of securing lucrative deals in Moscow.The F.B.I., which had been tracking Russian spies when Mr. Page came on the bureau\u2019s radar, determined that he had no idea he was meeting with a Russian agent.The new team was in place by the end of March, and Mr. Trump had a new message that was strikingly similar to one of Mr. Putin\u2019s most ardent talking points.\u201cNATO\u2019s not meant for terrorism,\u201d he went on to say. \u201cNATO doesn\u2019t have the right countries in it for terrorism.\u201dBy then, the Russian intelligence operation to intervene in the American election \u2014 including efforts to infiltrate and influence the Trump campaign \u2014 had begun.Mr. Papadopoulos, the 28-year-old campaign adviser, did not know this when he met in the cafe of the London hotel with Mr. Putin\u2019s \u201cniece\u201d (he has no niece) and an obscure Maltese professor in late March. The academic had taken an interest in Mr. Papadopoulos when he joined the campaign.F.B.I. agents have identified the professor, Joseph Mifsud, as a likely cutout for Russian intelligence, sent to establish contact with Mr. Papadopoulos and possibly get information about the direction of the Trump campaign. He disappeared after his name surfaced last October, and his whereabouts is unknown. At one point he changed his WhatsApp status to a simple, if cryptic, message: \u201cAlive.\u201dProfessor Mifsud arranged an email introduction between Mr. Papadopoulos and a Russian foreign ministry official. The American also exchanged emails with Olga Polonskaya, the woman in the cafe. \u201cWe are all very excited by the possibility of a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d she wrote in one message, and the two discussed a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump.Over time, though, Mr. Papadopoulos came to question whether the messages were actually from Ms. Polonskaya. The woman he had met in the cafe barely spoke English. The emails he received were in nearly perfect English.\u201cI even remember sending her a message asking if I\u2019m speaking to the same person I met in London because the conversations were so strange,\u201d he said during an interview this month.In late April, Mr. Trump gave his first major foreign policy address in the ballroom of a historic Washington hotel. Some of the speech was a familiar litany of Republican policy positions \u2014 hawkish warnings to Iran and pledges to be tough on terrorism. But midway through the speech, as Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States watched from the front seats, Mr. Trump pivoted and said the United States and Russia should look for areas of mutual interest.\u201cCommon sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility, must end, and ideally will end soon,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s the signal to meet,\u201d Mr. Papadopoulos wrote in an email to his Russian foreign ministry contact that evening, meaning that Mr. Trump\u2019s favorable comments about Russia suggested he might be interested in meeting Mr. Putin.Just one day earlier, Professor Mifsud had told the campaign aide about a possible gift from Moscow: thousands of hacked emails that might damage Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy.It was a breathtaking revelation. But there was no evidence that Mr. Papadopoulos \u2014 while ambitious and eager for advancement in the bare-bones campaign \u2014 passed the information along to anyone inside the Trump circle.More than two years later, Mr. Papadopoulos says he has \u201cno recollection\u201d of telling anyone in the campaign about the emails. He said he was supposed to have a phone call that day with Stephen Miller, a top campaign adviser, but it was postponed. If the two men had talked, Mr. Papadopoulos said, he might have shared the information.\u201cHow fate works sometimes, I guess,\u201d said Mr. Papadopoulos, who has been sentenced to 14 days in jail for lying to the F.B.I.As Mr. Trump continued to win primaries and vacuum up convention delegates late in the spring, the Russians made multiple attempts to establish contact with campaign officials.A Republican operative connected to the N.R.A. tried to arrange a meeting between Mr. Trump and a Russian central banker at an N.R.A. convention in Kentucky in May. \u201cPutin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,\u201d wrote the operative, Paul Erickson, in an email with the subject \u201cKremlin connection.\u201d \u201cEver since Hillary compared Putin to Hitler, all senior Russian leaders consider her beyond redemption.\u201dMr. Page, the foreign policy adviser, was invited to deliver the commencement address at the prestigious New Economic School in Moscow. That invitation now appears to have been an effort both to gain information about the Trump campaign and to influence it by feting Mr. Page in the Russian capital. Russian television that year was describing him as a \u201cfamous American economist,\u201d but he was an obscure figure in this country.At that time, the last American to give the commencement speech was Mr. Obama, who used the opportunity to criticize Russia for its treatment of Georgia and Ukraine.Mr. Page, though, criticized the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the United States and its NATO allies for lecturing Russia about bullying its neighbors, which were former Soviet republics, while the Westerners were taking \u201cproactive steps to encourage regime change overseas.\u201d During his time in Moscow, Mr. Page met with at least one top Russian official and numerous business leaders.And there was the now infamous June 2016 approach to Donald Trump Jr. by Russians whom he and his father had known from their days taking the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. The Russians met at Trump Tower in Manhattan with top campaign officials after promising damaging information on Mrs. Clinton.See the timeline of events that surround the Trump Tower meeting.What exactly transpired during the meeting is still a mystery, but it appears that the Russians pulled a bait-and-switch. They used the session to push for an end to the crippling economic sanctions that Mr. Obama had imposed on Russia.Donald Trump Jr. has said how disappointed he and other campaign advisers were that they didn\u2019t get what the Russians had promised. The campaign\u2019s reaction to the Russian attempts to discredit Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign was not to rebuff them or call law enforcement \u2014 it was to try to exploit them.Experts who have studied Russian operations for decades see the catalog of contacts and communications between Russians and Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers as a loosely coordinated effort by Russian intelligence both to get insight into the campaign and to influence it.\u201cThe Russians aren\u2019t reckless, and I don\u2019t see them going through with this effort without thinking they had a willing partner in the dance,\u201d said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. officer who served as the spy agency\u2019s station chief in Moscow.By midsummer 2016, the Russian contacts sounded alarms inside the F.B.I., where agents had received a tip about Mr. Papadopoulos and puzzled over Mr. Page\u2019s Moscow visit. The bureau sent a trusted informant to help understand what was happening: Stefan Halper, a former Nixon and Reagan adviser and professor at Cambridge University, reached out to Mr. Page and Mr. Papadopoulos under false pretenses.American officials have defended Professor Halper\u2019s work, saying the use of such a confidential informant is routine in a counterintelligence investigation. Mr. Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have called him something different: a \u201cspy\u201d sent by the Obama administration to infiltrate the campaign.Eventually, Mr. Trump would use such episodes as a foundation for his view that America\u2019s law enforcement agencies had been aligned against him from the beginning \u2014 ammunition for a looming war with the \u201cdeep state.\u201d This idea would consume Mr. Trump after he became president, feeding his sense of grievance that the legitimacy of his victory was under attack and shaping his decisions as he tried to blunt the widening Russia investigation.The long-promised \u201cdirt\u201d the Russians had on Mrs. Clinton would soon be made public. Three days after the Trump Tower meeting, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, appeared on a British Sunday television show.He said that his website would soon be publishing a raft of emails related to Mrs. Clinton. And he said something at once ominous and prescient: \u201cWikiLeaks has a very big year ahead.\u201dUsing a hacker persona, Russian military intelligence officers began to reveal documents stolen from the Democrats. A website made its splashy debut three days later, presenting a jaunty hacker who called himself Guccifer 2.0. He had broken into the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computer network, Guccifer said, offering as proof a selection of purloined documents.\u201cHere are just a few docs from many thousands I extracted when hacking into the DNC\u2019s network,\u201d Guccifer wrote on June 15. \u201cThe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to WikiLeaks,\u201d he added \u2014 which seemed to explain Mr. Assange\u2019s boast.Russian intelligence had worked fast. Just the day before, D.N.C. officials and their cybersecurity contractor, CrowdStrike, had announced that Russian hackers had penetrated the committee\u2019s computer network.Overnight, Russian military intelligence officers set up the website and created the Guccifer persona to counter the D.N.C. accusations. Guccifer \u2014 a name borrowed from a real Romanian hacker \u2014 was presented as a jovial Romanian, a \u201clone hacker,\u201d who in his posts wanted to make one thing very clear: He had nothing whatsoever to do with Russia.Yet the Guccifer gambit would prove remarkably effective at creating doubt about Russia\u2019s responsibility for the hack. Republican operatives working on congressional campaigns emailed \u201cGuccifer\u201d and received hacked documents relevant to their races. For journalists, the claims of the supposed \u201clone hacker\u201d made the role of Russian intelligence seem to be a disputed allegation rather than a proven fact.See the timeline of hacking that led to the indictment.The agency, now called the Main Directorate but often referred to by its former abbreviation, the G.R.U., proved agile, brazen and not terribly discreet \u2014 the same pattern it would show two years later in the nerve-agent poisoning in England of its former officer, the defector Sergei V. Skripal.The hacking might have drawn little attention had the G.R.U. stopped there, simply stealing emails to peruse for intelligence clues. But the Russians\u2019 decision to leak the emails to undercut Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy was a huge escalation.The Russian officers\u2019 political skills proved equal to their hacking expertise. They deftly manipulated a long list of Americans and Europeans, many of whom embraced Guccifer\u2019s tall tale and took seriously the claim that the other Russian false front, DCLeaks.com, was run by American \u201chacktivists.\u201dBut the Russians\u2019 masterstroke was to enlist, via the Guccifer persona, the help of WikiLeaks. Neither of the Russians\u2019 websites, Guccifer 2.0 or DCLeaks.com, had much reach. But WikiLeaks had a large global audience. Its editor, Mr. Assange, shared Mr. Putin\u2019s hatred of Mrs. Clinton and had a soft spot for Russia.Mr. Assange assisted with the subterfuge. He repeatedly denied that he\u2019d received the documents from Russia; whether he was really taken in by the \u201cGuccifer\u201d ruse is uncertain.\u201cThat was just a robbery, I believe, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d the interviewer said. \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m suggesting that our sources take risks,\u201d Mr. Assange said \u2014 and then declined to say if Mr. Rich was a source.Unknown to the feuding Democratic delegates, a cyberdrama had been playing out in secret for weeks, as CrowdStrike experts tried to root out the Russian hackers who had penetrated the D.N.C. and its sister organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.Robert S. Johnston, a lead investigator for CrowdStrike, said the Russian hackers, uniformed officers of military intelligence, were \u201clike a thunderstorm moving through the system \u2014 very, very noisy.\u201dCrowdStrike had begun watching the Russians in April, asking D.N.C. staffers to keep quiet about the intrusion. \u201cWe only talked over Signal,\u201d an encrypted text and call service, said Mr. Johnston, a former Marine and veteran of the United States Cyber Command who is now chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Adlumin. Only by following the hackers for several weeks could CrowdStrike be certain it had found the Russians\u2019 tools and blocked their access.But somehow, possibly by intercepting communications inside the D.N.C. or the F.B.I., which was investigating the breach, the G.R.U. officers learned they had been spotted. On May 31, two weeks before the public disclosure of the hack, Ivan Yermakov, a G.R.U. hacker who had used American-sounding online personas \u2014 \u201cKate S. Milton,\u201d \u201cJames McMorgans\u201d and \u201cKaren W. Millen\u201d \u2014 suddenly began searching online for information about CrowdStrike. He sought to find out what the cybersleuths knew about the Russians\u2019 main tool, a nasty piece of malware called X-Agent, the indictment noted.After that, the spy-versus-spy contest escalated. \u201cWe knew it was the Russians, and they knew we knew,\u201d Mr. Johnston said. \u201cI would say it was the cyber equivalent of hand-to-hand combat.\u201dThe candidate favored by the Russians alternated between denying their help and seeming to welcome it. On June 15, the day after the D.N.C. hack was disclosed, the Trump campaign pitched in with a novel idea to deflect blame from the Russians: The D.N.C. had somehow hacked itself.But at other times, he appeared to accept that Russia was responsible.\u201cThe new joke in town,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on July 25, \u201cis that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC emails, which should have never been written (stupid), because Putin likes me.\u201d\u201cBecause we know the ideas of Mr. Stevenson, we in our hearts all favor him,\u201d Khrushchev said in a message passed on by the Soviet ambassador. \u201cCould the Soviet press assist Mr. Stevenson\u2019s personal success? How?\u201dMr. Stevenson declined the offer, in language that reflected the broad American political consensus about foreign election interference. \u201cI believe I made it clear to him,\u201d Mr. Stevenson wrote, \u201cthat I considered the offer of such assistance highly improper, indiscreet and dangerous to all concerned.\u201dRussia did not deliver on Mr. Trump\u2019s request for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s deleted emails. But it had obtained something just as useful: 50,000 emails of John Podesta, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, stolen via a phishing attack by the G.R.U. Roger Stone, a political operative and longtime Trump friend, seemed to have advance word. \u201cTrust me,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Aug. 25, it would soon be \u201cPodesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201dBut WikiLeaks withheld the Podesta emails for months after receiving them from \u201cGuccifer\u201d in June, evidently waiting for the right moment to have the biggest impact on the race. The time came on Oct. 7, amid two blows to the Trump campaign.See the timeline of events that surround the release of the emails.And then came a potentially lethal disclosure for the Trump campaign: the shocking \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d recording in which Mr. Trump bragged of groping and sexually assaulting women. The candidate desperately needed to change the subject \u2014 and that was the moment WikiLeaks posted the first of thousands of Mr. Podesta\u2019s emails.They were invaluable for political journalists, offering embarrassing comments from staffers about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s shortcomings and the full texts of her highly paid speeches to banks and corporations, which she had refused to release. WikiLeaks assisted by highlighting interesting tidbits in yellow.\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d had said \u201cbehind closed doors,\u201d Mr. Trump declared, that terrorism was \u201cnot a threat\u201d; that she had \u201ca great relationship with the financial industry\u201d; that ISIS might infiltrate groups of refugees coming to the United States; that a politician needed to have \u201cboth a public and private position\u201d on policies; and on and on.The quotes were taken out of context, of course, and subjected to the most damaging interpretation. But they seemed to offer a glimpse of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s hidden views.For the last month of the campaign, in daily releases that kept the Clinton team on the defensive, WikiLeaks delivered the Russians\u2019 gift. If the July D.N.C. dump had been an explosion, the October series was more like unrelenting sniper fire. Whether the timing was decided by the Russians or by Mr. Assange, it proved devastatingly effective.Russian trolls, using fake accounts on social media, reached nearly as many Americans as would vote in the election.David Michael Smith, a Houston political scientist and activist, spotted the alarming call on Facebook. A group called Heart of Texas was suddenly urging Texans to come at noon on May 21, 2016, to protest a 14-year-old Islamic center in downtown Houston.\u201cStop Islamization of Texas,\u201d the post declared, with a photo of the Islamic Da\u2019wah Center, which it called a \u201cshrine of hatred.\u201d It invited protesters to prepare for battle: \u201cFeel free to bring along your firearms, concealed or not!\u201d\u201cWe immediately asked, \u2018What the blank is the Heart of Texas\u2019?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Smith, who started calling friends to organize a counterprotest.Months later, he would find out.Heart of Texas, which garnered a quarter-million followers on Facebook, was one of 470 Facebook pages created 5,000 miles from Houston at the Internet Research Agency, the oddly named St. Petersburg company that would become the world\u2019s most famous manipulator of social media. The two Russian employees who had visited Texas during that 2014 American tour, Ms. Bogacheva and Ms. Krylova, evidently had returned home with big ideas about how to exploit the emotional chasms in American politics and culture.Just as the Russians\u2019 Guccifer character had reached out to American activists, journalists and WikiLeaks, the Russian online trolls understood that their real political power would come from mobilizing Americans. The Russian company\u2019s formula was simple: tap into a simmering strain of opinion in the United States and pour on the fuel.Consider the Texas protest. After the Russians put up the \u201cStop Islamization\u201d Facebook post, several dozen like-minded Texans added their own incendiary comments. \u201cAllah Sucks,\u201d wrote one, adding a threat to kill any Muslim who tried to visit him. Another wrote of the Islamic center, \u201cNeed to Blow this place up.\u201dA dozen yelling white supremacists turned out for the protest, at least two of them with assault rifles and a third with a pistol. Others held Confederate flags and a \u201cWhite Lives Matter\u201d banner.Houston police managed to keep them away from a much larger crowd of counterprotesters \u2014 some of whom had responded to a second Russian Facebook call. In a blatant attempt to create a confrontation, another Internet Research Agency page, this one called United Muslims of America, had asked people to rally at exactly the same time and place to \u201cSave Islamic Knowledge.\u201dThe event had no lasting consequences, though clearly it could have ended in tragedy. Still, it demonstrated that young Russians tapping on keyboards in 12-hour shifts could act as puppet masters for unsuspecting Americans many time zones away.When Facebook first acknowledged last year the Russian intrusion on its platform, it seemed modest in scale. The $100,000 spent on ads was a trivial sum compared with the tens of millions spent on Facebook by both the Trump and Clinton campaigns.See the timeline of events that shows Russia\u2019s social media campaign.Oct. 6 18,634 tweetsTweets spike on Oct. 6, the day before the Obama administration formally accuses the Russian government of hacking.

The St. Petersburg trolls tapped the power of Silicon Valley for their stealth intervention in American democracy.The Russian troll operation had gotten its start two years before, focusing at first on government targets closer to home.In 2014, Vitaly Bespalov, then 23, finished a journalism degree in the Siberian city of Tyumen and signed on as a \u201ccontent manager\u201d at the Internet Research Agency, which looked vaguely like a digital marketing firm and offered a relatively generous salary of $1,000 a month.Mr. Bespalov was surprised to discover that his job was to write or swipe stories to post on counterfeit Ukrainian websites, spinning the conflict there to fit the Russian government\u2019s view. He had to be sure always to use the word \u201cterrorists\u201d for the Ukrainian fighters opposed to the Russian invasion that was tearing the country apart.\u201cMy first days on the job I was in shock \u2014 I had no idea what kind of an operation this was,\u201d Mr. Bespalov said in a recent interview while vacationing in Ukraine: his first visit to the country about which he had written so many bogus stories.He was put off by the company\u2019s work but said he chose to stick around for several months, in part to study its operations. \u201cIt was very monotonous and boring,\u201d Mr. Bespalov said. \u201cIt seemed that almost no one liked this work. But almost nobody quit, because everyone needed the money.\u201dSoon he began hearing about a new, secretive department inside the St. Petersburg company that was recruiting English speakers to focus on the United States.If Mr. Trump was borrowing the hacked emails from the Russians for his stump speeches, the online trolls in St. Petersburg returned the favor, picking up the candidate\u2019s populist rhetoric. Even pages that seemed nominally hostile to him often worked in his favor: \u201cWoke Blacks\u201d critiqued Mrs. Clinton for alleged hostility to African-Americans; \u201cUnited Muslims of America\u201d showed her with a woman in a head scarf and a slogan \u2014 \u201cSupport Hillary, Save American Muslims\u201d \u2014 that seemed aimed at generating a backlash.The Russians managed to call a dozen or more rallies like the one in Houston, sometimes paying unwitting American activists for their help via money transfer. The same method may have been used to get the bridge banners of Mr. Putin and Mr. Obama hung.Facebook, reluctant to step into the divisive politics of the Trump presidency, did not acknowledge the Russian intrusion until nearly a year after the election, asserting that Russia had chiefly aimed at sowing division. A closer look suggested a more focused goal: damaging Mrs. Clinton and promoting Mr. Trump.Many of the Facebook memes portrayed Mrs. Clinton as angry, corrupt or crazed. Mr. Trump was depicted as his campaign preferred: strong, decisive, courageous, willing to shun political correctness to tell hard truths. The Russian operation also boosted Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate who had dined with Mr. Putin in Moscow, to draw votes from Mrs. Clinton. It encouraged supporters of Mr. Sanders to withhold their votes from Mrs. Clinton even after he endorsed her.The impact is impossible to gauge; the Internet Research Agency was a Kremlin fire hose of influence wielded amid a hurricane of a presidential election. Christopher Painter, who had served under President George W. Bush at the Justice Department and as the State Department\u2019s coordinator for cyberissues from 2011 to 2017, said the propaganda flood and the leaked emails certainly affected the vote. But no one can say whether it made the difference in an election decided by the tiniest of margins, fewer than 100,000 votes in three states.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how much voter suppression it caused, discouraging people from coming out,\u201d Mr. Painter said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know how many votes it changed.\u201dHe added that \u201cpeople don\u2019t like to admit they\u2019ve been fooled\u201d \u2014 hence the strenuous efforts from Mr. Trump and his supporters to deny or dismiss the significance of the Russian interference.A case in point would be Harry Miller, a devoted Trump supporter in Florida who was paid to organize a rally in which a woman portraying Mrs. Clinton sat behind bars on the back of his pickup truck. It turned out that the people who had ordered up the rally, \u201cMatt Skiber\u201d and \u201cJoshua Milton,\u201d were pseudonyms for Russians at the Internet Research Agency, according to the Mueller indictment.But don\u2019t tell that to Mr. Miller. Contacted via Twitter, he insisted that he had not been manipulated by Russian trolls.\u201cThey were not Russians, and you know it,\u201d Mr. Miller wrote, adding, \u201cIf you don\u2019t then you are the one snookered.\u201dThe president has created doubts about the investigation and an affinity for Russia among his supporters.The White House statement released at 7:21 p.m. on May 17, 2017, was measured, even anodyne. Reacting to the news that Mr. Mueller had been appointed special counsel for the Russia investigation, the statement quoted Mr. Trump saying that he was \u201clooking forward to this matter concluding quickly,\u201d and that in the meantime he would be fighting \u201cfor the people and issues that matter most to the future of our country.\u201dExactly 12 hours and 31 minutes later, early in the morning without his staff around him, he told the world what he really thought.It had been little more than a week since the president had fired his F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, but the \u201cRussia thing\u201d wasn\u2019t going away. Now the president was up against someone who could become even more formidable \u2014 a careful, tenacious former Marine whose stewardship of the F.B.I. during the Bush and Obama years had been praised by Washington\u2019s establishment.Mr. Trump\u2019s instinct was to fire Mr. Mueller, but he settled for a different strategy. He has used all his power to try to discredit the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Revelation upon revelation about Russian encounters with Trump associates has followed in the months since Mr. Mueller was appointed, intensifying the fear in the White House. Mr. Trump has used his Twitter pulpit to repeatedly assault the Mueller inquiry, and has made scathing remarks at rallies about claims of Russian interference. \u201cIt\u2019s a hoax, O.K.?\u201d he told a Pennsylvania crowd last month. The attacks have had an impact on how Americans view the country\u2019s national security apparatus, how they view the Russia story, even how they view Russia itself.See the full timeline of Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated denials and attacks.The strategy has helped sow doubts about the special counsel\u2019s work in part because Mr. Mueller and his prosecutors only rarely go public with the evidence they have been steadily gathering in secret interviews and closed-door sessions of a grand jury.During a period of 146 days over this year \u2014 between the Feb. 16 indictment of the Internet Research Agency operatives and the July 13 indictment of Russian intelligence officers \u2014 Mr. Mueller\u2019s office was effectively silent. The president was not, sending at least 94 tweets that denied he had been involved in \u201ccollusion,\u201d called the Russian interference a \u201choax\u201d or labeled the Mueller investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201dIndictment of Internet Research Agency operativesIndictment of Russianintelligence officersAprilJulyOct.AprilJulyJan. 2017Jan. 2018Jan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018Indictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesAprilIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJulyIndictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018AprilJulyJan. 2017AprilJulyOct.Jan. 2018Indictment of InternetResearch Agency operativesAprilIndictment of Russianintelligence officersJulyBy July, one poll showed that 45 percent of Americans disapproved of how Mr. Mueller was handling the investigation, a 14-point increase from January. The shift was even more dramatic among Republican voters: from 49 percent to 78 percent. More recent polls, conducted since the indictment of the G.R.U. officers and Mr. Manafort\u2019s conviction, have shown a reversal of the trend.The president\u2019s aides hardly make a secret of their goal to discredit the investigation before a jury of the public. There is little expectation that Mr. Mueller would ignore Justice Department guidelines and try to indict a sitting president, so Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers see Congress and impeachment as the only threat. Turn the public against impeachment, the thinking goes, and Congress is less likely to act.\u201cMueller is now slightly more distrusted than trusted, and Trump is a little ahead of the game,\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s omnipresent lawyer, told The New York Times last month, without citing any data to buttress his assertion.\u201cSo I think we\u2019ve done really well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my client\u2019s happy.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s frustration with the Russian investigation is not surprising. He is right that no public evidence has emerged showing that his campaign conspired with Russia in the election interference or accepted Russian money. But the inquiry has buffeted his presidency, provoked concern that his attempts to thwart the investigation amount to obstruction of justice and fed his suspicion that the F.B.I. and intelligence agencies \u2014 what he calls \u201cthe deep state\u201d \u2014 are conspiring against him.The desire of the president to make deals with Mr. Putin, and the longstanding skepticism of the intelligence community about Russian intentions and actions, might have made a clash inevitable. But Mr. Trump appears to have had success in persuading some Americans that the spy and law enforcement agencies are corrupt and hyperpartisan. He has scrambled alliances that solidified over decades, including the Republican Party\u2019s reflexive support of the national security agencies. A president in open war with the F.B.I., once inconceivable, is now part of the daily news cycle.Mr. Trump began laying the foundation immediately after he won the presidency, when he questioned the intelligence agencies\u2019 findings that Russia had disrupted the election, and likened America\u2019s spies to Nazis. Since taking office, he has worked with partners in Congress to cast the agencies as part of an insurgency against the White House.It continued in July, when he stood next to Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and declared that he trusted the Russian president\u2019s assurances that Moscow was innocent of interfering in the 2016 election.\u201c\u2018We have found nothing to show collusion between President Trump & Russia, absolutely zero, but every day we get more documentation showing collusion between the FBI & DOJ, the Hillary campaign, foreign spies & Russians, incredible.\u2019\u201dThe reshuffling of alliances has seeped into the media, where the president\u2019s reliable allies have been joined by voices on the left to dismiss the Russia story as overblown. They warn of a new Red Scare.On Fox News, the network where Sean Hannity fulminates nightly about Mr. Mueller and his team, the journalist Glenn Greenwald, a founder of the left-leaning news site The Intercept and a champion of government whistle-blowers, has appeared regularly to dismiss revelations about the investigation and decry officials \u201cwilling to leak, even at the expense of committing crimes,\u201d in order to damage Mr. Trump.Multiple frenzied television segments and hyped news stories have given credence to the concerns of Mr. Greenwald and others about a 21st-century McCarthyism. And critics of the \u201cdeep state\u201d were given powerful ammunition after the release of text messages between two F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, that revealed their animosity toward Mr. Trump. The pair, who were involved in a romantic relationship at the time, have been skewered regularly on Mr. Hannity\u2019s show as the \u201cTrump-hating F.B.I. lovebirds.\u201dMeanwhile, Mr. Trump\u2019s glowing words about Mr. Putin and Russia have created a new affinity for Russia \u2014 in particular its social conservatism and toughness on terrorism \u2014 among Mr. Trump\u2019s most devoted supporters.During a period of myriad accounts about Russia\u2019s attempts to disrupt the last election, the percentage of Republicans who view Mr. Putin favorably has more than doubled (from 11 percent to 25 percent), according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. Democrats are now far more likely than Republicans to see Russia as a threat. An October 2017 poll showed that 63 percent of Democrats and just 38 percent of Republicans said they saw \u201cRussia\u2019s power and influence\u201d as a significant threat to the United States.Once again, Mr. Trump has flipped the script in the party of Reagan: A country that was once seen as a geopolitical foe is now embraced by many Republicans as a bastion of Christianity and traditional values.Michael McFaul, ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, said that despite the country\u2019s relative economic and military weakness, Mr. Putin had often played a poor hand deftly. \u201cAcross many dimensions, Putin is using all kinds of instruments of power,\u201d he said.\u201cIt feels to me,\u201d the former ambassador said, \u201clike he\u2019s winning and we\u2019re losing.\u201dOn July 16, the president woke early in Helsinki, hours before he was to sit face to face with Mr. Putin. The meeting came three days after Mr. Mueller indicted the 12 Russian intelligence officers. Once again, Mr. Trump dashed off a tweet.\u201cWe agree.\u201dKitty Bennett contributed research.

{"Headline": "Australia Wants to Take Government Surveillance to the Next Level", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA new bill will help its intelligence agencies circumvent encryption. And what starts Down Under won\u2019t necessarily stay there.Ms. O\u2019Shea is a human rights lawyer who is writing a book about technology and politics.SYDNEY, Australia \u2014 A state\u2019s capacity to spy on its citizens has grown exponentially in recent years as new technology has meant more aspects of our lives can be observed, recorded and analyzed than ever before. At the same time, much to the frustration of intelligence agencies around the world, so has the ability to keep digital information secret, thanks to encryption. We should all be worried, because it\u2019s not just criminals or terrorists who use encryption, but every one of us. We use encryption to buy things online, manage our finances, and communicate personally and professionally. Hospitals, transportation systems and government agencies use encrypted data. Creating tools to weaken encrypted systems for one purpose weakens it for all purposes. If Australia succeeds in doing so, it could be your bank account or your medical records that are compromised in the end.The government has been quick to claim that this is not a back door, and the bill prohibits requests to companies to create \u201csystemic\u201d weaknesses. But this prohibition is ambiguous, and the reporting and accountability safeguards are minimal. The truth is that there is simply no way to create tools to undermine encryption without jeopardizing digital security and eroding individual rights and freedoms. Hackers with bad intentions will do their utmost to take advantage of any such tools that companies are forced to provide the government. Seemingly in response to such criticisms, the bill in Australia prohibits the government from preventing a company from repairing such a vulnerability. But this is cold comfort: The N.S.A. didn\u2019t need to prevent Microsoft patching the problem because Microsoft didn\u2019t even know it existed. The WannaCry attack illustrates how intelligence agencies prioritize their own interests. If we give state agencies more power to build tools to circumvent encryption, not only do we expose ourselves to the risk that they can be stolen, we are forced to trust that these agencies will behave responsibly. The evidence to date suggests the opposite. The same is true today. The Australian government is testing the limits of our democracy by seeking to empower the surveillance state, and what it learns will have implications globally. We need to take a stand against this power grab by state agencies, and reject the idea that encrypted communications undermine security. Quite the opposite: They are complementary. Advertisement"}

(And whose idea was it to have an animated Rick from \u201cRick and Morty\u201d ask, \u201cHow do you think \u2018Atlanta\u2019\u2019s doing?\u201d at a point long after \u201cAtlanta\u201d had lost in five of its six categories?)The show\u2019s producer, Lorne Michaels, won an award for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and ended his acceptance speech with a dig at those who have predicted the demise of the broadcast networks, still the home of the major awards shows. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, accepting one of the broadcast networks\u2019 only two awards, the other going to the director of the Oscars. The networks may have been the one significant group to do worse on the night than people of color.A couple of tweaks to the usual award show format jointly contributed to the broadcast\u2019s anemic feel. Separating the awards by category \u2014 so that all the comedy, limited-series and drama awards, except for outstanding series, were presented in succession \u2014 robbed the evening of some of its texture and suspense. The \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d sweep was apparent within the show\u2019s opening half-hour, making the show\u2019s outstanding comedy award a few hours later an anticlimax.The decision to have the nominees\u2019 names read in prerecorded voice-overs may have saved time, and reduced the possibility of gaffes and mispronunciations by the presenters. But it, too, sucked tension out of the proceedings, and the abrupt shifts from the presenters\u2019 patter to the announcements of the winners were jarring. (It also tended to highlight the banality of most of the patter.)At a time of cataclysmic change in the country and in the TV industry, it\u2019s an accomplishment of a perverse kind to put on an awards broadcast that feels flat, inessential and, despite its insistent topicality, out of touch. It felt appropriate that the night\u2019s big finish was an award for a show, \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d that hadn\u2019t had a new episode for over a year.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "David Boies Pleads Not Guilty", "Date": "2018-09-21", "News": "The superlawyer in such cases as Bush v. Gore and the fight for gay marriage rights makes no apologies for representing Harvey Weinstein and Theranos with zeal.Supported byWhen I arrived on a late July afternoon for an interview with David Boies at his mansion in Westchester County, displaced furniture filled the foyer and workmen occupied much of the famed litigator\u2019s home. Water from an unchecked bathtub had cascaded through the house, reaching all the way to his cellar and his vast collection of rare wines. Mr. Boies, dressed in a dark-blue Lands\u2019 End suit, guided me down into the mess.The last 12 months have been an unprecedented public relations disaster for the most prominent lawyer in America. In October, his longtime client Harvey Weinstein was branded a sexual predator. Another high-profile client, Theranos, on whose board Mr. Boies served, has been exposed as a fraud. The Times publicly fired Mr. Boies\u2019s firm, which had been representing the newspaper, after learning that he had been personally involved in an undercover operation to smear Mr. Weinstein\u2019s victims and deceive Times reporters. The Manhattan district attorney is looking into the matter and Mr. Boies\u2019s role.In May, \u201cBad Blood,\u201d the best-selling Theranos expos\u00e9 by the Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou, laid out in gripping detail the aggressive efforts by Mr. Boies and his firm to intimidate \u2014 and, in some cases, terrify \u2014 company whistle-blowers. Mr. Carreyrou compared the tactics to those of \u201cthugs.\u201dOf all the humiliation, scolding and criticism Mr. Boies has endured, it was this comment that seemed to eat at him as we talked in his study in July \u2014 his first extended interview since the furor peaked.\u201cOver all, his reporting on Theranos was excellent,\u201d Mr. Boies said of Mr. Carreyrou, between sips of 20-year-old Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, which he had rescued from the cellar. \u201cAnd overwriting aside, even his personal comments about me were within the realm of fairness. But calling me a \u2018thug\u2019 on his book tour was over the top.\u201dMr. Boies, 77, seemed more puzzled than hurt that editors of The Times, The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg had recently spurned his letters to the editor. \u201cI was disappointed,\u201d he allowed, in the same judicious and unflappable manner that has made him a favorite of federal judges. Mr. Boies suggested that exonerating facts about his work for Mr. Weinstein and Theranos had been omitted from media coverage. \u201cWhat are letters for,\u201d he asked, \u201cif not to air an opposing view?\u201dMost of all, Mr. Boies said, he felt misunderstood. While he concedes he made mistakes, he maintains he was simply defending his clients\u2019 interests to the best of his abilities, including protecting them from damaging headlines.\u201cYou don\u2019t know all the facts when you take on a client,\u201d he said, \u201cbut once you do, you have a duty of loyalty. You can\u2019t represent them halfway. If, as a lawyer, you start to value how you are going to look to the media, as opposed to how your client will look, then you should find a new profession.\u201dA bedrock of lawful society is that every defendant, no matter how repugnant, has the right to a zealous attorney. But \u2014 as he himself has put it \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean the right to David Boies. He can afford to be selective about whom he represents, and he told me that he accepts as clients fewer than 20 percent of the people who approach him.Throughout his half-century of practice, Mr. Boies has shown an almost unerring instinct for picking clients who burnish his reputation. It has made him one of the highest-paid lawyers in the country, with an hourly rate of $1,850. And it has baffled legal observers that, in what could have been his gilded years, Mr. Boies ended up representing both Mr. Weinstein and Theranos, led by Elizabeth Holmes, in ways that arguably helped prolong their misdeeds. For the first time in his career, the most vaunted advocate in the United States has been a defendant in the court of public opinion.One afternoon in August, Mr. Boies occupied a prime corner table at the newly reopened Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan. It was his third meal there in 36 hours. With tousled dark-blond hair and a rather slight build, he looked tanned and relaxed and was looking forward to a safari in Kenya. He was drinking a glass of cabernet from the vineyard he owns in Northern California, visibly relieved that he could again indulge his craving for the Four Seasons version of pigs in blankets.From his vantage, any clouds over his reputation had dissipated. His firm, Boies Schiller Flexner, was thriving, and he was in demand. In just the first six months of this year, he had generated $35 million in billings. A lawyer for Leslie Moonves, who in early September was forced out as CBS\u2019s chief executive after allegations of sexually aggressive behavior, recently approached Mr. Boies to see if he\u2019d consider representing Mr. Moonves. Mr. Boies demurred, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be good for Les, and I don\u2019t think that would be good for me.\u201dAlthough he\u2019s a Democrat, Mr. Boies said he\u2019d be more than happy to represent President Trump in the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. \u201cWhether you agree with him or not, he needs to have effective representation,\u201d Mr. Boies said of the president. \u201cThis long, drawn-out morality play isn\u2019t in the country\u2019s best interests. It needs to be resolved. Of course, he\u2019d have to agree to do what I told him.\u201dWithin the legal establishment, Mr. Boies\u2019s reputation seems undimmed. \u201cWhen you are a superstar like David Boies, there will always be some people who are jealous and want to take you down,\u201d said Jed S. Rakoff, a senior United States District Court judge in New York. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that everything he has ever done is beyond reproach, but he has been in my court numerous times and has always performed at the very highest level, both in terms of skill and in terms of professionalism. I think he continues to be very highly regarded by the judges of the Southern District.\u201d\u201cIf you represent people who did bad things, the public is going to lash out at you,\u201d said Theodore B. Olson, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who was Mr. Boies\u2019s adversary in Bush v. Gore and his co-counsel in the gay marriage case. \u201cDavid may push hard, but that\u2019s what\u2019s required sometimes.\u201dEvery judge and lawyer I interviewed noted that few laymen fully appreciated their ethical duties. \u201cI often have to explain to journalists that there\u2019s a divergence between legal ethics and the ethics of ordinary people,\u201d said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law and an expert on legal ethics. \u201cRepresenting a bad person doesn\u2019t make you a bad person.\u201dAmong the general public, however, Mr. Boies\u2019s \u201creputation has absolutely been damaged,\u201d Professor Gillers said. \u201cHe may be a stellar lawyer. But in representing a Harvey Weinstein or Elizabeth Holmes, he\u2019s not seeking to vindicate an overarching legal principle as he did in Bush v. Gore or gay marriage.\u201cCriminal defense lawyers who represent vicious criminals may lead perfectly ethical and admirable lives, but their clients can harm their reputation in the larger community,\u201d he continued. \u201cDavid Boies can\u2019t represent the Harvey Weinsteins and Elizabeth Holmeses of the world the way he did and still expect the public to see him as a golden boy.\u201dThat\u2019s where Mr. Boies finds himself today: still revered by the bar, but fallen in the eyes of the media and liberal constituencies, and undergoing a reappraisal of his career and tactics.\u201cAnyone who\u2019s been on the other side of his maneuvers knows that he and his firm are incredibly aggressive advocates who push the envelope for their clients,\u201d Mr. Carreyrou said. \u201cThat was obscured for decades by the fact that he was on the right side of history again and again.\u201dWhile Mr. Boies projects a sanguine sense of his future, one thing nags at him: who will play him in the film version of Mr. Carreyrou\u2019s book. (Jennifer Lawrence is taking on the role of Ms. Holmes.) He has been portrayed on stage and screen before, always with a mix of brilliant affability \u2014 by Ed Begley Jr. in the HBO movie \u201cRecount,\u201d and by Morgan Freeman and George Clooney in productions of the marriage-equality play \u201c8.\u201d Whoever gets the part in \u201cBad Blood\u201d may be considerably less appealing.Mr. Boies got his start at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the paradigm of the institutional corporate law firm. (We were briefly colleagues there, but never worked on a case together.) Within its staid ranks, Mr. Boies was something of a maverick. Usually a little disheveled, he wore off-the-rack Sears or Lands\u2019 End navy suits and a plastic watch strapped over his shirt cuff. He found time for gambling excursions to Las Vegas and cross-country driving trips with his four sons. (He has been married three times and also has two daughters, one deceased.)Liberated, Mr. Boies and his firm took on all kinds of clients and embraced fee arrangements, like contingency fees and stock compensation, that weren\u2019t allowed at Cravath. The firm flourished; this year, it had 340 lawyers and average profits per partner of $3.2 million, among the highest in the country.\u201cI spend a lot of money,\u201d Mr. Boies told me: on his Westchester estate and a car and driver; his rare-wine collection; his vineyard; a racing sailboat; a Manhattan co-op in the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.Four years after he started the firm, in 2001, the editor Tina Brown introduced Mr. Boies to Mr. Weinstein \u2014 her partner in a multimedia venture \u2014 to discuss a legal memoir. Mr. Weinstein hired him, and almost immediately, Mr. Boies had to confront the producer\u2019s ugly behavior with women. In 2002, he talked The New Yorker out of publishing allegations of sexual harassment. At the time, none of the victims would go on the record, and Mr. Boies argued that the encounters were consensual. Mr. Boies knew there had been settlements with some of the accusers: He had shown Ken Auletta, the reporter on the story, copies of the canceled checks from Mr. Weinstein\u2019s personal account.Afterward, Mr. Auletta asked Mr. Boies how he could represent someone like Mr. Weinstein. \u201cI\u2019m loyal,\u201d Mr. Boies replied.He stayed loyal, even as he became aware of the settlements that Mr. Weinstein had reached with women alleging inappropriate sexual behavior. \u201cI knew of two or three over the last 20 years,\u201d Mr. Boies told me. \u201cHarvey had a reputation as a philanderer. But there was never any evidence or indication of assault, rape or threat of force. He was emphatic that he\u2019d never assaulted anyone or forced anyone to have sex with him.\u201d Mr. Boies also helped negotiate a 2015 settlement with a Weinstein employee, Lauren O\u2019Connor, that required Mr. Weinstein to seek anger management therapy. (In June, Mr. Weinstein pleaded not guilty to assault and rape charges.)For his part, Mr. Weinstein showered Mr. Boies with invitations for opening-night parties and celebrity-studded charity events. The Weinstein Company put one of Mr. Boies\u2019s daughters in the hit 2012 film \u201cSilver Linings Playbook,\u201d and also distributed a movie she produced, \u201cJane Got a Gun.\u201d Along with the son of one of his law partners, Mr. Boies formed a film production company, which invested $5 million each in two Weinstein films, \u201cGold\u201d and \u201cThe Upside,\u201d both flops.These entanglements may have colored Mr. Boies\u2019s objectivity and judgment about Mr. Weinstein. But they weren\u2019t, in the legal sense, a conflict of interest. They more closely aligned Mr. Boies\u2019s interest with his client\u2019s, which as far as the bar is concerned is a good thing.Mr. Boies met Elizabeth Holmes in 2011, after an early Theranos investor asked him to represent her. At the time, her claim that Theranos technology could render an accurate blood test from a finger prick was being hailed across Silicon Valley as a revolutionary breakthrough with enormous profit potential.\u201cShe showed us the lab,\u201d Mr. Boies said. \u201cShe was very well prepared, committed and intelligent. She made a terrific impression.\u201d A committee of prominent doctors and scientists served on an advisory board.So impressed was Mr. Boies that he took half his and his firm\u2019s fees in Theranos stock, which eventually amounted to 400,000 shares, or roughly $7 million at the company\u2019s apex. Had the company thrived, it could have been worth many times that.Like his business and social dealings with Mr. Weinstein, a financial stake in a client risks coloring a lawyer\u2019s independent judgment. For that reason, firms like Cravath and Gibson Dunn prohibit it. But they are exceptions. It\u2019s a common and lucrative practice, especially among Silicon Valley and San Francisco firms with large venture capital divisions. Defenders of the arrangement note that scores of start-ups might not have succeeded without the expensive legal advice they were able to finance with stock, rather than cash.The American Bar Association \u201chas wrestled with the wisdom of the practice for over 20 years,\u201d Professor Gillers said. \u201cThe answer that has emerged,\u201d he added, \u201cis that it\u2019s not categorically forbidden, but it has to be monitored closely to protect the client.\u201d To guard against this, clients typically consent to the arrangement in writing, as Theranos did.Mr. Boies insists that his friendship with Mr. Weinstein, his personal admiration for Ms. Holmes and his firm\u2019s financial interest in Theranos had no impact on his professional judgment, and he seemed somewhat puzzled that anyone would think otherwise. \u201cAnything that gives you an incentive to put the client\u2019s interest first is good for the client,\u201d he said.During the summer of 2015, at the behest of Jim Mattis, a Theranos board member who is now the secretary of defense, Mr. Boies also agreed to join the Theranos board. The Wall Street Journal was investigating Theranos, and Mr. Mattis told him that he anticipated \u201ca difficult period where both Theranos and Ms. Holmes would need the advice of a seasoned lawyer,\u201d Mr. Boies recalled.That added another level of ethical complexity. As a board member, Mr. Boies assumed a fiduciary duty to shareholders. Now he was obliged to act in the best interest of two different parties: investors and company management. What if one \u2014 i.e. Ms. Holmes \u2014 acted in a way that harmed the other? Precisely because the arrangement could create an impossible dilemma, some firms prohibit such board memberships. Yet it is not explicitly forbidden by the bar\u2019s ethics rules.As The Journal\u2019s Mr. Carreyrou stepped up his reporting on Theranos that summer, Mr. Boies used all the tools at his disposal to defend Ms. Holmes and muzzle the journalist\u2019s sources. His partners sent letters threatening suspected talkers with litigation if they disclosed trade secrets or confidential information. (One whistle-blower, a man in his 20s, incurred several hundred thousand dollars in legal fees.) And he wrote a 23-page letter to The Journal warning it about publishing Mr. Carreyrou\u2019s article.Mr. Boies told me that he maintains a longstanding policy: He won\u2019t sue media organizations, or even threaten to do so. \u201cThere may be valid defamation actions, but I don\u2019t want to be the lawyer doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing all the way back to CBS and Westmoreland, my experience has been that most reporters try to get it right.\u201d He also has long positioned himself as a friend to reporters and a champion of the First Amendment. He\u2019s a donor to the Committee to Protect Journalists and has served as its annual dinner chairman.Mr. Carreyrou insists that the letter did \u201cexplicitly threaten\u201d a lawsuit. Mr. Boies denies that, but he seems to be splitting hairs. The letter demands that Mr. Carreyrou and The Journal save all their notes and records, which \u201cwould doubtless be highly relevant in any lawsuit\u201d \u2014 and then cites two cases as precedent. Mr. Boies either violated his own policy regarding media lawsuits, or came precariously close to doing so.When I pressed Mr. Boies on this, the litigator in him wouldn\u2019t give an inch. \u201cYou don\u2019t write a 20-plus-page letter to threaten someone,\u201d he said. \u201cI could do that in one paragraph. You write that kind of letter to persuade. You may point out things that you believe are inaccurate or reckless and that could support a lawsuit. But it\u2019s not a threat to sue.\u201dHe added: \u201cThe question is, can you make the story better, more accurate, more favorable to your client? If so, you\u2019re being an effective advocate.\u201dFrom Mr. Boies\u2019s point of view, his approach worked. Among the facts that Mr. Carreyrou had uncovered, and that didn\u2019t appear in the article, was Ms. Holmes\u2019s long-running romantic relationship with Ramesh Balwani, Theranos\u2019s president.The article didn\u2019t shake his confidence in Ms. Holmes, however. She agreed, at his suggestion, to an independent verification of Theranos\u2019s technology in order to rebut the Journal article and reassure investors and regulators.In early March, she was a guest at Mr. Boies\u2019s 75th birthday bash at Las Vegas\u2019s Wynn Resort. But by the end of that month, there were still no results. Ms. Holmes began relying on other outside lawyers, and she fired the company\u2019s general counsel, a former Boies Schiller partner, who returned to the firm.\u201cI\u2019d say that by summer, I wasn\u2019t exactly persona non grata, but I was pretty close,\u201d Mr. Boies said. He tried to resign from the board, but other directors dissuaded him. His own outside lawyer advised that as a director, he couldn\u2019t resign in a way that might damage shareholders.The final straw came in August, when Ms. Holmes made an overly optimistic presentation to shareholders without consulting Mr. Boies. As he put it in an email to Ms. Holmes, he could not continue being her lawyer if she did not heed his advice: \u201cIf we are going to risk being at the scene of a serious accident, we want to have the steering wheel in our hands.\u201d He continued, \u201cBecause of the very public role we have taken in defense of the company, the firm\u2019s own credibility is at stake.\u201dWithin 72 hours of sending the email, Mr. Boies stopped representing the company. He remained a director until Theranos could find a replacement, which took until February. The next month, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Ms. Holmes orchestrated a \u201cmassive fraud\u201d that cost investors more than $700 million while putting the health of its testing subjects at risk.Mr. Boies\u2019s work for both Mr. Weinstein and Theranos might well have gone largely unnoticed, and his reputation might have remained unblemished, had that been the end of the story. But Mr. Boies himself became the subject of further investigative reporting.Mr. Weinstein approached Mr. Boies in the spring of 2017, after he learned that Times reporters, as well as Ronan Farrow, then a reporter for NBC News and later for The New Yorker, were unearthing allegations of sexual assault. Mr. Weinstein asked Mr. Boies to write letters to the publications threatening legal action.Mr. Boies said he told Mr. Weinstein that he\u2019d be \u201ccrazy\u201d to sue, and reminded him about his personal rule against media lawsuits. But, he said, he agreed to give Mr. Weinstein legal advice and act on his behalf as a \u201cfriend,\u201d and would not charge him for any of his work.In his hybrid role as lawyer and friend, Mr. Boies approached The Times. He knew many of its reporters and editors, and his firm represented the paper in a libel suit. When The Times retained one of Mr. Boies\u2019s partners for the libel case, the company signed an explicit waiver of any conflict, which even gave his firm the right to sue The Times on behalf of another client.Mr. Boies had numerous exchanges with its executive editor, Dean Baquet, maneuvering to get reporters to interview Mr. Weinstein on background. Mr. Baquet rebuffed him; The Times\u2019s policy is not to talk to subjects of investigative reports on such a basis.The Times obviously knew that Mr. Boies was advocating Mr. Weinstein\u2019s point of view, even as his firm continued to represent The Times. What it didn\u2019t know \u2014 and what Mr. Boies never told the paper \u2014 was that he had also negotiated and signed an agreement with Black Cube, a secretive investigative agency that used undercover operatives.The company\u2019s goal was to dig up \u201cintelligence which will help the client\u2019s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY Newspaper,\u201d as a contract Mr. Boies signed put it.Mr. Boies told me that he didn\u2019t view any of this as a conflict of interest with his work for The Times. \u201cReporters don\u2019t have a monopoly on investigating facts,\u201d he said. To the extent that Mr. Weinstein was innocent, he said, it was in both his and The Times\u2019s interest to know that. And even if it was a conflict, he noted, there was the waiver The Times had signed.\u201cI think even people who knew Harvey well were shocked,\u201d he added. He called the articles, which won the Pulitzer Prize for public service, \u201cfairly reported, which is what I\u2019d expect from The New York Times and The New Yorker.\u201d At the same time, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not popular to say this, but Harvey is still presumed innocent until proven guilty.\u201dConfronted with the Black Cube revelation and the attempt to undermine its own reporters, The Times promptly fired Mr. Boies. \u201cWe never contemplated that the law firm would contract with an intelligence firm to conduct a secret spying operation aimed at our reporting and our reporters,\u201d The Times said in a statement at the time. \u201cSuch an operation is reprehensible.\u201d\u201cThere was really no debate,\u201d Mr. Baquet told me recently. \u201cWe were outraged. A guy who was working for us was essentially trying to hurt us. It\u2019s not like he was just representing Harvey Weinstein. He was hiring private detectives to deceive journalists. You\u2019d think he\u2019d be ashamed of that.\u201dMr. Boies said he had no idea that Black Cube\u2019s work would include targeting Times reporters working on the story, but he acknowledged it was a mistake to have hired a firm that he didn\u2019t select and over which he had no oversight or control. \u201cAt the time, it seemed a reasonable accommodation for a client, but it was not thought through, and that was my mistake,\u201d he said.Mr. Boies found it difficult to extricate himself from Mr. Weinstein. \u201cI\u2019m probably too reluctant to fire clients,\u201d he said. \u201cA lawyer has a lot of leeway in deciding to take a client. But to abandon a client, especially a client in trouble, is a much higher hurdle.\u201d But in November, he said, he and Mr. Weinstein \u201cmutually agreed\u201d to part company. Mr. Boies said ethical constraints prevented him from saying any more.Mr. Boies said the #MeToo movement represented a \u201crevolution that\u2019s long overdue,\u201d even though \u201cevery revolution causes collateral damage, and to some extent, I\u2019m part of the collateral damage.\u201dAt 77, he is aware that his legacy is at stake. \u201cI guess if it\u2019s a long obituary, this is going to be in there,\u201d he said at lunch at the Four Seasons, referring to the Weinstein and Theranos controversies. \u201cIn the context of 50 years of a high-profile law practice, there are going to be things that make people unhappy. Any time you go through something like this, you reflect on what you might have done differently.\u201dBut he added: \u201cFor 99 percent of the people I deal with, this doesn\u2019t affect them. For some people, mostly in the media, it does affect them. I get that.\u201dOf course, I\u2019m in the media, writing for his former client The Times, but this time he\u2019s not advocating on behalf a client. He\u2019s defending himself. I asked him what that felt like.\u201cSteve Jobs told Walter Isaacson\u201d \u2014 his biographer \u2014 \u201cthat he wanted his children to understand him,\u201d Mr. Boies said. \u201cI get that. When you\u2019re talking about yourself, you tend to be less of an overt advocate. If you want people to understand you, you have to be accurate and complete, blemishes and all.\u201dI asked him to assume I\u2019m the judge and readers the jury. What\u2019s his closing argument? He seemed to relish the challenge.\u201cI\u2019m proud to be a lawyer and to serve the justice system,\u201d he began. \u201cThat\u2019s essential to everything we care about: liberty, equality, inclusiveness, the pursuit of happiness. The justice system protects the weak and limits the strong.\u201cIn America, this is an adversarial process,\u201d he continued. \u201cIn many countries it\u2019s not. History shows that no system does more to protect individual rights and liberties than a system that provides people with a lawyer with complete dedication to the client.\u201cA lawyer can choose what clients to represent. A lawyer does not have the choice of how to represent a client. A lawyer is duty- and honor-bound to represent a client effectively and aggressively, within the bounds of the system itself. And once a lawyer takes on a client, you do not have the right to abandon that client under fire, except in extraordinary circumstances.\u201dBy now he had hit his stride. \u201cIf we decide any class of accused is not deserving of aggressive representation simply because of what they\u2019re accused of, then we undermine the protections that are essential for all of us.\u201dThis was Boies the legendary litigator, spontaneously generating fully formed paragraphs. Evidently, though, Mr. Boies felt he had not made himself fully understood, and a few days later, on a Sunday afternoon, he wrote me an email of more than 1,000 words.\u201cLike I often do following a particularly good discussion (or movie or play), I keep thinking afterward about what we covered,\u201d he began. Doing so seemed to trigger, for the first time in our interactions, an element of wistfulness.Without naming names, but obviously referring to Theranos and Mr. Weinstein, he conceded that \u201cgreater due diligence would have led me to decline the representation\u201d of one. Of the other, \u201cI think I have to acknowledge that I have let loyalty to a client often outweigh revelations that, had I known them earlier, would have led me not to accept the representation initially.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know whether any of this adds anything to what you have,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut it has helped me think through how I feel about these issues.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified one of the news organizations to which Mr. Boies wrote letters to the editor. It was Bloomberg, not The New Yorker.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Emmys 2018: \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and \u2018Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 Win Big Awards", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmmys BriefingThe dragons held off Netflix.\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d stormed the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards on Monday night, taking home the best drama Emmy for the third time in the past four years and defeating last year\u2019s winner, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201dAlthough HBO\u2019s sprawling fantasy closed out its seventh and most recent season 13 months ago, Emmy voters still showered it with awards.HBO and Netflix tied for the total number of Emmys won, with 23 awards each, including the statuettes given out at the Creative Emmy Awards earlier this month.\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d had the biggest haul, with nine total awards, just ahead of Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d and NBC\u2019s enduring sketch series \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which won eight apiece.For Netflix, the 2018 Emmys represented a triumph. But the result came as a relief to HBO, which can now say that it has technically finished in first place among all broadcast and cable networks for 17 years running.The rest of HBO\u2019s awards were spread among several shows in acting categories, including wins for Henry Winkler (\u201cBarry\u201d), Bill Hader (\u201cBarry\u201d), Thandie Newton (\u201cWestworld\u201d) and Peter Dinklage (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d).In his acceptance speech, Mr. Dinklage called out the show\u2019s creators, David Benioff and Dan Weiss, saying: \u201cThank you Dave and Dan for changing my life. I cannot walk down the street anymore.\u201d\u201cThe Americans,\u201d the FX spy drama that concluded earlier this year, won two awards, including best actor in a drama for Matthew Rhys. The FX drama had won only two Emmys across its previous five seasons, but voters decided to give it some love on its way out, as they had with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201dNetflix spent handsomely on Emmy campaigning this year, opening a space in Hollywood to showcase its fare and advertising on billboards along the Sunset Strip. But it wasn\u2019t the only company to hype its wares. So-called For Your Consideration events \u2014 panel discussions where voters have access to stars, canap\u00e9s and booze \u2014 filled the schedules of the more than 23,000 members of the Television Academy in the run-up to the ceremony.Last year, there were 61 academy-sanctioned events in Los Angeles and New York during Emmy campaigning season. This year, that number ballooned to 116, according to a spokesman for the academy.Lorne Michaels, the 73-year-old impresario behind \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and NBC\u2019s late-night lineup, also had a big night. Not only did he leave the Microsoft Theater with the Emmy for best variety sketch series, he also produced the broadcast for NBC. It was his second time at the helm, having last overseen the Emmys broadcast in 1988, when the \u201cDynasty\u201d star John Forsythe was the host.In addition to giving the hosting job to Mr. Jost and Mr. Che, Mr. Michaels recruited a number of current and former \u201cS.N.L.\u201d cast members. The show began with a satirical musical number on Hollywood\u2019s diversity problem, led by two stalwarts of the show, Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon.\u201cYup, we solved it!\u201d Mr. Thompson exclaimed.Andy Samberg and RuPaul joined in, along with a group of Broadway-style hoofers identified as the One of Each Dancers.In a taped segment midway through the broadcast, the show returned to diversity as a theme, with Mr. Che handing out \u201creparations Emmys\u201d to black actors from past shows, including Jimmie Walker and John Witherspoon.The focus on diversity became ironic as the night wore on, with one white person after another delivering acceptance speeches. Before the ceremony was done, there were victories for actors and performers of color \u2014 including Regina King, for the Netflix limited series \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d; Ms. Newton, for her work on HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d; and RuPaul, of VH1\u2019s \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d \u2014 but the great majority of winners did not reflect the night\u2019s theme.The \u201cS.N.L.\u201d influence held fast throughout the night, with Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, stars of a new Amazon show, \u201cForever,\u201d appearing in a series of awkward-on-purpose sketches and an out-of-breath Will Ferrell presenting the award for best comedy series.In a way, it was surprising to see the New York-based \u201cS.N.L.\u201d front and center at the Emmys. The Television Academy, the main body behind the awards, has looked askance at the show for most of its 43-year run. But that has changed, with \u201cS.N.L.\u201d having won half of its 62 Emmys in the past five years.\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d a series created by Amy Sherman-Palladino about a housewife who tries her luck as a comedian in 1950s New York, had a big night, taking five awards, including best comedy series.It was the first time Amazon had won a top show award at the Emmys, and the first time a streaming service had taken the best comedy award.Rachel Brosnahan, who plays the show\u2019s title character, won for best actress in a comedy, the first new winner in that category in seven years. (With HBO\u2019s \u201cVeep\u201d sidelined this year, Julia Louis-Dreyfus hit the pause button on her record-breaking Emmy run.) Ms. Sherman-Palladino won for directing and writing, in addition to the best comedy series award. And Alex Borstein, who plays Mrs. Maisel\u2019s manager, took the award for best supporting actress.The triumph of \u201cMrs. Maisel\u201d was a blow to the avant-garde FX comedy \u201cAtlanta,\u201d a critical favorite. Donald Glover, the show\u2019s star and creator, took the prize for best actor in a comedy last year. This time, he lost out to Mr. Hader, who plays a hit man trying to make it as an actor in \u201cBarry.\u201d74 PhotosIn the late-night battle, John Oliver\u2019s weekly HBO show, \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d took the best variety talk category for a third year in a row, besting his former colleague at Comedy Central, Stephen Colbert, the host of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS.But the issue was largely absent from this year\u2019s ceremony, with no one mentioning Mr. Moonves from the stage.In his opening remarks, Mr. Che broached the topic, welcoming \u201cthe many, many talented people in Hollywood who haven\u2019t been caught yet.\u201dWith President Trump still deeply unpopular in Hollywood, the hosts, presenters and winners referred to him only in veiled terms, if at all, which stood in contrast to this event in each of the last two years.Mr. Che and Mr. Jost did not invoke his name in their opening remarks. And most winners stayed away from third rail political fare.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misidentified the actress Thandie Newton. She is British, not American.An earlier version of this article misidentified the award presented by Will Ferrell. It was the award for best comedy series, not the final award, which was for best dramatic series.Follow John Koblin on Twitter: @koblinAdvertisement"}
