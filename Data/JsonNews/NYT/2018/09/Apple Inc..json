{"Headline": "Freezing Credit Will Now Be Free. Here\u2019s Why You Should Go for It.", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserConsumers will soon be able to freeze their credit files without charge. So if you have not yet frozen your files \u2014 a recommended step to foil identity theft \u2014 now is a good time to take action, consumer advocates say.Security freezes, often called credit freezes, are \u201cabsolutely\u201d the best way to prevent criminals from using your personal information to open new accounts in your name, said Paul Stephens, director of policy and advocacy with Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer advocacy nonprofit group.Free security freezes were already available in some states and in certain situations, but the federal law requires that they be made available nationally. Two of the three major credit reporting bureaus, Equifax and TransUnion, have already abandoned the fees. The third, Experian, said it would begin offering free credit freezes next Friday. To be effective, freezes must be placed at all three bureaus.A security freeze makes it harder for criminals to use stolen information to open fraudulent new accounts, or borrow money, in your name. Credit bureaus house records of your accounts and payment history, which card companies and lenders use to decide whether you are likely to pay your bills. If you freeze your file, the bureaus will not provide information to lenders unless you \u201cthaw\u201d the freeze first, using a special personal identification number.Consumers suffer from \u201coptimism bias,\u201d the researchers found. They realized that the breach created risk, but did not think anything would happen to them personally. \u201cPeople tend to underestimate their own risk,\u201d said Florian Schaub, an assistant professor at the school and one of the study\u2019s authors.Others incorrectly assumed that because they had poor credit or little wealth, they would be unattractive targets for identity thieves. \u201cThey think: \u2018I don\u2019t have much money. I have nothing to lose,\u2019\u201d Mr. Schaub said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not how identity thieves operate.\u201dPeople interviewed also cited the cost of freezes as a barrier. It can cost as much as $10 per bureau to place a freeze, and a similar fee is charged to thaw it temporarily when you want to apply for credit.Consumer advocates hope that making freezes free will spur more consumers to use them. (The new law requires that a thaw must also be free.)But the freeze process is not as easy as it could be, said Mike Litt, consumer campaign director for U.S. PIRG, the consumer advocacy group. He would prefer credit files to be \u201cfrozen\u201d by default, and thawed on request. As it stands, consumers must place freezes separately at all three bureaus, and keep track of three PINs.And because it\u2019s not always possible to know in advance what credit bureau a lender will use, consumers typically must lift the freezes at all three bureaus when they want to apply for new credit.Brett Merfish, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., said she froze her credit at all three bureaus several years ago, after her personal information was used to open \u201ca steady flow\u201d of fraudulent credit card accounts. The freeze process was \u201ctedious,\u201d she recalled, but ultimately effective because she no longer has problems with fake accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it to do it,\u201d she said.One credit bureau, TransUnion, introduced a smartphone app, myTransUnion, this month that consumers can use to more easily freeze and thaw their credit. The app is available for both Apple and Android phones. Mr. Stephens, of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, said he had not seen the app, but cautioned consumers to tread carefully, in case it is used to market other, fee-based products and services.The credit bureaus also offer something called a credit \u201clock,\u201d which they promote as a more convenient way to protect your information. But some offerings carry fees, and consumer advocates prefer freezes because the rules are set by law, rather than by the credit bureaus.One other less-protective option is a fraud alert, which requires credit bureaus to contact you to verify your identity when a company requests your credit file. Under the new law, initial fraud alerts must last for one year once established. Fraud alerts are free, and, unlike the freezes, an alert placed at one bureau is automatically placed at all three.The website for the utilities exchange says its database is \u201choused and managed\u201d by Equifax. But the exchange is a \u201cdistinct\u201d entity that requires its own freeze, said Craig Caesar, outside counsel to the exchange. \u201cA separate request to N.C.T.U.E. is required because it is a separate database,\u201d Mr. Caesar said in an email. There is no cost for a freeze, he said.Here are the websites to visit to set up security freezes:Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s China Fight Puts U.S. Tech in the Cross Hairs", "Date": "2018-09-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says his trade war with China will protect America\u2019s dominance and derail Beijing\u2019s plan for technological and economic supremacy.Mr. Trump\u2019s next round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods goes into effect on Monday, hitting thousands of consumer products from handbags to refrigerators to bicycles. The tariffs will also hit the tech and telecom companies that provide much of the gear that powers the internet, mobile networks, data storage and other technology. United States customs will begin collecting a tax on circuit boards, semiconductors, cell tower radios, modems and other products made and assembled in China and exported into America.Those tariffs, Intel warned in a letter last month, are \u201ca game changer for the American consumer.\u201d The tariffs begin at a rate of 10 percent and increase to 25 percent next January.Like American automakers and other manufacturers, the tech sector has increasingly outsourced production to China, where manufacturing and assembly of products is cheaper than in the United States. In recent decades, Intel, Dell, and Apple began shifting manufacturing overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and align operations closer to customers in emerging markets.Intel, for instance, designs and manufactures most semiconductors in the United States but relies on Chinese facilities for assembly of their chips, which will now be taxed. Moving those manufacturing and assembly operations outside of China is unrealistic, the company has warned, saying \u201cit is too expensive to relocate established and integrated supply chains.\u201dGoogle, Dell, IBM and others say the tariffs will increase costs for companies and consumers, hindering America\u2019s ability to dominate the next generation of technology, like 5G wireless networks. Rising prices, the industries say, will slow business growth, increase costs for consumers and put other nations, like China, in a more competitive position to dominate tech.\u201cThe tariffs affect the heart of the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank financed by tech companies including Microsoft, Google and Intel. \u201cIf we are going to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, we should impose them on items that hurt the Chinese, not us.\u201dMr. Trump does not share that view, seeing the tariffs as a weapon to force China to change trade practices that the administration \u2014 and many companies, including tech firms \u2014 say are unfair.\u201cChina is engaged in numerous unfair policies and practices relating to United States technology and intellectual property \u2014 such as forcing United States companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement last week.Tech companies agree that China has long pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business in China or engaged in outright theft of intellectual property. But they argue that using tariffs as a retaliatory measure will hurt American companies while doing little to change China\u2019s ways.Tech and telecommunications products are among the fastest growing imports from China. In 2014, electronics accounted for 40 percent of all Chinese imports, according to the United States International Trade Commission. While the total value of telecommunications parts affected by the latest round of tariffs is unclear, the Telecommunications Industry Association estimates \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in extra costs for companies.The impact on the industry is amplified by the timing, as the United States and China race one another to dominate the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks, known as 5G. The faster networks will fuel the use of artificial intelligence in driverless cars and robotics and other technologies used by military. Companies have warned that the administration\u2019s tariffs will undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s stated plan to lead in those areas.\u201cThese latest duties threaten to raise the cost of 5G infrastructure in the U.S. by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Nokia officials told the F.C.C., according to public filings.\u201cOf course, this is related to some of the product that we import into the U.S. that is manufactured in China, and we are very much focused on mitigating that manufacturing,\u201d Micron\u2019s chief executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in an interview on CNBC.Other companies are weighing legal options. A leading trade group, the Consumer Technology Association, which represents 2,000 tech companies, said the administration is overstepping its authority on trade policy and is considering legal action against the administration.\u201cWe are exploring all options,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the association\u2019s president, said when asked if his group would sue the administration. \u201cThe tariffs will stifle our global leadership in 5G, create and internet tax on business and cause uncertainty for companies.\u201dThe inclusion of tech products only increased tension between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Silicon Valley has sparred with Mr. Trump on immigration. Mr. Trump accused tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google of political bias against conservatives and Amazon of avoiding tax payments. The companies have refuted the president\u2019s claims.Some companies have been partially spared. After intense lobbying by Apple and Fitbit, the Trump administration removed several consumer electronics products from the latest round of tariffs. Left off the list are technologies that affect Apple\u2019s Watch and other fitness trackers, AirPod earbuds and wireless speakers. The administration spared a total of 300 products from an earlier proposal drafted in July.On Friday, a senior administration official who has been engaged in trade negotiations defended the decision to offer relief to Apple\u2019s products. In a briefing with reporters at the White House, the official rejected the notion that winners and losers were being determined based on lobbying power.\u201cThis has been talked about a lot as an Apple issue, Apple has been very vocal about it, but the tariff lines that have been exempted, they applied to a whole range of companies in addition to Apple,\u201d the official said, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the trade battle with China would be resolved.When asked about the exemptions of Apple\u2019s products, Mr. Cook said that while the iPhone is assembled in China, many parts are made and developed in the United States. The tariffs would cost a company like Apple when it imports devices assembled in China.\u201cI think they looked at this and said that it\u2019s not really great for the United States to put a tariff on those type of products,\u201d Mr. Cook said.An earlier version of this article misidentified the location of Nokia\u2019s headquarters. It is Finland, not Sweden.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Watch Series 4 Review: A Big Step for Wearable Gadgets", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bytech fixThe faster speeds and larger screen sound boring on paper. But an electrical heart sensor gives a glimpse of the promise to come, our reviewer writes.A few days ago, I sat in a medical recliner at the University of California, San Francisco. A cardiologist placed 10 stickerlike electrodes onto my limbs and chest and then connected the wires to a dated-looking contraption with a screen and a keyboard on a cart.About a minute later, a printer produced a chart of my heart\u2019s electrical activity on red graph paper. The procedure I had undergone was an electrocardiogram, or an EKG, which is used to diagnose cardiac problems like arrhythmia and heart attacks. The Apple Watch\u2019s EKG won\u2019t be nearly as comprehensive as the one produced by a traditional electrocardiograph, which hooks up to multiple parts of the body, like the one the cardiologist used on me. The watch is a single-lead EKG device, meaning it will record one angle of the heart\u2019s electrical signals \u2014 enough to collect data about arrhythmia but not to diagnose a heart attack.Still, the new Apple Watch is perhaps one of the most significant developments in wearable gadgets in years. People with heart problems can easily use the EKG app to take electrocardiograms whenever they sense something abnormal, without the rigmarole I went through. And the data can be shared immediately with their doctor, which could open a conversation about next steps, like going in for a visit or modifying treatment.For everyone else who doesn\u2019t have a confirmed heart condition, this feature will not immediately be a selling point. \u201cI\u2019m not recommending it for most people as anything other than just a novelty,\u201d said Dr. Ethan Weiss, the cardiologist who took my EKG. But he added that the implications for heart research were profound. \u201cThere\u2019s all this stuff we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. Typically, an EKG in a doctor\u2019s office provides up to 90 seconds of data. \u201cWe\u2019re only getting little snippets,\u201d Dr. Weiss said.In the meantime, I tested the new Apple Watch for a week and found it incrementally better than the previous version. Here are the highlights. The most apparent changes to the new Apple Watch show up in its higher price and larger screen and case.The new models start at $399, compared with $329 previously. The two sizes are 40 millimeters and 44 millimeters, up from 38 millimeters and 42 millimeters. But while the case is now slightly longer and wider, it is also thinner, and the 40-millimeter model didn\u2019t feel bulkier than the 38-millimeter Apple Watch that I used in the past.More important, the screen stretches out from one edge to the other, letting apps take up more of the watch\u2019s face. This enlarged display makes everything on the watch look better, including text.A less obvious, though still useful, change is the watch\u2019s speed. Apple emphasized that the device was two times faster than the third-generation model, which was already zippy. The speed difference was most noticeable when using Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant. By simply raising the watch toward my mouth, I could speak a command like \u201cSet a timer for 20 minutes,\u201d and the watch reacted with barely any delay. The hands-free ability to summon Siri is a feature of Apple\u2019s new watch operating system, WatchOS 5. In my book, this is how watches were meant to be used: without having to press any buttons. To test the watch\u2019s fitness-tracking capabilities, I wore it on a 7.7-mile hike in Pacifica, Calif. I opened the Workout app on the watch, chose hiking as a workout and paid close attention to the device\u2019s tracking of my walking distance and heart rate.Throughout the hike, I wondered about my progress. How many miles to the end of the trail? Had I gone too far and gotten lost? The Apple Watch relieved me of anxiety by updating the distance I had hiked for every tenth of a mile. By the end of the trek, the Apple Watch said I had hiked precisely 7.7 miles. Impressive accuracy.During steep inclines throughout the hike, I glanced at the watch to check my heart rate. With past Apple Watch models, there was a delay before they showed me. But the new model, with its improved speed, updated with my current heart rate almost instantaneously.While the Apple Watch Series 4 is a solid piece of technology and another step toward the maturity of wearable computers, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for people who are considering a smart watch for the first time.If you are simply a health-conscious person, should you get the new watch? I wasn\u2019t able to test the EKG app because it is not out yet. Those with heart conditions would be wise to wait until Apple releases its electrocardiogram app this year to see if the technology works well. It is also important to not regard the watch as a catchall device for health monitoring. Dr. Weiss said that even if the EKG app detected arrhythmia in a young person, for example, that information would not necessarily be useful because the condition might not cause a problem at a young age. Instead, it may just induce anxiety.\u201cWhat it is going to do is make you aware of having this condition, which could impact your insurance, which could impact your mental state and your state of happiness,\u201d Dr. Weiss said.I struggled to trigger the fall detector. In the name of journalism, I took several dives at home onto my mattress, a couch and a dog bed to try to get it to work.My failure to trigger the fall detector was not necessarily a bad thing. To design the feature, Apple worked with people in assisted living facilities and movement disorder clinics to collect data about real slips and falls \u2014 not my phony ones.As for my own health, the new Apple Watch basically showed me I was getting plenty of exercise. And for those who were wondering: Dr. Weiss pronounced that the heart activity from my EKG was normal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Netflix Executives Who Bent Comedy to Their Will", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyLOS ANGELES \u2014 To its competitors, the Netflix takeover of comedy must have seemed nasty, brutish and quick.In only a few years, the streaming giant has pushed aside HBO as the home of prestige stand-up and made Comedy Central seem like Comedy Marginal. By signing up A-listers (Dave Chappelle, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock), turning rising talent into stars (Ali Wong and Hannah Gadsby) and radically expanding the volume of new content, Netflix has transformed the stand-up special into the bustling center of popular culture. How did it do it?The cynical explanation, commonly heard in comedy circles, is that the service just outspent everyone else. But in rare, extensive interviews that explored that criticism as well as a controversy over pay equity, Lisa Nishimura, Netflix\u2019s vice president of original documentary and comedy programming, and Robbie Praw, its director of original stand-up comedy, the most powerful gatekeepers in stand-up, tell a different story, one in which iconoclasm, new metrics and abiding faith in the algorithm disrupt the stale conventions of an industry.Over dinner at an Italian restaurant last month, Ms. Nishimura, 47, projected casual charisma in jeans and glasses, shifting between comedy nerd chatter and Silicon Valley-speak. Mr. Praw, 37, warm but more cautious, sat next to her, listening in awe as she explained perhaps her greatest coup, persuading Mr. Chappelle to return to a national platform. She lingered on the image of seeing him after the Bafta Awards one year in London when a security guard who didn\u2019t recognize him stopped him from entering a party. She introduced herself: \u201cWe\u2019re heading to another party. Wanna go?\u201dHe did, and years later, he joined her again, not only agreeing to release his first standup special in 13 years on Netflix, but also following that with three more in 2017. Bringing this reclusive star to Netflix solidified its dominant reputation. His pay for the package of shows was widely reported as $60 million. Netflix does not confirm salaries, but, asked how she determined what to offer him, Ms. Nishimura responded: \u201cThe way we do everything else,\u201d she said. \u201cWe go into the data.\u201dThe same impulse was evident over a decade earlier when Ms. Nishimura started working for Netflix, buying content of all kinds from companies other than major studios. After seeing how specials first shown on cable performed on Netflix, she developed a hunch that the common wisdom about the stand-up special \u2014 that it had a limited audience \u2014 was entirely wrong.It was a fairly niche genre then; months went by without a major release. But when you made specials readily available, Ms. Nishimura noticed there was an enthusiastic untapped market. \u201cWe started to hear from artist and managers that they were feeling something almost instantly,\u201d Ms. Nishimura said.When Netflix started developing original content, Ms. Nishimura\u2019s experience helped make the case to bet big on comedy. Now, 50 percent of its 130 million subscribers have watched a special in the last year, and a third of those viewers have watched three such shows.Netflix currently releases about a special every week, and the frequency increased dramatically in fall 2016, not long after Ms. Nishimura brought on Mr. Praw, a comedy obsessive who was vice president at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal and who, at Netflix, leads four employees constantly scouting new work. Their strategy is rooted in the belief that Netflix doesn\u2019t need to choose between quality and quantity, that the eternal showbiz question of whether to go for mass or prestige is a false choice.They can do both, their argument goes, because they not only have more data on what the audience wants \u2014 and, with their algorithm\u2019s help, are better able to personalize the experience \u2014 but also their system of analyzing taste is more refined than that of others in the industry.Unlike traditional media outlets, Netflix does not fixate on categories of age, gender or race. \u201cWe don\u2019t pull demographic information because you would be in danger of imparting biases of what a 75-year-old Japanese grandmother would want to watch versus a 14-year-old kid from Ohio,\u201d Ms. Nishimura said. \u201cBut there are moments in time when they are in the exact same taste cluster. We see it all the time.\u201dThe Netflix system has more than 2,000 \u201ctaste clusters\u201d that measure content by tone, timbre and feeling to predict what you will want to see when you log onto the site. Netflix places more emphasis on whether a show is uplifting, somber or redemptive than on genre or who the director is. But what do these new metrics say about comedy that the rest of us cannot see?Netflix is famously tight-lipped about data. It won\u2019t release audience information to the news media or comics, who would love to know who watches their specials to plan tours.But the two executives will discuss some details. Mr. Praw said one of the many misconceptions he brought to Netflix was that there would be no overlap between fans of, say, Gabriel Iglesias\u2019s broad comedy and Maria Bamford\u2019s more cerebral standup. \u201cWhat we discovered is that for some people that\u2019s the case,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for others, that assumption is wrong.\u201dMs. Nishimura added that there was also a surprising overlap between viewers interested in Ms. Gadsby and \u201cWild Wild Country,\u201d the documentary series about a cult leader. They are both popular, she said, among those drawn to explorations of the \u201chuman condition, what motivates people under pressure.\u201dNetflix may try to transcend the old categories, but now that it\u2019s the biggest and most influential stand-up platform, it\u2019s become a subject of intense scrutiny about issues of representation and pay equity.Netflix had not produced any new hourlong stand-up shows by black women in 2017 or 2018 \u2014 although several have appeared in the service\u2019s half-hour and 15-minute collections. When asked if Netflix has a responsibility to do better, Mr. Praw said: \u201cI think we have a responsibility, but it\u2019s also what our members want.\u201dThe next day, Mr. Praw emailed to clarify his comments and in a follow-up conversation conceded that programming so few black women has been a failure. Since our discussion, Netflix has announced that Tiffany Haddish and Ms. Sykes will release specials through the service next year.In comedy circles, the most common criticism of Netflix is that in releasing so many specials, it\u2019s oversaturating the market, making it more difficult for comics who aren\u2019t superstars to break out. But Mr. Praw rejects that argument. \u201cWe would never look at musicians and say let\u2019s put out 10 albums this year,\u201d Mr. Praw responded.When asked if he\u2019s worried about running out of A-list stars, Mr. Praw pointed to forthcoming specials by Ellen DeGeneres and Adam Sandler and remaining deals with Mr. Rock and Mr. Seinfeld.Players like Disney and Apple are entering the streaming market. But it\u2019s unclear if these outlets will spend tens of millions of dollars on stand-up. Asked if Netflix can continue to offer huge sums, Ms. Nishimura replied, \u201cIf we continue to grow the audience, we\u2019re O.K.\u201dThis may be partly why Netflix is putting a premium on the global market, recently hiring an Amsterdam-based executive to recruit international comics. Next year, the service will release 47 half-hour specials in seven different languages on the same day.\u201cWhen you look around the world, there\u2019s stand-up markets all over the place where there weren\u2019t 20 years ago,\u201d Mr. Praw said. \u201cNow there\u2019s clubs in Korea.\u201dIn this new venture, they may upend another bit of common wisdom \u2014 that comedy has trouble crossing borders. It wasn\u2019t long ago when it seemed ridiculous that a DVD rental company would dominate American stand-up. The idea that it would take over the world hardly seems far-fetched.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s How to Save on an Upgrade.", "Date": "2018-09-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixIt\u2019s the time of year when smartphone makers introduce their newest wares to tempt you to spend your hard-earned dollars on the latest, priciest devices.And this Wednesday, Apple is set to introduce three new iPhones, including some models with bigger screens and higher starting prices.According to a person briefed on Apple\u2019s new products, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential, the changes will include:\u2022 A new entry-level phone to replace the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, with a larger display, at 6.1 inches.\u2022 The introduction of a big-screen premium phone with a 6.5-inch display, Apple\u2019s biggest ever.In what has become an ever-clearer trend, the prices of some of these new iPhones are also expected to go up. The new entry-level iPhone may start at $749, with the 5.8-inch iPhone X coming in at $949 and $1,049 for the giant 6.5-inch-screen model, analysts estimated. In contrast, just a few years ago Apple\u2019s iPhones started at $649 for the smaller model and $749 for the larger one.An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the prices of the new phones.The increasing number of higher-priced, bigger-screen smartphones has become a well-worn strategy by the phone makers. Given that many people around the world \u2014 especially in developed countries \u2014 already own a phone and upgrade at a slower pace than they used to, phone vendors industrywide are focused on wringing more dollars out of each device by having them get larger and more expensive.So where does that leave us? If you want to upgrade to some of the latest devices without breaking the bank, I have a few tips on how to achieve that.The easiest way to save some money on your next phone is to trade in your current cellphone. In the last few years, wireless carriers and retailers have expanded their trade-in programs to be seamless and more inclusive.Here\u2019s an overview of how some of them work.After trading in your phone, you can use the credit in a couple of ways.Let\u2019s say, for example, you are trading in an iPhone 7 to Verizon Wireless. The Verizon webpage offers $185 in credit for that phone, and you accept it.Now let\u2019s imagine that the next new iPhone costs $1,049. If you buy the device outright from Verizon, you could shave $185 off the $1,049, bringing the total to $864.Or you could opt to pay for the new iPhone with an installment plan and spread the cost of the phone into monthly payments. If Verizon hypothetically requires a $300 down payment for the new iPhone, your $185 in credit would reduce the amount you pay up front to $115. From there, you\u2019d pay $31.20 a month for 24 months to cover the remaining $749.You could sell your old device directly to another consumer for a chance to get more cash than through a trade-in program. This is similar to how selling a used car in a private sale usually yields more money than trading it in at a dealership.But there are trade-offs: Some buyers can be a nuisance and bombard you with lots of questions or take a long time to send payment.You could also ask your friends and family whether they want to buy your used phone. Just don\u2019t offer it to the hagglers among them.Taking care of your gadgets takes time. But with the rising costs of phones, the benefits are greater now that you will save even more by sticking with the tried and true.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Dominates as a Merchant and Platform. Europe Sees Reason to Worry.", "Date": "2018-09-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor many independent merchants who sell their goods on Amazon, there has long been deep concern that if the e-commerce giant saw a particular product selling well, the company would duplicate it, but at a lower price.The European Union\u2019s antitrust chief said on Wednesday that there may be reason for worry.Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s competition commissioner, announced the start of an investigation into whether Amazon is unfairly using data collected about third-party sellers to make its own decisions about products to sell \u2014 information that would give it a potentially anticompetitive edge.Ms. Vestager, the world\u2019s most aggressive regulator of American technology giants, said that Amazon\u2019s dual position as host of the largest online platform for third-party sellers and as a retailer of goods deserved a closer look from European investigators. Her office has sent a number of questionnaires to market participants to learn more about Amazon\u2019s practices.\u201cThe question here is about the data,\u201d Ms. Vestager said at a news conference on Wednesday. She said that she wanted to know whether Amazon used data collected from merchants to make its own calculation about \u201cwhat is the new big thing, what it is that people want, what kind of offers do they like to receive, what makes them buy things?\u201dShe called the investigation \u201cpreliminary,\u201d and noted that a formal inquiry had not been started. European antitrust investigations can take years to complete.\u201cIt is very early days in this antitrust investigation into Amazon\u2019s business practices,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.Amazon had no immediate comment.Most of the products sold on Amazon come from third-party sellers who use the platform to find customers. The practice has been mutually beneficial: Merchants get access to Amazon customers they would not otherwise be able to reach, while Amazon is able to offer a wider range of products and to collect a fee from any goods that are sold. Just over half of the company\u2019s unit sales globally come from third-party sellers.Amazon, she added, can use sales data about other merchants to improve its offerings.This is not the first time Amazon has been in Ms. Vestager\u2019s sights. Last year, her office ordered Luxembourg to collect 250 million euros, or about $290 million at current exchange rates, in back taxes from the online retail giant.An earlier version of this article, using information from an Amazon spokesman, referred incorrectly to the proportion of Amazon\u2019s sales that come from third-party sellers. It is just over half of unit sales globally, not revenue.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk Had a Deal From the S.E.C. It Fell Apart in a Morning.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Thursday began, Elon Musk had a deal on the table.After days of tense negotiations, the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawyers for Mr. Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, had agreed on a settlement that would bring to a close a drama that has riveted Wall Street and Silicon Valley for the past two months.Under the terms of the agreement, what started on Aug. 7 \u2014 when Mr. Musk posted on Twitter that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private for $420 a share \u2014 would end with some modest penalties and Mr. Musk staying on as chief executive, according to two people briefed on the talks.The plan, as it was negotiated by lawyers, was for Mr. Musk to step down as chairman of Tesla within 45 days and not resume that post for two years. The company, also a party to the proposed agreement, would add two new directors to its board. Mr. Musk and the company would pay tens of millions of dollars in fines, according to the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The negotiators planned to announce the agreement on Thursday after the markets closed.The settlement with the S.E.C. was a \u201cneither admit nor deny\u201d deal, meaning that Mr. Musk would not have acknowledged knowingly committing a violation. Mr. Musk, however, would not have been allowed to publicly state that he had done nothing wrong \u2014 and that was something he couldn\u2019t accept, according to three people familiar with the talks.So on Thursday morning, as settlement papers were being drawn up and news releases were being drafted, Mr. Musk walked away. Lawyers, Tesla executives and advisers to the company were stunned that he would turn away from such a favorable settlement.\u201cThe company\u2019s brand and stock will suffer if he leaves,\u201d said Mike Ramsey, an auto analyst at Gartner. \u201cBut I hate to say it, they might be better off.\u201dOn Friday, the S.E.C. set a date of Feb. 1 for a preliminary hearing on the case, leaving plenty of time for Mr. Musk to change his mind and agree to a settlement, albeit a potentially less favorable one. But the lawsuit, which could take years to come to trial, will cast a cloud over the company as long as the matter remains unresolved.In recent weeks, the S.E.C. was preparing to send Tesla a Wells Notice, signaling that it intended to bring civil charges against the company and Mr. Musk. But by Thursday, after the settlement talks fell apart, the S.E.C. narrowed its focus. Instead of looking to settle with the company and Mr. Musk, it sued Mr. Musk alone, according to a person close the company.After the commission began to investigate Mr. Musk\u2019s assertion on Twitter, his lawyers sent two lengthy letters to regulators making their case that he had done nothing wrong, according to that person.The letters outlined meetings that Mr. Musk had had with officials from a Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, which had led him to believe he had financial support to take Tesla private, the person said.On an evening in March 2017, for example, Mr. Musk and Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer dined at the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., with Larry Ellison, the chairman of Oracle, and Yasir Al Rumayyan, the managing director of the Saudi Public Investment Fund. During the meal, the letters said, Mr. Rumayyan raised the idea of taking Tesla private and increasing the Saudi fund\u2019s stake in it.More than a year later, the lawyers said, Mr. Musk and Mr. Rumayyan met at the Tesla factory on July 31. When Mr. Rumayyan spoke again of taking the company private, Mr. Musk asked him whether anyone else at the fund needed to approve of such a significant deal. Mr. Rumayyan said no, according to the person familiar with the letters.Representatives for Mr. Ellison and the Saudi investment fund did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday evening. People familiar with the workings of the Saudi fund previously said it had taken none of the steps that such an ambitious transaction would entail, like preparing a term sheet or hiring a financial adviser to work on the deal.Mr. Musk and other Tesla executives told Tesla\u2019s board about the talks with the Saudis, the lawyers wrote, according to the person familiar with the letters. On Aug. 3, Mr. Musk shared his idea for the $420 share price with the board.It was an Aug. 7 Financial Times story that spurred Mr. Musk to action, the lawyers said in the letters to the commission. An alarm bell went off when he saw the newspaper\u2019s report that the Saudis had built up a significant stake in Tesla. He feared that word would get out that a deal to take Tesla private was possible. So he began to tweet, the lawyers said.His tweets, the lawyers wrote, were sent in good faith. He believed that the Saudis were capable of doing a deal and interested in doing one, and that what remained was a matter of details, according to the person familiar with the letters.One sticking point for Mr. Musk in the tentative S.E.C. settlement was the particular statute which he was said to have violated.That statute contains language about misleading investors. Mr. Musk\u2019s lawyers wanted the commission to change its claim to say he was merely negligent in his statement, according to a person familiar with the details of the negotiations.Mr. Musk was concerned about what those terms might mean for his other businesses, SpaceX and the Boring Company. He was worried the agreement could jeopardize those companies\u2019 ability to continue working for the government, the person said.In a statement after the commission filed its suit on Thursday, Mr. Musk called the agency\u2019s enforcement effort \u201cunjustified.\u201d\u201cI have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors,\u201d he said. \u201cIntegrity is the most important value in my life, and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.\u201dMr. Musk\u2019s decision to back away from the settlement could complicate Tesla\u2019s future. He has said the company will be consistently profitable by the end of this year, propelled by sales of its newest car, the midsize Model 3 sedan. But Tesla has struggled to meet its production targets for the Model 3, and has continued to burn through cash while two bond payments totaling more than a billion dollars will come due in the next six months.Tesla had $2.2 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter, but has been using up nearly a $1 billion every three months. It also has about $11 billion in debt, and owed its suppliers $3 billion as of June 30.Mr. Musk has said Tesla won\u2019t seek additional capital. But Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, said he believed Tesla will have do so in the first half of 2019.Mr. Musk\u2019s legal troubles will only make it more difficult for the company to issue bonds or secure other financing.\u201cThe best case is they can get access to capital but it\u2019s more expensive than they would like,\u201d Mr. Nelson said. \u201cThe worst case is they won\u2019t be able to raise capital.\u201dAnother uncertainty for investors is who will ultimately be at the helm of Tesla. Mr. Musk is Tesla\u2019s visionary, much like Steve Jobs was at Apple, Mr. Nelson said, and belief in him is one of the reasons investors have bet on Tesla shares.\u201cHe\u2019s critical, in our opinion,\u201d Mr. Nelson said.Neal E. Boudette contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Farhad Manjoo, your technology columnist \u2014 and more important for our purposes today, I\u2019m a guy who has been to every Apple iPhone-unveiling event since the first one, all the way back in 2007. (If I were single, this would make a killer Tinder profile, right?)But I come to you today to praise rather than complain. Because this year, I did find myself getting a little out of my seat and my picture of the future expanded to include possibilities I hadn\u2019t considered viable before. For the first time in years, I was truly surprised.There\u2019s just one catch: I felt this way about Apple\u2019s new watch, not its smartphone. The phones were fine. Apple\u2019s going to sell a lot of them and make a lot of money, as it does every year. But it\u2019s the watch that might change the future most arrestingly.The big deal: The new Apple Watch packs a slew of sensors to make it a truly novel kind of wearable device \u2014 something like a \u201cStar Trek\u201d tricorder on your body. The new watch can administer a medically accurate electrocardiogram, a test of a person\u2019s heart rhythm that can help detect dangerous health conditions. It also detects and alerts rescue personnel to dangerous falls, a leading cause of injury, especially for older people.One detail was particularly compelling. Apple received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration for its device, meaning that when you take your watch\u2019s data to your doctor, there will be some basis for accepting its pronouncements.By themselves, these features won\u2019t change the world. But they may play a significant role in some people\u2019s lives, even saving some from an early death.It is significant that Apple is consulting with regulators as it does so. The prevailing ethos across much of the industry is to charge forward with new tech \u2014 to beg forgiveness from the world when things go wrong, instead of asking permission first. How refreshing it is, then, that Apple went through proper channels here. When it comes to health, moving fast and breaking things isn\u2019t an option.There was some other news in tech this week:And that\u2019s it, folks! See you next week.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Fetching a High Price, Time Magazine Moves Into a New Era", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Time magazine started in 1923, it hit upon a popular formula: short, punchy items that aggregated the week\u2019s events and came in an entertaining package. But the newsweekly could never compete with the digital version of its own blueprint: the internet\u2019s bloggers, explainers, listicles and 30-second videos.Time\u2019s sales and profits, like those of most print publications, have been shrinking every year, a situation that made it difficult to sell the magazine, even with its storied past.The auction was more complex than Meredith executives had expected. The Des Moines-based publisher specializes in titles focused on home and lifestyle topics, and its advertising business is not designed for news and sports publications. Selling the four publications had always been the plan.Alan Murray, the chief content officer of the former Time Inc. brands, who helped lead the process, and Meredith\u2019s banking adviser, Citigroup, placed potential bidders into tiered groups. The groups were based on several factors, including the ability to pay and the level of seriousness. Meredith considered selling all the titles together but soon settled on individual transactions. Money will most likely be bundled with Fortune when it is sold.\u201cIt was a learning process for me, and these things just take a lot longer than you think they would,\u201d Mr. Murray said.Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money should be sold by the end of the year, he said. \u201cThere are very healthy, advanced conversations going on,\u201d he added, though he declined to comment on specific suitors. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic.\u201dMeredith fended off a $325 million offer for Time from David J. Pecker, the media executive who has become a key witness in a federal investigation into President Trump. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Pecker, who publishes The National Enquirer, suppressed the story of a former Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, according to federal prosecutors.Until a few weeks ago, Mr. Benioff was nearing an agreement to acquire Fortune and Money, according to four people familiar with the sales process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. He switched his preference to Time when he decided its business was stronger, one of the people said.Reed Phillips, a longtime investment banker specializing in media transactions, said the purchase price was surprisingly high.\u201cFor a business in decline, that\u2019s a big number,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems that when billionaires buy media assets, it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re making a nonprofit donation. They\u2019re not doing this as a moneymaker. This is more of a cause.\u201dMeredith had been asking as much as $200 million for Fortune as recently as May, two of the people said. Fortune benefits from a lucrative conference business, but a big share of those profits comes from an event it produces in China for which a municipality pays most of the cost, the people said.Sports Illustrated, which was priced in the area of $150 million, has drawn intense interest from multiple suitors, including sports figures, the people said. Endeavor, the powerhouse agency representing sports clients and Hollywood talent, considered buying the title but backed off after it decided the magazine wasn\u2019t a fit with its main business, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.Mr. Benioff is the latest tech billionaire to take the reins of a historic news brand. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013, and last year, Laurene Powell Jobs, who heads the Emerson Collective and is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, bought a majority stake of The Atlantic magazine.But the re-emergence of billionaire media proprietors isn\u2019t a sign the news profession is bouncing back, said Kyle Pope, the editor in chief of the Columbia Journalism Review.\u201cLet\u2019s not read anything more into this about the health of newsmagazines,\u201d he said. \u201cMost papers and magazines across the country are still desperate.\u201dHe added: \u201cIconic magazines like Time will always have a suitor because people like Benioff will always want to own these things. It's a good way to keep these titles going, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s good for journalism writ large.\u201dWith Time, Mr. Benioff and his wife will face challenges. The magazine\u2019s revenue inched past $170 million last year with profits around $25 million, according to two of the people familiar with its finances.Expenses at Meredith\u2019s magazine division grew by more than $566 million with the addition of Time Inc., while profits shrank by more than a third to $98 million in the 12 months ending in June, when the company reports its fiscal year.As part of the Time deal, Meredith will continue to provide shared services for the magazine, helping Mr. Benioff save on print and ink costs. Marketing and subscription fulfillment will also be included in that agreement.Walter Shapiro, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who spent over 10 years at Time during the 1980s and \u201990s, said he had stopped reading the magazine after Meredith acquired it but was considering renewing his subscription after the sale.\u201cThey need to go back to a much more traditional word-filled product,\u201d he said, comparing Time with The Economist, a text-heavy magazine that has fared well. \u201cThey need to take a deeper look and not just with investigative reporting. That\u2019s how they\u2019ll differentiate themselves now.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Metamorphosis of Silicon Valley C.E.O.s: From Big to Boring", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the Art\u201cI don\u2019t know what a Twitter C.E.O. should look like,\u201d Mr. Barton said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look like what a C.E.O. of Twitter should look like.\u201dThe congressman had a point. Mr. Dorsey \u2014 who sported a nose ring, a popped-collar shirt and a craggy Moses beard \u2014 looked more like a hipster version of a Civil War officer than a tech icon. Yet more striking than his look was his manner before skeptical lawmakers.Faced with tough questions, Mr. Dorsey did not mount an aggressive defense of his company and his technology, as an earlier generation of tech leader might have. Instead, he demurred, conceded mistakes and generally engaged in a nuanced and seemingly heartfelt colloquy on the difficulties of managing tech in a complex world. Even in response to Mr. Barton\u2019s comment about his look, Mr. Dorsey was solicitous. \u201cMy mom agrees with you,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey\u2019s testimony prompted questions about what we expect from tech leaders today \u2014 and how thoroughly what we expect has been upturned in the last few years. Since the 1980s, a common leadership archetype has loomed over the tech business: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Sometimes unconsciously and often deliberately, a generation of tech leaders attempted to ape the Apple and Microsoft founders\u2019 charisma, their quirks, their style and above all their irrepressible, hard-charging confidence, to say nothing of arrogance.That is, Mr. Dorsey sounded less like a quotable visionary who can see beyond the horizon and more like what he actually is and ought to be \u2014 a thoughtful, accessible, transparent and, despite the beard and nose ring, kind of boring manager of a serious company whose decisions have world-changing consequences.When it comes to tech C.E.O.s, boring is the new black. Under the glare of global scrutiny, the daring, win-at-all-costs ethos that defined so much of the tech industry in the last couple of decades has been undergoing a thorough metamorphosis.Google once played up the nerdy antics of its founders, but now the company\u2019s leaders are almost unidentifiable ciphers. Larry Page, who runs Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, has become a recluse, and even Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s achingly pleasant chief, declined to appear at last week\u2019s hearings.Oh, and I almost forgot about Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s C.E.O. In my defense, everyone forgets about Mr. Nadella.\u201cA start-up that has five million people using it \u2014 that\u2019s small for Silicon Valley, but it\u2019s a tremendous number of people, and so even they have a large amount of responsibility in the world,\u201d Mr. Reeves said.The tech press has also gotten tougher. Once, novelty alone would merit coverage, but in the social media age, even the tiniest misstep can be ruinous. It has become crucial to get a leader who doesn\u2019t speak out of turn.Mr. Musk\u2019s odd behavior underlines the tensions at play as understated style takes over tech. There is a reason that a big, Jobsian personality was once so prized. Tech companies are leaps of faith. In their early days they exist on the knife edge of oblivion, and it is often only through a founder\u2019s force of personality that investors, employees and the media take any notice. The most beloved founders possess an uncanny genius for selling the world on ideas that look useless, pointless or impossible before we all realize we can never live without them.Though he has made good on only some of those points \u2014 Tesla is now struggling to fulfill orders for the Model 3, the \u201ceven more affordable\u201d car in the plan \u2014 posting the plan was part of an impish ploy to generate publicity for what looked like an outlandish idea. That ploy worked; ever since, Mr. Musk has leveraged his growing celebrity as if it were a currency.Every few months, he makes new promises about this or that amazing thing coming soon. Each time, he reaps more attention and financing and, eventually, builds real cars that are sold to real people. In this way, Mr. Musk\u2019s personality became a key element of not just his companies\u2019 brands, but their business models.But it\u2019s a tricky, high-stakes gamble. For one thing, Mr. Musk has to deliver on his promises. More recently, another problem has eaten at this strategy: The future has been getting less obviously wonderful, so it\u2019s hard to take any tech chief\u2019s assurances that their new thing will indeed be as great for the world as they say.\u201cI tried to convince people to slow down A.I.,\u201d he told Mr. Rogan. \u201cThis was futile. I tried for many years. Nobody listened. Nobody listened.\u201dThus, the tension: On one hand, Mr. Musk wants us to believe that everything he\u2019s building is going to turn out wonderfully. On the other, he\u2019s telling us to be very scared. This sounds like a contradiction, but in its admission of doubt and complexity, it\u2019s actually a pretty good picture of the future.No wonder he sounds crazy. No wonder everyone else is going for boring.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Trump\u2019s Trade War Mounts, China\u2019s Wall Street Allies Lose Clout", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew trade talks between the two governments are tentatively scheduled between Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Liu He, a Chinese vice premier, later this month in Washington. Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone\u2019s chief, has been playing a critical role in organizing them, say people familiar with the talks, who asked for anonymity because the process is sensitive.\u201cWhat\u2019s really surprising is that the connections that used to work, the formula that used to work, just don\u2019t work at this point,\u201d said Marshall W. Meyer, an emeritus professor of management at the Wharton School of Business.A worsening trade war could stymie that progress, and it hurt other foreign businesses as well. Lou Jiwei, China\u2019s former finance minister, said in a speech on Sunday that China could block exports of crucial components for Western supply chains if the trade war continued. Such a move would disrupt American businesses but would likely accelerate corporate efforts to shift factories away from China, and current Chinese officials haven\u2019t publicly discussed such a dramatic step.The financial sector\u2019s arguments have often found a sympathetic ear in Washington. Over the past two decades, China has emerged as a major global economic growth driver and as an important customer for many American companies, including Apple, Qualcomm and General Motors.But the Trump administration\u2019s trade hawks have so far prevailed against Wall Street-friendly voices of trade moderation, such as Mr. Mnuchin, a onetime Goldman Sachs executive. That is partly because the trade war hasn\u2019t shown President Trump much downside. His stance has won support from both parties. The United States economy shows few signs of trade-war damage, and markets continue to rise.Even if Republicans lose Congress in November\u2019s elections, the trade war will probably continue, said Robert B. Zoellick, a former United States trade representative. Only a slump in the markets might make him reconsider, Mr. Zoellick said.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to affect Trump,\u201d Mr. Zoellick said about November\u2019s elections. \u201cMarkets could.\u201dJPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, a onetime informal adviser to Mr. Trump, said last Wednesday in a speech that \u201cI\u2019m smarter than he is\u201d and that unlike Mr. Trump\u2019s, his personal wealth \u201cwasn\u2019t a gift from Daddy.\u201d Mr. Trump the next day called Mr. Dimon a \u201cnervous mess,\u201d and Mr. Dimon has since said he shouldn\u2019t have made the remarks. Others, like Morgan Stanley\u2019s chief, James Gorman, and the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, opposed Trump policies like his original travel and immigration ban.The Wall Street influence ran deep. Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street veteran, served as Treasury secretary under President Clinton and helped forge the consensus within the Clinton administration on how to bring China into the World Trade Organization. Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former Goldman Sachs executive with a high profile in China, served as President Bush\u2019s Treasury secretary.Mr. Schwarzman is working behind the scenes to get China and the United States talking again. He urged American officials to invite their Chinese counterparts to resume talks, according to the people familiar with the discussions.Last week, Mr. Mnuchin issued an invitation, which Chinese officials publicly greeted warmly. But Larry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser and another Wall Street veteran, suggested afterward that China had sought the invitation.The meeting in Beijing on Sunday \u2014 organized by Zhou Xiaochuan, China\u2019s former central banker, and John Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs president \u2014 gave Wall Street a chance to press for more business from China. The bankers were planning to present Wall Street\u2019s wish list for more market access, including creating a more transparent process for financial firms to get operating licenses and expanding the services that American bank branches can offer.Because the meeting was called on short notice, top Wall Street executives didn\u2019t attend. Most sent a senior executive, like Franck Petitgas, head of Morgan Stanley\u2019s international business; John Waldron, president of Goldman Sachs; and Jon Gray, the No. 2 executive at Blackstone. Officials will pass suggestions to Mr. Liu, Mr. Xi\u2019s top economic adviser.Prospects are good that this type of outreach will help, said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator.\u201cTraditionally there have been these back channels, and one of the reasons why Beijing has put people like Liu He in these senior positions has been because they have such good relationships with Wall Street,\u201d said Ms. Cutler, who is vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute.\u201cTo date, these back channels don\u2019t seem to be working in moving this administration towards a negotiated solution.\u201dAlexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong, Kate Kelly from New York and Keith Bradsher from Beijing.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "SiriusXM to Buy Pandora for $3.5 Billion in Bid to Expand Reach", "Date": "2018-09-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPandora rose to success with radio stations, tailored to users, that were sprinkled with ads. In recent years it has struggled to compete with rival services like Spotify and Apple Music, which dominated music streaming by offering paid on-demand content \u2014 something Pandora was slow to replicate.SiriusXM, one of the first commercial enterprises to sell radio service through satellite systems, has been partly hampered by the high capital costs of its business. Acquiring Pandora would give SiriusXM access to the fast-growing online segment of listeners, those who prefer streaming music through mobile phones. Fewer people are listening to traditional programming, whether over terrestrial or satellite radio.\u201cIt would allow Sirius to reach a much broader audience,\u201d said Justin Patterson, a music industry analyst. He likened the situation to DirecTV, the satellite service owned by AT&T, which also sells a streaming version of its product known as DirecTV Now. The online package is cheaper than the satellite offering and has the potential to reach many more households through existing broadband connections.On a call with analysts, Jim Meyer, SiriusXM\u2019s chief executive, said the acquisition would enable Sirius to try to keep listeners who did not want to pay for music by diverting them toward Pandora\u2019s free ad-based model.\u201cThe truth is the majority of \u2018trial-ers\u2019 ultimately decide not to pay for our service,\u201d Mr. Meyer said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times, we would benefit from having a free funnel.\u201dSiriusXM has 36 million subscribers across North America and more than 23 million listeners on trials. The companies said that combined with the 70 million monthly active users on Pandora, this would create the largest digital audio audience in the United States.The $3.5 billion offer is a steep valuation given Pandora\u2019s losses. The company is expected to post a loss of $150 million this year and about $83 million next year.Pandora does stand to benefit from the potential passage of a bill that would make it easier for publishers and artists to earn royalties while also protecting streaming services from lawsuits.SiriusXM\u2019s deal for Pandora allows other potential bidders to emerge in what is known as a go-shop period when the company could attract other buyers. Rivals like Spotify or big tech players like Amazon could come in with a spoiler bid, but Mr. Patterson said he expected Sirius to ultimately close the deal. \u201cThere\u2019s a high probability this goes through,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "AnchorFree, Maker of a Top Online Privacy App, Raises $295 Million", "Date": "2018-09-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDespite the recent attention on digital privacy, venture capital investors have mostly stayed away from companies that offer virtual private networks, which allow users to hide their online tracks.Now there is one big exception.AnchorFree, the maker of Hotspot Shield, one of the oldest VPN apps, said Wednesday that it had raised $295 million. The round brings AnchorFree\u2019s total funding to $358 million, far outpacing any of its competitors.The investment in AnchorFree suggests that the VPN category is becoming more mainstream. Investors previously avoided it in part because relatively few users have adopted the technology. In addition, some of the networks are not as secure as their companies claim.But after events like the Equifax hack, the repeal of net neutrality rules and Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal, downloads of Hotspot Shield spiked.It\u2019s a little perplexing, since a VPN would not have protected people affected by any of those events. David Gorodyansky, the founder and chief executive of AnchorFree, said they had pushed typical consumers to take privacy and security more seriously.Hotspot Shield has been downloaded 650 million times. Lately, it has averaged 250,000 downloads a day. For most of the summer, it has been the top-grossing app in its category in the Apple App Store, and in the top 50 over all, according to the app-ranking site App Annie. AnchorFree\u2019s other apps, Betternet and HexaTech, ranked high on the App Store charts this week, as well as competing VPN apps owned by Norton, McAfee and a variety of obscure companies.\u201cTwo years ago, there were no privacy or security apps in the top 100,\u201d Mr. Gorodyansky said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a massive shift.\u201dVirtual private network technology is open-sourced, or freely available to use, making it easy for anyone to enter the market. There are hundreds of VPN apps. Some, including AnchorFree, have built additional technology on top of the open-source software.Some free services log users\u2019 browsing data and sell it or turn it over to governments when asked. Others say they are based in the United States or the Cayman Islands but actually operate out of countries with censorious governments.Still others obscure what a VPN can actually protect people from.\u201cThey are marketing themselves as \u2018sprinkle our security or privacy dust on your device and suddenly it will become private and secure,\u2019\u201d said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights.AnchorFree made for an attractive venture investment because the technology it has built on top of the open-sourced VPN software makes it faster than other VPN services, said Sujay Jaswa, a partner at WndrCo, the investment firm that led the latest round of financing. Many of AnchorFree\u2019s competitors license its technology, including Bitdefender, Dashlane, Kaspersky and McAfee.AnchorFree\u2019s tech is also prevalent in smartphones and the products of telecommunications companies. Samsung Galaxy phones come loaded with AnchorFree\u2019s VPN software; Verizon and Telef\u00f3nica license it as well. The companies split revenue earned from anyone who becomes a paying customer.The company said it has been profitable since 2010. It has just 110 employees; 80 are engineers, and it has no salespeople. Hotspot Shield is free, but a small percentage of users pay a monthly fee for extra features, including faster internet speeds, the ability choose their internet server, and added protection from phishing, malware and spam. The company recently added a product specifically for businesses.In 2017, the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that promotes digital rights, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate AnchorFree and Hotspot Shield, accusing the company of deceptively redirecting users to certain websites and sharing data.AnchorFree, which has denied the allegations, declined to comment on the investigation. But after the criticism, the company rewrote its terms of service, to avoid legalese, and AnchorFree began to release transparency reports. The first one, issued in November, showed the company received 81 requests for user data from government agencies in the first 10 months of 2017 and 79 in 2016. AnchorFree complied with none of the requests.Hotspot Shield does not log any of its users\u2019 activity, Mr. Gorodyansky said. As a result, the company could not provide the data to the government.\u201cOur conversations are super simple,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no data. End of story.\u201dThe latest round of funding comes from WndrCo along with Accel Partners, 8VC, SignalFire and Green Bay Ventures. AnchorFree would not disclose its valuation or revenue.AnchorFree said it would use the capital to expand into related areas, such as security for internet-connected devices (say, smart doorbells or thermostats). The company will also pursue acquisitions, potentially of companies with sales teams in place.An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the AnchorFree competitors that licenses its technology. It is McAfee, not TunnelBear, a VPN service that McAfee acquired this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Five Eyes\u2019 Nations Quietly Demand Government Access to Encrypted Data", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration and its closest intelligence partners have quietly warned technology firms that they will demand \u201clawful access\u201d to all encrypted emails, text messages and voice communications, threatening to compel compliance if the private companies refuse to voluntarily provide the information to the governments.\u201cShould governments continue to encounter impediments to lawful access to information necessary to aid the protection of the citizens of our countries,\u201d the joint statement said, \u201cwe may pursue technological, enforcement, legislative or other measures to achieve lawful access solutions.\u201dOn Wednesday, leaders from two major social media firms, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, will testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on curbing election interference by Russia and other powers. The social networks are also expected to answer Republican charges that their firms, and others, use their platforms to emphasize news media sources with liberal bias.But the new demands by the five nations threaten to rekindle a debate that seized Washington and Silicon Valley after Apple gradually began encrypting more data on its phones.At the core of the dispute is whether Apple, Facebook, Google and others should be compelled to provide a \u201cback door\u201d to their products that would allow government investigators to gain access to all communications, with a legal order.It is far from clear that Congress is ready to take on the technology companies on this issue, especially because more companies and citizens are turning to encryption to protect sensitive conversations and financial transfers.Ordinary Americans \u2014 including President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen \u2014 are also increasingly using encrypted apps to conduct delicate conversations to prevent monitoring by the government or others.On Tuesday, staff members of key congressional committees said they had received no briefings on the new accord from Australia, and questioned how they could construct rules that provided access to all encrypted communications.One Senate staff member said the memo was unenforceable in its current form.Facebook and Google were similarly surprised, and questioned what sort of measures would be put into place with companies that did not comply.\u201cCybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it\u2019s impossible to create any back door that couldn\u2019t be discovered \u2014 and exploited \u2014 by bad actors,\u201d Facebook said in the blog post. \u201cIt\u2019s why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.\u201dIn response, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, contended that once phones or messaging systems were designed to allow legal access, hackers from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere would use the breach to pry their way in, destroying technology devised to protect privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s our job to provide you with the tools to lock up your stuff,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview in 2015.He tried, unsuccessfully, to convince former President Barack Obama that there was no safe technological way to create back doors; Apple deliberately does not retain the keys to unlock those communications, so they can tell investigators, or the courts, that they are unable to comply with demands for access.But Mr. Obama left office without resolving the issue of the government\u2019s ability to compel access. Both Mr. Trump and his rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, sided with law enforcement authorities on giving access to the government.One Facebook official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said that the memo from Australia had no teeth, and was part of an escalating war between government officials and Silicon Valley over access to people\u2019s private data.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple\u2019s Takeover of Shazam Is Cleared by European Regulators", "Date": "2018-09-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 European authorities on Thursday cleared Apple\u2019s acquisition of the popular song-recognition app Shazam, after months of study into whether the deal would give the iPhone maker an unfair advantage over rival streaming music services like Spotify.Apple said in December that it had agreed to buy Shazam, prompting European regulators to scrutinize the proposed takeover as part of a broader effort to examine the value of data when evaluating mergers.In the case of Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam, regulators questioned whether the app held important information on Apple competitors. The focus on data transfer is a departure from typical antitrust enforcement, which tends to zero in on how a deal may affect customers in terms of a product\u2019s cost.The Apple deal, Ms. Vestager said, would not impede competition.The case was a rare instance in which European antitrust authorities have passed on an opportunity to act against an American technology giant. The region has gained a reputation as the world\u2019s strictest overseer of the technology industry.When starting their investigation of the Apple-Shazam deal in February, regulators said they were concerned that Apple would block Shazam from referring customers to rival services, or that it would use the app to poach customers.On Thursday, the European Commission said that after a six-month review, it had concluded that the app did not give Apple an unfair advantage that merited government intervention.\u201cAccess to Shazam\u2019s data would not materially increase Apple\u2019s ability to target music enthusiasts and any conduct aimed at making customers switch would only have a negligible impact,\u201d the commission said in a statement.Spotify, a major rival to Apple\u2019s own music-streaming service, declined to comment.Shazam was an early hit in Apple\u2019s App Store thanks to its novel ability to quickly identify a track after using a smartphone\u2019s microphone to \u201clisten\u201d for only a few seconds. The two companies established closer ties in 2014, when Shazam was integrated into Apple\u2019s voice-powered digital assistant Siri, allowing users to ask, \u201cHey Siri, what song is playing?\u201dThe app mainly makes money by selling advertisements and collecting fees when it refers users to a music service like Apple and Spotify. Shazam is also a valuable source of data, giving music companies insight into what songs and artists are performing well, and in which regions.Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam has been seen as a possible test case for Ms. Vestager, who has said antitrust enforcement must evolve to consider the value of data.Ms. Vestager has said that with free services, customers effectively pay with their data, and that they are not always getting a fair deal.Broadening the interpretation of antitrust law would have consequences for future acquisitions. But whether such an argument would hold up in a courtroom has not yet been well established, making it harder for authorities to step in.Working in Apple\u2019s favor was the fact the European Commission had previously approved acquisitions between several data-rich companies, including Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of LinkedIn.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "For Big Tech, a Comeuppance We\u2019ve Seen Before: On Wall St.", "Date": "2018-09-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When I moved to the Bay Area two years ago, it was with a sense of relief.Relief from New York winters and deteriorating subways, yes. But also relief after six years of covering Wall Street, an industry that had moved from one crisis to another after the financial crash of 2008, drawing the unending wrath of the public.In California I was joining a growing team of reporters covering Silicon Valley, which had quickly become the new engine of the economy. Just like Wall Street before it lost its luster, the tech industry had become the destination of choice for the top college graduates. I would be writing about a place where everyone was focused more on the future than on the past.Now, just two years after getting here, and a decade after the start of the financial crisis, I have a creeping sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as I go about my job.Admiration of the tech world has, in the wake of a growing list of scandals, quickly soured into an intense suspicion that manages to cross partisan lines, similar to what Wall Street faced after 2008.As was true after the financial crisis, the backlash against tech rises out of a public awakening to the integral role that these huge companies occupy in our society \u2014 with Facebook, Uber and Twitter playing the part that Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase did a decade ago.\u201cPeople talk about bankers being amoral,\u201d said Charlie Beckett, the director of the Truth, Trust and Technology Commission at the London School of Economics. \u201cThey are starting to talk about tech people in similar language. Where before they were kind of heroes \u2014 they were people who brought us these wonderful products \u2014 they are now starting to be blamed for the ills of the world.\u201dIt often feels as though these companies took on their pivotal positions so quickly that no one \u2014 not even their employees \u2014 had a chance to understand how they really worked or how much influence they had.Ana Bot\u00edn, a longtime executive at the giant Spanish bank Santander, recently wrote on LinkedIn that the tech companies were losing the same basic thing that banks lost in 2008: the public\u2019s trust.\u201cSome in big tech are beginning to accept what we in banking learned some years ago: We don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d Ms. Bot\u00edn told me last week.The storm that Ms. Bot\u00edn and other bank executives faced after 2008 and the one we are witnessing now are obviously different.The crisis precipitated by the banks was a financial one that caused markets to crash, and threatened to bring down the global economy.The crisis involving the internet giants is not hitting our pocketbooks \u2014 it is straining our confidence in what we know about the world. If Russian hackers can create and amplify fake news stories across the many sites we have come to rely on, where can we go for reliable information?In public surveys, like the Harris Poll Reputation Quotient, the tech giants are still polling well ahead of Goldman and Wells Fargo, and some, like Amazon and Apple, seem to be mostly flying above the fray.The exact ills that people assign to the industry tend to differ based on their politics. While people on the right, including President Trump, have expressed the most concern about political bias and censorship, the left has worried more about the way the companies opened the door to election interference and have exacerbated income inequality. But nearly everyone is voicing unease about the way our children have been turned into digital addicts.The broad shift in perception is inevitably piling more blame onto the shoulders of one industry than it should bear. Like the mortgage meltdown, our current crisis of confidence is the result of factors that go beyond any one player in the drama \u2014 from the polarization of the media landscape to the growing economic inequality that has led to distrust of elites of all sorts.Whatever the reality, political momentum is building behind some sort of broader regulatory response, similar to what came together in the Dodd-Frank financial regulations. The current push has begun with talk of legislation that would protect our privacy \u2014 but much bolder steps are being considered.What I wonder now is whether any regulatory response will follow a similar path to what came after the financial crisis.A long list of new laws in the United States and Europe did seem to make the banks safer and another crisis less likely.But the regulations also appear to have cemented the status of the biggest banks in our economy. The largest financial institutions now control a bigger proportion of the industry\u2019s assets than they did before the crisis. These big banks are regulated as if they were more like utilities, but the high regulatory costs provide a kind of barrier against most competitors.It is easy to imagine something similar happening in the technology industry, and European authorities have already taken some steps in that direction.If tech companies are forced to be more responsible for the content on their platforms, they will most likely need to build a significant apparatus for compliance.

It would also make it very hard for upstarts to challenge them.\u201cThere\u2019s an increasingly loud call for the platforms to get involved in content moderation,\u201d said Cory Doctorow, a special adviser with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s well intentioned, but the outcome of that is very likely to be pretty disastrous.\u201dMr. Doctorow has been part of a growing chorus of people calling for antitrust actions to break up the biggest companies, rather than tweaking their operations.Whatever steps the government takes, they are unlikely to help recover the trust that has already been lost.

Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. Breitbart News described the 2016 video as a \u201csmoking gun\u201d because it showed Sergey Brin, the Google co-founder, telling everyone how he felt about the new leader of the free world.Spoiler: Not good.\u201cMyself, as an immigrant, as a refugee, I certainly find this election deeply offensive, and I know many of you do, too,\u201d he said in his flat, nasal voice. He was obviously rattled, as were the other top Google executives on stage with him. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very stressful time, and it conflicts with many of our values.\u201dConservatives who have been spreading the canard that social media companies oppress their views \u2014 a drum Mr. Trump has himself been banging on lately \u2014 seized on the video as proof of Google\u2019s bias. But it should not have shocked anyone to find that Mr. Brin, a Russian exile who built the quirkiest of companies on the planet, is no fan of the president.Responding to the attack on its motives, a Google spokeswoman said, \u201cNothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products.\u201d Blah blah blah. I don\u2019t mean to be cavalier. But I am astonished by the focus on this ridiculous scandal when a much more important issue concerning Google and censorship has been largely ignored by the public and by Washington.I\u2019m talking about the fact that Google is considering re-entering the Chinese market after leaving it with a lot of righteous indignation less than a decade ago. Reports say it might once again offer a range of services, including a censored version of its flagship search engine. A Google spokeswoman told me that the controversial effort \u2014 code-named Dragonfly \u2014 is \u201cexploratory,\u201d and that Google is \u201cnot close to launching a search product in China.\u201d What\u2019s most interesting is that much of the outrage about the possibility seems to be coming from Google employees who have registered strong objections, rather than from outside.For those who don\u2019t know the history, Google began operating in China in 2000 and in 2005 the Microsoft tech leader Kai-Fu Lee was hired as the head of Google China. By 2009 Google controlled more than 36 percent of the market share and served hundreds of millions of mainland Chinese users.It offered a truncated version of a search product, which included this disclaimer at the bottom of the page: \u201cSome results have been withheld because of the government restrictions.\u201d Google\u2019s justification for being there was that bringing more information to the information-starved Chinese was a good thing.\u201cAt least Chinese users knew what they were missing,\u201d Nicole Wong, a former top Google lawyer, recently explained to me on my podcast.The hope was that more information could help loosen the government\u2019s stranglehold. That did not happen.By 2010, Google was fed up with increasing repression and intrusions into its systems by Chinese-government-backed hackers. After a prolonged debate, Google withdrew to Hong Kong with a noncensored offering and was effectively out of the larger Chinese market. \u201cOur objection is to those forces of totalitarianism,\u201d Mr. Brin said at the time. He also wrote on his Google Plus page that the \u201cprimary threat by far to internet freedom is government filtering of political dissent.\u201d This rejection of censorship was a bold stance, setting Google apart from other companies, like Apple, that had compromised with the Chinese government in order to do business there.Fast forward to today, when Google is being falsely accused of censoring speech in the United States, when what it is really doing is mulling a return to censorship in China.If this makes you pause, it should, and Washington politicians should take all their sanctimony and direct it at the China issue, which actually deserves some scrutiny. Perhaps that is the real reason Google avoided sending its current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, to the recent Senate hearings, so he could avoid explaining what it was thinking when it came China 2.0: Now With 100 Percent More Hypocrisy.Google seems to have no problem climbing down off its high horse to grab the thing it needs in China.Which is, simply put, more data.That is what Ms. Wong and Dr. Lee, whom I also did a podcast interview with this week, suggested to me was the key impetus for the move.Right now, he notes, with China\u2019s aggressive use of sensors and you-say-facial-recognition-I-say-surveillance, a population hooked on mobile in a much more significant way than here and consumers more willing to trade away their privacy for digital convenience, China\u2019s internet companies have access to 10 to 15 times more data than American ones. Dr. Lee and others have called it a \u201cdata gap\u201d that Google has to bridge, and soon, if it wants to remain competitive.Ms. Wong agrees, noting that doing otherwise might give China the advantage in the next computing era.It\u2019s certainly a far cry from what he wrote with great emotion back in 2012 about leaving China:\u201cRegardless of how you feel about digital ecosystems or about Google, please do not take the free and open internet for granted from government intervention. To the extent that free flow of information threatens the powerful, those in power will seek to suppress it.\u201dWell said, Mr. Brin. Say it again.Advertisement"}

But My Old One Is Better Than Ever.", "Date": "2018-09-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesApple\u2019s new offerings are so good that I\u2019m not buying a new iPhone.I expect to save hundreds of dollars this year and enjoy what I\u2019ve already got, because, thanks to Apple, my old iPhone 6 is performing better than ever.This is the result of two unusual moves by the trillion-dollar corporation. One was Apple\u2019s release this month of a new operating system that not only makes its new iPhones run well, but can also radically improve the performance of millions of old ones.Unless articles like this one spur millions of people to defer purchases, Apple may have found a business strategy that allows the company to have it both ways: Charge ever more money for fancy new phones, while enhancing its reputation by providing value-oriented consumers with reliable products that can last for years.What\u2019s the magic that has rejuvenated my iPhone and given it powers it didn\u2019t possess when I first bought it, nearly four years ago?The answer is mundane. My old iPhone started getting younger in February, when I took advantage of the Apple discount to replace the phone\u2019s aging battery for $29, down from the usual $79 out-of-warranty fee.Until last winter, I had never even thought of replacing an iPhone battery. I accepted that it would wear out every couple of years, and assumed that because of the way Apple had engineered the iPhone, the smart move was to replace the entire device with a new, improved model. My phone appeared to be on its last legs. It ran out of power in a few hours, and sometimes shut down inexplicably.While my new battery made my phone serviceable again, I still assumed I would have to replace it when Apple introduced the new models, and a new operating system, in September, as it does just about every year. New operating systems typically make old phones slow to a crawl.I downloaded the new software, and my phone works spectacularly now. Some people who installed iOS 12 have reported minor glitches, but that hasn\u2019t been my experience. My phone can\u2019t do everything the new iPhone Xs can do, but it seems fast enough to me.A lot of other things are possible with my iPhone now. Searching for photos of family members is now staggeringly easy. Most important, the phone\u2019s internal capacity seems to have been enlarged: I can read a book, switch to a magazine, start an audiobook app, return to The New York Times website, check my heartbeat and see how many miles I jogged this morning, all without crashing the phone.Moderating this kind of addictive overuse is easier, too, thanks to functions that make it simpler to turn off annoying messages for extended periods. It\u2019s like having a new, speedy phone, without having to buy one.What\u2019s the upside for Apple? By supporting my aging iPhone years after what might have been its sell-by date, the company has increased the odds that \u2014 when I do actually need a new phone \u2014 I will remain in the Apple universe, expensive as it may be to live there. My old phone, which cost $649 new, seems like a much better deal now, considering all the use I\u2019m getting out of it.Even before the latest changes, many people had been delaying buying a new phone. In Apple-speak, the iPhone replacement cycle has lengthened, and annual sales have not yet returned to the 2015 peak of 231 million units sold. As Toni Sacconaghi, senior analyst with Bernstein, points out, \u201cIf the iPhone replacement cycle continues to elongate meaningfully, that could undermine Apple\u2019s fundamental economics.\u201dBut for Apple, the saving grace is a surge in the average sales price from $671 for all of 2015 to well over $700 for the first three quarters of this year. In a mature smartphone market, pushing the average price higher \u2014 and it\u2019s rising at double-digit levels, the company says \u2014 is crucial to corporate growth.As the most valuable company in the world, Apple can surely afford to treat its customers well. By doing so, it may be able to keep millions of people paying for increasingly expensive products. And if some of us wait a year or two because we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve got, it won\u2019t be the end of Apple\u2019s prosperous world.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.Another factor: Under Nike\u2019s latest deal with the N.F.L., it can\u2019t sell league-branded merchandise after 2020. That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process. Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.And:If companies\u2019 profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds. But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year. And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more.

{"Headline": "Qualcomm Accuses Apple of Stealing Secrets to Help Intel", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Qualcomm accused Apple of stealing proprietary software and sharing it with the rival chip maker Intel as part of a scheme to reduce Apple\u2019s reliance on Qualcomm technology.The claim, made in documents filed in California Superior Court in San Diego on Monday night, add to charges that Qualcomm leveled last year and escalates a broad legal battle that has been raging between the two technology giants since early 2017.Qualcomm said Apple had engaged in a \u201cmultiyear campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct to steal Qualcomm\u2019s information and trade secrets\u201d to help improve the performance of Intel chips so they could match Qualcomm products.The material taken included computer source code, software development tools and log files providing data about the performance of Qualcomm products, according to the filing.In court documents, Apple has complained that Qualcomm has failed to provide evidence of any stolen information, though Apple has provided extensive access to corporate records. Qualcomm, in turn, accuses Apple of dragging its feet on providing information needed to bolster its charges.An Intel spokesman declined to comment.Qualcomm, the leading supplier of modem chips that allow smartphones to communicate over cellular networks, became Apple\u2019s main source for those kinds of chips in iPhones in 2011. But Apple has moved to drop Qualcomm as a supplier; the new iPhones announced this month use only modem chips from Intel.That agreement contained a series of restrictions aimed at protecting Qualcomm source code and other information, restrictions that Apple violated, in part, by sharing information with Intel, Qualcomm said in the initial complaint.In its latest move, Qualcomm provided more claims in its effort to persuade a judge to broaden the suit to cover theft of trade secrets. That question is expected to be considered at a hearing on Nov. 30, while a trial has been set for April.Qualcomm officials, and some analysts, believe the dispute with Apple is essentially a dispute over how much the smartphone maker pays to license Qualcomm patents. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, has held out hope that a settlement might be reached with Apple.\u201cThat really creates a much better environment for us to be able to resolve at least the licensing business issues that we have,\u201d Mr. Mollenkopf said in an interview in July.Qualcomm\u2019s battle with Apple is one of many challenges the company has grappled with recently. It battled a takeover attempt by a rival, Broadcom, for four months before President Trump blocked the bid on national security grounds. More recently, Qualcomm called off a $44 billion bid to buy NXP after the Chinese authorities failed to approve the transaction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Game Apps That Captivate Kids Have Been Collecting Their Data", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "A lawsuit by New Mexico\u2019s attorney general accuses a popular app maker, as well as online ad businesses run by Google and Twitter, of violating children\u2019s privacy law.Before Kim Slingerland downloaded the Fun Kid Racing app for her then-5-year-old son, Shane, she checked to make sure it was in the family section of the Google Play store and rated as age-appropriate. The game, which lets children race cartoon cars with animal drivers, has been downloaded millions of times.Until last month, the app also shared users\u2019 data, sometimes including the precise location of devices, with more than a half-dozen advertising and online tracking companies. On Tuesday evening, New Mexico\u2019s attorney general filed a lawsuit claiming that the maker of Fun Kid Racing had violated a federal children\u2019s privacy law through dozens of Android apps that shared children\u2019s data.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right,\u201d said Ms. Slingerland, a mother of three in Alberta, Canada. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s any of their business, location or anything like that.\u201dThe suit accuses the app maker, Tiny Lab Productions, along with online ad businesses run by Google, Twitter and three other companies, of flouting a law intended to prevent the personal data of children under 13 from falling into the hands of predators, hackers and manipulative marketers. The suit also contends that Google misled consumers by including the apps in the family section of its store.An analysis by The New York Times found that children\u2019s apps by other developers were also collecting data. The review of 20 children\u2019s apps \u2014 10 each on Google Android and Apple iOS \u2014 found examples on both platforms that sent data to tracking companies, potentially violating children\u2019s privacy law; the iOS apps sent less data over all.But the New Mexico lawsuit and the analyses of children\u2019s apps suggest that some app developers, ad tech companies and app stores are falling short in protecting children\u2019s privacy.\u201cThese sophisticated tech companies are not policing themselves,\u201d the New Mexico attorney general, Hector Balderas, said. \u201cThe children of this country ultimately pay the price.\u201dJessica Rich, a former consumer protection director at the Federal Trade Commission, called the findings \u201csignificant and disturbing.\u201d They suggest, she said, \u201cthat the \u2018safe spaces\u2019 for kids in the apps stores aren\u2019t safe at all.\u201dA Google spokesman, Aaron Stein, said that developers are responsible for declaring whether their apps are primarily for children, and that apps in the store\u2019s family section \u201cmust comply with more stringent policies.\u201dA Twitter spokesman said that the company\u2019s ad platform, MoPub, does not allow its services to be used to collect information from children\u2019s apps for targeted advertising and that it suspended the maker of Fun Kid Racing in September of 2017 for violating its policies.Jonas Abromaitis, founder of the Lithuania-based Tiny Lab, said he believed he had followed the law and Google\u2019s requirements, because the app asked for users\u2019 ages and tracked those who identified as over 13. \u201cWe thought we were doing everything the right way,\u201d he said.Dozens of companies now track consumers on their phones to build behavioral profiles that help tailor the ads they see. Two of the largest are AdMob and MoPub.To make money, app developers generally have two options: publish free apps supported by ads, or charge users. But children don\u2019t have the money to make purchases, and under federal law they can\u2019t be tracked for ad targeting.By Anjali Singhvi and Rich Harris | Source: Mr. Collins said some top children\u2019s app makers had started charging parents for subscriptions or showing ads that didn\u2019t use tracking. But, he noted, small developers typically sell fewer subscriptions and don\u2019t always sell enough ads using only child-friendly ad networks. \u201cAs a result, there\u2019s still a huge amount of data being collected on kids,\u201d he said.Mr. Abromaitis, the Tiny Lab founder, created Fun Kid Racing in 2013, after searching unsuccessfully for a racing game to play with his 3-year-old nephew. Other Tiny Lab apps include simple games with titles such as Run Cute Little Pony.Still, Mr. Abromaitis said in an interview, the company\u2019s apps were directed at \u201cmixed audiences,\u201d with children under 13 forming only part of the market.The distinction is important: Under privacy law, apps aimed at younger children are prohibited from tracking any users for ads without parental consent, but those intended for a general audience can ask players their age and track older users.When Tiny Lab submitted apps to Google\u2019s store, it indicated they were for families, not just children, and Google accepted the apps.In The Times\u2019s tests of Fun Kid Racing in July, the app asked that players select their birth year from a list. But with the default set between 2000 and 2001, a young child eager to get to the next screen could simply tap through quickly and be counted as a teenager. In the tests, the app didn\u2019t collect location data if the player identified as under 13.In July, a Google manager responded that the company had investigated the Tiny Lab apps and had found they had not violated the privacy law. Google, he said, did not consider \u201cthese apps to be designed primarily for children, but for families in general.\u201dA month later, Google appeared to reverse course: The company told Mr. Abromaitis it had identified a Tiny Lab app that should be designated for children. Google gave Tiny Lab a week to change that app and any others like it. Tiny Lab labeled 10 of its apps for children and used ad networks in them designed for children\u2019s apps. Google approved the updates but flagged more apps at the end of August, Mr. Abromaitis said, so he made another round of changes.Then, this week, after inquiries from The Times, Google terminated Tiny Lab\u2019s account and removed all of its apps from the Play store, citing multiple policy violations.Asked about the earlier emails, Google said the statements were made in error and that it doesn\u2019t certify whether apps in the Play store comply with the children\u2019s privacy law.Mr. Abromaitis said he hoped to work with Google to get back into the store.The study this spring showed not only that more than half of children\u2019s apps on Android were sharing tracking ID numbers but also that 5 percent collected children\u2019s location or contact information without their parents\u2019 permission.To evaluate tracking on iOS as well as Android, The Times conducted a small study, looking at 10 apps on each platform. The Times chose a mix of the most popular children\u2019s apps and smaller apps that had been flagged in the academics\u2019 research for sharing data, to test whether the apps had problems on iOS and whether they had been fixed on Android.Although it is difficult to know whether companies are actually violating the federal rules, six of the Android apps shared data such as precise location, IP addresses and tracking IDs in ways that could be problematic. On iOS, five apps sent IDs to tracking companies in questionable ways.In addition to Fun Kid Racing, the tests showed one other Android app sending precise location data to other companies: Masha and the Bear: Free Animal Games for Kids, an animated game app with millions of downloads. The iOS version sent advertising ID codes to a company that generally prohibits children\u2019s apps from using its network.In an email, Indigo Kids, the Cyprus-based maker of the Masha app, said it was not responsible for harvesting children\u2019s information because third-party companies collected the data. \u201cWe, as a company, do not collect or store any data of our users,\u201d the company said.Other apps with data practices that could violate the children\u2019s privacy rules sent data to multiple tracking companies that don\u2019t allow children\u2019s apps, or sent the data with notes in the computer code incorrectly indicating that it hadn\u2019t come from children.Several apps reviewed by The Times also sent the advertising ID to other companies but said this was for specific purposes allowed under the law, such as preventing an ad from being shown too many times.Tom Neumayr, an Apple spokesman, said that children\u2019s privacy in apps \u201cis something we take very seriously\u201d and that developers must follow strict guidelines about tracking in children\u2019s apps.\u201cThe F.T.C. has made enforcement of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act a high priority,\u201d said Juliana Gruenwald, an agency spokeswoman.But the New Mexico lawsuit is different. The state is not just going after a single app maker or ad company; it\u2019s also implicating the ad platforms of Google and Twitter, and the vetting process of Google\u2019s app store.\u201cGoogle knows that Tiny Lab\u2019s apps track children unlawfully,\u201d the complaint said. \u201cGoogle\u2019s bad acts are compounded because it represents to parents\u201d that Tiny Lab\u2019s apps comply with the children\u2019s privacy law and are \u201csafe for children.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see any way that anything would change unless there are enforcement actions,\u201d said Serge Egelman, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped lead the study this spring.New Mexico\u2019s attorney general said he hoped the F.T.C. and others in Washington would follow his lead. \u201cThis is as much a black eye on the federal government as the tech space,\u201d Mr. Balderas said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get lawmakers at the federal level to wake up.\u201dAug. 26, 2018June 28, 2018May 19, 2018July 29, 2018Advertisement"}

It was first reported on by the Intercept news site.Google\u2019s chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, testified on Wednesday before a congressional committee about the company\u2019s approach to data protection. Executives from Apple, AT&T, Amazon, Twitter and Charter Communications also appeared at the hearing.Dr. Poulson said the Chinese project, called Dragonfly, had several \u201cdisturbing components.\u201d A prototype, he said, would allow a partner company in China to view a person\u2019s search history based on his or her phone number. He said the project also censored an extensive list of subjects that included information about air quality and China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping.He also pointed lawmakers to commitments Google made as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission in 2011. Google, among other requirements, must submit to regular privacy audits and follow a comprehensive privacy program under the settlement. The privacy program includes reviews of all Google products for privacy issues before they are released.Google\u2019s privacy reviewers are assigned to analyze Google code and make sure it does not violate user privacy. But after Dragonfly became public, several reviewers said they had signed off on sections of code for Dragonfly without fully understanding the project or its privacy implications, according to two people familiar with the process. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity to protect their relationships at the company.The reviewers, they said, felt that pertinent information about Dragonfly\u2019s code had been withheld from them, and raised questions about the review process that went unanswered.In his testimony on Wednesday, Mr. Enright said Google was not close to releasing a search product in China.\u201cIf we were, in fact, to finalize a plan to launch a search product in China, my team would be actively engaged,\u201d he said. \u201cOur privacy and security controls would be followed, and any such project or product would follow and be consistent with our values in privacy and data protection.\u201d\u201cInnovative uses of data shouldn\u2019t be presumptively unlawful just because they are unprecedented, but organizations must account for and mitigate potential harms,\u201d the framework says. \u201cThis includes taking particular care with sensitive information that can pose a significant risk. To enable organizations to develop effective mitigations, regulators should be clear about what constitutes a harm.\u201dGoogle left China in 2010, denouncing government censorship. That year the company also said it had discovered that Chinese hackers had attacked the company\u2019s corporate infrastructure.\u201cIt should be pretty obvious that they should be asked what changed between 2010 and today,\u201d said Cynthia Wong, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.Advertisement"}

Unfortunately, the chances are pretty good that Google will lose \u2014 that the court will order the company to make certain information harder to find. For example, if you are in the United States and you use Google to search for a New York Times article that has been removed from European versions of the search engine, that article will no longer appear in your results.We should be equally worried, however, about the prospect of platforms like Google and Facebook, with their international reach and pervasive role in our lives, doing the bidding of governments around the world.For now, very few countries are asking online platforms to enforce their national laws elsewhere. And the courts that are considering worldwide removal orders mostly sit in democratic and rights-respecting countries. That should give us some hope for better outcomes in those cases. But it also means that their decisions will carry a lot of weight, and set expectations for other national courts and lawmakers about their own power to make platforms globally remove content.Governments around the world know that while online platforms have historically enabled the free flow of information, that needn\u2019t be the case forever. Technical intermediaries can just as easily become choke points, shutting down communication on prohibited topics. Governments of any country have at least some leverage to make this happen: National internet service providers can cut off access entirely. In 2016, for example, Malaysia blocked the entire Medium blogging platform for refusing to delete a London-based journalist\u2019s accounts of corruption in the Malaysian government.That kind of showdown is rare, though. As a matter of both law and international relations, few countries are willing to insist that the rest of the world be bound by their rules. Things should stay that way \u2014 particularly among countries whose laws meet international human rights standards, and vary only in interpreting things like the balance between privacy and speech rights.We would all suffer under a system in which any country could export its own rules through private online platforms. Let\u2019s hope that the European Court of Justice sees things that way.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Apple Thrived in a Season of Tech Scandals", "Date": "2018-09-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtBut this year, as it begins to roll out a new set of iPhones, the story line surrounding Apple has improbably shifted. In an era of growing skepticism about the tech industry\u2019s impact on society, Apple\u2019s business model is turning out to be its most lasting advantage.Because Apple makes money by selling phones rather than advertising, it has been able to hold itself up as a guardian against a variety of digital plagues: a defender of your privacy, an agitator against misinformation and propaganda, and even a plausible warrior against tech addiction, a problem enabled by the very irresistibility of its own devices.Though it is already more profitable than any of its rivals, Apple appears likely to emerge even stronger from tech\u2019s season of crisis. In the long run, its growing strength could profoundly alter the industry.For years, start-ups aiming for consumer audiences modeled themselves on Google and Facebook, offering innovations to the masses at rock-bottom prices, if not for free. But there are limits to the free-lunch model.If Apple\u2019s more deliberate business becomes the widely followed norm, we could see an industry that is more careful about tech\u2019s dangers and excesses. It could also be one that is more exclusive, where the wealthy get the best innovations and the poor bear more of the risks.\u201cBecause of Apple\u2019s business model \u2014 because their money comes from their profitable hardware \u2014 it has been much easier for them to make certain choices and certain arguments about how to address problems in the industry,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, a technology research firm.The thrust of Apple\u2019s message is simple: Paying directly for technology is the best way to ensure your digital safety, and every fresh danger uncovered online is another reason to invest in the Apple way of life.These aren\u2019t new arguments for Apple. While Google and Facebook pursued globe-spanning scale by offering free or cheap services supported by ads, Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, was warning of the risks of an internet advertising market run amok.Though their businesses keep chugging along, Facebook and Google, the world\u2019s biggest internet ad companies, now face global scrutiny for the spread of disinformation, propaganda and what critics say is their products\u2019 destabilizing effects on politics and society.Amazon is beloved by customers, but its rapid growth has spurred economywide anxieties about the future of jobs. All three behemoths are considered growing targets for antitrust prosecution in the United States and elsewhere.Apple\u2019s business model, by contrast, insulates it from most of the tech fears that have emerged in the last few years. Although it makes the vast majority of the profits in the global smartphone business, Apple\u2019s phones account for a minority of sales, blunting fears of monopoly.Apple\u2019s high prices also set up an expectation of safety, giving it a freer hand to police online properties like its app store, podcast directory and news app. A decade ago, when Mr. Jobs imposed rules on the iOS App Store banning scammy and pornographic apps, he was called a prude. Now his rules seem prescient.Its commitment to curating online experiences has also turned Apple into something like a moral arbiter for tech. When Apple decided to bar the right-wing conspiracist Alex Jones from its services this summer, it cut through much of the hand-wringing in the industry over Mr. Jones\u2019s antics. Many other tech companies immediately followed its move.Apple has not entirely escaped criticism in the Trump era. Its reliance on China, where it makes its products and expects to see much of its growth, and where its products abide by government censors, looks to be a rising liability.Even when Apple\u2019s products have been directly implicated in tech worries, its business model has helped it weather the storm. Consider the rising fears of \u201ctech addiction,\u201d the idea that kids and adults are spending too much mindless time in the digital world, egged on by tech companies\u2019 insatiable need for our eyeballs.In January, a pair of large Apple investors, Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, wrote an open letter to Apple urging the company to address the issue. Charles Penner, a partner at Jana, told me that the campaign had targeted Apple because the company had every reason to respond.\u201cThe biggest source of strength that Apple has is their ability to charge premium prices for their products,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir value depends on people feeling safe and supported within their ecosystem.\u201dAnd, in fact, Apple responded. The company told the investors that it believed the overuse of tech was a serious issue, and that it had been working on it. In the summer, it unveiled a series of widely praised features meant to allow adults to police their own and their kids\u2019 smartphone habits.Google, apparently spurred by the same campaign, offered similar features for its Android phones. Mr. Penner told me that he appreciated the companies\u2019 efforts, though he expects to keep pushing them to reduce their devices\u2019 addictiveness.Apple\u2019s safety-first business model may become only more important as technology becomes even more intimate. The company\u2019s latest phones can be unlocked with your face, while its watch includes sophisticated sensors to monitor your movements and your health. In pushing these and other advances, the company can reasonably argue that only its ad-free business can protect such sensitive information.But it is worth noting that Apple\u2019s model isn\u2019t available to everyone. In the spring, after Mr. Cook took a few swipes at Facebook\u2019s scandals, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, pointed out the inherent limits in Apple\u2019s model.Since then, Apple has raised the prices of its top-end phones, and as the smartphone market slows, the company\u2019s pristine haven from the dangers of online life might get only more expensive.Inequality is the story of our age, and it\u2019s no surprise that it could become the dominant story line of tech, too. As the digital world gets scarier, Apple\u2019s technology may come to resemble a high-priced oasis for the world\u2019s rich. Everyone else takes their chances on a free lunch.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Instagram Rose Into a Cultural Powerhouse", "Date": "2018-09-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byInstagram\u2019s co-founders, who resigned on Monday, presided over a company that boomed with help from technological advances and societal changes.When Justin Bieber posted on Instagram for the first time in July 2011, he did not enthrall his army of fans with a shirtless selfie or a meticulously planned photo shoot. Out of focus. Mundane scenery. Not particularly artful. No matter. These were the early days of Instagram, before smartphones included cameras that could produce higher quality images than the point-and-shoots of yore. Most celebrities now, some with tens of millions of followers, put far more care into what goes on the platform. Instagram has become central to their public images. The same goes for teenagers who just want to look cool, as well as everyone in between. Instagram was founded in 2010, but initially focused on location check-ins as an app called Burbn. Mr. Krieger and Mr. Systrom noticed that early Burbn users were heavily using the app\u2019s photo features, so they retooled it around sharing photos and changed the name. Within hours of Instagram\u2019s release, thousands of people had downloaded it. It passed one million users about two months later. In 2012, it had 40 million users. Now more than one billion people use it, and analysts expect continued growth. Instagram\u2019s concept was simpler than those of competing social networks. It offered a stream of photos \u2014 and later videos \u2014 that were more often than not pleasant or artful. There were no heavy news stories or invitations to download new apps mucking up feeds.While the growth was driven by everyday users, much of the app\u2019s cultural clout comes from its utility to celebrities, who also have quite an interest in putting their best foot forward. A-listers like Beyonc\u00e9 and Kylie Jenner announce pregnancies and births on the platform instead of magazine covers. Stars ensnared in scandal will post text or video statements and apologies before news sites can update their articles. But even those who have profited deeply from the platform say they need occasional respite. Selena Gomez, who at 143 million followers holds Instagram\u2019s largest audience, said on Monday that she was taking a break from social media. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s Private Groups Offer Refuge to Fringe Figures", "Date": "2018-09-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn Mr. Jones\u2019s absence, the group continued to fill with news stories, Infowars videos and rants about social media censorship. Users also posted the sort of content \u2014 hateful attacks against Muslims, transgender people and other vulnerable groups \u2014 that got Mr. Jones suspended. And last week, when Mr. Jones\u2019s suspension expired, he returned to the group triumphantly.\u201cMy 30-day Facebook ban is up!\u201d Mr. Jones announced.Mr. Jones built his Facebook audience on pages \u2014 the big public megaphones he used to blast links, memes and videos to millions of his followers. In recent months, though, he and other large-scale purveyors of inflammatory speech have found refuge in private groups, where they can speak more openly with less fear of being punished for incendiary posts.Facebook\u2019s fight against disinformation and hate speech will be a topic of discussion on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, when Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, will join Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, to testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\u201cThey\u2019ve essentially empowered very large groups that can operate secretly without much governance and oversight,\u201d said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University\u2019s S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. \u201cThere may be harms and abuses that are taking place, and they can\u2019t see.\u201dAfter The Times sent screenshots to Facebook of activity taking place inside these groups, Facebook removed several comments, saying they violated the company\u2019s policies on hate speech. The groups themselves, however, remain active.A Facebook spokeswoman said the company used automated tools, including machine learning algorithms, to detect potentially harmful content inside private groups and flag it for human reviewers, who make the final decisions about whether or not to take it down. The company is developing additional ways, she said, to determine if an entire group violates the company\u2019s policies and should be taken down, rather than just its individual posts or members.Harmful activity does not appear to be more prevalent in secret groups, the Facebook spokeswoman said.Soon after, the company\u2019s algorithms began giving posts from groups higher visibility in users\u2019 news feeds. The largest Facebook groups \u2014 such as Pantsuit Nation, a progressive political group formed to rally Hillary Clinton supporters in the 2016 election \u2014 gained millions of members.Facebook\u2019s promotion of private groups encouraged like-minded people to cluster together. But it also meant that some users were seeing more posts from people whose opinions and interests they already shared, and it may have created echo chambers where polarizing behavior could flourish.One type of private Facebook group, known as a \u201cclosed\u201d group, can be found through searches. Another type, known as a \u201csecret\u201d group, is invisible to all but those who receive an invitation from a current member to join. In both cases, only members can see posts made inside the group.The private Infowars group is closed, was formed before Facebook took action against Mr. Jones and is billed as an \u201cunofficial\u201d fan group. New users must be approved by moderators and answer several screening questions, including \u201cWhat is the answer to 1984?\u201d (The correct answer, according to the title of one of Mr. Jones\u2019s books, is \u201c1776.\u201d)Since the public Infowars page was taken down, the private group has functioned as a makeshift home for fans of the site. Two remaining Infowars pages, along with profiles apparently belonging to Mr. Jones and others affiliated with Infowars, are listed as administrators, giving them a higher level of control of the group than moderators.Mr. Jones and several other administrators of the Infowars group did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cThe vast majority of groups on Facebook are probably the run-of-the-mill groups,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e DiResta, a researcher with Data for Democracy who studies online extremism. \u201cThe challenge is, how does the groups feature interact with the other features on Facebook that we know are causing radicalization, hate speech and genocide in certain places? Who is taking responsibility for looking at the negative externalities of this push to create communities?\u201dSheera Frenkel contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

That could force him to assume a different position at Tesla. It could also affect his other companies, SpaceX and the Boring Company, were they to go public, and potentially harm their ability to raise money from investors.Andrew\u2019s take:Mr. Musk will want to prove that his intent wasn\u2019t to mislead investors, probably by demonstrating that he had real conversations to take the company private.

{"Headline": "Elizabeth Warren on Big Banks and the Democratic Party: 5 Takeaways", "Date": "2018-09-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts positioned herself as an alternative to the standard-bearers of the Democratic Party, refusing to classify herself within the party during an hourlong interview on Thursday.And while she brushed off a question asking if she was running in 2020, she offered a glimpse into what such a platform could hold.Here are the takeaways.As speculation mounts over whether Ms. Warren will enter the presidential race in 2020, she was asked where she sees herself within her own party.She argued that her economic views \u2014 like raising the minimum wage, expanding Social Security and regulating big banks \u2014 are ones that most Americans share. She places herself \u201cright in the middle of America,\u201d she said.\u201cHow I see this is, this is a lot less about political parties and a lot more about where America is,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThere are issues on which we are divided. I understand that. But on these core economic set of issues, America is a progressive country.\u201dIs it unfair to argue that she has shifted her views compared with where she had initially established herself within the larger party?\u201cThis is who I\u2019ve been all along,\u201d Ms. Warren said.Ms. Warren was withering in her criticism of Gary Cohn, President Trump\u2019s former chief economic adviser.\u201cWhat he did was help Goldman Sachs,\u201d she said, adding that the tax overhaul that he helped push through last year saved corporations billions of dollars.What angered Ms. Warren the most, she said, was imagining the response of the American people.\u201cIs he working for us,\u201d she imagined someone thinking, \u201cOr is he working for Goldman, or is he just working for himself?\u201dMs. Warren said that she had spoken to the Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer \u2014 who is said to be considering a presidential bid in 2020 \u2014 and told him she did not support his efforts to impeach the president. Instead, she is intent on protecting the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.The investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s election interference \u201chas resulted in more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas already,\u201d she said.\u201cI want protection for the special prosecutor,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time Donald Trump starts tweeting again or attacks someone else in government, I get very worried about the special prosecutor.\u201dWhat Congress could do, Ms. Warren said, is pass a law that says the special counsel cannot be fired by the president.\u201cOnce the investigation is completed,\u201d she said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll know what we have in front of us.\u201dAs tech giants like Facebook and Apple come under continued scrutiny by Congress, Ms. Warren weighed in on the subject, stating that the issue was more about their anti-competitive business models and less about \u201cbreaking up\u201d big companies.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick one business or the other,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting a huge competitive advantage from being a platform provider because of all this information you\u2019ve been scraping, then we no longer have competition going on.\u201dMs. Warren, who has been the target of the president\u2019s name-calling on Twitter, offered a challenge to Mr. Trump\u2019s taunts.\u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t going to change. But he\u2019s not going to change me, either,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the fights I\u2019m in and I\u2019m going to stay in them.

{"Headline": "Hey, Alexa, Why is Amazon Making a Microwave?", "Date": "2018-09-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 If you\u2019re one of the millions of people without a smart speaker in your home, Amazon wants to talk to you.On Thursday, the company announced not one, not six, but more than a dozen devices for its Alexa voice assistant \u2014 all meant to solve problems in your life that you may not have even known you had.There\u2019s even a microwave.\u201cIf you have ever tried to defrost peas, it\u2019s a number of clicks,\u201d said Dave Limp, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president for devices and services.Mr. Limp said the $59.99 microwave, made by AmazonBasics, the company\u2019s house brand, was a way for Amazon to try out the smart home tools it is building out. The company wants the devices to be easier to set up out of the box and for other companies that make kitchen appliances \u2014 from rice makers to ovens \u2014 to tap into the Alexa platform.\u201cWhen we imagine a future with thousands of devices like this, this is going to become essential,\u201d Mr. Limp said.The microwave was perhaps the cheekiest in a blizzard of announcements at the event inside Amazon\u2019s headquarters.\u201cWe took advantage of the hands-free moments,\u201d Tom Taylor, senior vice president of Alexa, said in an interview. \u201cHow do we continue to expand? Where else are those opportunities?\u201dSo far, Amazon\u2019s answer appears to be \u201ceverywhere.\u201dThe company has a long history of introducing products and services at a rapid clip, in sharp contrast to competitors like Apple, which focuses on a few very refined releases at a time. Some of Amazon\u2019s ideas work, like its Kindle e-reader, and the company keeps building on them. But many of them fail, like its Fire smartphone, and the company quickly drops them.On Thursday, Mr. Limp also introduced an Echo Auto that plugs into cars; Fire TV Recast, a DVR recording device that lets users record live TV and watch on a variety of devices; and an analog wall clock with a voice-controlled timer.Another suite of devices announced on Thursday is aimed to appeal to audiophiles. Echo devices can now be used for individual left and right channels, meaning a pair can create stereo sound. And the new Echo Sub provides rich bass sounds, which Mr. Limp showed by booming Lorde\u2019s \u201cRoyals.\u201d The new Echo Input is the first Echo device without a speaker so users can connect their speakers to the brain of the Alexa.Since it introduced its Alexa smart assistant four years ago, the company has not shied from trying out new forms and uses. First it had an Echo speaker, a tall cylinder, then an Echo Dot, a version the size of a hockey puck. Then it added a screen, too, with the Echo Show. At the same time, developers wrote thousands of apps \u2014 or skills \u2014 for the devices. There are now more than 50,000 skills.The strategy helped Amazon quickly take the lead in the voice-controlled device market \u2014 a market it practically created. But it now has some stiff competition.A device from Google, the Home Mini, is now the top-selling smart speaker worldwide, Strategy Analytics, a research firm, wrote in a report this week. Google offers fewer types of devices, but has an advantage because millions of customers already have access to its voice assistant through the smartphones that use its Android operating system. Apple has also introduced its own high-priced voice-controlled speaker, focused on pristine audio quality, which Amazon looks to now be challenging head-on.\u201cThe earlier days were more inventing on behalf of customers,\u201d said Mr. Taylor. \u201cNow we have a chance to invent by listening to customers.\u201dThe announcements Thursday show Amazon trying to flood the field, not just with its own devices but with products intended to model a way for outside manufacturers to build off Alexa\u2019s interface.\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming \u2014 that\u2019s the risk for the consumer,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. \u201cThey have been so early in the market that they need to make sure the geeks that jump into the smart home early have something, but at the same time, they need to make it really simple for people who haven\u2019t yet.\u201dNot all of the announcements were products. Amazon introduced new ways Alexa will try to anticipate the needs of users, not just respond to questions. The Alexa Hunches function, which will be public later this year, tries to provide suggestions; for instance, if a user says good night to Alexa, the voice assistant might note that a porch light is on and offer to turn it off.And users can turn on Alexa Guard when they leave their home, and the device will notify them if it detects a smoke alarm alert or the sound of a burglar smashing a window.Amazon also said users would no longer need to sign up individual skills to use them. Instead, they will be able to speak to Alexa, which will automatically pick the best skill.\u201cThat was a big barrier, you learning how to talk to Alexa versus Alexa learning how you speak, which is how it should be,\u201d Ms. Milanesi said.An earlier version of this article misstated the name of an Amazon voice assistant function that anticipates users\u2019 needs. It is Alexa Hunches, not Alexa Hunch.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Amazon Hits $1,000,000,000,000 in Value, Following Apple", "Date": "2018-09-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow Amazon has become the second American company to cross that once-unimaginable line. Its shares rose as high as $2,050.50 on Tuesday morning, pushing it over $1 trillion in value, before immediately falling back and then ending the day at $2,039.51, below the $1 trillion threshold. Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is worth nearly as much as Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett put together.This time, the explanation is more complicated.Amazon captures 49 cents of every e-commerce dollar in the United States. It employs more than 550,000 people and generates $178 billion in annual revenue. It sells everything from computing space to peanut butter to appointments with plumbers.But the thing it has always sold the most \u2014 to investors, customers, the news media \u2014 is excitement.In the beginning, Amazon was an exciting new way to shop for books: online. Then it was an exciting new way to read (Kindle e-books), an exciting new way to publish (CreateSpace), an exciting new way to power the internet (Amazon Web Services), an exciting new way to get deliveries (Amazon Prime), an exciting new way to make your house a high-tech outpost (Alexa).Long before Amazon went to Hollywood and began making movies, it was the star of its own show, generating vast amounts of attention just for being Amazon. No other company had ever managed to turn its lack of profit into such effective drama, or the question of what its next move would be.Mr. Bezos made clear when Amazon went public in 1997 that he would not work for Wall Street, and the result was a company cast in an entirely different mold. It never feared losing money. In a real sense, there were no consequences for being wrong.Behind the drama is a relentless and sometimes scary ambition. Amazon is the Jay Gatsby of American companies, believing that tomorrow it will run faster, stretch its arms out farther, fulfill the desires of consumers in ways that no other business possibly could. You will live in Amazon\u2019s world, it says, and you will like it.One of the great benefits for Amazon of this approach is that it is impossible to tell where reality ends and hype \u2014 or perhaps even madness \u2014 begins.Take Amazon\u2019s drone program, which it first announced on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d \u201cI know this looks like science fiction,\u201d Mr. Bezos said, as he showed a film of an unmanned vehicle delivering a package. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d He said there were \u201cyears of additional work\u201d to be done, but declared himself an optimist. Drone delivery, he predicted, would be a reality in \u201cfour, five years.\u201dThat was December 2013. Roughly a million features were written about Amazon and its drones, nearly all with the subtext: Isn\u2019t this the coolest thing ever?Over the years, the company kept raising the stakes, as if they were not already high enough. Amazon applied a few years ago for a patent for an \u201caerial fulfillment center\u201d that would float at 45,000 feet. Drones would fly out of it with your order and then glide down to your backyard.The fulfillment center, which looks in drawings like a blimp tugging a warehouse, has other uses besides delivering dinner. It would drift down to 2,000 feet to what the patent calls \u201cthe advertising altitude,\u201d where it would present information \u201cabout items and/or services.\u201d Perhaps it will be just like the movie \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d and the floating ads will trumpet the joys of working in Amazon\u2019s off-world colonies. The patent was granted this summer.Haye Kesteloo, senior editor of the news site DroneDJ, noted that there were many hurdles to routine delivery by drone, even if the vehicles are not being launched from airships. The claimed drone attack on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela will not help soothe nervous citizens.Nevertheless, Mr. Kesteloo, like Mr. Bezos, proclaims himself an optimist. \u201cCompanies like Amazon will make routine drone deliveries to consumers by 2025,\u201d he said \u2014 only twice as far away as promised.\u201cThere is no doubt anymore,\u201d said Ron Nussbaum, who runs an investment management fund called Maverick Value in Los Angeles. \u201cThe stock always goes up, and no one doubts it will keep going up.\u201dMr. Nussbaum, who emphasized that over all his investments were profitable, might be the last Amazon skeptic. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor,\u201d he said.And an expensive one. Last year, when Amazon crossed $1,000 a share, he started buying \u201cput\u201d options \u2014 bets that the stock would decline. One of his puts has dropped 85 percent; another, 92 percent.Mr. Nussbaum is planning to buy more. He thinks people are confusing their impressions of Amazon the company with Amazon as an investment.\u201cIf I fill up your gas tank for $1 but it costs me $2, you can say it\u2019s a great product, but it doesn\u2019t make any sense as a company,\u201d he said.Apple had profits of $48 billion last year. Amazon\u2019s were less than a tenth of that. If profits were all that mattered, Amazon should be worth about $100 billion, the size of United Technologies or Texas Instruments. That is nothing to sneeze at, but nothing to get people excited, either.Even before Amazon hit $1 trillion, the milestone was old news. There was a poll on Facebook run by a group of young Wall Street investors. The question: Would Amazon or Apple be the first to hit $2 trillion?The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of Amazon. Dreams will always triumph over devices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The iPhone XS and XS Max Review: Big Screens That Are a Delight to Use", "Date": "2018-09-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTech FixApple\u2019s new smartphones start at $999 and $1,099, but their superb cameras and screens make them worth the high prices, our reviewer writes. For the past few years, I have been a naysayer on one feature of smartphones: their growing size. My position was unusual given the increasing prevalence of larger screen devices. The world\u2019s top phone makers have all added more substantial glass screens to stretch from one edge of their smartphones to another, on the theory that people can better enjoy their apps and content on an ample display.I have been troubled by this trend. These devices spend a lot of time in your pocket and your hand, and there are often compromises in portability and comfort when the screens balloon in size. For those reasons, I never liked the Plus phones, the line of iPhones that Apple introduced in 2014 with 5.5-inch screens. They felt impossible to use with one hand and far too bulky in a pocket.So it\u2019s humbling to come to you now with another confession: The iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max may be making me a convert to bigger smartphones. Last week, I began testing both new iPhone models. I had predicted that the larger display on the XS Max would be unwieldy in my pocket and make the phone cumbersome to hold with one hand while typing and reaching for buttons inside apps.There were other things I figured I would dislike. The prices of Apple\u2019s phones, for one, have shot up. The XS will start at $999 and the XS Max at $1,099 when both become available on Friday, compared with $699, $799 and $999 for new iPhones last year. The iPhone XR, which will be released on Oct. 19, is starting at $749.Yet after running the 6.5-inch XS Max alongside the 5.8-inch XS through different situations and conditions for a week, I was surprised by my reaction. Far from being disappointed by the supersized devices, I was delighted.The trade-offs of the new jumbo model felt minor. By eliminating the bezels, which are the screen\u2019s borders, Apple did a terrific job of increasing screen size without adding bulk or compromising the usability of the XS Max. I still think the smaller XS is a better fit for most people, but many would enjoy the XS Max.Here\u2019s how all the testing went down.I began by testing the iPhone XS Max because why not start with the biggest device? I moved my SIM card and all my data from an older iPhone to the new gadget and took it with me to dinner parties, bars, meetings and the gym. After three days, I was surprised by how good it felt to use the XS Max with one hand. A key factor was how Apple had managed to cram a bigger screen into a slightly smaller body. (The body of the Plus phones was 6.24 inches by 3.07 inches, while the XS Max\u2019s body is 6.2 inches by 3.05 inches.)These changes amounted to meaningful improvements in ergonomics and overall convenience. I was able to hold the XS Max in one hand and type messages easily. In contrast, my thumb could not reach keys on the sides of the older iPhone 8 Plus, like the shift key or the backspace key, because of the space taken up by the bezel.And I found the jumbo-screen XS Max particularly beneficial in several instances. While driving, it was easier to read maps. The bigger screen made writing longer emails \u2014 a task that I usually do on a laptop \u2014 more pleasant. The display was also nice for reading recipes in the kitchen.While browsing Instagram next to my partner, I said to her: \u201cIf you can use this thing with one hand, who would want the smaller phone if you only have to pay $100 more for this huge screen?\u201d\u201cBut does it fit inside your pocket?\u201d she asked.That brings me to the iPhone XS. After taking the larger XS Max everywhere with me for three days and feeling good about it, I switched to the iPhone XS \u2014 and immediately experienced a sense of relief. I found I simply preferred the XS\u2019s smaller body for the very basic task of moving around. Having the smaller phone in my pocket felt less obtrusive during dog walks, long hikes and gym sessions. I also found the XS easier to use as a camera. While the XS and XS Max share identical camera systems, which produce excellent, clear photos with natural-looking colors in normal and lowlight conditions, the smaller phone worked better in a pinch because it was easier to pull out of a pocket and quickly stabilize to take a clear shot.So where does that leave us? I concluded I no longer had any real objection to the bigger size of the iPhone XS Max, but felt that the smaller XS was still a better mobile phone because it was just as capable but more portable and pocketable. That means if you are a more casual technology user who wants a superb smartphone that is comfortable to carry, I recommend you go for the XS. If you plan to treat your phone as a primary computer, go for the XS Max.One flaw frustrated me in both iPhones: the poor design of Reachability, the software feature that was designed to make larger phone screens easier to use with one hand. On past iPhones, Reachability let people tap the home button twice to lower the top of the screen and reach for the buttons up there. Now there is no home button, so the new way to trigger Reachability is to swipe down from the bottom of the screen. That\u2019s problematic because when you swipe from the bottom, it\u2019s easy to unintentionally hit a button on the bottom of an app, like the search tab inside Instagram or the video tab inside Facebook. There is a clear opportunity here for Apple to use the iPhone\u2019s pressure sensitivity, called 3D Touch, to let you press hard on the bottom of the screen to trigger Reachability. But for now, we are stuck with swiping down.Apple said the Reachability swipe gesture was designed as a quick action to let people easily reach for the top of the screen.But I suspect it will largely come down to whether you can live with a single-lens camera, which doesn\u2019t do as good a job taking those D.S.L.R.-like photos with a blurred-out background and a sharpened foreground. The XS is about $250 more than the XR, but after shooting photos like the one below, I\u2019m sold on dual-lens cameras.It\u2019s important that you find the right fit: Since you have to pay so much for your next iPhone, you will probably live with it for a long time. And who knows? You might assume you will dislike a bigger screen and then change your mind \u2014 just as I did.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A San Francisco Tech Mogul Buys a Fabled Slice of New York Media", "Date": "2018-09-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Marc Benioff is like the Salesforce Tower: He looms over this city.At 1,070 feet, the tower is the second-tallest building west of the Mississippi. Mr. Benioff moved Salesforce into it in January, right before his software company became the largest private employer in the city.Mr. Benioff, who is 6-foot-5 and 290 pounds, is as hard to miss as his tower. He\u2019s forceful, flamboyant and quotable, a fourth-generation San Franciscan who has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into his city.Even Mr. Benioff did not suspect this was coming.The interview was classic Benioff. He said he did not have a few moments to be interviewed by phone because he was \u201con crazy Dreamforce lockdown,\u201d a reference to the annual Salesforce convention, which begins next week. Besides, he was getting a massage. But he agreed to answer questions by text, which he proceeded to do for two hours.The deal is tech\u2019s second try at Time, the premier American newsmagazine for much of the 20th century. In early 2000 \u2014 right as Salesforce was starting up \u2014 the internet pioneer AOL bought Time Warner for $165 billion. Heralded as a deal that would unite the fledgling digital world with the sturdy physical assets of traditional media, it was a disaster for the ages.Mr. Benioff, who will turn 54 this month and whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $6.7 billion, emphasized he was not going to get editorially involved in the magazine. He ignored questions about how much he would invest in Time, whose resources and vision have dwindled over the decades, and whether people should again be worried about the merging of tech and traditional media.He repeatedly said Meredith, the Iowa media company that was selling him Time, would be a partner. Meredith will provide the Benioffs with services such as consumer marketing, subscription fulfillment, paper purchasing and printing.\u201cI especially liked Meredith\u2019s core values,\u201d he said. \u201cI have followed them since I started Salesforce.\u201d He noted Meredith\u2019s corporate focus on volunteerism, \u201csomething that is very important to me as well.\u201dLynne Benioff, 43, was a publicist during the dot-com boom. She serves on the board of several organizations and was a co-founder in 2011 of a short-term residential community for homeless families in San Francisco. She declined to be interviewed.The hands-off policy might not last, given the deep gloom over physical magazines.\u201cMarc Benioff is a guy who wants whatever he touches to succeed,\u201d said Phil Bronstein, a longtime Bay Area newsman. \u201cIf that\u2019s going to require him to be involved, he\u2019ll do it.\u201dMr. Benioff is deeply embedded in the Bay Area. His grandfather helped build the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, and his father ran a chain of clothing stores in the city. He began writing software as a teenager and briefly wrote code in the mid-1980s at Apple during the original tenure of Steve Jobs. But he first broke into prominence during a 13-year stint at Oracle, a dominant supplier of databases and other software. There Mr. Benioff was schooled in sales and strategy by one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most brash leaders, Larry Ellison.Mr. Benioff, though he calls Mr. Ellison his mentor, broke from Oracle\u2019s practices in significant ways when he started Salesforce. His start-up, founded in an apartment on San Francisco\u2019s Telegraph Hill in 1999, opted not to sell software that customers would install on their own computers. Rather, Salesforce ran its offerings \u2014 which initially automated sales tasks like tracking customer histories \u2014 on its own computers and delivered them to corporations over the internet.This strategy reduced technical expenses and headaches for customers, while allowing Salesforce to make initial sales to small groups of employees at companies that would expand over time.It was a risky bet, because the web could be unreliable. But what would later be called a \u201ccloud\u201d model gradually became the dominant way for start-ups to deliver software. Even Mr. Ellison, who once derided the term, was an early investor in Salesforce and has turned Oracle into a major supplier of cloud-based offerings.Mr. Benioff, who has said he \u201chad an incredible feeling of unfulfillment\u201d at Oracle, was equally determined to make his own company more than a vehicle for making money. Salesforce popularized what he called the 1-1-1 model of corporate philanthropy, by which companies contribute 1 percent of equity, 1 percent of employee hours and 1 percent of company products to communities they serve.\u201cThe miraculous thing about his history as a businessperson is that he has found a way to turn being a really good and caring person into a business asset,\u201d said David Kirkpatrick, a Benioff friend who runs the Techonomy conferences. \u201cFor instance, his historic opposition to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signing that awful anti-gay rights law in 2015 emerged out of genuine personal outrage and his sense of justice. But it turned into a tremendous branding positive for Salesforce.\u201dMr. Benioff has given more than $200 million to Bay Area hospitals, which are now named after him. And like a number of billionaire tech philanthropists, he has plunged into efforts to try to reshape education.But where other tech donors have focused on promulgating their own education reforms, such as reducing the size of public high schools or expanding charter schools, the Salesforce chief has taken a more local, holistic approach.Through Salesforce.org, his company\u2019s nonprofit arm, Mr. Benioff has pledged $100 million over a decade to improve educational resources for Bay Area schools. Since 2012, Salesforce.org has provided $27 million to San Francisco public schools and $7.7 million to Oakland public schools.Among other things, the San Francisco Unified School District has used the money to develop computer science curriculums. It has also hired additional math teachers, reducing the average class size across eighth-grade math to 24 students from 33. Oakland has used the Salesforce funds in part to bolster computer science education.As a result of his support for a variety of local school projects, Mr. Benioff has largely escaped the withering criticism that other tech billionaires, such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, have faced for their school initiatives.\u201cOther billionaires tend to hop around different places, leaving half-completed reforms in their wake,\u201d said Sarah Reckhow, an associate professor of political science at Michigan State University who studies philanthropy. \u201cIt will be interesting to see if his education investments have more staying power.\u201dMr. Benioff is not as dramatic in his display of wealth as Mr. Ellison, who is a collector of costly cars, homes and yachts \u2014 and a winner of the America\u2019s Cup sailing race. But the Benioffs have multiple homes in San Francisco and a residential compound on the Big Island of Hawaii, and he has hosted private concerts by his favorite musical artists. Stevie Wonder performed at the couple\u2019s wedding, as well as at a fund-raiser that Mr. Benioff hosted for President Barack Obama.During the interview Sunday night, Mr. Benioff sent cartoons; links to Time stories on YouTube; chunks of what sounded like news releases but were, he insisted, original (\u201cTime is the best fit for us, and most reflects our values and interests\u201d); discussions of his and his interviewer\u2019s Judaism; and quite a bit more. It is impossible to imagine Mr. Zuckerberg, for example, behaving like this with a journalist.But if Mr. Benioff was very charming, he was not very forthcoming. His most revealing moment was when he said, \u201cI live with a beginner\u2019s mind,\u201d and then texted a screenshot of a quote from the Zen master Suzuki: \u201cIn the beginner\u2019s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert\u2019s mind there are few.\u201dIt was a momentary glimpse of the tremendous freedom that tech billionaires are afforded. The world is both their plaything and, Mr. Benioff stresses, their responsibility.\u201cMy power,\u201d he said, \u201cwas that I didn\u2019t really want to do anything but I was open to all possibilities.\u201dDavid Streitfeld and Don Clark reported from San Francisco, and Natasha Singer from New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walmart Finally Makes It to the Big Apple", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn a bank of the Bronx River, below the roar of the Bruckner Expressway, Walmart has finally found a foothold in a city that has long shunned it.Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business, Jet.com, is leasing a 205,000-square-foot warehouse in the Bronx that will soon begin supplying MacBooks and organic eggs to New York\u2019s well-heeled shoppers.The physical presence is a victory for the nation\u2019s largest retailer, which has faced resistance from labor groups and their political allies every time it has proposed opening a store in the five boroughs. But it\u2019s also an acknowledgment that the company\u2019s longtime national strategy won\u2019t work in certain big cities.With a revamped Jet\u2019s new push into New York, Walmart is trying to reach beyond its core base of big-box stores in rural and suburban America and compete for higher-income urbanites. A retailing empire built on no frills and low prices, Walmart is using Jet to entice millennials and young families with trendy, premium products like Big Gay Ice Cream and Dr. Martens shoes.\u201cWe believe we can win in New York,\u201d Jet\u2019s president, Simon Belsham, said in an interview.By acquiring stand-alone businesses, Walmart has been able to avoid the political furor it typically sets off in left-leaning cities where there is deep support for the unions that Walmart has rebuffed. Jet is also pushing to grow its business in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington.The retailer\u2019s previous attempts to enter the New York market, in Queens and then in Brooklyn, ended in stinging defeat. Activists and city leaders turned the proposed stores into a referendum on Walmart\u2019s labor practices.As recently as 2014, nearly half the City Council accused the Walton Family Foundation, which is funded by the company\u2019s founding family, of trying to curry favor with New Yorkers by donating \u201ctoxic money\u201d to local efforts to support charter schools.This time around, many city leaders either declined interview requests or did not return requests for comment on Jet\u2019s growth plans in New York. Some are skeptical, even if they are taking a wait-and-see attitude.\u201cWalmart may think they have found a new, under-the-radar path into New York City by buying up businesses already here, but we should not be fooled,\u201d Comptroller Scott M. Stringer, a Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cWe intend to be watching very carefully.\u201dMaritza Silva-Farrell, executive director of the labor and community group Align, worked to sink Walmart\u2019s plans to open a store in the East New York section of Brooklyn. She and others argued that Walmart\u2019s low prices would endanger local businesses and that its lower wages would depress pay at other retailers.Ms. Silva-Farrell said she was still concerned about Walmart\u2019s business model. But Amazon, she said, is becoming \u201ca world threat\u201d as the company increasingly dictates the global supply chain and broadens into manufacturing.\u201cAmazon is going to define how the economy is going to work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bigger problem than Walmart.\u201dSome labor activists see Walmart\u2019s use of Jet to break into the New York market as a sign of victory.\u201cThe fact that Walmart had to acquire another company in order to operate in New York City is a testament to our efforts to keep them out,\u201d said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.New York is now a testing ground for Walmart\u2019s urban e-commerce strategy, which puts every step of the sale \u2014 from the mobile app to the \u201clast mile\u201d of delivery \u2014 under the company\u2019s control.Walmart is also providing a decent amount of local jobs. Jet employs about 1,300 engineers, executives and other white-collar workers at its Hoboken headquarters and is planning to hire more than 100 workers in its Bronx fulfillment center, a warehouse where customer orders will be prepared and shipped.A spokeswoman said it was too early to comment on the pay at the warehouse since the facility is not yet operational. Parcel employs 150 part-time drivers, all earning $15 an hour, which will soon be the city\u2019s minimum wage.When Walmart acquired Jet, it was not clear how the large retailer would integrate the website into its larger online strategy.Founded by the e-commerce entrepreneur Marc Lore, Jet was billed as the \u201cAmazon killer\u201d that could win over shoppers with low prices. But Jet seemed redundant with Walmart.com, leading some in the tech world to speculate the real motivation was to acquire Mr. Lore, who now runs Walmart\u2019s e-commerce business nationally.About a year ago, Walmart signaled that it was switching gears and focusing Jet\u2019s efforts on certain cities in the Northeast, where Walmart lacks a huge brick-and-mortar presence.Mr. Belsham, who was hired to run Jet in March, said the redesigned website was meant to be less utilitarian and offer more \u201cinspiration\u201d \u2014 enticing shoppers to order groceries and, say, a pair of Nike sneakers, all in the same online basket.The offerings are upscale, but the prices are not outrageous by New York standards. Pints of Van Leeuwen Earl Grey Tea ice cream for $5.99 and hydroponic Gotham Greens lettuce for $3.49 are less expensive than at some city grocery stores.Online grocery is already a crowded market: FreshDirect, Peapod, Instacart and Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods are offering grocery delivery in New York. But analysts expect Jet will have the advantage of using Walmart\u2019s buying power with vendors to compete on price. Jet is also offering products, like iPhones and designer clothing, that other grocers do not.For same-day scheduled delivery, Jet charges a $5.95 fee. There\u2019s no fee for orders over $35 with no scheduled delivery time.\u201cThis is a surgical strike,\u201d said Burt P. Flickinger III, a managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group. \u201cWalmart could be a top-10 retailer in the city within the first year.\u201dNot all analysts are sold on the strategy, which they say is likely to lose Walmart money in the near term as the company ramps up its marketing and hiring.For Jet\u2019s \u201crelaunch\u201d party last week, the company rented out a brownstone near Washington Square Park to showcase its New York offerings. One floor of the apartment featured museumlike displays of what Jet said were actual orders by New Yorkers \u2014 including an arrangement of Sam Edelman high heels, avocados and rolls of toilet paper \u2014 bathed in purple light.\u201cIt feels like a bit of a sideshow,\u201d said Scott Mushkin, a retail industry analyst at Wolfe Research. \u201cWalmart\u2019s strength is in places like Missouri, Arkansas and Mississippi, where their stores are the center of commerce.

{"Headline": "Time Magazine Is Bought by Marc Benioff, Salesforce Billionaire", "Date": "2018-09-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTime, the pre-eminent weekly newsmagazine of the 20th century, will have new owners: Marc Benioff, the billionaire co-founder of the software company Salesforce, and his wife, Lynne.Time\u2019s parent company, Meredith Corporation, announced on Sunday that it had agreed to sell the flagship publication of once-mighty Time Inc. to the Benioffs for $190 million in cash.Mr. Benioff becomes the latest tech billionaire to take the reins of an iconic media brand. Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013. Last year, Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, agreed to acquire a majority stake in The Atlantic magazine through her organization, Emerson Collective.Now, with the deal for Time, the Benioffs have picked up one of the most storied \u2014 but struggling \u2014 publications in the country.Since March, Meredith executives, led by Time Inc. alumni, have pounded the pavement looking for the right owner. But in recent years, the economic headwinds facing the magazine industry have become a gale force.Alan Murray, the chief content officer of the Time Inc. brands at Meredith, said that, after dozens of meetings with suitors \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t have enough fingers and toes to count them,\u201d he said \u2014 the Benioffs emerged as the best fit, willing to put journalistic integrity ahead of corporate gains.\u201cThey\u2019re not looking for private-equity returns,\u201d Mr. Murray said, adding that the couple would help the title \u201cfurther make the transition into the digital world, but don\u2019t want to get involved\u201d in editorial decisions.Meredith had fended off offers from multiple suitors, including a more than $325 million offer from David J. Pecker, a confidant of President Trump and chief executive of American Media Inc., publisher of The National Enquirer, to purchase three Time Inc. titles.In a statement, the Des Moines-based Meredith echoed that Time would maintain editorial independence, and made it clear that the deal had nothing to do with Salesforce.\u201cThe Benioffs are purchasing Time personally and the transaction is unrelated to Salesforce.com, where Mr. Benioff is chairman, co-C.E.O. and founder,\u201d Meredith said in its release.Mr. Benioff, 53, whose net worth has been estimated at more than $6 billion by Forbes, confirmed the agreement in a Twitter post on Sunday, saying he and his wife were \u201chonored to be stewards of this iconic brand.\u201d\u201cThe power of Time has always been in its unique storytelling of the people & issues that affect us all & connect us all,\u201d Mr. Benioff wrote. \u201cA treasure trove of our history & culture.\u201dMeredith, which specializes in home and lifestyle magazines like Better Homes & Gardens, had owned Time for less than a year.The magazine\u2019s sale, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, was a long time coming. Meredith announced in March that it was seeking a buyer for Time, as well as other former Time Inc. titles: Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated.Each of those magazines has undergone its own extensive search for the right buyer, with more than 100 parties expressing interest, according to Art Slusark, a Meredith spokesman. He added that the company was close to selling Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated, but declined to elaborate. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very measured and formal process,\u201d he said.Time will continue to be based in New York, Mr. Felsenthal said. And, despite speculation that the print edition could cease to exist, he said Time will continue to be centered on the print magazine, which now has over two million paid subscribers.\u201cThe print product is the foundation that we\u2019re building everything else on,\u201d he said.As an owner, Mr. Benioff stands in stark contrast to the humble, Midwest-based Meredith Corp., which started in 1902 with Successful Farming magazine.An impassioned and eccentric billionaire, even by Silicon Valley standards, Mr. Benioff was drawn to computers at an early age. He interned at Apple as a college student, and became a top salesman at Oracle, the enterprise software company. After burning out at Oracle, he traveled to India, decided to leave the company, and co-founded Salesforce in 1999. Today, Salesforce, a pioneer in the business model of offering software as a service, is worth some $120 billion. The San Francisco company occupies the new Salesforce Tower, the tallest office building west of Mississippi.\u201cWe don\u2019t plan to be operational or involved in editorial,\u201d he wrote in a text message. \u201cWe are only stewards of a historic and iconic brand.\u201dBoth Mr. Felsenthal and Mr. Benioff said Time is profitable. But overall profits at the Time Inc. brands have sagged in recent years. In March, Meredith said that over the next 10 months it planned to lay off 1,000 employees of the former Time Inc. magazines.Meredith agreed to purchase Time Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.8 billion last November, and the deal was made final on Jan. 31. The deal came to fruition with the help of an infusion of $650 million from the private equity arm of Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire brothers known for using their wealth and political connections to advance conservative causes.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long couple of years and a challenging time in media and at Time Inc.,\u201d Mr. Felsenthal said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Apple Unveils Bigger iPhones at Higher Prices, and a Heart-Tracking Watch", "Date": "2018-09-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byApple has long had a playbook for iPhones, its most important product: Keep rolling out bigger, faster and more expensive models.On Wednesday, it repeated that strategy by introducing another round of iPhones that are \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 bigger, faster and more expensive. The model with a 6.5-inch screen, the iPhone XS Max, is Apple\u2019s biggest iPhone ever and will start at $1,100. (And, yes, its name is a mouthful.) Last year when Apple debuted its iPhone X, the starting price was $1,000.More notable, perhaps, was how much Apple is now evolving its smart watch into a clearly health-related device. The company showed off a new Apple Watch with an electronic heart sensor approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That could lead to new implications for health care \u2014 and prove to be a major selling point for a device that has played second fiddle to the iPhone.Apple on Wednesday unveiled the iPhone XS, a premium model with a 5.8-inch screen, and the iPhone XS Max, with a 6.5-inch screen, its biggest-ever smartphone. The company also showed the iPhone XR, an entry-level model with a 6.1-inch screen.The iPhone XR will come in white, black, red, blue and yellow, and is just as fast as the XS models. It has a single-lens camera, unlike the XS models, which have dual-lens camera systems. And it uses LCD, a less expensive screen technology than the OLED used for the XS, and the casing is made of aluminum, unlike the stainless steel that the premium phones are composed of.It\u2019s obvious why Apple and other phone makers like Samsung keep enlarging their phones: Phones with bigger screens are selling well. When presented with the choice between a small phone and a bigger one, most people will go with the latter. That\u2019s similar to how just about everyone wants a big-screen TV.But for mobile phones, there are trade-offs. For one, the larger phones are more difficult to use with one hand. With last year\u2019s 5.8-inch iPhone X, it was difficult to reach your thumb across the screen to type a keystroke or hit a button inside an app.The larger screens raise an important question about design. Will Apple do much in the near future to improve one-handed use?When Apple\u2019s screen sizes started growing with the iPhone 6 in 2014, the company released a software shortcut, called Reachability, through which users can tap the home button twice to lower the top of the screen and make it easier to reach buttons up there. That feature still exists for the new iPhones, but the lack of a home button makes it more difficult to use \u2014 instead of double tapping the home button, now you swipe down from the bottom of the screen.As Apple has made its phones larger and faster, it is also charging more for them. The company said the new iPhones would start at $750, $1,000 and $1,100. The starting prices last year were $700, $800 and $1,000.Unit sales of the iPhone were about flat in the latest quarter compared with a year earlier, but iPhone revenue rose 20 percent, to $29.9 billion. Something else that rose 20 percent? The average selling price of the iPhone.By going bigger, Apple is trying to grow not just by raising prices but also by getting customers to use their devices even more. Research shows people with larger smartphones use them more, particularly to watch movies and play games.That\u2019s good for Apple. A central part of its strategy is to get existing iPhone owners to pay for more services on their phones, like Netflix and HBO. For each subscription bought via its App Store, Apple takes a 30 percent cut for the first year and 15 percent for each subsequent year. That bet seems to be working: Apple\u2019s services revenue rose 31 percent to $9.55 billion in the latest quarter.The iPhone is old enough now that figuring out what to call the new versions each year has become tricky. Last year, on the device\u2019s 10th anniversary, Apple skipped the iPhone 9 and went straight to the iPhone X. (But it pronounced the model \u201cten\u201d and not \u201cX.\u201d)That X has now created an awkward situation for Apple. The company has typically appended an S to the name of the second iteration of each generation of phones, like the iPhone 5S, 6S and so on.But this year, that meant calling it the iPhone XS. Never mind that XS is the abbreviation for extra small \u2014 not an adjective Apple wants for its $1,000 phones \u2014 but say \u201cXS\u201d out loud. In the age of smartphone addiction and devices that cost as much as some refrigerators, \u201ciPhone Excess\u201d may not be great for branding.Instead, the new iPhone XS is pronounced \u201ciPhone 10S,\u201d or as the audience at the Apple event quickly realized, \u201ciPhone Tennis.\u201dAdd the new iPhone XS Max to the mix and you\u2019ve got \u201ciPhone Tennis Match.\u201dApple introduced the Apple Watch Series 4, which it has designed to be more of a health aid.It\u2019s the first redesign of the company\u2019s smart watch since it was introduced in 2015. The new watch is slightly thinner, but the black frame around the screen \u2014 what is known as the bezel \u2014 has been removed to create a larger display area.Apple said that the new watch would be the first over-the-counter ECG device offered to consumers and that it had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (Apple may want to check its claim of being first, as other companies said they had been ahead of it with the agency in this regard.)The device\u2019s new health features are sure to increase Apple\u2019s dominance of the smart watch category \u2014 and they underscore the company\u2019s focus. When the watch was first released, critics and consumers were confused about its utility. Over time, Apple has refined the device to focus on its health and fitness capabilities. Now the narrative is clear: Get this watch, if you want to live.The Apple Watch will be available in several colors and band styles; watchbands from older models will work on the new model. The Watch starts at $399. It will begin shipping on Sept. 21.\u201cThe F.D.A. worked closely with the company as they developed and tested these software products, which may help millions of users identify health concerns more quickly,\u201d Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in a statement.Apple\u2019s formal entrance into medical devices brings heft to the idea of tracking health with consumer wearables. Until now, they were largely limited to the casual counting of steps or watching heart rates climb at the gym. At Wednesday\u2019s event, Apple featured remarks from Dr. Ivor Benjamin, the president of the American Heart Association, who described the ability of wearable devices to measure heart rhythms as \u201cgame-changing, especially when evaluating atrial fibrillation \u2014 an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase a person\u2019s risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.\u201dEven Vic Gundotra, the chief executive of AliveCor, which sells a wearable device with similar heart-testing capabilities, said Apple\u2019s decision to enter the market would make consumers\u2019 use of electrocardiograms take off.The readings may not always be helpful, and doctors are advised not to use electrocardiograms as a screening tool for someone without symptoms, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.\u201cPeople are going to start looking at their watch as if something is wrong,\u201d she said.An earlier version of this article misstated the material that aluminum is replacing in the iPhone XR. It is replacing the stainless steel casing, not glass.Advertisement"}
